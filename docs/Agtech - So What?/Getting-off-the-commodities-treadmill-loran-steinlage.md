**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:13):**  Lauren Steinloggy, may not exactly fit the image that comes to mind.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:17):**  Lauren, who farms in Iowa, has been tinkering with ag machinery for as long as he can remember.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:23):**  So when he started looking more into soil health and practices such as cover cropping  
**[0:00:27-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:27):**  and relay cropping, he started tweaking equipment to make it do the new jobs he needed it to.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:34):**  Now other farmers and even machinery manufacturers are paying attention to his innovations.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:40):**  It's Lauren's understanding of farming, machinery, business, and soil health at an in-depth and  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:45):**  practical level that's helped him to tackle some big farming and tech challenges.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:50):**  Like Lauren has a system that allows him to grow a crop 365 days a year, even under snow.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:56):**  But Lauren became motivated to share his innovations for very personal reasons.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:01):**  After his son, Roland, was diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of 12.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:06):**  Soon as Roland got sick, I realized that chances are the farm could die with me.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:12):**  And I just said, I'm not a selfish person.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:14):**  I'm going to start sharing ideals.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:16):**  And the next thing you know, when you start sharing ideals, more people share ideals with  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:21):**  you and it just snowballs from there.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:25):**  In fact, Lauren has had to overcome multiple life-changing events and adapt as a result.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:31):**  The first one happened when he was just a newborn baby.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:36):**  My dad moved here in 1968 and then I was born a year later.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:41):**  About six weeks after I was born, he was burnt 75% over his body.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:49):**  And the doctors and everybody told him he pretty well never farmed, but he quickly figured  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:54):**  out that his only option to keep farming was to fully automate.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:00):**  And we went from bucket milking to pipeline, fully automated feeding systems and all that.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:07):**  And that trend just kept progressing all the way up and through the 80s.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:15):**  And he was one of the survivors of the 80s.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:17):**  He never really got overextended.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:20):**  So coming out of the farm crisis in the 80s, he was in a position he could start buying  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:25):**  land and stuff like that.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:28):**  He always had the attitude, if it ain't fun, we're not going to do it.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:33):**  Every one of us kids came home to farm.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:35):**  I got a brother and three sisters.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:37):**  Some of them have now moved on from farming since, but he started every one of us farming  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:41):**  at least twice was the joke we always had.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:44):**  You said your dad was focused on making sure it was fun.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:47):**  What's an example?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:48):**  Do you have any kind of early memories of farming being fun?  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:52):**  Oh, just, I don't know.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:56):**  You never made things of hard work.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:58):**  If it was mundane and hard work, we just figured out a better way to do it.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:03):**  And that was kind of instilled in me at an early age.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:05):**  So everything I do anymore is how to become more efficient, how to get by with about as  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:12):**  little help as possible.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:14):**  And I was pretty well focused about 10th grader.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:17):**  We got a 12th grade system here in the States, about 10th grader ready.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:20):**  I was pretty well focused that I was going to go home and farm.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:26):**  Our class had 117 kids in, and I was the only one that was going to go straight home to  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:29):**  farm, but I always told everybody I was going to stay all the way through graduation just  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:35):**  to prove a point that, you know, like bankers and that they'd see, I wasn't afraid to commit.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:39):**  So I always joke that I graduated high school on a social degree.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:43):**  And, you know, my senior year in high school, I never went a full day.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:47):**  As a teenager, Lauren started farming in partnership with his dad Florian, creating Flow Low Farms.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:53):**  And while Lauren's father was his first teacher on how to be innovative in agriculture, Lauren  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:58):**  also had to learn to adapt out of necessity when another one of those life changing moments  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:03):**  arrived.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:04):**  At the age of 14, while in a tractor, he was hit by a truck as it tried to pass him.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:10):**  Now Lauren recovered from his injuries, but due to scar tissue, 10 years later, he found  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:14):**  he just physically could no longer work with animals.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:19):**  And that's when I had to decide, you know, I couldn't be around livestock anymore.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:23):**  So I started focusing on the row crop.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:25):**  I always enjoyed the row crop production and equipment more than the livestock anyways.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:30):**  My forte is I love designing and building equipment, figuring out how to make stuff  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:33):**  work better.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:34):**  That just, when the cows left, I focused hard on custom work, you know, and our peak, I  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:40):**  was probably 2,500 acres between the custom work and our own work.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:45):**  Dad was still pretty heavily involved.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:46):**  My wife was, it was basically the three of us putting the crop in, taking it out every  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:50):**  year.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:51):**  And well, 09 is when Roland got sick and you know, I just, I was pretty hard corn on corn  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:57):**  back in them days.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:58):**  You know, I just, I didn't even think about it.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:00):**  I just called the grain buyer and said, Hey, can we roll my corn contracts into bean contracts?  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:04):**  All the seed dealer rolled all the seed in and farming became easy that year.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:09):**  Our son had a 20% chance of living a year.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:12):**  That's basically what they told us.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:15):**  You know, so we just focused on living in that time.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:18):**  And the more removed I got from the farm, the more a guy learned how to time stuff,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:23):**  get stuff done quick, and then focus on the family.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:27):**  And this day, I never, I never thought I'd walk away from the farm as much as I do, but  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:33):**  I just learned, I become more efficient when you're more focused.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:37):**  Do you, it's such a tough one because you would never wish that I mentioned on anyone  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:43):**  to have such a, you know, a scare like that with, with your son and, and such a challenge.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:48):**  And yet you, you know, some good has come of it.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:50):**  It sounds like in, in, you know, farming differently and thinking about how you manage time differently.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:55):**  It is tough in agriculture.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:56):**  Like I talked to a lot of people who, and I fall prey to it myself, where it's like,  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:59):**  you get so caught up in the day to day that you don't think about working smarter.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:03):**  It ends up being working harder.

**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:07):**  Do you see that?  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:08):**  Oh, definitely.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:09):**  You know, everybody wants to be the best farmer in the world, but I've never met a bad farmer.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:14):**  That's kind of what drove me, you know, as I started meeting people around the world,  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:18):**  everybody's trying to be the best.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:19):**  And I give credit to a friend in Australia.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:21):**  And you know, he was here one time on an upfield scholarship and you really get to know the  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:26):**  guys when you sit there and talk to them.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:28):**  I said, what's, what's your competition like in Australia?  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:31):**  And he's like, listen, every farmer in Australia has got to be the best farmer in the world  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:36):**  because we don't have subsidies and all that to help us survive.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:39):**  And that was probably one of the triggers that started making me realize we need to  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:45):**  be pushing, doing better.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:47):**  You know, one of them instances goes back to when we were doing the stuff with deer,  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:53):**  every year we'd have to go in for training.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:56):**  There was a relatively sizable farmer that was at the meetings every year.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:01):**  And me and him got to be pretty good friends and talk during the meetings.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:04):**  And he made the announcement during the meeting the one day as we're talking, he's like, yeah,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:09):**  we're to the point where people call us and want us to rent their farms.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:13):**  That's like, okay, somebody comes and offers you your farm or their farm, what's the deciding  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:19):**  factor?  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:20):**  And he just put his finger up, $1.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:24):**  I was like dollar an acre, you'll farm it?  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:26):**  He's like, no, if it adds a dollar to the bottom line, the whole operation, he'll add  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:30):**  it.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:31):**  And that was just like, I can't compete with that.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:35):**  You know, so that started going down more to specialty grains and stuff like that.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:40):**  As I said earlier, I love focusing on equipment.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:43):**  So learning how to fine tune equipment, getting the maximum quality during harvest and stuff  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:48):**  like that has been probably one of the biggest booms for us.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:53):**  If we can capture premiums and stuff like that, or one of the favorite things I used  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:57):**  to do is we used to sell a lot of beans direct to Korea, soybeans for edamame and stuff like  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:03):**  that.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:04):**  We used to, or tofu beans, whatever they all were.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:06):**  But now I've had to back away from that because the guy's just getting too busy.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:10):**  I'm hoping the next generation, I'm getting ready to step out of the way and let the next  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:14):**  generation start handling that.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:17):**  So there's a few things that I want to unpack a little bit more, Lauren.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:19):**  So you mentioned the, I guess, kind of decision to go more specialty.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:24):**  And it sounds like there's two things there.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:25):**  One is sort of efficiency and equipment and technologies.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:29):**  And one is also like actually farming different things or thinking about different markets.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:33):**  Tell me more about that.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:34):**  What are some examples?  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:35):**  Well, for me, they go hand in hand.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:37):**  I mean, once you start figuring out the efficiencies, you can also get the quality.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:42):**  Like I said, they go hand in hand and we've got as high as a $3 bushel premium on soybeans  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:48):**  over Chicago.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:49):**  So that would essentially be a strong $4 premium because we're in such a low basis area.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:55):**  So that's when we started, well, through my son's deal, that's when we started forcibly  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:01):**  losing acres.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:03):**  And we had landlords starting to walk away from us and other guys seeing the guy kind  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:07):**  of down.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:08):**  So they were going after our land, but the neat part is they went after our worst land.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:13):**  So we did our best land base and a lot less headaches.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:18):**  But I would say the farm itself for the last five years has probably been more profitable  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:23):**  at 750 acres than we ever were at 2,500 with all the custom work.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:27):**  I've totally dropped custom work and all that, or I guess you guys would call it contract  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:32):**  work, but I've totally dropped all that.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:34):**  I just focus on our acres.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:40):**  So it sounds like focus, a bit of that kind of perspective and time management.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:44):**  What were some of the other keys there?  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:46):**  Was it, you mentioned kind of changing over to beans.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:50):**  What else, what are other examples of things that you did that have led to that profitability?  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:54):**  Well, bringing the technology to full scale.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:57):**  I mean, we had the auto steering and all that, and now everything's pretty much controlled  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:00):**  traffic.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:02):**  Tram lines of that end, we're getting by with very little herbicide.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:05):**  We essentially were becoming a low cost producer.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:08):**  We used the cover crops and all that.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:10):**  About 06 is when we started playing with the cover crops and stuff like that.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:13):**  And that started helping us eliminate tillage and all that stuff.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:18):**  Once we started figuring out we didn't need the tillage to eliminate compaction and all  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:22):**  that stuff.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:24):**  What's key in all of this is that it's Lauren's knowledge of equipment that has enabled him  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:28):**  to become a low cost producer, targeting premiums and reducing costs rather than being stuck  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:33):**  on the commodities treadmill.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:35):**  Without the ability to modify and adapt equipment, he'd be missing the unlock code to alternative  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:40):**  farming practices and entering different farming markets.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:43):**  Lauren has won awards for his innovations, but he's still very modest about what he's  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:48):**  achieved.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:49):**  2012 was the first time I was ever asked to do a public presentation.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:55):**  And when I was in school, they didn't have such a thing as PowerPoint and all that.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:59):**  So I had to have my daughter do my first PowerPoint for me and all that.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:03):**  I walked on stage to a group of 100 engineers.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:08):**  I walked on stage and introduced myself as the unengineer.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:13):**  It's just for what we're doing.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:15):**  Usually traditional equipment doesn't work.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:17):**  So everything we've done, I've had the custom builder modifier back to when Roland got sick.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:25):**  It was to the point we had to have appraisers out to keep him insured.

**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:34):**  And the guy that did the appraisal wrote on there, there's only one way to force or one  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:39):**  way to appraise this line of equipment is to force an auction because none of it has

**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:44):**  I mean, everything that was even close to remotely standard was the tractors probably.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:52):**  And we did everything from the planners to the heads, you name it, were custom built.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:58):**  And you did a lot of that work yourself.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:00):**  Give me an example or two of one that's worked out well.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:05):**  Probably the best one has been the no-till drill we built from the ground up in 2016.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:11):**  That was the 10th drill we had built.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:14):**  That was when we really started getting the companion cropping and the interseeding all  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:18):**  figured out.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:19):**  Well, we figured out once we had that key piece of the equipment, it set us up for the  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:24):**  relay cropping.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:25):**  We could put fertilizer down with it.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:26):**  So we built that accordingly.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:28):**  And that's the one that really sealed the deal that I got the job with going equipment  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:33):**  out of that deal.

**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:36):**  How do you bridge the gap between practical, like what's actually happening on the farm?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:40):**  What are the drivers?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:41):**  What's going to make more money, save more time versus the people who are building the

**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:52):**  What's your experience been with kind of bridging the gap between those two?  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:56):**  That's kind of my position with Dawn is to kind of help the engineers understand what's  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:01):**  actually going on in the field.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:04):**  And I always go back to John Deere when through the years they had a history of hiring young  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:09):**  farm kids and bringing them up through the country.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:11):**  And that's who they ended up as their designers in that.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:13):**  Well, they've kind of went away from that.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:16):**  And about, I don't even remember what year that was, but I had the opportunity to go  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:21):**  to work for Deere and we were at a field day with a bunch of the lead engineers and they're  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:26):**  like, you don't want to come and work for us anymore.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:29):**  Go to a company like Dawn that's more responsive.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:33):**  You can actually have an impact.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:35):**  Joe as he's evolved the whole underground ag line that I've actually working for is  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:40):**  strongly focused on the regen ag side and stuff like that.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:44):**  So it's pretty neat to see all this coming full circle.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:47):**  And now we've got manufacturers starting to look at the way we're doing stuff and I'm  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:52):**  optimistic about the future, I guess, on some of that.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:55):**  Yeah, it's really interesting.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:56):**  I mean, in the world I often live in, we're talking about people with robotics expertise  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:14:01):**  and mechatronic engineers and machine learning programmers.

**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:14:11):**  what's happening on the farm.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:14:12):**  And I know I've been in lots of hilarious conversations where people are talking over  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:14:16):**  each other and I'm one of them, I'm sure, but it's totally different skill sets.

**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:14:31):**  being some people's nemesis.

**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:14:46):**  we first started getting on Google, it seemed it was a lot more, you could get better information  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:14:53):**  now.

**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:19:31):**  Cause you start seeing the progress again.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:19:35):**  One of the things we were talking a little bit about this last week, but is agriculture

**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:19:43):**  your family and what's happening and on a podcast about technology is just an insane  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:19:47):**  thing about agriculture, how it is about families and it is about life.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:19:52):**  And some of that stuff's just not talked about enough.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:19:54):**  You know, we're like, Oh, what decision did you make on paddock seven?

**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:20:01):**  And yeah, it's just, it's such a unique industry in that sense.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:20:05):**  Well, that's, you know, people are shocked when I say I'm ready to walk away from the

**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:20:59):**  I'm not over going to overextend to one bit.

**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:21:13):**  You know, I don't, I don't even really focus on cover crops anymore.

**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:22:06):**  everything set up perfectly, but then late May there we had a frost, May 29th, but we  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:22:12):**  ended up replanting a lot of beans and that's why I'm hoping that didn't screw my plan up.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:22:16):**  But you know, the fluid management is the way I call it.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:22:19):**  You know, we'll have a kind of a destination where we're going, but how we get there, nobody

**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:24:54):**  And we had a lot of hurdles back in June, July.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:24:58):**  And Ross, the young guy that I worked with on the multi-cropping Iowa project, he called

**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:07):**  trout.

**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:11):**  You know, I knew that I knew we've had fish in it ever since growing up and that.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:15):**  But it came out about a week or two before our field day and they started stunning the  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:19):**  trout so they could actually take inventory of what's there.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:22):**  And here we have native trout in our creek about five miles away from where they probably  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:27):**  thought there should be trout.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:29):**  The only way you're going to have trout in a stream like that is you got cool, clear,  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:33):**  good quality water.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:35):**  To me, that's the ultimate sign that what we're doing is working on our farm.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:39):**  Like I said, you know, then part of our field day, we had the DNR out and do it again.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:43):**  And then we had, well, the one night we had a bunch of kids out here, we showed them all  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:48):**  the trout in the stream and all that.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:50):**  If this keeps progressing, you know, they're monitoring our creek now, they're going to  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:54):**  actually stock our creek with another species of native trout to try to help propagate the  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:01):**  trout herd in Northeast Iowa.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:03):**  So I said you can run all the tests you want.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:07):**  But when you start, when you see something like that happen, you know, a couple of days,  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:12):**  one of one of the days of our field day this year, we had the Rodale Institute here.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:16):**  And by two, three days later, I got a letter from the head of Rodale Institute saying,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:22):**  I've been struggling to put a name on the definition on regen agriculture.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:27):**  He's like, but I think when I can stand in your creek and see trout where they're not  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:32):**  supposed to be, that's a pretty good sign.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:34):**  And you know, that's some little things I see in the future, you know, John Q. Public  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:40):**  is paying attention to what we're doing.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:41):**  And that's the stories we've got to start telling.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:44):**  We as farmers got to step forward and tell what we're doing on the farm.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:48):**  And, you know, start showing the positive light, not just letting people grab the negative  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:52):**  light and showcasing that.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:54):**  Yeah, what do you think about that?  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:56):**  Is that a driver for you in terms of talking to the public and telling the stories?  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:00):**  I mean, in one sense, I find that really compelling.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:03):**  Like there are amazing stories and people care about nature and the environmental aspects.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:08):**  In another sense, it's like, that's exhausting.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:10):**  Like you're already farming, you're running that business, having to have that conversation.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:13):**  And then I guess the third one is like, soon we'll have satellite imagery that is just  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:18):**  knowing everything we want to know and the brands or whoever else is going to communicate

**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:22):**  So I don't know, do you see that long term as the role of the farmer?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:27):**  I think we need to become self advocates before we start getting dictated what we're going

**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:34):**  I foresee, you know, everybody's hooked on the carbon credits.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:37):**  But the first thing I tell people is, you know, number one, we better be carbon or I'm  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:44):**  a proponent of the net zero initiative, I guess I'll put it that way.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:47):**  Because what I'm worried is we as farmers are going to step forward and sell all our

**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:55):**  So if United States steps forward and follows the Canadian model, we switch to a carbon

**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:07):**  So I was asked to be on a net zero alliance initiative or whatever they want to call it  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:12):**  for the local community college.

**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:20):**  And you know, if you start really talking to the people in industry, I think your major  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:24):**  players are going to start looking at the net zero alliance.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:26):**  And that's, I believe, and I volunteered our farm to run an audit to find out exactly where  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:33):**  we're at on the net zero initiative.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:35):**  You know, because right now, you know, everybody's touting, oh, we're going carbon neutral.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:40):**  I don't think any of them ever even realized what that's going to take to truly quantify  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:45):**  that.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:46):**  On our personal operation, I want to get to the point where I'm not going to be afraid  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:51):**  to say, hey, do I use a pen or a pencil?  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:54):**  That sounds a little extreme, but I think to truly tell a story, that's where we're  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:58):**  going to need to be.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:59):**  What do you mean?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:01):**  Well, with the whole net zero, I mean, you know, I want to be able to say, hey, you know,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:07):**  we are actually, you know, my goal is to actually prove we're positive.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:11):**  I don't even know where we're going to be yet on that.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:14):**  So that's probably a bold statement, but you know, that's part of the reason I want to  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:17):**  do the relay crop for at least five years, because I think we can set a pretty strong  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:22):**  baseline.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:23):**  You know, probably our biggest carbon burn right now is the nitrogen use on corn.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:26):**  You know, so if I can truly eliminate that, that's going to help us drastically right  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:32):**  there.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:33):**  And, you know, focusing on crops that we don't need the nitrogen and stuff like that, or  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:37):**  through some of our past testing with the clovers and stuff like that in our corn, you  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:42):**  know, we've actually proved that we can produce 80 pounds of nitrogen in a corn on corn situation.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:49):**  Even in a rotated field, we can do that now.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:51):**  You know, I was told this summer that, you know, a little bit of a head of soybeans is  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:56):**  not a good idea, but we've done it.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:58):**  You know, we've maintained a lagoon crop since 2016 till last fall.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:03):**  Last fall, that field was going to be set up for relay again.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:06):**  So I finally felt comfortable taking that field out.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:09):**  But you know, I also know that's one of the fields that we are testing hardest on carbon,  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:14):**  and we can probably blow some pretty good numbers.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:16):**  You know, we're going to have some pretty strong numbers coming off of that field already.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:19):**  So for me, the key is start keeping that living plan in there 24 seven in northeast Iowa.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:26):**  That takes a little thinking because in the what we kind of have a winner.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:31):**  And we freeze up in December and we probably the last couple years we haven't fought till  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:36):**  April.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:38):**  But some of the data I'm reading and hearing shows that even if we have a like a perennial  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:42):**  cover in there, as long as it's green, even under snow cover, it's probably sinking some  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:47):**  carbon.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:48):**  We had one of the major companies here a couple months ago have supper with the COO.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:54):**  And she's like, Lauren, when I go back to the board Monday morning, what do you want  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:57):**  me to tell the board?  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:58):**  I said, why don't you go back and tell them we screwed up?  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:02):**  She looked at me and she's like, what do you mean?  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:04):**  I was like, well, the way I look at it, you guys have spent a lot of money trying to quantify  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:09):**  carbon.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:11):**  I can spend $8 on a water quality sample and prove that we're doing a good job.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:17):**  Now if we solve the water issue, we solve the carbon issue at the same, you know, they  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:20):**  go hand in hand.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:21):**  So if we solve the cycle, we solve the carbon cycle and you know, that's probably getting  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:27):**  way beyond where you wanted to go today.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:29):**  But that's  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:30):**  No, no, it's fascinating.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:31):**  I mean, I think that kind of those kind of indirect indicators, like right now we're  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:36):**  stuck in this world, especially around carbon of like, we've got to go out and measure every  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:40):**  however many meters and dig cores over deep.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:43):**  And it's like, that just doesn't make sense.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:44):**  Right.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:45):**  And it's not going to scale.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:46):**  Like we've got changes to make way faster than we can figure out how to scale digging  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:49):**  cores.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:51):**  It does.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:52):**  From what I've been reading here, and it all comes down to water quality.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:55):**  If you've got water, you've got carbon in the soil.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:59):**  You know, that's, you know, we were fortunate enough back in July here at the field day,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:03):**  Rick, Dr. Rick Haney was here, and he kind of showed us his new test coming.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:10):**  It's going to be fun times.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:11):**  And you know, that that's part of that technology we were talking about the other day.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:15):**  I mean, that's, that's why guys involved in some of this, you know, I know a few people  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:20):**  condemn me for being so pro technology, but the way I look at it, if we can start doing  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:25):**  things with technology that we can't do today, what's wrong with that?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:29):**  Yeah, last fall, we were seeding cover crops in standing corn with robots.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:36):**  We've used the drones for spraying.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:38):**  We've used all my relay rye this year was all maintained with the drone.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:43):**  And we can get cost competitive already with a plane.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:48):**  You know, ground rig is still cheaper.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:50):**  Yes.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:51):**  And when you have solid crop out there, I don't want to sacrifice crop.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:56):**  So the drone fit is the perfect fit.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:58):**  And you know, it just helps us maintain quality.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:03):**  I'm sure we've got some listeners who want your list of what you've been using any companies  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:07):**  you'd recommend or any tools that you've been using that people should check out if they

**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:14):**  Oh, man.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:16):**  We have the robot, ROWBOT was the one we had last fall there seeding.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:22):**  And then this year, we have Sibanto out here.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:25):**  That's another company that they're making autonomous, you know, traditional tractors  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:30):**  autonomous, I guess would be the description there.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:32):**  IZO is the company that we're working with on the drones.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:37):**  Through the whole Ag Launch 365 deal, we've been exposed to quite a few companies that,  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:42):**  you know, global neighbor, I'm gonna say is the one to watch right now.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:46):**  I think they've got some technology that's going to be a game changer.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:51):**  You know, we're supposed to have it on our combine this fall that they they've got the  
**[0:33:55-0:34:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:55):**  weed destructor like you would have in Australia, but instead of a mill there, you're actually  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:02):**  using a light source technology.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:04):**  So it takes a lot less power.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:06):**  It works in a broader range of environments.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:09):**  You know, in Iowa here, we're pretty high humidity compared to Australia.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:13):**  You know, so that was been my biggest concern, like with the Hanraville type deals on the  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:17):**  back of the combine, it creates a lot of heat, you know, the more humidity have, the worse  
**[0:34:22-0:34:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:22):**  it's going to work.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:23):**  But the neat part to that technology is there, they already have a commercial version called  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:28):**  the weed erase that a homeowner can buy.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:32):**  And you use that same light source technology to kill weeds.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:36):**  They're in field test right now they're gonna, they're gonna come out with a field version  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:40):**  that in lab they were killing cereal, foot tall cereal rye at four mile an hour.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:46):**  So if we can start utilizing that technology, and if you really get the chance to talk to  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:53):**  him, he starts describing how beyond killing weeds, they can suppress leads.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:59):**  So they just turn back the dial and say, Hey, we want to suppress like clover for a month  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:03):**  or clover for two months.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:05):**  They just turn the dial back, stun that clover.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:08):**  Boom, you got cover crop that's perennial.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:11):**  And you know, cover crop every year, you can just keep maintaining that, you know, that's,  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:16):**  that's what we've been trying, but I've killed a lot of good cover crop trying to learn.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:21):**  Then the other thing, like in the fall after harvest, you'd be able to use that same technology,  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:27):**  go over your field and it would germinate the weed seeds that are on top.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:31):**  So it's like, all of a sudden you've got a three season tool, that's how you make stuff  
**[0:35:36-0:35:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:36):**  pay.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:37):**  I talked about, you know, once we figured out how to build stuff that you can use more  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:41):**  than one season, you know, one of the, one of the things I've got accused, you know,  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:45):**  they're like, well, for no more acres, new farm, how do you justify the equipment you  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:49):**  have?  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:50):**  Well, we use more than one season a year.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:51):**  You know, you make it so it's adaptable, you simple, you know, like my drill, I just changed  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:57):**  monitor and boom, I can go from fertilizer to seeding to, you know, broadcast or whatever  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:03):**  you want to do.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:04):**  We, we, with minor changes, we can do pretty, you know, that, that tool, well, when I was  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:08):**  at 750 acres, that tool was going over 3000 acres a year and no customer.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:14):**  So you know, it, it, it gets some serious acres on it, even though we don't have the  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:17):**  farm, but you know, I, I've also got to the point where I don't want to farm the world.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:22):**  So, you know, if I can do a better job, what we're doing, that's where I'm at.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:27):**  And, and keeping it fun, it sounds like as well, which, which is increasingly, I mean,  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:31):**  must be super exciting to have your daughters thinking about coming back and taking over  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:35):**  that, that must be, you must be really proud.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:37):**  The biggest challenge there is going to be, you know, the, the son-in-law, they farm very  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:43):**  sizable acres, I guess I'll put it that way.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:46):**  If we can have a little impact, you know, I'm not going to try to tell them guys how  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:49):**  to farm, you know, and I've told them, you know, his parents need to know I'm never going  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:54):**  to condemn how they farm because I respect what they've done.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:58):**  You know, his dad's the same age as I am.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:37:00):**  We were good friends growing up and all that.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:37:03):**  I don't want it ever come off that I'm condemning the way they farm, but you know, I know his  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:37:08):**  mother's paying attention.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:37:09):**  We're doing, cause you know, they, they see the bills and you know, we're, we're farming  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:37:16):**  a fraction of what they're farming and a lot less stress, you know, but if, if we can have  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:37:21):**  an impact and help them understand how we farm and take it to that scale, that could  
**[0:37:27-0:37:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:37:27):**  be, you know, I could set them kids up for a pretty good future.

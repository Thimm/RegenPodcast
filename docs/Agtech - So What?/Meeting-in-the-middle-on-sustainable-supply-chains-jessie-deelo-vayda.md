### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 09 Mar 2022 19:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Icthentic Group.  
**[0:00:05-0:00:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:05):**  I'm Sarah Nollet.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:06):**  At this point, it seems like pretty much every major food company has announced their commitment  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:11):**  to making their supply chains more sustainable.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:14):**  It's not quite as common, I think, to hear the flip side of this story, that farms are  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:18):**  operating sustainably at scale and are looking to build supply chains up to big brands.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:24):**  Today's guest, though, she's hearing from more and more farms who are doing just that.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:28):**  And I love that because once it goes grassroots and it's coming top down and bottom up, the  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:34):**  solutions we're going to find in the middle are going to be fair.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:37):**  And I think they have a better chance of long term success and being able to find that sweet  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:41):**  spot of being big enough to get that scale and that efficiency, but still small enough  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:45):**  to hold on to your mission.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:47):**  That's Jesse Delo, an independent sustainability consultant and chief hub officer at VEDA,  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:52):**  a new venture that's focused on using technology to enable regenerative farming and improve  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:00:57):**  agricultural operations, environmental outcomes and the quality of food produced.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:02):**  Jesse's work has centered around connecting environmentally conscious food businesses  
**[0:01:06-0:01:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:06):**  with innovative farmers.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:07):**  And this work has been informed by an incredibly diverse career.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:11):**  Since her start in Chicago, Jesse has been an organic urban farmer in Denver, an extension  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:16):**  agent in California, a farm founder and manager near Boston, and today a full time consultant.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:22):**  Throughout this work, she's cultivated a love for both working on farms and for the excitement  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:27):**  and challenge of early stage startups.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:30):**  Since the launch of Delo Consulting in 2016, she's been working with industry and nonprofits  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:35):**  to reimagine supply chains, in particular around environmental and sustainability metrics.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:40):**  These two themes have long been the backbone of Jesse's work.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:44):**  And today, she's excited about how central they've become within the whole ag sector.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:49):**  When I entered into agriculture, I was always thinking about how do we do this in a way  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:53):**  that is profitable and sustainable and how do we do it in a way that's good for communities?  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:01:58):**  And whether that's communities of farmers or communities of eaters.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:01):**  And so I also like a challenge.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:03):**  And when I came into this in, you know, 96, organic and sustainable was the fringe.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:08):**  And I like the fringe.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:09):**  And I really appreciate the values in the way that people in this space were connecting  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:13):**  with each other, sharing stories, working through things from the ground up because  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:18):**  the system didn't exist.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:19):**  We were doing organic before there was a certification.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:22):**  And I love that messy space of seeing this big opportunity, breaking it down into parts  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:28):**  and figuring out the space where I can add a lot of value and doing everything I can  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:32):**  there.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:33):**  And it's been fascinating to see the conversation shift from at the time, sustainable agriculture  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:37):**  being really hard and really on the fringe to today where it's baseline.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:42):**  It is going to cost of doing business means you have a sustainability program and you  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:46):**  can tell me how it's operating and what are the potential benefits of that.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:50):**  I wonder even going back to when you were in the Central Valley talking to these farmers  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:02:54):**  about fertilizer use, like what was the kind of sustainability vibe or conversation then?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:00):**  And I don't know if that contrasts with being in the room with those corporates talking  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:03):**  about collective impact.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:04):**  And then now, like in my head, those are three really different rooms to be in.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:07):**  Yeah, I would say 20 years ago talking about sustainability was a bit of a dirty word.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:13):**  You didn't just throw that out carefully.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:15):**  It was like you leave that at the farm gate.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:17):**  Like you come here and talk about what yield, price, access, risk, but it has evolved dramatically.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:25):**  I would say that when the conversation started with the food companies, it was more of the  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:30):**  marketing side.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:31):**  It was the marketing and branding saying, I'm trying to capture the consumer's interest  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:35):**  who is telling me they care about the earth or they care about their health.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:39):**  And so that was the free from era.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:42):**  We don't want pesticides in our food.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:44):**  We don't want sugar and preservatives in our foods.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:47):**  And now we're seeing more and more frequently that a sustainability division isn't just  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:03:55):**  kind of an off to the side, but it's either working cross-functionally or even better  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:00):**  is when it's connected directly to procurement.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:02):**  And that is the part of that I'm really impressed of, you know, the Unilever model, because  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:07):**  they've been doing this for 10 years in a very advanced way, but they kept sustainability  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:13):**  and procurement together.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:15):**  And that relationship is very essential because we can do a lot of work on the sustainability  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:20):**  side, but if the procurement team doesn't understand it, doesn't value it, doesn't know  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:24):**  how to source along those principles, we lose our capability to have meaningful impact on  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:30):**  the landscape.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:31):**  I would even take it a step further, like the incentives for the procurement departments  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:35):**  are often around cost cutting or cost reduction, not hitting any kind of sustainability metrics,  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:40):**  which may in some cases be more expensive.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:43):**  And so you actually have this like counter incentive where they're working against each  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:46):**  other, let alone working together.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:48):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:49):**  That's true.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:50):**  I think procurement is driven by productivity and efficiency.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:52):**  You know, that is their motivation.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:53):**  And I would say that our entire agricultural system has been designed around productivity  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:58):**  and efficiency.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:04:59):**  And now we're in this moment that we're saying, okay, at least we have to include sustainability.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:03):**  So we need a three-legged stool.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:05):**  And then the sustainability division can push forward and say, okay, this is regenerative.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:09):**  This is net zero.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:10):**  This is social justice in sourcing, and we have a lot more work, but that change at procurement  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:15):**  and helping them see why am I sourcing what from where, you know, is still evolving.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:20):**  There's no sustainability team that I am aware of that is telling procurement where to buy  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:24):**  products.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:25):**  And I don't know if we'll ever get to that space, but I do think that the food companies  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:28):**  are doing a better job of kind of living up to their, their public facing commitments  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:34):**  as well as their internal business functions, because they see it that the sustainable brands  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:39):**  grow faster, the brands with purpose grow faster and consumers stick with it.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:43):**  And they resonate it because you've shared with them a story that is very meaningful  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:46):**  about that farmer in California and what they're doing and that they're making practice changes  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:51):**  every day because they are getting demand signals from the consumer.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:56):**  When we looked at some of the drivers for the changes in these food companies, we put  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:05:59):**  it in a couple of buckets.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:00):**  One would be like profit or consumers in the sense of it's getting pulled through the supply  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:04):**  chain, as you were saying, which is definitely true.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:06):**  My sense is it's still in the kind of niche category.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:09):**  Another might be hitting targets, whether it's their CSR targets, or now we've got task  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:14):**  force for climate disclosure and somebody's more commercial, almost access to finance,  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:18):**  social license kind of targets.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:20):**  And then you might have more like political, whether it's a country's net zero commitment  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:24):**  or something like that.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:25):**  What have you seen in terms of the drivers that are pushing change in these organizations?  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:30):**  And is that something that's, that's changing?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:33):**  I think it's often when the leadership starts to care at, you know, at that moment at which  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:40):**  the CEO or the C-suite says, we really need to do a better job.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:44):**  And part of that is that they're getting messages from procurement and supply chain, like that  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:48):**  we're facing a lot more risks.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:49):**  We're having these kind of point of failure moments that are rippling through our system  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:06:55):**  and sustainability agendas, regenerative and net zero commitments are going to mitigate  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:00):**  some of that risk, not right away, but in the long term.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:03):**  I think we are all pivoting and really thinking about, okay, where do we need to be in 2030?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:08):**  Where do we need to be in 2050?  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:10):**  And some of that is just driven by just pure supply chain and climate change and all of  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:15):**  those challenges we see.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:16):**  But a lot of it is being driven by the investors space.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:19):**  Even your biggest food companies in the world are reliant on investors and they're the way  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:25):**  that they want to partner with you to push your agenda forward.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:29):**  You cannot be successful in food right now without an ESG program.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:34):**  And that is really completely different than it was five or 10 years ago.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:38):**  And I think that we were just, for some of us who are so deeply in this, it's shocking  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:42):**  to think about it because it is just so mainstream right now.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:45):**  I was just going to ask what this has been like for you being the one in the room talking  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:50):**  about this stuff that was a bit fringe.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:52):**  And now like you probably, everyone knocking down your door to say, we need this expertise.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:56):**  And you're like, where were you 20 years ago?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:07:58):**  It does feel like sustainability professionals are having their moment that we've arrived  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:01):**  or you've arrived.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:02):**  We've been here the whole time, but we're also learning a lot that the systems are changing.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:06):**  And this is why I think regenerative is just such a different model than what we've ever  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:10):**  seen before.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:11):**  Because now we're saying we want data, we want metrics.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:13):**  We want to hold your hand.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:14):**  We're going to audit through this.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:16):**  We're actually applying a whole different process to sustainability than what we developed  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:20):**  previously was like, let's create a certification for that.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:23):**  And everything that we did in sustainability up until recently was like process-based and  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:28):**  certify it.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:29):**  And that shift towards the food company saying, here's my goal.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:32):**  My supply chain has to hit those targets.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:34):**  It changes the onus on the relationship and it changes the way that we actually go and  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:39):**  have relationships with our suppliers and our farmers.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:43):**  It's so interesting to me that you describe it this way because I totally understand the  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:47):**  certification model and why that's, I would say highly disruptable.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:50):**  Like you're sort of based on practices, but not on outcomes.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:53):**  And there's a million different edge cases, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:08:56):**  When I think of Regen, one of the criticisms has been it's principles-based and it doesn't  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:00):**  have that kind of underlying data or science element, but that's not at all how you're  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:04):**  describing it.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:05):**  So to help me bridge the gap here around why Regen is really different and how it has this  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:10):**  kind of data and metrics element.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:12):**  In my experience in working with, I think, you know, the leading brands in this space.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:17):**  Yes, it's principles-based.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:19):**  That's the outward message.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:20):**  That's the marketing and communication story.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:23):**  When it hits my desk and people say, I want a regenerative dairy supply chain, it is a  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:27):**  very rigorous approach.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:29):**  Say four, maybe five major categories.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:32):**  If you turn to me and say, just develop a regenerative dairy sourcing solution, I'd  
**[0:09:36-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:36):**  say we need KPIs and metrics for carbon, soil, water, biodiversity.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:44):**  And that fifth one could be animal welfare.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:46):**  It could be social justice.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:47):**  It could be a whole bunch of issues.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:49):**  And then from there, we are going through a whole theory of change.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:52):**  Okay.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:53):**  So if you're going to do carbon, how are you going to do it?  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:55):**  How are you going to avoid it?  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:56):**  How are you going to sequester it?  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:09:58):**  What are the data points that I can gather from my suppliers realistically without being  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:03):**  overly burdensome, but having high quality communications and a high quality program  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:08):**  that I feel is accountable and verifiable to all the people I'm assuring consumers and  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:13):**  investors alike.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:16):**  You cannot run a regenerative program without working through that entire process of what  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:21):**  are my targets for carbon?  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:23):**  What am I going to measure?  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:24):**  How am I going to monitor it?  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:26):**  Who am I reporting it to?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:27):**  And how do I verify that this is happening?  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:29):**  So there certainly are going to be actors out there that just throw a label on them.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:33):**  They go grab some products, but if you're running a global supply chain, these are very  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:37):**  rigorous programs reliant on a lot of data and a lot of communication between supplier  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:42):**  and buyer.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:43):**  I think one of the challenges is like we've seen brands come out and make this commitment  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:47):**  and they're going, wait, where do we get non-GMO grain or how do we make regenerative mac and  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:52):**  cheese?  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:53):**  That's not actually easy to do.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:54):**  We need this whole supply chain to come together to make that possible.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:10:56):**  Or do you have any stories of bridging the gap between what a corporate might want to  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:00):**  put on their marketing and what actually needs to happen, boots on the ground?  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:04):**  I mean, I think my time at Pipeline Foods, which is a supply chain company, they remember  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:08):**  being in a conversation with a challenger brand and they said, we're going to talk about  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:13):**  soil health on our box.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:15):**  And I think I laughed out loud and I was like, how?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:18):**  We have tried this.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:19):**  The biggest companies in the world have tried to get consumers to care about soil health.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:23):**  It's not going to work.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:24):**  And they're like, okay, we'll just put the farmer's face back on the box.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:27):**  And it's like, that's not enough either.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:29):**  And so I don't, y'all are the marketing people.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:31):**  You're the experts here.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:32):**  And I feel for them to try and just talk about carbon, like an element in our environment  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:37):**  like that you saw on your chemistry periodic table.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:39):**  I just don't want to be the marketer in that office that day.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:44):**  I think the role of infrastructure is a really interesting one because there were a lot of  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:46):**  assumptions made about the organic space, that the way we were doing things was inefficient  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:51):**  or ineffective, or it just wasn't allowing for kind of the productivity to take off.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:55):**  And that we had all this pent up demand in the marketplace for organic.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:11:58):**  And then we created an infrastructure solution and still we have that pent up demand and  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:03):**  that production is elsewhere.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:05):**  And I don't think that is going to change anytime soon because what organic did when  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:09):**  it grew up was created its own system and its own market.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:13):**  But I do think it's been fascinating to see some of those organic companies have to really  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:17):**  change the way that they're telling their own story and looking for what is the change  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:21):**  that we're making.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:22):**  And they lean in on social justice or farmer livelihood and things like that.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:26):**  But interesting to see the challenge to talk about soil health in some of these systems  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:30):**  because these folks are so science-based.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:32):**  Nobody wants to make a claim that is not legitimate and they truly care about saying what is actually  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:38):**  happening in their supply chain.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:40):**  A lot of Jesse's recent experience in building supply chains has been in the dairy industry,  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:45):**  which she believes will be a, if not the, major driver of regenerative practice adoption.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:51):**  And when it comes to the challenges of building alternative supply chains, often from the  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:55):**  ground up, Jesse says dairy is a leader.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:12:59):**  I can think about like dairy farmers when I started doing dairy sustainability five  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:02):**  years ago, I'd go up and talk to some of the cooperatives and it was arms across the chest  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:07):**  and just shaking their head at me.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:09):**  It's oh, it's you.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:10):**  And I like the hippies have come to tell me how to farm.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:14):**  And it takes years of relationship building to really get people to trust you and help  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:20):**  them see that I'm on your side.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:23):**  I want you to understand where the market is going, where the consumer is going.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:27):**  We are all responding to somebody else.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:29):**  And now the dairy farmers are coming to me and saying, listen, I'm cover cropping.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:34):**  I got 12 months of soil cover.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:36):**  I've got multi-species cover crops.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:38):**  I've put solar panels on my barn.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:41):**  Can you help me build a dedicated supply up to that niche brand?  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:45):**  And I love that because once it goes grassroots and it's coming top down and bottom up, the  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:51):**  solutions we're going to find in the middle are going to be fair.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:54):**  And I think they have a better chance of long-term success and being able to find that sweet  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:13:58):**  spot of being big enough to get that scale and that efficiency, but still small enough  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:02):**  to hold onto your mission.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:04):**  And I think we're going to see more and more farmers start to come together and build up  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:08):**  those networks and go to market with like that.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:11):**  One of the things that strikes me is this kind of jump from like sustainability, do  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:15):**  less bad stuff and kind of market it better and then regen and then moving into net zero  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:19):**  where you actually have this like clear metric that you're aiming for, that's tied to the  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:24):**  kind of global context, global and national targets, et cetera.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:27):**  And it's much more quantitative and focused in some ways.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:30):**  Like you're not actually talking about a bunch of the other aspects of the system.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:33):**  It's truly focused narrowly around carbon and that maybe makes it a bit easier in some  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:38):**  ways to hit on.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:39):**  What have you seen in terms of the rise of net zero and then why dairy in particular  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:43):**  as well suited to be a leader in this space?  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:45):**  I think for better or worse, carbon is a good common metric.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:49):**  It allows us to understand soil health.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:52):**  It provides us indicators for water quality.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:55):**  It helps us see biodiversity improvements.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:14:57):**  Is it an ideal tangible something I can get my head around?  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:00):**  No, but it as a metric that we can use from farm to buyer, it's working.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:06):**  And as food companies put it out there, net zero commitments, it really truly holds our  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:10):**  feet to the fire.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:11):**  Like we have a number, we have a target, we have a 30 or 50% drawdown by 2030 and a hundred  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:16):**  percent by 2039, 2040, 2050, whatever you're working with.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:21):**  Once you do that, you can say to your procurement managers, all right, get after this.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:26):**  And then they can partner with sustainability.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:28):**  And we go into the supply chain and we start working with farms on very specifically the  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:33):**  challenges that we face.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:35):**  And I love dairy because I think it is probably one of the most advanced forms of agriculture  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:40):**  that we have.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:41):**  Highly skilled farmers that are running cropping systems, animal systems, milking parlors,  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:46):**  and infrastructure.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:47):**  They have teams and teams of service providers around them, helping them make decisions daily.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:53):**  And whenever there's creatures, whenever there's livestock involved, it's just a different  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:57):**  feeling in the space.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:15:59):**  Sure, we can think about the very, very large farms that might not have that kind of same  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:04):**  warm fuzzy feeling, but at the end of the day, these livestock farms and their demand  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:09):**  for carbon neutral grains should catalyze a major growth of regenerative cropping.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:16):**  And when those things start to fit together, I think we're going to see major positive  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:21):**  outcomes and co-benefits that we couldn't have even imagined when we launched these  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:25):**  things by saying to that farm, I need you to get to net zero.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:28):**  And for those farms that don't have that, they're going to start asking hard questions  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:32):**  for their grain supplier.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:33):**  I need that carbon footprint when you sell me that grain, I need to know where it came  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:37):**  from.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:38):**  And then once we started asking questions about water and biodiversity, and we have  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:42):**  a system and a structure in place that allows us to say, here's our target, this is where  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:47):**  I get to go, and this is what I have to measure along the way.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:49):**  I think we're going to see all of us adopt a different mindset and adopt systems and  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:54):**  technologies that are going to make it easier.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:16:57):**  I love what you're saying, because it talks so much about the kind of taking responsibility  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:00):**  of your scope one and even two emissions, and then pushing it upstream scope three,  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:04):**  talking about grain suppliers and what are they doing in terms of inputs and sustainability.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:08):**  There's also this kind of methane challenge that seemingly is not yet obvious how we're  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:12):**  going to overcome.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:13):**  Talk a little bit about that as a challenge and what solutions you're maybe seeing.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:17):**  Yeah, I think methane is something we have to live with a little bit.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:20):**  If we want to have animal agriculture, we have to accept that there are manure and cow  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:24):**  burps, and those things can be mitigated.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:26):**  I think we're all very excited about the potential for feed additives and rumen modifiers that  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:30):**  could significantly reduce the amount of methane that a cow emits.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:35):**  And we also can do a lot of work right now with things we have at our fingertips, improved  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:39):**  forage quality, better feeding regimes, just improved animal welfare overall.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:44):**  And then the manure systems, I think this is both the opportunity and the challenge  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:48):**  that we have to face.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:49):**  And the opportunity side is really for the larger farms, where you can get an anaerobic  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:52):**  digester and maybe even additional add-ons to that kind of system, and quickly start  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:17:57):**  generating carbon credits through a compliance market that just really makes the whole revenue  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:02):**  model work.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:03):**  The smaller farms, this is a much more difficult story because you need to have a lot of volume  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:09):**  in order for these systems to work.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:11):**  And even if you're talking about just like covered lagoons, those don't work when it's  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:15):**  really cold to generate enough carbon credits.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:18):**  So I think what we will see is more innovation in the manure space.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:23):**  Right now this is happening naturally, but what else can we do to get some of this organic  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:27):**  fertility off that dairy farm and into cropland, where we know putting organic fertility on  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:33):**  is probably the number one best thing you can do for soil health, whether that's just  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:37):**  improving crop and yield and nutrition, as well as generating a carbon or ecosystem service  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:42):**  credit.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:43):**  So I think we're going to see a massive amount of change in that space.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:47):**  I also, the reason I think dairy catalyzes regenerative is that those dairies, since  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:52):**  they're always going to have some emission factor, are probably going to be looking to  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:56):**  offset their own emissions in their supply chain.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:18:58):**  So if we can imagine like a scope of four, that is the step at which we can see some  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:02):**  major growth in carbon neutral or carbon negative feedstocks.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:06):**  Has that been frustrating at all to hear this like carbon offset ag narrative that's really  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:12):**  arisen in the last 18 months of ag can be this place where we help the rest of the economy  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:17):**  decarbonize when, I don't know from where you said it's ag still has a lot of work to  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:21):**  do itself, but also yes, it does have this potential.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:25):**  What's your experience been with that kind of ag in the spotlight now as this solution  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:28):**  provider?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:29):**  Is that a good thing?  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:31):**  I think overall it's going to be a good thing for us.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:34):**  I think in reality, it's not the answer.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:38):**  And so on one side, I'm really excited when I'm competing with my supplier for carbon  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:42):**  credits because we've all made net zero commitments.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:45):**  Hell yeah.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:46):**  Thank goodness.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:47):**  I would love to have this challenge.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:48):**  Thank you for this challenge.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:49):**  But on the other side of it, if everyone sets their hopes up so high that agriculture is  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:53):**  going to support climate change, I want to turn back to you all and say, have you seen  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:19:57):**  what a balance sheet looks like on a farm right now?  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:00):**  Like it is everybody's problem.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:02):**  And you're looking for solutions from a group of people that this is not their problem.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:08):**  So I do want us to keep challenging us and whether that's revenue streams or carbon markets,  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:13):**  whatever that looks like, we really need to recognize that these are private companies.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:18):**  These are family farms.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:20):**  You're asking them to solve a major governmental and policy issue.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:25):**  And so unless those solutions are coming in side by side, I don't think it's going to  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:30):**  be a fair situation.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:31):**  At the end of the day, if we're all thinking about this and we got more people thinking  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:35):**  about it and working towards it, the innovation is going to happen.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:38):**  And the farms will not act if it is not market sensibility.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:42):**  There's no business model that can justify a carbon neutral farm.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:47):**  It's not going to happen.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:48):**  So it is on all of us to line up the policy, the financial situation, risk mitigation,  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:54):**  and the supply chain opportunities that are going to coalesce in front of that farmer  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:20:59):**  to say, yes, this makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:01):**  And if I want to stay in business, if I want to pass my farm down to the next generation,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:06):**  regenerative ag, carbon smart farming is a solution that is right for me.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:11):**  That's a value proposition we have to see in the supply chain.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:14):**  One of the things you said as well, when we were talking about methane was like part of  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:17):**  it is accepting it if we want to eat livestock based products.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:20):**  And obviously there's a group of people that say we shouldn't or that we need more plant  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:24):**  based solutions.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:25):**  Do you see that as a binary answer or in particular in dairy, one of the things you're excited  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:31):**  about is combining those two worlds.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:33):**  Tell me about that.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:35):**  I'm really excited about the plant based market.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:37):**  I think it's going to drive more choice for the consumer.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:41):**  It's going to get more people thinking about how they're eating, making different choices.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:44):**  I think that is always a good thing.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:46):**  And the food product innovation space is always really exciting to watch.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:49):**  I do see that many of these food companies are excited also about plant based products.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:54):**  And so plant based dairy is I think the biggest growing sector of plant based foods.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:21:59):**  And the graph that I've tried to think about is you've got that growth trajectory, you've  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:03):**  got a good chunk of it will remain in milk from dairy cows.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:07):**  And then that growth is going to be covered by plant based products.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:10):**  I think that where we could help the dairy farm not feel threatened and really start  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:15):**  to embrace and think about the innovation capacity in this space is to look at their  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:20):**  own operation if they are growing their own grains.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:24):**  Because I can imagine that we can figure out and there is a proof of concept with this  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:29):**  from a program at Dairy Farmers of America that was run out of Wisconsin, I think a few  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:32):**  years ago.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:33):**  So I can imagine a situation where you've got a dairy farmer who has multiple forage  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:38):**  crops in rotation, as well as grain crops and corn silage.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:42):**  And can you figure out a rotation that would allow for adding oats or barley or some other  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:48):**  product there that I can cut off that grain and send that into the plant based dairy market,  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:55):**  and then use the stocks and the stems and feed that to my cows.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:22:58):**  And then those cows are returning that manure back to that system.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:01):**  And now I'm reducing my synthetic fertilizers to hopefully nothing.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:05):**  And so now I've got a scenario where on that farm, I am providing feedstock into a plant  
**[0:23:10-0:23:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:10):**  based dairy system.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:12):**  And I'm providing cow milk into a dairy brand.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:18):**  And I've created a kind of circular economy on my farm and within my co-op, possibly,  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:24):**  if we could get some scale around this.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:27):**  And what we end up with are three potential product streams.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:31):**  We have our dairy cow products, we have our plant based products, and then we can create  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:35):**  blended products.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:37):**  So when we find customers that say, hey, I really need to reduce my greenhouse gas factor,  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:41):**  but we are a dairy company, we need to put dairy milk on that shelf.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:46):**  Then we look at blending some of these plant based beverages with dairy milk, that gets  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:51):**  you almost to a carbon neutral milk product.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:54):**  But it looks, tastes, feels like milk, and it truly is still a dairy product.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:23:59):**  And that to me is a place where I think we have now shown the innovation potential to  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:03):**  dairy farms.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:04):**  We've challenged them with a rotation saying you can actually get a lot more value out  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:08):**  of this.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:09):**  And once I start reducing the number of inputs, because I'm integrating livestock into those  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:14):**  ecosystems, and I add the cherry on top of potential ecosystem service market credits,  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:19):**  I think we could create a system that at least at pilot scale could be successful.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:23):**  The challenge is how do we scale that in a way that has really great landscape benefits?  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:28):**  Because it isn't just about carbon, right?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:30):**  We have to work on biodiversity and water especially.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:33):**  And in all of this, we can't forget about our labor force and our workforce development,  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:38):**  which is, obviously, we're all feeling it right now.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:41):**  I love that concept.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:42):**  What do you think the challenges are to scaling it?  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:45):**  Oh, man, I would probably be looking at that price of grain and milk every single day,  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:50):**  all day long, because as soon as something goes in a different direction, because these  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:54):**  are all independent markets and they're just connected and they're at some point maybe  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:24:58):**  a little distorted by the policy or support or thing that we have in place.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:03):**  I think it would be really hard to keep people in a program or keep them at the scale that  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:08):**  we would need.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:09):**  Which contract am I going to break?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:10):**  Is it going to be my oat contract that's bringing me in just a little bit of benefit or is it  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:15):**  going to be the tried and true what my entire system and my insurance is built around, which  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:19):**  is my dairy cow.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:20):**  So, I think we're going to have to be really strategic in figuring out how do we manage  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:24):**  risk and prove out, okay, folks, this is a three-year timeline.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:27):**  Let's get on board.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:29):**  Don't freak out at year two.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:30):**  We need to get another year through.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:32):**  So, I think we have a lot of work ahead of us, but I am super confident that dairy farmers,  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:37):**  they pivot fast.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:38):**  I think we have this idea of them that they're slow and they're curmudgeon.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:41):**  No way.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:42):**  These are advanced managers who are paying attention to what the market is doing and  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:46):**  they're involved in this space.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:47):**  And these are big systems, so they're not going to disappear overnight.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:50):**  The R word, the risk word has come up a few times here and whether it's embedded insurance  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:55):**  or different types of incentives with your downstream partners, what else are you seeing  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:25:59):**  in that space in terms of kind of novel or interesting or even emerging that don't exist  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:04):**  yet ways to manage risk that you think have potential?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:08):**  We can work on risk in a number of ways in our supply chain through contracts, long-term  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:13):**  contracts and in some other products like that.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:15):**  I don't see that farmers really like long-term contracts.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:19):**  They'd much rather play the market and have a lot of flexibility and control.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:22):**  I'm sure that you can find an example from every part of the supply chain.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:25):**  They would say the opposite, but I do believe that the place that we need to manage risk  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:29):**  the most and where I think there's working done today is around how do we look at climate  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:35):**  risk?  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:36):**  Can we look at extreme weather events?  
**[0:26:40-0:26:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:40):**  Can we demonstrate that regenerative ag leads to more resilient soils, better water infiltration  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:48):**  so that when those extreme weather events come through, my farm can recover faster.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:52):**  Can we create a kind of climate risk factor on that piece of land that goes into the way  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:26:59):**  that we appraise and value land?  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:02):**  So rather than all of us just paying attention to yield and profit, can we also think about  
**[0:27:08-0:27:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:08):**  our climate risk in that overall valuation of that land and that portfolio of farmland?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:16):**  I think we're going to move towards that space because the operating loan providers, those  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:20):**  banks, they're looking at their assets and realizing yield potential is not going to  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:27):**  do it for us for very long.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:28):**  We really need to grow revenue.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:30):**  We need to make sure we've got resilient farms that will continue to yield under any situation  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:35):**  and how do we make sure that those farms are whole?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:38):**  And we also need to look at which farms are doing the best work because those are going  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:41):**  to be our lowest risk operators, but we do need some really progressive innovation tools  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:47):**  that we can pilot and connect them into what agriculture is really based on in this system  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:53):**  of crop insurance and risk management and commodity grain.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:27:56):**  How do you see that kind of extension and information diffusion happening?  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:01):**  Is it private sector?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:02):**  Is it within specific value chains where like a corporate is rolling out a program for their  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:06):**  supply shed?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:07):**  Is it more traditional kind of university or public sector extension?  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:11):**  How do you see those information networks evolving as well?  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:14):**  I think these solutions are going to come from new actors in the space that are really  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:18):**  trying to work within this system.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:20):**  And that's why I'm really excited to join VEDA because we are one of those new companies.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:25):**  We're going to come in and operate farms.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:28):**  We're going to develop that impact agronomy and that regenerative farm cropping system  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:34):**  plan.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:35):**  We're going to help sort out all of that ag technology and create like what's that best  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:41):**  in class set of sensors and satellite imagery and telemetry that helps that farmer digest  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:47):**  all that data so that they can be making good decisions.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:50):**  And all of that starts to get built into a risk profile.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:28:54):**  And so if we can start to de-risk that transition for every farmer out there, then I think we  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:00):**  can say, all right, now we've got a quantity of marketable grain or farm product that has  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:06):**  this attribute and that attribute can be assigned a value.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:10):**  And once we start getting into contract growing situations where you're paying both for that  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:15):**  grain and that attribute, how that product was produced, we're starting to value that  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:20):**  farmer for their work and that goes right into that yield and revenue calculation.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:27):**  That farmer gets to go back to their bank with next year and say, I hit my yield goals.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:32):**  My profitability was better.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:33):**  My risk is lower.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:35):**  Help me find more land and help me get a better operating loan and help me invest in XYZ so  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:40):**  I can keep doing the system and making it even better.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:44):**  And what is a chief hub officer?  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:47):**  And what will you be doing at VEDA?  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:51):**  I love this title.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:52):**  I think it's, I think hubs are a word that kind of has come and gone over the last few  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:56):**  years.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:29:57):**  I think that hubs are naturally the way farm systems operate.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:01):**  You could say that every elevator is a potential hub because from that elevator, that point,  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:07):**  I've got a network of farms that I'm originating grain from, for example.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:12):**  And so my role as the chief hub officer at VEDA is to pull together all of the work of  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:17):**  my colleagues and put it on the ground and make it happen.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:22):**  So we've got farm operations, we've got an ag tech team, we have an impact agronomy team,  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:29):**  and I'm pulling all of that stuff and landing it around our farm in Clarksdale, Mississippi  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:34):**  and establishing a service region.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:36):**  So our farm is a demonstration farm.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:38):**  We're going to do all the testing for you.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:41):**  Come and see how it works for us.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:42):**  And we hope after a few years we can open our books and show you the financial reality  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:46):**  of making this shift.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:49):**  At the same time that we're learning in this space and farming within the community, we're  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:54):**  going to develop relationships with the partner farmers around us.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:30:57):**  So how can we bring our technology, how can we bring our consulting services, how can  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:01):**  we bring our market access options to the farms and start to generate regenerative products  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:08):**  that can hit the supply chain?  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:09):**  Because we certainly have seen these farm groups come up on their own.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:12):**  Meadowlark Organics, the Artisan Grain Collaborative.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:15):**  I can provide countless examples of farm groups that are doing this.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:19):**  How do we help those folks scale, accelerate, engage, and tell their story as well as start  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:26):**  to create massive scalable change on the landscape and get those buyers what they need?  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:32):**  So what I bring as the hub officer is many relationships with food companies and being  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:37):**  able to understand what they're looking for and what the spec is on that grain.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:41):**  So we're a new company, we're only a year old and I've only been there for a few months,  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:45):**  but we have potential off-take agreements right now that those buyers are willing to  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:50):**  take the risk and work with a new company because we have to.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:55):**  There's not like an existing company out there that's already doing this.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:31:58):**  I was going to ask about, do you miss being back at the, we started the conversation around  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:03):**  actually farming and like that kind of boots on the ground, but it sounds like you're actually  
**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:06):**  still doing quite a lot of that.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:08):**  So I don't know, maybe that's not a trade off, but is there a world where you wish you  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:11):**  were full-time farming in some sense?  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:14):**  No, I saw April 23rd.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:16):**  Absolutely not.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:17):**  Every April 23rd, because that was our like cutoff date.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:20):**  We don't get this ground opened up in our first crops and our CSA members are not going  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:23):**  to be happy.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:24):**  So on April 23rd, I'm always like, so glad I'm not farming anymore, but I miss it like  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:29):**  hell.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:30):**  There's just nothing like that lifestyle.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:31):**  I don't think my love for farming will ever go away, but I know I can be way more successful  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:38):**  working with other farmers and that I can bring my experience, my value, my background,  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:42):**  my connections to do a lot more scalable change.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:45):**  Jesse's journey isn't over yet, but looking back at her career so far, there's a lot to  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:50):**  learn.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:51):**  First, for companies that source commodities in their supply chain, improving sustainability  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:32:55):**  metrics is no longer a nice to have or just a marketing play.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:00):**  It's a cost of doing business driven by both leadership and investors and the organizations  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:05):**  that are finding the most success in this space are those who are able to most closely  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:09):**  tie their sustainability teams and goals directly into their procurement work.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:14):**  Second, when it comes to companies supporting regenerative agriculture and net zero, the  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:19):**  principles might be paramount, but to execute people need metrics.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:23):**  Jesse says carbon may be imperfect in terms of quantifying environmental health, but it's  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:28):**  the best indicator we have.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:29):**  It's something companies can and are targeting.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:32):**  Finally, Jesse described a number of ways that the industry and even individual companies  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:38):**  can do innovative work to get ahead of the curve from lowering the carbon footprint of  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:42):**  milk by blending it with plant based alternatives to progressive farmers putting in the work  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:46):**  to meet premium supply chains halfway.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:49):**  And Jesse's own work with Veda, bringing the two ends of the supply chain together by aiming  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:53):**  to illustrate the ROI on tech and sustainability.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:33:57):**  Jesse sees a ton of opportunity to grow financially while minimizing environmental impact.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:34:02):**  So that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:34:05):**  Thanks to our guest Jesse Delo, Chief Hub Officer at Veda.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=967349#t=0:34:09):**  And of course, thank you for listening.

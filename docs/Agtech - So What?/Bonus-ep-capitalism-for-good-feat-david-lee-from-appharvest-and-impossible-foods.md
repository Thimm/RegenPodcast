### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 20:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to AgTech So What brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:07):**  I'm Kirsten Diprose bringing you some bonus content.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:11):**  You've probably heard of the Impossible Burger.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:13):**  Well, we're about to hear from David Lee, who was the company's CFO and COO for more  
**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:19):**  than five years.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:20):**  This was in the company's startup phase, back even before it had a burger.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:26):**  He's speaking with Sarah Nollet at the recent Future Food Asia conference.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:30):**  I happen to think that capitalism and consumerism are powerful, powerful levers that are required  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:39):**  to make social change.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:41):**  And that's really the theme of David and Sarah's fireside chat.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:45):**  David's now the president of AppHarvest, a rapidly growing company which uses high-tech  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:50):**  greenhouses to grow fruit and vegetables with significantly less water than field agriculture.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:00:56):**  In this conversation, Sarah and David cover impact investing in food and AgTech from VCs  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:02):**  to SPACs.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:03):**  And if you haven't heard of a SPAC, it stands for Special Purpose Acquisition Company, which  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:09):**  is basically a company that doesn't really sell or produce anything, but it's used to  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:13):**  raise capital to then buy a private company and take it public.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:18):**  In fact, AppHarvest went public and raised $435 million through a SPAC earlier this year.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:25):**  Anyway, I'll leave you now with Sarah at the Future Food Asia conference by ID Capital.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:31):**  David, I thought we might start with a little bit of your background.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:35):**  You started out in a graduate job at McKinsey or sorry, in the finance and kind of consulting  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:41):**  world and ended up in food and Ag.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:44):**  Like where did you grow up?  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:45):**  Did you ever think you'd end up in food?  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:47):**  Did you always want to be in tech?  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:48):**  Where did this all start?  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:50):**  Well that's a great question.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:51):**  You know, I somehow wandered my way into doing a large number of corporate turnarounds.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:01:57):**  So I found myself earlier in my career thinking that, you know, if only there was a mandate  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:02):**  for change and being a little bit impatient with the norm of Fortune 100 business, I tended  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:08):**  to be attracted to companies whose boards had already decided that it was time to bet  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:15):**  big on something radically different.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:17):**  So my first turnaround was a large utility company here in the San Francisco Bay area  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:23):**  in the US called PG&E corporation, who was my only limited partner investor in a $300  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:28):**  million renewable energy fund.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:31):**  And from then I just got a bit hooked on the idea that when there's a mandate for change  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:37):**  that you can have more impact.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:40):**  And so between PG&E and Del Monte and turning around a large retailer called Best Buy here,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:45):**  Zynga, the social mobile gaming company, and then my first startup, Impossible Foods, I  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:50):**  tend to gravitate towards either the really large companies that are absolutely in need  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:02:56):**  of a desperate change or the really, really small companies who are trying to create a  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:00):**  new future.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:01):**  We'll see how long I can keep it up, but I tend to want to be part of things that are  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:05):**  in the middle of a transformation.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:07):**  You know, I happen to think that capitalism and consumerism are powerful, powerful levers  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:15):**  that are required to make social change.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:17):**  That if you can make investors rich and you can make the mass consumer really happy, that  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:25):**  if you happen to be selling a product with better technology that changes the world for  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:29):**  the better, that's the fastest path to creating change.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:34):**  And so that's been a big surprise, a welcome surprise for me.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:38):**  Take me back to that time.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:39):**  You were working largely in large companies, as you said, and it wasn't a time where veggie  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:44):**  burgers or alternative protein or any of this stuff was really on anyone's mind.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:49):**  Was there a moment or how did you learn about the impossible idea and what made you decide  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:54):**  to go to a, not only a small company, but an idea that wasn't nearly as popular as it  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:58):**  is now?  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:03:59):**  Well, I'd like to tell you, you know, there was a Eureka single moment, but truth is I  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:05):**  began looking for something to transform food.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:08):**  But frankly I hadn't found it.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:11):**  And I had been looking, you know, for probably something like 10 or 15 years before I stumbled  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:17):**  upon Pat Brown, the founder and CEO of Impossible Foods, where I found a technology that wasn't  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:23):**  just grinding up a bunch of interesting ingredients and pretending that it tasted great, which  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:29):**  we all have been disappointed by if we're meat eaters like myself.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:33):**  And I saw a potential way to raise capital, create a consumer movement around a product  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:38):**  that was just better, you know, really better because of new technology.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:42):**  And then once I saw that, I think at Parviz, where I am now as its president for the last  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:48):**  four or five months, I like to think that there are many now great opportunities where  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:54):**  you can leverage, in our case, even the public equity markets to do well by doing better.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:04:59):**  But I got to tell you, you know, back in the early 2000s, it was hard going.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:03):**  My wife, my family, when I told them I was going to leave corporate life for a startup,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:09):**  you know, at the time billed as the vegan bleeding burger company, I think everyone  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:13):**  thought I was crazy, but the good news is that there are plenty of great opportunities  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:18):**  for leaders who are looking to make a change.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:21):**  Is there anything else you looked at that time that looking back was also a good idea  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:24):**  or maybe a bad idea that you passed on?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:26):**  You said you spent 10 or 15 years.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:28):**  Good question, Sarah.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:30):**  You're, you're well, I would, I would say this.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:32):**  I think I was a well-informed, you know, many, as many investors or corporate operators look  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:39):**  at all these great opportunities, either for partnership or investment or some other form  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:43):**  of Alliance, you know, I was looking to bet not my capital, but my personal time.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:49):**  And because of the oddity of having started in marketing, but then a public company, CFO  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:54):**  and tech and spend time running a big food business.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:05:56):**  I probably looked at many other companies, some of whom are represented in the audience  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:02):**  today.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:03):**  The reason why I picked impossible is very early in my career, you know, when I was 21  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:09):**  years old, you know, struggling in a full-time job that paid me, you know, less than 20 K  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:14):**  per year, us, I was trained to look at does the consumer proposition make sense, even  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:21):**  if the consumer proposition didn't make financial sense.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:24):**  So I tend to look at things from a consumer lens first.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:27):**  And then if I think it's a winner, ask myself if there's a way to make it work from a business  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:32):**  standpoint and frankly, almost all the companies I'd seen up until impossible foods didn't  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:37):**  pass those tests.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:39):**  And so I'm grateful that I took a risk and got lucky with a great team.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:06:44):**  One of the reasons many people talk about capitalism as a force for good is because

**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:07:26):**  business at a large company was failing.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:07:29):**  You know, creating within the confines of the big corporate, almost a gorilla entrepreneur,

**[0:07:52-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:07:52):**  with a grand mission, I felt empowered to somehow avoid the cynicism of burned investors

**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:08:29):**  But when you start at a startup and you're the first or one of the first senior business

**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:08:44):**  in the middle of coach class, selling a customer, selling an investor, creating a supply chain,  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:08:51):**  you know, for a while it's on your shoulders.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:08:54):**  And that, you know, when you approach being an entrepreneur later in your, in your career,  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:08:59):**  I think I was, you know, in my late or mid for forties.

**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:08):**  would my wife and my kids enable me to do so much personally that I'd relied on teams  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:13):**  to do in my former career.

**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:19):**  Awesome.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:20):**  And it sounds like you've done the right amount of reflecting to embrace those lessons and  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:23):**  think about how they can apply.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:25):**  Were there things about the tech world you've been in both with Best Buy and with Zynga  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:30):**  that applied right away, sort of, Oh, we've learned this lesson or otherwise things that  
**[0:09:34-0:09:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:34):**  didn't apply.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:35):**  Cause I think food and ag tends to say, Oh, well, we're different.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:37):**  You know, people have to eat this or we've got to plant it and grow it.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:40):**  And so it's really not the same.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:42):**  Any reflections in that area?  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:44):**  Well, I think food is different.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:46):**  I mean, to be clear, like when we speak at large conferences, right?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:49):**  When I ask who here is a vegan, you know, hands raise triumphantly and quickly.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:09:56):**  And when I say who here like me, you know, loves and craves meat, hands kind of go like  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:02):**  this a little bit.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:03):**  And some of them are the same hands that describe themselves as plant-based and it's because  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:09):**  food is visceral.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:11):**  It's emotional.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:12):**  It's cultural.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:13):**  We define who we are, where we've been, who our families are, what we believe in by what  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:18):**  we choose to eat.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:19):**  And that emotional visceral notion of choice in consumption is different than a widget  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:27):**  in any other sector.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:29):**  I think it's also different because what we choose to eat, we choose multiple times a  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:34):**  day.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:35):**  You know, in case of me, I define my breakfast, lunch, and dinner by meat.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:38):**  Like it's such an everyday part of our lives, food that we tend to be in denial that what  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:46):**  we choose to eat every day as part of our cultural identity has a massive impact on  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:52):**  the wellbeing of others.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:54):**  And so those things are different.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:56):**  Here's what I would say is not different.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:10:58):**  There is a customer cost of acquisition.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:00):**  You know, like my days in mobile gaming, there's a CAC, a customer acquisition cost.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:05):**  Even if your customer acquisition cost is high, your LTV, your lifetime value is extremely

**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:17):**  You know, the oddity of those who are in food for decades is they don't think about that  
**[0:11:22-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:22):**  CAC LTV consumer tech adoption circle because tech has been late in coming to the consumer  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:31):**  proposition of making better food.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:33):**  In fact, we Royal against it.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:35):**  Technology, food.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:37):**  Please don't blaspheme my craveable piece of fill in the blank food with the idea that  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:43):**  it was created in the hands of a scientist or a technologist when the truth of the matter  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:49):**  is technology has been part of food forever.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:11:52):**  We just never thought about technology to fundamentally remake food in a completely

**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:12:24):**  And one that impossible foods in particular is often brought up around this kind of narrative  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:12:29):**  of industrialized animal agriculture or tech focused food.

**[0:12:39-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:12:39):**  I'm curious your views on the strategy behind being so kind of different in that messaging  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:12:47):**  versus maybe trying to align with more natural, or we can work with the livestock industry

**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:13:40):**  and the whole space was kicking off and venture capital was fueling in.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:13:44):**  It feels different to me now though, than it did even only that kind of seven, eight  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:13:48):**  years ago.

**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:13:50):**  How would you characterize some of the changes that we've seen over the last, you know, 10  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:13:56):**  plus years, and then there's a couple I want to dig in on like SPACs and sustainability.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:14:01):**  Well there's no question that being in food and being in technology is suddenly fashionable.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:14:06):**  Aside from the billions of dollars of capital, we could articulate it in a more compelling

**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:14:20):**  We would have these zero parties and we'd go around, what do you do?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:14:23):**  Well, I work at really cool tech company, XYZ.

**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:14:35):**  And you know, the conversation would stop.

**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:14:44):**  I in the end am grateful that we're fashionable.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:14:48):**  The problem is so important for us to solve.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:14:52):**  I'm happy that we will fund failures because we will fund a few successes and, and I'm  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:14:58):**  excited to see more and more momentum in the space.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:02):**  Those of us in the investing community have been asked many times by our investors and  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:06):**  others, you know, where the exits coming from, where the returns.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:09):**  And so SPACs coming on the scene has been on everyone's mind recently.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:14):**  And obviously this is something you've been part of how, tell me about the decision to  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:18):**  go down this back route.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:19):**  And do you think that it's consistent with what you've said before around capitalism  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:23):**  for good?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:24):**  Well, you know, I am the president and member of the board at Up Harvest.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:30):**  To be clear, I'm also on the board and the audit committee chair of a company called  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:33):**  Benson Hill, which was recently announced to be going public through a SPAC.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:37):**  Much like how I defend science in food, which unfortunately I've had to defend many a time  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:43):**  in the last five or six years.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:45):**  So too, do I defend SPACs.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:47):**  SPACs are just one mechanism to raise capital and be operating as public.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:52):**  You know, on the other side of the SPAC, it's no different as if you had done an IPO or  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:56):**  a direct listing, you still have to operate as a public company.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:15:59):**  And to me, it's not a new phenomenon.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:01):**  I remember SPACs back in the day when I took Del Monte private.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:06):**  I think what's new is that in the world in which we live, there's a large number of new  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:12):**  SPACs that have been raised that are hunting for a target in less than two years.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:17):**  It's not that different than when venture capital and growth equity had reached such  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:22):**  a status that there were plenty of future IPOs.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:26):**  It's just the mechanism is different.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:27):**  So to me, if you view a SPAC as no different than another important mechanism to fund your  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:33):**  future mission and growth, with the kind of with the warning, the caveat that it is not  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:39):**  a private round.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:41):**  On the other side of it, you have to be able to live as a successful public company.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:46):**  I think it's, it's a valid, it's a very interesting way to take a company public.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:51):**  The reality is on the other side of it, however, don't change.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:54):**  You still have to have all the rigor of being a public company, whether you SPAC or you  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:16:59):**  do an IPO.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:00):**  And I think that's the concern maybe that some have, especially in food and agriculture,  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:05):**  but also for a company that maybe isn't ready to do that, or can be, you know, has to make  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:10):**  that big jump from I've been operating in a venture funded context to now I've got reporting  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:15):**  cycles and I've got to keep the drip feed of good news and these things coming out.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:20):**  How are you seeing that shift from a cultural standpoint in these companies and from an  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:25):**  investor standpoint, in terms of understanding food and agriculture and impact and kind of  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:30):**  following that narrative in this kind of new, but exciting space?  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:35):**  Well I think my philosophy personally, you know, from my days at really large public  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:40):**  companies that hadn't arrived at being publicly risk-backed or my days today.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:45):**  My philosophy is still the same.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:46):**  You have to be transparent, fact-based and operate clearly as a public company.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:51):**  You have to provide quarterly insight into how you did and where you're going.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:17:56):**  I think that the difference is for me, I've always had the ability to be part of large  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:03):**  or small public companies that are mid to long-term focus with investors who are not  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:08):**  in it for, you know, like the dividend that happens next quarter, they're in it for the  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:12):**  100x growth promised in the next 10 years.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:16):**  But I think training the investor to understand what you are, that you know, you are not,  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:21):**  you know, in the case of Appharvas, we are not in the business of optimizing incrementally.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:25):**  We're in the business of creating things new, which has risk.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:28):**  I think that transparency is different than when I was operating at Impossible Foods and  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:34):**  I was asked, you know, every quarter by journalists, when are you going public and how are you  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:38):**  going?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:39):**  And now I tell the world every quarter at Appharvas how we're doing.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:43):**  So that transparency is different, but the operating headset isn't different at all.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:48):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:50):**  We're sitting at Future Food Asia, obviously, and I want to hear your thoughts on the Asian  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:54):**  opportunity.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:55):**  It's one that gets talked about frequently in terms of modernizing, you know, middle  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:18:59):**  class and feeding the growing population and changing consumer demands.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:03):**  Are those the kinds of opportunities you're seeing or how are you looking at Asia?  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:07):**  I think Asia is incredibly important for anyone interested in a global food business.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:13):**  You know, Asia arguably is at least, if not greater than 40% of, for example, the meat  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:18):**  market in case of the business I was in at Impossible Foods.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:22):**  But more importantly, Asia sets both business and consumer trends.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:27):**  You know, we launched in Singapore and Asia for a reason.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:31):**  We have seen the benefit of Singapore announcing its 30 by 30 initiative.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:36):**  And it's not just Asia, by the way, Asia and the Middle East, both are great leaders in  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:41):**  thought leadership and technology and food in part because they need to, you know, food  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:46):**  security used to be an idea.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:49):**  And now it's a pragmatic requirement within decades of line of sight and great companies  
**[0:19:54-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:19:54):**  and great countries in Asia are quick to recognize it, arguably faster than many other global  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:02):**  operations elsewhere.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:04):**  So for me, it's not only one of the largest components of a global market, it's the thought  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:08):**  leading part of the market.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:10):**  This is definitely the conversation we're having in Australia.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:13):**  So we're an Australian agri-tech VC firm, and we very much believe that agri-tech can  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:18):**  not only help Australian producers produce more food and fiber and grow our agricultural  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:24):**  production economy, but also that we can export these technologies.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:27):**  And I think that goes to app harvest and yes, you can grow more tomatoes and you can create  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:31):**  jobs in Appalachia, but you can also potentially export this technology to help start new farming  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:37):**  systems or help other countries produce their food.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:39):**  And so they're sort of separate, but complimentary opportunities, one for food and fiber and  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:43):**  one for technology.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:45):**  Is that how you see it?  
**[0:20:46-0:20:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:46):**  I mean, listen, I, we picked the tomato because our 2.8 million square foot first facility  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:54):**  are, you know, our 50 acre to continue to use Western terms, but this very large first  
**[0:20:59-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:20:59):**  farm of 12 in the region needed to produce crop that is not ubiquitous, but certainly  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:07):**  is common for the mass consumer.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:10):**  I think over time, you'll see global leaders like app harvest and pioneer with your region  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:18):**  and with Asia, because as you know, for example, Australia, New Zealand are massive exporters  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:25):**  of meat to Asia already.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:27):**  And so there is already a global ecosystem residents serving Asia and within Asia nascent.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:33):**  And I think we're both very attractive for us as we seek to become larger and global.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:38):**  Hmm.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:39):**  Yeah, definitely no shortage of opportunities.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:41):**  The topic here is, is Agri-Tech 2.0.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:43):**  And so I wanted to come back to that question here as we wrap up our chat, David, what's  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:48):**  something that you're excited about in terms of this maybe 2.0 version of Agri-Tech and  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:53):**  what are challenges you see?  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:54):**  Are there new hills that we're going to have to climb that we haven't had to thus far?  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:21:59):**  Well, I'm glad to hear it's 2.0.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:03):**  You know, back five years ago, what was it like non-existent, right?  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:07):**  You know, food tech was a very small endeavor and it certainly wasn't in its second generation.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:14):**  I think that the hardest question that we will have to as business leaders, as part  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:19):**  of the ecosystem have to get over is how do we acknowledge that technology has always  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:25):**  been part of food and needs to be a bigger part of it.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:28):**  The magnitude of the problems, I mean, again, to be pragmatic, we simply can't make enough  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:34):**  food.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:35):**  You know, whether you are a meat eater or even if you are not, if you just want to create  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:39):**  more fruits and vegetables for the globe, we simply don't have enough resources to do  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:44):**  so, which requires new technology.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:48):**  And you know, instead of debating whether GMO is a curse word or a curse set of words  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:22:54):**  or rather the future, we should be open eyes about every technology because the magnitude  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:01):**  of the problem we face is enormous.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:03):**  We should instead get over ourselves and start thinking about how do we actually pragmatically  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:09):**  address the magnitude of the problem.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:12):**  That requires the Davids and the Goliaths to break breath for the incumbents and the  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:19):**  upstarts to recognize that we all have to solve the problem.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:22):**  That's the 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, I think mode of success here versus the us versus them, which  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:30):**  is one, not frankly very valuable from an investor standpoint and two, simply not productive  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:37):**  given the global issue we face.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:40):**  It's interesting the framing there.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:42):**  I would say the GMO narrative thus far, one of the challenges has been, well, the science  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:47):**  is sound and so just listen to us.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:49):**  We're the scientists and that kind of hasn't panned out in terms of reactions.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:53):**  And if you look at the regulatory landscape in places like the EU, we're getting still  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:56):**  pushed back to that.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:23:58):**  Is there a new narrative that we need to have?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:00):**  And maybe that's what you're alluding to around.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:03):**  Is it listening more or is it really just this, the problems are big, let's get on with  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:06):**  it.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:07):**  I would like to ask you a little bit about that to maybe push you that that still doesn't  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:10):**  acknowledge the concerns, whether valid or not of the other side.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:13):**  And do we run the same risk of not having listened enough to the people we're talking  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:16):**  to?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:17):**  No matter how valid the science is.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:18):**  Well, I happen to of course have strong views on everything, but this, we cannot wait for  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:23):**  regulators to push down.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:26):**  We would wait for Godot.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:28):**  I mean, the truth is on our side, right?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:31):**  For every diabetic who uses insulin, guess what?  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:35):**  Their insulin is made through genetic modification for, for most of the cheese that's consumed  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:40):**  in the U S for much of the cheese that's actually consumed in the E which I'm sure results in  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:46):**  me getting a bunch of tweets or texts later, but it is actually true.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:49):**  It's made through genetic modification.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:51):**  So while the truth is on our side, the truth takes too long to convince consumers.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:24:57):**  And I don't believe the regulator will catch up fast enough.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:01):**  The consumer, however, don't underestimate the consumer.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:05):**  Everyone said the impossible burger will appeal only to the bi-coastal elite in the U S and  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:12):**  then we launched chain wide at Y castle, which has a less affluent quick service consumer,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:17):**  the McDonald's and then burger King.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:18):**  And then, you know, we went nationwide, the consumer, if you tell them exactly what you  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:23):**  are making and why you're making it pretty savvy consumers want the truth and they're  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:29):**  demanding it from new brands.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:31):**  So it'll come.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:32):**  And I think betting on the consumer is the fastest path to change.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:36):**  Last question for you, David, you, I would say have been pretty objectively successful  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:40):**  in the tech space and also in the food mag space.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:43):**  The exciting part of this growing agri tech 2.0 is new perspectives coming in and new  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:49):**  talent and new views and new technologies, but people who maybe haven't worked in food  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:53):**  and ag and maybe are younger in their career.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:25:55):**  What advice would you have for them breaking into this new agri-tech 2.0 and thinking about  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:00):**  the Asian opportunity in particular?  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:03):**  Well, I think focusing on Asia is quite smart.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:07):**  You know, you want to go where thought leadership and change is happening fastest.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:11):**  And that is Asia.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:12):**  It's also in the middle East.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:14):**  I would say the second is mentees, fine mentors, not vice versa.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:20):**  And I think acting as a generalist versus a specialist.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:25):**  Listen, I was never successful in finance until I became a CFO, right?  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:30):**  I was never great at marketing until I was stuck running all of marketing for global  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:35):**  brands.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:36):**  And it's because I viewed problems from a first principle standpoint.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:40):**  And I was lucky to have mentors who gave me a shot doing a job for the very first time  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:46):**  that arguably I probably didn't deserve to have.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:49):**  But because I had never done the jobs before in industries that were desperate for change,  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:26:54):**  I might have come up with a few crazy ideas and others wouldn't have tried.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:27:00):**  And that is all due to the mentors I had.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:27:03):**  I think, you know, cream doesn't rise to the top.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:27:06):**  There is no such thing as a meritocracy.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:27:09):**  Cream gets pulled to the top by mentors who take a chance on them or is pushed to the  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:27:13):**  top by folks who really believe in you and will follow you.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:27:17):**  So I would bet on a network and bet on mentors and go where the change is happening geographically.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:27:23):**  I mean, frankly, Sarah, like you've done, I think those that's the best advice I guess  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:27:27):**  I could offer.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/7/capitalism-for-good#t=0:27:28):**  Awesome.

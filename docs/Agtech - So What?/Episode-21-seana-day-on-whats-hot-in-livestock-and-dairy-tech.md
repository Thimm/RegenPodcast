### Agtech - So What?  (2018-05-16)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:00):**  Hi everyone, you're listening to BushTech, an agtech podcast that gets to the so what  of agtech.  We'll bring you interesting things from interesting people and I'm one of your co-hosts,  
**[0:00:10-0:00:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:10):**  Simon Mathewson.  And I'm your other co-host, Sarah Nolette.  On this podcast we will bring in leading speakers in technology, entrepreneurship, investment,  
**[0:00:19-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:19):**  agriculture, science and anything else you can think of and we can find in the world  of agtech.  We'll look to demystify it so that we're getting to the so what.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:27):**  What does it really mean for farmers and for the broader agricultural industry?  I'm farming and I grow it.  I'm farming and I grow it.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:42):**  Well thanks for having me join.  Yeah, no, Shawna, thanks so much for joining the podcast.  We are really looking forward to talking to you about your background and what you're  
**[0:00:52-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:52):**  up to.  I love that you have, you sort of grew up in an ag area but have a finance background  and are now back in ag so one of these kind of translators across the tech and the ag  
**[0:01:04-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:04):**  finance world, which I think is such a needed skill set.  Well I'm happy to share that with you guys as well.  Yeah, so maybe start with a little bit of an overview of that background and how you've  
**[0:01:18-0:01:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:18):**  kind of gone from the finance and back to ag and finance.  Yeah, so I spent, it's been about 15 years now in the technology investment banking landscape  and as Sarah mentioned by way of background, I grew up in a small ag town in the central  
**[0:01:38-0:01:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:38):**  part of California called Turlock and my family's been in this town for a long time.  I'm fourth generation and over the course of our family history we've had everything  from grain trading to chicken from turkeys and now almonds in production.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:55):**  It's a relatively small operation but still kind of nice to keep one foot in that world  and about three years ago I had been banking in London and like I said working with technology  companies, did a lot of work in mobile wireless and I'll come back to that in a couple of  
**[0:02:13-0:02:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:13):**  minutes, the significance of that.  As a matter of fact, my current business partner, Rob Trice, about 10-12 years ago in that kind  of part of my life and I was banking in London and woke up one day and decided I couldn't  
**[0:02:26-0:02:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:26):**  do another winter in London and really wanted to get back to California and around that  time, Monsanto had acquired Climate Corp for close to a billion dollars and I think that  really opened a lot of people's eyes to the possibilities of technology and agriculture  
**[0:02:41-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:41):**  and because I worked with so many tech companies I spent a lot of time in Silicon Valley.  I worked in San Francisco at an investment bank for about six or seven years and my Silicon  Valley friends were starting to get really excited about the possibility of technology  
**[0:02:57-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:57):**  disrupting agriculture and it wouldn't look the same in the next five to ten years and  robotics and all of this sort of promise that, dare I say hype, that comes with that was  very interesting to me but I also, sort of being grounded and still having family in  
**[0:03:14-0:03:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:14):**  the Central Valley, wanted to validate that view of the future and so I decided to move  from London back to Turlock just to see if there was a there there and that was in 2014  and it became pretty clear pretty quickly that the perception of technology in the ag  
**[0:03:35-0:03:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:35):**  ecosystem especially in specialty crops here in California was very different than just  over the hill in Silicon Valley and that's when I recognized that there was a really  interesting opportunity to help build those bridges and serve as a little bit of a translation  
**[0:03:50-0:04:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:50):**  engine having the benefit of being able to speak both ag and technology.  That was an unusual skill set and unfortunately I think it's still to many extents is an unusual  skill set and but great opportunity for me.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:07):**  So I started working with more growers actually around that time and really trying to understand  where their needs were, where technology was falling short of promise, what they were using  and it was sort of staggering to me the not the lack of sophistication of the operators  
**[0:04:26-0:04:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:26):**  certainly you know the growing the producers are very sophisticated in the way that they  you know think about their businesses but just the level of technology that was available  to them was sort of like what we've used in the 90s and that was something that was really  
**[0:04:44-0:04:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:44):**  strange to me after working in such sort of high tech industries in the investment banking  side.  So you know over the last three years or so I spent kind of probably more time again for  
**[0:04:57-0:05:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:57):**  helping technology people understand the real needs and making the introductions and helping  connect them to the growers who are really interested in adopting those technologies  and on the other side you know helping create awareness within the ag community and among  
**[0:05:13-0:05:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:13):**  growers in terms of what's actually out there because one of the things I really noticed  was the sales cycle to growers like hey you know we'll look at whoever knocks on our door  and if you're not in the ag industry knocking on doors and getting growers to pay attention  
**[0:05:29-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:29):**  to you is really difficult so a lot of times what you would see is that not the best of  breed wouldn't necessarily be the one that was adopted because you know they just happened  to be the ones that showed up on the door at the right time at the right place promising  
**[0:05:43-0:05:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:43):**  to solve a problem and lo and behold that problem was never really solved so that growers  perception of that particular technology wasn't great and the next time somebody came to their  door they didn't want to answer it so there were these kind of friction that it takes  
**[0:05:59-0:06:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:59):**  some overcoming but again that's about building awareness and I guess I'd say over the past  couple of years or not even a couple of years over the past six to nine months the appetite  for having those conversations really seems to be shifting at least in my part of the  
**[0:06:17-0:06:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:17):**  world the west coast specialty crop world where three years ago there were definitely  growers on the forefront and they were interested in technology and maybe they were adopting  some but they were much fewer and further between whereas now we're getting a lot more  
**[0:06:32-0:06:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:32):**  people knocking on our doors and saying hey help us figure out what our technology strategy  should look like we know that we don't know everything that's out there and we need somebody  to help us figure out what's out there and what we should be using and the volume of  
**[0:06:45-0:07:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:45):**  those discussions is becoming more and more frequent yeah and there's a difference in  progress do you see a difference in um I know you've been around the world and definitely  on the us as well in the sort of central valley conversations versus elsewhere because the  
**[0:07:01-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:01):**  central valley is so close to silicon valley and can have those conversations in a different  way than you know you might in somewhere else that doesn't have that kind of view into the  tech world so easily it's so surprising to me because exactly what you just said is what  
**[0:07:17-0:07:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:17):**  you would think however um a lot of aspects of the specialty market have been much slower  to adopt technology and versus the commodity row crops in the midwest of the united states  um and other places parts of the world where grains corn soy are grown we've seen a lot  
**[0:07:39-0:07:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:39):**  more adoption of technology in those markets and that was really really puzzling to me  particularly because the margins and specialty crops are so much higher so you would think  that there's more capital to spend on um on technology and and robotics and automation  
**[0:07:57-0:08:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:57):**  and it just doesn't didn't seem to be happening and I think one of the reasons one of the  big reasons is fundamentally the size of those markets so it sort of brings to into question  the whole capital deployment strategy or capital deployment um bias and in the sort of ag tech  
**[0:08:15-0:08:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:15):**  market where you've got traditional institutional investors venture capital investors who are  looking at these technologies and saying great really neat um automation technology but how  big is the actual market size how many growers are there that will buy this product and so  
**[0:08:34-0:08:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:34):**  you start in specialty you know here in California I think we grow three or four hundred crops  so you start to get these much much smaller market opportunities and I don't probably  have to tell anybody that listens to this podcast the way that you grow and harvest  
**[0:08:49-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:49):**  a strawberry is very different from lettuce and almonds and citrus and so the overlap  between those technologies doesn't isn't hasn't really been great and so consequently you  have startups chasing these markets but there's not enough capital to fund those because they  
**[0:09:08-0:09:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:08):**  don't recognize a large enough market opportunity on the other on the other hand um in sort  of broad acre row crops commodity crops much bigger market opportunities instead of a couple  hundred acres you know a big operation in California could be fifteen hundred two thousand  
**[0:09:25-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:25):**  three thousand acres um a big operation in the midwest with corn and and soy is you know  thousands and thousands of acres so it's just you got much different market dynamics and  that's had a big impact on where I think the capital is flowed to the startups addressing  
**[0:09:41-0:09:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:41):**  those market opportunities the long-winded way of answering your question is there's  been less there's been less a lot less adoption than I would have expected here in the west  coast of California.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:53):**  Yeah I think I think that is changing I've seen that as well and and do you think that's  a US thing or are you guys looking elsewhere I mean we have a lot of listeners in Australia  have obviously been based there do you do you think that that's a you know just specialty  
**[0:10:08-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:08):**  crops is it a geography thing is it a US thing like what are you seeing I guess on a more  global scale?  Yeah so that's where I think proximity to Silicon Valley does indeed help and I wouldn't  
**[0:10:23-0:10:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:23):**  even say Silicon Valley I wouldn't I wouldn't isolate it to Silicon Valley because there  are other I think really exciting ag tech hubs around the rest of the country in Illinois,  Texas, North Carolina and so but I would say that proximity to those academic institutions  
**[0:10:42-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:42):**  research institutions hubs for technology innovation make the US somewhat unique and  the kind of the flow of technology is maybe a little bit a little bit I don't want to  say seamless it's certainly not seamless but there's a little less friction whereas let's  
**[0:11:00-0:11:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:00):**  say in Latin America where you have enormous firming operations and you've got a couple  of players on the ag tech side that have I think made some really good headway is you're  just you don't have those same hubs and the same support system and the same sort of culture  
**[0:11:17-0:11:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:17):**  of innovation and so I think that's been a little bit of an inhibitor to technology adoption  and we see we see that with Brazil for example where we're seeing more and more Brazilian  scouts, outcome scouts whether they're corporate scouts or farming operation scouts coming  
**[0:11:34-0:11:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:34):**  up to the Bay Area or coming up to the US and trying to source technologies to bring  back to those places so that's Latin America.  I think Europe has some really interesting dynamics and there are there are some good  
**[0:11:47-0:12:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:47):**  strong pockets of innovation in Europe.  France is doing a lot on the ag tech side, Ireland's doing a lot, UK has a couple of  really interesting particularly in the livestock technology side obviously in Israel anything  
**[0:12:01-0:12:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:01):**  related to water management again sort of livestock there's some interesting stuff going  on so there are again sort of these pockets that these pockets that that have a very good  support have very good support for ag tech ecosystems but the reality is most of the  
**[0:12:18-0:12:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:18):**  capital is in the US and so that's where companies tend to gravitate if they are at that stage  that they're going to need growth capital to scale their businesses so you know it becomes  then the question of do you follow the capital, do you have a good local network of high net  
**[0:12:37-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:37):**  worth investors who can fund it but at some stage are you going to have to go shop your  company in Sand Hill Road to kind of raise the type of money that you need to really  build a globally scalable business so I think that it just putting my prior tech hat on  
**[0:12:55-0:13:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:55):**  that was the case not just an ag tech that was a case kind of across the board and most  technologies where at some stage they would look to the US because that's where the capital  was flowing.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:07):**  Yeah right and I guess one potential pushback there is that maybe venture capital isn't  the right type for ag tech and I imagine that's something you guys come across or have faced  what's your view on the suitability of VC for ag tech given needing to plant things  
**[0:13:24-0:13:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:24):**  and wait longer and some of these you know trials that have to take more time in areas  that you might not you know you might be doing something in a crop that's not you know near  silicon dollar not in the US what's your what's your view on sort of what's a good fit and  
**[0:13:39-0:13:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:39):**  what's not a good fit?  We're 100% spot on I mean I think I think because this is quote unquote technology play  the temptation is to go that venture route but the priorities and the financial return  
**[0:13:57-0:14:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:57):**  requirements of many venture funds do not align well with agriculture and so that's  something that I think even if you look at what's happening in the ag tech landscape  now we're feeling that play itself out right there was a lot of excitement in 2015, 2016  
**[0:14:16-0:14:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:16):**  where big dollars were pouring into especially infield technologies and there maybe wasn't  a full appreciation for the failed cycle of selling products into agriculture and to directly  to growers there wasn't a full appreciation for you know look in most cases you have one  
**[0:14:36-0:14:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:36):**  harvest a year and it's one chance to kind of pull your technology such that it you know  it does what it promises to do and you got your one harvest and that's your data point  you have to wait until next year of course there's some faster turn row crops like lettuce  
**[0:14:50-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:50):**  and things like that where you get a few more chances and in dairy you get a chance a couple  times a day but you know for the most part I think the venture community said uh oh this  is taking a lot longer and it's a lot more complicated than we expected and consequently  
**[0:15:06-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:06):**  now I think you've seen a lot of sort of that capital drying up for those earlier stage  companies who were maybe depending on having that readily available so that they could  prove out their business model and start to really sort of scale into a sustainable business  
**[0:15:23-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:23):**  now that capital is no longer there and those companies are sort of left out in the desert  you know there have certainly there are financings that are still taking place and they're getting  they're larger and larger financing so you're kind of having a separation in the market  
**[0:15:36-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:36):**  there but to your point Sarah I think it's really made people look around and say is  this the right type of capital for these business models and in a lot of cases no it's not because  you're just not going to see you're fundamentally not going to see as many 10x 100x returns  
**[0:15:55-0:16:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:55):**  because like I said before these are in some cases smaller market opportunities this might  not be a multi-billion dollar market opportunity where this company is trying to sell a particular  type of robot into specialty crops or a particular type of sensor to monitor water use.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:13):**  Yeah.  It might be a multi-hundred million dollar one but not a billion dollar one.  And so I mean you're now on the investment side as well actually you know making investments  
**[0:16:22-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:22):**  in the space through Better Food Ventures so what is a good fit for you guys are you  looking for that kind of 10x return as a traditional VC or do you take a different approach and  if you are then what is a good fit how you know should companies know that they could  
**[0:16:37-0:16:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:37):**  go to you and that that would be a good option?  Yeah so I mean we're in the midst of fundraising now we've already done 13 investments to date  and I think one of our big one of the themes that we really stay focused on is capital  
**[0:16:51-0:17:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:51):**  efficiency and very much understanding the customer acquisition model and it's how you  scale that so are you trying to sell something directly to a grower or are you able to work  through the channel retailers or other input providers to sort of get more bang for your  
**[0:17:10-0:17:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:10):**  for your marketing sales and marketing dollar.  So we're really looking at those fundamentals very very closely.  I think I like to think that we've got a good pulse on the market.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:19):**  I cover about 1500 or so ag tech companies with sort of the market mapping work that  I do and you know so on one hand I think we're very disciplined about that capital efficiency  model and how we look at the routes to market.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:37):**  On the other hand in our fundraising efforts we are really really trying to be conscious  about aligning our LPs interest with the realities of this market so we're raising a 30 million  dollar fund and the reason we're not raising a 300 million dollar fund is because we feel  
**[0:17:53-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:53):**  like that's kind of where the market is right now in terms of opportunities that we can  achieve the types of returns that we think are reasonable in this market.  The other thing we're doing is also fundraising from folks that we think have that kind of  
**[0:18:09-0:18:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:09):**  more patient capital and maybe a little bit sort of a little bit different return objectives  than maybe some of the traditional LPs that you would find in venture capital portfolios  that are investing in consumer technologies or investing in enterprise software or communications  
**[0:18:28-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:28):**  models.  So it's just it's about finding the right investors for these for these transactions  and I think even when you're talking to angel investors you know it's very tempting to get  
**[0:18:41-0:18:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:41):**  sort of to have farmers invest in the technologies and I think there's 100% of place for that  and I want to see more of that but I also think it's really important for companies  to manage those expectations because in a lot of cases the growers are used to investing  
**[0:18:56-0:19:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:56):**  in dirt or iron and there's sort of more cash flow based models versus I would call it value  creation models where you know you're not going to see anything for 10 years and you  might forget about the money that you put into that company but in 10 years you know  
**[0:19:11-0:19:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:11):**  that could be your 10x return so just making sure that you're really educating or the investor  is really educated in terms of what it is and what it is not I think is extremely important.  And how's the capital raise going like is the sort of excitement around ag that I think  
**[0:19:26-0:19:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:26):**  does this in the space feel all the time something that you're seeing from the investment community  as well?  We are you know the exciting part about this is it's some days it feels like I've been  
**[0:19:38-0:19:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:38):**  doing this forever and other cases it feels like this has been a whirlwind but in the  kind of four years that I've really been heads down focusing on this pretty exclusively I  mentioned it before but in the last year the number of people starting to lean in and say  
**[0:19:56-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:56):**  hey this isn't a fad you know this sort of the intersection of technology and agriculture  is something that is very much here to stay and people are starting to rethink their organizations  people are definitely rethinking their operations how do they staff them how can they leverage  
**[0:20:13-0:20:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:13):**  technology to reduce their risk I think risk is one of the big topics that if you're outside  of the industry it might not resonate quite as much but if you're within the ag industry  food and ag and thinking about your supply chain risk thinking about your resource management  
**[0:20:30-0:20:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:30):**  risk thinking about all of these things that can be significantly managed through technologies  you just are smarter about your sort of exposure in your business those are the levers that  people are starting to say oh yeah okay we need to we need to be investing in either  
**[0:20:47-0:21:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:47):**  companies or people who can identify and diligent with companies on our behalf so I'm pleased  to say that the fundraising is going well you know it's always takes time but it's going  well and the timing for us feels right now because of our story because of kind of our  
**[0:21:06-0:21:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:06):**  I think we've got a pretty interesting position with sort of me in the Central Valley covering  all things ag tech and then our partner Britta Rosenheim based out of out of Manhattan covering  all things food tech and then Michael Rose and Rob Trice who are really seasoned corporate  
**[0:21:23-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:23):**  executives and corporate venture guys so we've got a nice mix I think that gives us great  deal flow and sort of a thoughtful approach because we're well at least I can speak for  myself here in the central part of California I'm kind of on the ground really understanding  
**[0:21:39-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:39):**  where the challenges are and then I can match that up to kind of the companies that we're  seeing come through the pipeline.  Yeah I mean I've loved how you guys do do that kind of like boots on the ground work  
**[0:21:50-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:50):**  and in the conferences you run but in the you know getting out in different areas and  doing the market map and adding value to the ecosystem so I think it's a really friendly  model in the sense of trying to build this space and increase awareness around it so  
**[0:22:03-0:22:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:03):**  I've really appreciated seeing that from you guys and working on a bit of it with you.  I want to ask just you personally do you ever find yourself wanting to be on the entrepreneur  side like do you do you get the itch to start one of these companies and jump ship?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:19):**  No it's really hard.  I have a tremendous amount of respect for the companies that we work with and we invest  in and boy the heartbreak and the you know the ups and downs are I just I don't know  
**[0:22:34-0:22:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:34):**  if I could do it.  I love helping them but boy I don't know if I could sit in their in their shoes.  Having said that I actually have had a couple of opportunities to be a part of the kind  
**[0:22:46-0:23:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:46):**  of more the operation side and I've enjoyed them very very much but all roads keep leading  back to sort of financial lens for me and at some point I guess in your career you kind  of you kind of say okay the world's trying to tell me something I should I should respond  
**[0:23:03-0:23:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:03):**  accordingly so I'm extremely grateful.  I had a brief stint co-founding a wine importing business looking at Argentine wines at the  time and the portfolio's grown since then and that was back during the 2008-2009 period  
**[0:23:19-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:19):**  when investment banking all but dried up because as we all know there was a little bit of a  capital crisis around the world and so that afforded me a really amazing opportunity to  like I said co-found this business with with a business partner and and we sourced some  
**[0:23:35-0:23:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:35):**  awesome wines from from Argentina and marketed them in the U.S. and built a nice little business  and I got to drink a bunch of wine for about a year and a half and then it was time to  get back to get back to investment banking.  
**[0:23:47-0:24:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:47):**  So between that and I ran operations and restructuring for a large software consolidator for about  a year and a half and that was a really instructive opportunity for me to sit on the other side  of the table and really understand operations and operations management and so being able  
**[0:24:05-0:24:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:05):**  to kind of bring that lens back into the work that I do now has been has been I think a  huge value add for me and hopefully for the companies that I work with but yeah I think  I get just the right amount of entrepreneurial exposure with what I'm doing now but I don't  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:21):**  know I don't know that I'd ever jump across the table again.  Well you never say never I suppose but yeah that sounds like you.  Never say never exactly.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:28):**  I guess just in the market you we've emailed back and forth a little bit recently on on  Dairitech and on livestock what are areas that you're excited about or that you guys  at Better Food are excited about in terms of investing like where where's somewhere  
**[0:24:45-0:24:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:45):**  that you think people should should be looking or maybe areas where they they shouldn't be  looking?  Yeah great question so I am going to do a little plug for livestock tech because I just  
**[0:24:55-0:25:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:55):**  spent about the last three or four months doing a really deep dive and it it actually  started off with a collaboration with the Innovation Center for US Dairy some conversations  with them and just talking about how dairy technology was perceived where the adoption  
**[0:25:14-0:25:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:14):**  curve is in dairy technology where what's working what's not working and it led to this  really intriguing deep dive where I've done dozens of interviews with producers and folks  in the support network around the dairy complex.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:27):**  I'll use broadly livestock technology but this kind of ended up going to more in the  direction of dairy technology but it I came up with about 120 companies and and take a  step back so my coverage area it within the ag tech landscape is sort of infield and post  
**[0:25:46-0:26:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:46):**  harvest so infield automation robotics sensors imagery you know sort of anything that hardware  software applications that are used in the field and then post harvest supply chain logistics  b2b marketplaces trading and finance technology so everything that kind of runs into about  
**[0:26:06-0:26:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:06):**  distribution and then my partner Bridget Rosenheim picks up at the distribution point and covers  all things consumer facing in in food technology so food media meal delivery kits restaurant  technology sort of anything consumer facing so with that as a backdrop my livestock technology  
**[0:26:24-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:24):**  landscape overview was really you know what are people using within the dairy complex  up until about the milk parlor and then from that point the process inside I didn't get  into that and I didn't really get into the genetics too deeply or nutrients or additives  
**[0:26:41-0:27:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:41):**  so that's kind of the backdrop of what I was focused on but I was fascinated by so on one  hand dairy technology livestock technology faces the same sort of infrastructure challenges  that we see in the rest of agriculture you know lack of data standards no common operating  
**[0:27:03-0:27:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:03):**  system a lot of fragmentation etc etc but on the other hand what I guess I at some level  I knew this I just didn't put the pieces together the level of technology in the dairy complex  has been pretty pretty advanced as you compare it to other parts of even in something like  
**[0:27:23-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:23):**  that's wearable that's been around for quite some time robotics in the dairy in the milk  parlor have been around so in dairy technology is the dairymen and dairy producers I think  are very much open to technology that works and that drives some value of course but it's  
**[0:27:41-0:27:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:41):**  a it's maybe not as challenging of a sale the other thing that I found really sort of  intriguing about dairy technology is and again sort of lack of better words its ability to  one a technology company's ability to A B test I mean you're getting two or three milk  
**[0:27:57-0:28:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:57):**  in the day you know 365 days a year and so to the extent you can fine-tune your technologies  you know if they're if they're measuring different things and and the sort of dairy workflow  you've got much more chances to understand how a tweak here or tweak there might impact  
**[0:28:15-0:28:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:15):**  the performance of your technology so I think that's something that was really interesting  and then the other thing is just the size of the market you know talked about in specialty  you've got these very small fragmented markets and it's hard to attract capital and sort  
**[0:28:29-0:28:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:29):**  of companies to focus on them dairy is huge and by and large you know there are different  ways that people run their operations certainly but the kind of basic basic workflow is fairly  similar where just wherever you are in the world so I think those are things that people  
**[0:28:47-0:29:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:47):**  should consider when they're looking at opportunities in this broader ag tech landscape whether  you're an investor or an entrepreneur that's looking for some white space I think that  there are that that's maybe a part of the market that's been overlooked so I'm I'm excited  
**[0:29:04-0:29:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:04):**  and interested about around that right now I am particularly interested in some of the  categories of post-harvest and supply chain analytics we kind of had traceability 1.0  I think some years back and the next generation of food safety tracking and tracing is is  
**[0:29:23-0:29:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:23):**  some is interesting we've got some enabling technologies now with blockchain that I think  are going to be really game changers there that's something to keep an eye on we're starting  to see more activity around kind of trading and finance you know maybe more creative trading  
**[0:29:39-0:29:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:39):**  and finance platforms you've seen farmers business network have a play there again blockchain  could be a really interesting enabling technology around getting you know getting farmers paid  more quickly and and the authenticity of the of the payment flows so yeah that's that's  
**[0:29:58-0:30:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:58):**  I would say where I'm spending a bit of my time right now and then of course in automation  as well I think the the sensors and the vision systems and the technologies around robotics  and automation are starting to come down in price the pain of labor is becoming more and  
**[0:30:16-0:30:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:16):**  more acute especially here on the west coast of the US and so I think we'll we'll start  to see more adoption in that category over the next couple of years so I'm excited about  what's going on in that part as well.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:35):**  And look I think that's so that's such a two things there one the view on actual spaces  and where to be looking and then the concept of white space but also how you think about  that in terms of the iterations you can get in terms of the size of the market in terms  
**[0:30:50-0:31:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:50):**  of willingness to adopt and sort of tech saturation and tech familiarity I think those are really  like to you in the investment world obvious and how you think about the space but not  really lenses that I hear put on opportunities and really have to think about this space  
**[0:31:05-0:31:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:31:05):**  very frequently so I think that's a really important insight for both entrepreneurs and  investors and then probably farmers to be thinking about as well in terms of what they're  what they're gonna see and experience so and I love that it's such a positive view that  
**[0:31:18-0:31:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:31:18):**  there are so many opportunities in in this space so I think we might we might leave it  there Sean I really appreciate you coming on the podcast and sharing both your personal  background and what you guys are up to and some opportunities in this space I think it's  
**[0:31:32-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:31:32):**  it's really exciting and I love what you guys have been doing where can people find more  about about we've been doing some of the the market maps and investments where should they  be looking to learn more.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:31:42):**  Yeah so our investment fund is called Better Food Ventures like I said we're currently  in the fundraising process now but you can check our existing portfolio betterfoodventures.com  and then the landscape maps are available at the mixing bowl hub or start mixing bowl  
**[0:31:59-0:32:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:31:59):**  hub and that is both the ag tech landscape and the food tech landscape and we've got  an event coming up in New York on March 22nd Forbes mixing bowl NYC and I'm going to be  rolling out the livestock technology landscape and doing kind of a cool panel around that  
**[0:32:19-0:32:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:32:19):**  in that event so look for the livestock tech landscape after the 20 seconds on mixing bowl  hub dot com we also publish them through Forbes dot com so I know I've thrown a lot of dot  com sounds over that those are the places you can find find our information.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:32:36):**  Fantastic well thanks again so much Shauna and look forward to learning more about livestock  in a couple weeks.  Awesome thanks guys.

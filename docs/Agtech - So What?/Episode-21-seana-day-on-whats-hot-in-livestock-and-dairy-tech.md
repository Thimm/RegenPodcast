**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:19):**  agriculture, science and anything else you can think of and we can find in the world  
**[0:00:23-0:00:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:23):**  of agtech.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:24):**  We'll look to demystify it so that we're getting to the so what.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:27):**  What does it really mean for farmers and for the broader agricultural industry?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:30):**  I'm farming and I grow it.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:36):**  I'm farming and I grow it.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:42):**  Well thanks for having me join.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:43):**  Yeah, no, Shawna, thanks so much for joining the podcast.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:47):**  We are really looking forward to talking to you about your background and what you're  
**[0:00:52-0:00:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:52):**  up to.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:53):**  I love that you have, you sort of grew up in an ag area but have a finance background  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:00:59):**  and are now back in ag so one of these kind of translators across the tech and the ag  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:04):**  finance world, which I think is such a needed skill set.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:09):**  Well I'm happy to share that with you guys as well.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:13):**  Yeah, so maybe start with a little bit of an overview of that background and how you've  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:18):**  kind of gone from the finance and back to ag and finance.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:22):**  Yeah, so I spent, it's been about 15 years now in the technology investment banking landscape  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:33):**  and as Sarah mentioned by way of background, I grew up in a small ag town in the central  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:38):**  part of California called Turlock and my family's been in this town for a long time.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:43):**  I'm fourth generation and over the course of our family history we've had everything  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:49):**  from grain trading to chicken from turkeys and now almonds in production.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:01:55):**  It's a relatively small operation but still kind of nice to keep one foot in that world  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:03):**  and about three years ago I had been banking in London and like I said working with technology  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:08):**  companies, did a lot of work in mobile wireless and I'll come back to that in a couple of  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:13):**  minutes, the significance of that.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:15):**  As a matter of fact, my current business partner, Rob Trice, about 10-12 years ago in that kind  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:21):**  of part of my life and I was banking in London and woke up one day and decided I couldn't  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:26):**  do another winter in London and really wanted to get back to California and around that  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:31):**  time, Monsanto had acquired Climate Corp for close to a billion dollars and I think that  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:36):**  really opened a lot of people's eyes to the possibilities of technology and agriculture  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:41):**  and because I worked with so many tech companies I spent a lot of time in Silicon Valley.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:46):**  I worked in San Francisco at an investment bank for about six or seven years and my Silicon  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:52):**  Valley friends were starting to get really excited about the possibility of technology  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:02:57):**  disrupting agriculture and it wouldn't look the same in the next five to ten years and  
**[0:03:02-0:03:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:02):**  robotics and all of this sort of promise that, dare I say hype, that comes with that was  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:10):**  very interesting to me but I also, sort of being grounded and still having family in  
**[0:03:14-0:03:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:14):**  the Central Valley, wanted to validate that view of the future and so I decided to move  
**[0:03:22-0:03:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:22):**  from London back to Turlock just to see if there was a there there and that was in 2014  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:30):**  and it became pretty clear pretty quickly that the perception of technology in the ag  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:35):**  ecosystem especially in specialty crops here in California was very different than just  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:41):**  over the hill in Silicon Valley and that's when I recognized that there was a really  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:45):**  interesting opportunity to help build those bridges and serve as a little bit of a translation  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:50):**  engine having the benefit of being able to speak both ag and technology.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:03:56):**  That was an unusual skill set and unfortunately I think it's still to many extents is an unusual  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:03):**  skill set and but great opportunity for me.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:07):**  So I started working with more growers actually around that time and really trying to understand  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:13):**  where their needs were, where technology was falling short of promise, what they were using  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:20):**  and it was sort of staggering to me the not the lack of sophistication of the operators  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:26):**  certainly you know the growing the producers are very sophisticated in the way that they  
**[0:04:29-0:04:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:29):**  you know think about their businesses but just the level of technology that was available  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:37):**  to them was sort of like what we've used in the 90s and that was something that was really  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:44):**  strange to me after working in such sort of high tech industries in the investment banking  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:48):**  side.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:50):**  So you know over the last three years or so I spent kind of probably more time again for  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:04:57):**  helping technology people understand the real needs and making the introductions and helping  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:01):**  connect them to the growers who are really interested in adopting those technologies  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:08):**  and on the other side you know helping create awareness within the ag community and among  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:13):**  growers in terms of what's actually out there because one of the things I really noticed  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:18):**  was the sales cycle to growers like hey you know we'll look at whoever knocks on our door  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:24):**  and if you're not in the ag industry knocking on doors and getting growers to pay attention  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:29):**  to you is really difficult so a lot of times what you would see is that not the best of  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:36):**  breed wouldn't necessarily be the one that was adopted because you know they just happened  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:40):**  to be the ones that showed up on the door at the right time at the right place promising  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:43):**  to solve a problem and lo and behold that problem was never really solved so that growers  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:48):**  perception of that particular technology wasn't great and the next time somebody came to their  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:53):**  door they didn't want to answer it so there were these kind of friction that it takes  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:05:59):**  some overcoming but again that's about building awareness and I guess I'd say over the past  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:05):**  couple of years or not even a couple of years over the past six to nine months the appetite  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:12):**  for having those conversations really seems to be shifting at least in my part of the  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:17):**  world the west coast specialty crop world where three years ago there were definitely  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:22):**  growers on the forefront and they were interested in technology and maybe they were adopting  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:26):**  some but they were much fewer and further between whereas now we're getting a lot more  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:32):**  people knocking on our doors and saying hey help us figure out what our technology strategy  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:37):**  should look like we know that we don't know everything that's out there and we need somebody  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:41):**  to help us figure out what's out there and what we should be using and the volume of  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:45):**  those discussions is becoming more and more frequent yeah and there's a difference in  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:51):**  progress do you see a difference in um I know you've been around the world and definitely  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:06:56):**  on the us as well in the sort of central valley conversations versus elsewhere because the  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:01):**  central valley is so close to silicon valley and can have those conversations in a different  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:06):**  way than you know you might in somewhere else that doesn't have that kind of view into the  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:10):**  tech world so easily it's so surprising to me because exactly what you just said is what  
**[0:07:17-0:07:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:17):**  you would think however um a lot of aspects of the specialty market have been much slower  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:26):**  to adopt technology and versus the commodity row crops in the midwest of the united states  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:33):**  um and other places parts of the world where grains corn soy are grown we've seen a lot  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:39):**  more adoption of technology in those markets and that was really really puzzling to me  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:46):**  particularly because the margins and specialty crops are so much higher so you would think  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:50):**  that there's more capital to spend on um on technology and and robotics and automation  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:07:57):**  and it just doesn't didn't seem to be happening and I think one of the reasons one of the  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:02):**  big reasons is fundamentally the size of those markets so it sort of brings to into question  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:08):**  the whole capital deployment strategy or capital deployment um bias and in the sort of ag tech  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:15):**  market where you've got traditional institutional investors venture capital investors who are  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:22):**  looking at these technologies and saying great really neat um automation technology but how  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:27):**  big is the actual market size how many growers are there that will buy this product and so  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:34):**  you start in specialty you know here in California I think we grow three or four hundred crops  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:39):**  so you start to get these much much smaller market opportunities and I don't probably  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:46):**  have to tell anybody that listens to this podcast the way that you grow and harvest  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:49):**  a strawberry is very different from lettuce and almonds and citrus and so the overlap  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:08:55):**  between those technologies doesn't isn't hasn't really been great and so consequently you  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:02):**  have startups chasing these markets but there's not enough capital to fund those because they  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:08):**  don't recognize a large enough market opportunity on the other on the other hand um in sort  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:14):**  of broad acre row crops commodity crops much bigger market opportunities instead of a couple  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:20):**  hundred acres you know a big operation in California could be fifteen hundred two thousand  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:25):**  three thousand acres um a big operation in the midwest with corn and and soy is you know  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:32):**  thousands and thousands of acres so it's just you got much different market dynamics and  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:37):**  that's had a big impact on where I think the capital is flowed to the startups addressing  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:41):**  those market opportunities the long-winded way of answering your question is there's  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:46):**  been less there's been less a lot less adoption than I would have expected here in the west  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:52):**  coast of California.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:53):**  Yeah I think I think that is changing I've seen that as well and and do you think that's  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:09:58):**  a US thing or are you guys looking elsewhere I mean we have a lot of listeners in Australia  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:03):**  have obviously been based there do you do you think that that's a you know just specialty  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:08):**  crops is it a geography thing is it a US thing like what are you seeing I guess on a more  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:13):**  global scale?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:15):**  Yeah so that's where I think proximity to Silicon Valley does indeed help and I wouldn't  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:23):**  even say Silicon Valley I wouldn't I wouldn't isolate it to Silicon Valley because there  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:27):**  are other I think really exciting ag tech hubs around the rest of the country in Illinois,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:34):**  Texas, North Carolina and so but I would say that proximity to those academic institutions  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:42):**  research institutions hubs for technology innovation make the US somewhat unique and  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:48):**  the kind of the flow of technology is maybe a little bit a little bit I don't want to  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:10:55):**  say seamless it's certainly not seamless but there's a little less friction whereas let's  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:00):**  say in Latin America where you have enormous firming operations and you've got a couple  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:07):**  of players on the ag tech side that have I think made some really good headway is you're  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:12):**  just you don't have those same hubs and the same support system and the same sort of culture  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:17):**  of innovation and so I think that's been a little bit of an inhibitor to technology adoption  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:23):**  and we see we see that with Brazil for example where we're seeing more and more Brazilian  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:28):**  scouts, outcome scouts whether they're corporate scouts or farming operation scouts coming  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:34):**  up to the Bay Area or coming up to the US and trying to source technologies to bring  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:39):**  back to those places so that's Latin America.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:42):**  I think Europe has some really interesting dynamics and there are there are some good  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:47):**  strong pockets of innovation in Europe.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:50):**  France is doing a lot on the ag tech side, Ireland's doing a lot, UK has a couple of  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:11:55):**  really interesting particularly in the livestock technology side obviously in Israel anything  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:01):**  related to water management again sort of livestock there's some interesting stuff going  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:05):**  on so there are again sort of these pockets that these pockets that that have a very good  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:11):**  support have very good support for ag tech ecosystems but the reality is most of the  
**[0:12:18-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:18):**  capital is in the US and so that's where companies tend to gravitate if they are at that stage  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:26):**  that they're going to need growth capital to scale their businesses so you know it becomes  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:31):**  then the question of do you follow the capital, do you have a good local network of high net  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:37):**  worth investors who can fund it but at some stage are you going to have to go shop your  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:41):**  company in Sand Hill Road to kind of raise the type of money that you need to really  
**[0:12:47-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:47):**  build a globally scalable business so I think that it just putting my prior tech hat on  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:55):**  that was the case not just an ag tech that was a case kind of across the board and most  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:12:58):**  technologies where at some stage they would look to the US because that's where the capital  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:05):**  was flowing.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:07):**  Yeah right and I guess one potential pushback there is that maybe venture capital isn't  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:13):**  the right type for ag tech and I imagine that's something you guys come across or have faced  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:17):**  what's your view on the suitability of VC for ag tech given needing to plant things  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:24):**  and wait longer and some of these you know trials that have to take more time in areas  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:29):**  that you might not you know you might be doing something in a crop that's not you know near  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:34):**  silicon dollar not in the US what's your what's your view on sort of what's a good fit and  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:39):**  what's not a good fit?  
**[0:13:41-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:41):**  We're 100% spot on I mean I think I think because this is quote unquote technology play  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:50):**  the temptation is to go that venture route but the priorities and the financial return  
**[0:13:57-0:14:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:13:57):**  requirements of many venture funds do not align well with agriculture and so that's  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:05):**  something that I think even if you look at what's happening in the ag tech landscape  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:10):**  now we're feeling that play itself out right there was a lot of excitement in 2015, 2016  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:16):**  where big dollars were pouring into especially infield technologies and there maybe wasn't  
**[0:14:23-0:14:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:23):**  a full appreciation for the failed cycle of selling products into agriculture and to directly  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:31):**  to growers there wasn't a full appreciation for you know look in most cases you have one  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:36):**  harvest a year and it's one chance to kind of pull your technology such that it you know  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:43):**  it does what it promises to do and you got your one harvest and that's your data point  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:47):**  you have to wait until next year of course there's some faster turn row crops like lettuce  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:50):**  and things like that where you get a few more chances and in dairy you get a chance a couple  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:14:55):**  times a day but you know for the most part I think the venture community said uh oh this  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:02):**  is taking a lot longer and it's a lot more complicated than we expected and consequently  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:06):**  now I think you've seen a lot of sort of that capital drying up for those earlier stage  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:11):**  companies who were maybe depending on having that readily available so that they could  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:17):**  prove out their business model and start to really sort of scale into a sustainable business  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:23):**  now that capital is no longer there and those companies are sort of left out in the desert  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:28):**  you know there have certainly there are financings that are still taking place and they're getting  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:32):**  they're larger and larger financing so you're kind of having a separation in the market  
**[0:15:36-0:15:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:36):**  there but to your point Sarah I think it's really made people look around and say is  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:43):**  this the right type of capital for these business models and in a lot of cases no it's not because  
**[0:15:48-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:48):**  you're just not going to see you're fundamentally not going to see as many 10x 100x returns  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:15:55):**  because like I said before these are in some cases smaller market opportunities this might  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:00):**  not be a multi-billion dollar market opportunity where this company is trying to sell a particular  
**[0:16:05-0:16:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:05):**  type of robot into specialty crops or a particular type of sensor to monitor water use.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:14):**  It might be a multi-hundred million dollar one but not a billion dollar one.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:18):**  And so I mean you're now on the investment side as well actually you know making investments  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:22):**  in the space through Better Food Ventures so what is a good fit for you guys are you  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:27):**  looking for that kind of 10x return as a traditional VC or do you take a different approach and  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:32):**  if you are then what is a good fit how you know should companies know that they could  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:37):**  go to you and that that would be a good option?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:40):**  Yeah so I mean we're in the midst of fundraising now we've already done 13 investments to date  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:45):**  and I think one of our big one of the themes that we really stay focused on is capital  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:51):**  efficiency and very much understanding the customer acquisition model and it's how you  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:16:58):**  scale that so are you trying to sell something directly to a grower or are you able to work  
**[0:17:02-0:17:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:02):**  through the channel retailers or other input providers to sort of get more bang for your  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:10):**  for your marketing sales and marketing dollar.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:12):**  So we're really looking at those fundamentals very very closely.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:16):**  I think I like to think that we've got a good pulse on the market.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:19):**  I cover about 1500 or so ag tech companies with sort of the market mapping work that  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:27):**  I do and you know so on one hand I think we're very disciplined about that capital efficiency  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:33):**  model and how we look at the routes to market.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:37):**  On the other hand in our fundraising efforts we are really really trying to be conscious  
**[0:17:42-0:17:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:42):**  about aligning our LPs interest with the realities of this market so we're raising a 30 million  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:49):**  dollar fund and the reason we're not raising a 300 million dollar fund is because we feel  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:53):**  like that's kind of where the market is right now in terms of opportunities that we can  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:17:58):**  achieve the types of returns that we think are reasonable in this market.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:03):**  The other thing we're doing is also fundraising from folks that we think have that kind of  
**[0:18:09-0:18:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:09):**  more patient capital and maybe a little bit sort of a little bit different return objectives  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:17):**  than maybe some of the traditional LPs that you would find in venture capital portfolios  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:21):**  that are investing in consumer technologies or investing in enterprise software or communications  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:28):**  models.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:29):**  So it's just it's about finding the right investors for these for these transactions  
**[0:18:34-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:34):**  and I think even when you're talking to angel investors you know it's very tempting to get  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:41):**  sort of to have farmers invest in the technologies and I think there's 100% of place for that  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:47):**  and I want to see more of that but I also think it's really important for companies  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:51):**  to manage those expectations because in a lot of cases the growers are used to investing  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:18:56):**  in dirt or iron and there's sort of more cash flow based models versus I would call it value  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:02):**  creation models where you know you're not going to see anything for 10 years and you  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:06):**  might forget about the money that you put into that company but in 10 years you know  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:11):**  that could be your 10x return so just making sure that you're really educating or the investor  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:16):**  is really educated in terms of what it is and what it is not I think is extremely important.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:22):**  And how's the capital raise going like is the sort of excitement around ag that I think  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:26):**  does this in the space feel all the time something that you're seeing from the investment community  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:31):**  as well?  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:33):**  We are you know the exciting part about this is it's some days it feels like I've been  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:38):**  doing this forever and other cases it feels like this has been a whirlwind but in the  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:44):**  kind of four years that I've really been heads down focusing on this pretty exclusively I  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:50):**  mentioned it before but in the last year the number of people starting to lean in and say  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:19:56):**  hey this isn't a fad you know this sort of the intersection of technology and agriculture  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:03):**  is something that is very much here to stay and people are starting to rethink their organizations  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:08):**  people are definitely rethinking their operations how do they staff them how can they leverage  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:13):**  technology to reduce their risk I think risk is one of the big topics that if you're outside  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:20):**  of the industry it might not resonate quite as much but if you're within the ag industry  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:25):**  food and ag and thinking about your supply chain risk thinking about your resource management  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:30):**  risk thinking about all of these things that can be significantly managed through technologies  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:36):**  you just are smarter about your sort of exposure in your business those are the levers that  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:41):**  people are starting to say oh yeah okay we need to we need to be investing in either  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:47):**  companies or people who can identify and diligent with companies on our behalf so I'm pleased  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:20:55):**  to say that the fundraising is going well you know it's always takes time but it's going  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:00):**  well and the timing for us feels right now because of our story because of kind of our  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:06):**  I think we've got a pretty interesting position with sort of me in the Central Valley covering  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:12):**  all things ag tech and then our partner Britta Rosenheim based out of out of Manhattan covering  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:17):**  all things food tech and then Michael Rose and Rob Trice who are really seasoned corporate  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:23):**  executives and corporate venture guys so we've got a nice mix I think that gives us great  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:28):**  deal flow and sort of a thoughtful approach because we're well at least I can speak for  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:33):**  myself here in the central part of California I'm kind of on the ground really understanding  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:39):**  where the challenges are and then I can match that up to kind of the companies that we're  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:43):**  seeing come through the pipeline.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:45):**  Yeah I mean I've loved how you guys do do that kind of like boots on the ground work  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:50):**  and in the conferences you run but in the you know getting out in different areas and  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:54):**  doing the market map and adding value to the ecosystem so I think it's a really friendly  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:21:59):**  model in the sense of trying to build this space and increase awareness around it so  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:03):**  I've really appreciated seeing that from you guys and working on a bit of it with you.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:07):**  I want to ask just you personally do you ever find yourself wanting to be on the entrepreneur  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:12):**  side like do you do you get the itch to start one of these companies and jump ship?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:19):**  No it's really hard.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:22):**  I have a tremendous amount of respect for the companies that we work with and we invest  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:27):**  in and boy the heartbreak and the you know the ups and downs are I just I don't know  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:34):**  if I could do it.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:35):**  I love helping them but boy I don't know if I could sit in their in their shoes.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:39):**  Having said that I actually have had a couple of opportunities to be a part of the kind  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:46):**  of more the operation side and I've enjoyed them very very much but all roads keep leading  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:51):**  back to sort of financial lens for me and at some point I guess in your career you kind  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:22:57):**  of you kind of say okay the world's trying to tell me something I should I should respond  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:03):**  accordingly so I'm extremely grateful.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:06):**  I had a brief stint co-founding a wine importing business looking at Argentine wines at the  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:13):**  time and the portfolio's grown since then and that was back during the 2008-2009 period  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:19):**  when investment banking all but dried up because as we all know there was a little bit of a  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:23):**  capital crisis around the world and so that afforded me a really amazing opportunity to  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:30):**  like I said co-found this business with with a business partner and and we sourced some  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:35):**  awesome wines from from Argentina and marketed them in the U.S. and built a nice little business  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:41):**  and I got to drink a bunch of wine for about a year and a half and then it was time to  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:45):**  get back to get back to investment banking.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:47):**  So between that and I ran operations and restructuring for a large software consolidator for about  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:55):**  a year and a half and that was a really instructive opportunity for me to sit on the other side  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:23:59):**  of the table and really understand operations and operations management and so being able  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:05):**  to kind of bring that lens back into the work that I do now has been has been I think a  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:10):**  huge value add for me and hopefully for the companies that I work with but yeah I think  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:16):**  I get just the right amount of entrepreneurial exposure with what I'm doing now but I don't  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:21):**  know I don't know that I'd ever jump across the table again.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:23):**  Well you never say never I suppose but yeah that sounds like you.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:27):**  Never say never exactly.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:28):**  I guess just in the market you we've emailed back and forth a little bit recently on on  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:35):**  Dairitech and on livestock what are areas that you're excited about or that you guys  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:40):**  at Better Food are excited about in terms of investing like where where's somewhere  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:45):**  that you think people should should be looking or maybe areas where they they shouldn't be  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:48):**  looking?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:49):**  Yeah great question so I am going to do a little plug for livestock tech because I just  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:24:55):**  spent about the last three or four months doing a really deep dive and it it actually  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:00):**  started off with a collaboration with the Innovation Center for US Dairy some conversations  
**[0:25:07-0:25:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:07):**  with them and just talking about how dairy technology was perceived where the adoption  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:14):**  curve is in dairy technology where what's working what's not working and it led to this  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:19):**  really intriguing deep dive where I've done dozens of interviews with producers and folks  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:24):**  in the support network around the dairy complex.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:27):**  I'll use broadly livestock technology but this kind of ended up going to more in the  
**[0:25:32-0:25:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:32):**  direction of dairy technology but it I came up with about 120 companies and and take a  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:40):**  step back so my coverage area it within the ag tech landscape is sort of infield and post  
**[0:25:46-0:25:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:46):**  harvest so infield automation robotics sensors imagery you know sort of anything that hardware  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:54):**  software applications that are used in the field and then post harvest supply chain logistics  
**[0:25:59-0:26:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:25:59):**  b2b marketplaces trading and finance technology so everything that kind of runs into about  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:06):**  distribution and then my partner Bridget Rosenheim picks up at the distribution point and covers  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:11):**  all things consumer facing in in food technology so food media meal delivery kits restaurant  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:18):**  technology sort of anything consumer facing so with that as a backdrop my livestock technology  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:24):**  landscape overview was really you know what are people using within the dairy complex  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:30):**  up until about the milk parlor and then from that point the process inside I didn't get  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:36):**  into that and I didn't really get into the genetics too deeply or nutrients or additives  
**[0:26:41-0:26:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:41):**  so that's kind of the backdrop of what I was focused on but I was fascinated by so on one  
**[0:26:50-0:26:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:50):**  hand dairy technology livestock technology faces the same sort of infrastructure challenges  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:26:58):**  that we see in the rest of agriculture you know lack of data standards no common operating  
**[0:27:03-0:27:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:03):**  system a lot of fragmentation etc etc but on the other hand what I guess I at some level  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:12):**  I knew this I just didn't put the pieces together the level of technology in the dairy complex  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:17):**  has been pretty pretty advanced as you compare it to other parts of even in something like  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:23):**  that's wearable that's been around for quite some time robotics in the dairy in the milk  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:28):**  parlor have been around so in dairy technology is the dairymen and dairy producers I think  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:35):**  are very much open to technology that works and that drives some value of course but it's  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:41):**  a it's maybe not as challenging of a sale the other thing that I found really sort of  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:47):**  intriguing about dairy technology is and again sort of lack of better words its ability to  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:52):**  one a technology company's ability to A B test I mean you're getting two or three milk  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:27:57):**  in the day you know 365 days a year and so to the extent you can fine-tune your technologies  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:04):**  you know if they're if they're measuring different things and and the sort of dairy workflow  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:10):**  you've got much more chances to understand how a tweak here or tweak there might impact  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:15):**  the performance of your technology so I think that's something that was really interesting  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:19):**  and then the other thing is just the size of the market you know talked about in specialty  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:23):**  you've got these very small fragmented markets and it's hard to attract capital and sort  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:29):**  of companies to focus on them dairy is huge and by and large you know there are different  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:34):**  ways that people run their operations certainly but the kind of basic basic workflow is fairly  
**[0:28:40-0:28:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:40):**  similar where just wherever you are in the world so I think those are things that people  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:47):**  should consider when they're looking at opportunities in this broader ag tech landscape whether  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:53):**  you're an investor or an entrepreneur that's looking for some white space I think that  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:28:58):**  there are that that's maybe a part of the market that's been overlooked so I'm I'm excited  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:04):**  and interested about around that right now I am particularly interested in some of the  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:11):**  categories of post-harvest and supply chain analytics we kind of had traceability 1.0  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:17):**  I think some years back and the next generation of food safety tracking and tracing is is  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:23):**  some is interesting we've got some enabling technologies now with blockchain that I think  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:28):**  are going to be really game changers there that's something to keep an eye on we're starting  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:34):**  to see more activity around kind of trading and finance you know maybe more creative trading  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:39):**  and finance platforms you've seen farmers business network have a play there again blockchain  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:46):**  could be a really interesting enabling technology around getting you know getting farmers paid  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:52):**  more quickly and and the authenticity of the of the payment flows so yeah that's that's  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:29:58):**  I would say where I'm spending a bit of my time right now and then of course in automation  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:04):**  as well I think the the sensors and the vision systems and the technologies around robotics  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:10):**  and automation are starting to come down in price the pain of labor is becoming more and  
**[0:30:16-0:30:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:16):**  more acute especially here on the west coast of the US and so I think we'll we'll start  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:24):**  to see more adoption in that category over the next couple of years so I'm excited about  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:31):**  what's going on in that part as well.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:35):**  And look I think that's so that's such a two things there one the view on actual spaces  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:41):**  and where to be looking and then the concept of white space but also how you think about  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:46):**  that in terms of the iterations you can get in terms of the size of the market in terms  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:50):**  of willingness to adopt and sort of tech saturation and tech familiarity I think those are really  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:30:56):**  like to you in the investment world obvious and how you think about the space but not  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:31:01):**  really lenses that I hear put on opportunities and really have to think about this space  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:31:05):**  very frequently so I think that's a really important insight for both entrepreneurs and  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:31:10):**  investors and then probably farmers to be thinking about as well in terms of what they're  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:31:14):**  what they're gonna see and experience so and I love that it's such a positive view that  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357341#t=0:31:18):**  there are so many opportunities in in this space so I think we might we might leave it

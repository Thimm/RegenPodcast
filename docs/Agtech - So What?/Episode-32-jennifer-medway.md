### Agtech - So What?  (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 11:44:37)
**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:00:25):**  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:00:30):**  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:00:35):**  ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:00:39):**  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where ag and tech  
**[0:00:44-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:00:44):**  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:03):**  Just a quick bit of housekeeping here. I know that some of you mentioned this and really  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:07):**  appreciate the feedback that the volume, especially for my audio in a few of the episodes this  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:12):**  season has been really variable. We've tried to fix that and so hopefully that sorted out.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:16):**  But please do keep the feedback coming. This week's guest is Jennifer Medway. She is currently  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:22):**  the manager for research and innovation at Agri-Futures Australia where she looks after  
**[0:01:27-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:27):**  research into emerging industries as well as ag tech. But Jen has a really varied career,  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:34):**  including being a farmer herself with her husband and her family, but also working as  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:38):**  a consultant and as a policy officer and really across the agriculture industry. I really  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:43):**  liked this episode because we got to touch on Jen's perspective and experience as a farmer  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:48):**  herself thinking about what technology to buy. And we talked through her buying decisions,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:53):**  really how they went about choosing what technology to buy and how that process differs or is  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:58):**  similar in agriculture to in other industries or just for regular consumers. We also talk  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:03):**  about technology during the drought and we touch on emerging industries. So things like  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:09):**  tea tree oil and ginger, really what is the future of agriculture look like from an emerging  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:14):**  industries perspective. I hope you enjoy this podcast.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:20):**  Good afternoon Jen Medway. Thanks so much for joining me on the podcast today.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:23):**  No worries. Thanks for having me Sarah.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:27):**  So I'd love to hear a little bit about your background. I had a ton of fun actually looking  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:32):**  you up on LinkedIn because you've done a bunch of things that I didn't know you had done.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:36):**  So I'm really excited to hear about them, but why don't we kick off with you telling  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:39):**  me a bit about your story.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:41):**  Yeah, no worries. So I am a fifth generation farmer from Gunning, New South Wales. And  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:48):**  basically my husband and I run a large-ish operation here as well as with my parents.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:54):**  We have about 17,000 sheep, mostly wool, but also crossbred, first cross lambs that we  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:01):**  turn off about three months. So basically sheep and sheep, we don't have cattle, but  
**[0:03:05-0:03:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:05):**  yeah, we really always grown up as a farm girl, as one of three sisters, three girls,  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:12):**  sorry. So yeah, very much farming's in my veins, I guess you'd say, which I guess that  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:17):**  led me to an Ag Economics degree at Sydney Uni, which was very interesting. And outside  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:22):**  of that I came, went to government actually. So I did about 10 years, less than 10 years  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:28):**  in the Department of Agriculture in Canberra. So I really did cut my teeth in the sort of,  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:33):**  I guess, government space, but always had that very much the lens of farming. And then  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:38):**  since then I've worked for farming systems groups. I have, and more recently I managed  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:43):**  research and innovation at Agri-Futures Australia, which is one of 15 RDCs looking after research  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:50):**  and innovation for the sector.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:52):**  Fantastic. So what's it like working with your parents? I think it's really interesting  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:58):**  to me because it's so normal in farming to have like multi-generational businesses and  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:02):**  people working together. I personally can't imagine working with my parents. So I'm curious  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:06):**  what that's like.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:09):**  Well the good news is my parents are not people that listen to podcasts, so I can be honest  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:13):**  on this one. Look, it does definitely have its challenges, but there are also some really  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:18):**  interesting and exciting things to work through, I guess, just not having to go through the  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:24):**  initiation phase of working with people and all that kind of stuff has meant that we can  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:29):**  really, I guess, delve into some opportunities and have that back up, I guess, and knowing  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:33):**  that if something goes wrong, we've kind of got each other's back. And I mean that in  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:36):**  a financial sense, but also in terms of, I guess, the way that we manage our businesses.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:42):**  So I do like to say that our businesses are separate in some way. So we do everything  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:47):**  together. We share at the same time. We help each other with drenching and all that kind  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:51):**  of stuff, but when it actually comes to the bank balance at the end of the day, we do  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:55):**  have two different businesses. So from that perspective, I guess it is collaborative to  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:59):**  an extent and we don't have some of those financial pressures that other families do  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:04):**  have. But being right next door to each other and, you know, as I said, you know, share  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:09):**  machinery and other things, it certainly does, I think, actually help in our case. I'm actually  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:15):**  really fortunate that my husband is very laid back and works very, very well with my parents.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:20):**  So from that perspective, from, you know, I guess from that working really closely with  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:25):**  people that you also are related to, that actually hasn't been a bigger challenge. But  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:30):**  yes, I've probably been doing that arrangement for the last 15 or so years. So, so far, fingers  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:36):**  crossed, it's all working well.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:39):**  That's awesome. And does your husband come from a farming background as well?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:43):**  He absolutely did. Yes. So he worked with, well, sort of worked with his parents actually  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:48):**  in terms of they sort of handed the property over. It's going to sound bad. We then sold  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:54):**  that property and brought a whole country around us where we are now. So from our perspective,  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:00):**  we've really been able to, I guess, have from both sides of it, we were born into this sort  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:05):**  of farming community kind of sense. So from our perspective, it's kind of been in the  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:10):**  blood. But, you know, even outside of that, it's something we're really passionate about.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:14):**  It's not a chore, it's not a job that, you know, we sort of think, oh, God, we're stuck  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:19):**  with it. For kids and things that would have been nice to have explored and got out a little  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:24):**  bit more, I guess. But, you know, it's hard to look back at the same time we've been for  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:29):**  relatively young people, I think we've done pretty well actually, in terms of growing  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:33):**  our business quite substantially. And I feel that that's really owing to the part that  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:37):**  we have our families, but our backgrounds and, and obviously, surrounding ourselves  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:42):**  with good people and in terms of business and finance as well.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:46):**  Has the industry changed a lot? You mentioned growing the business and, you know, some different  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:50):**  transactions you've done. How has the industry changed since like from when you were little  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:55):**  and your parents were farming in the last 15 years that you've been doing it? Like,  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:58):**  what are some of the big things that have changed or maybe, you know, not a lot has  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:02):**  changed?  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:03):**  No, a lot has changed. The big, the most obvious one for us, particularly in that growth phase,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:10):**  is we're in the golden triangle of sort of sheep production, and we're only less, well  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:13):**  about two hours from Sydney. So that has meant that for us to expand has actually been, and  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:18):**  I mean, it's across the board, so it's not just us, obviously. But in terms of being  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:24):**  able to afford land and, you know, in terms of working through the numbers, you know,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:28):**  it's a really big investment and something that can be quite scary for relatively young  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:33):**  people. I'm still putting myself in a young person category. And from that perspective,  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:37):**  we've had a couple of different business models to achieve that. So we've kind of used leasing  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:43):**  as a stepping block to, you know, buying properties and whatever else. So from our perspective,  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:48):**  it's been, I guess, I'm being fortunate with my economics background. I'm quiet, you know,  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:53):**  business savvy, I guess, and I'm not putting other people down in any way, shape or form.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:57):**  It's just a skill set that I enjoy and have. And I just know across the industry, business  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:02):**  vacuum is something, you know, managing multi million dollar industries, and people don't  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:08):**  always have a really good handle on their gross margins and things. And I see that changing,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:11):**  I see that, you know, people are kind of starting, I think, to the culture of really treating  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:17):**  farm businesses as a business rather than just the family situation. And that's what  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:21):**  you do. And I guess the other thing that I see has really changed is the technology and  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:28):**  the willingness to adopt technology and new practice. We happen to surround ourselves  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:33):**  through farming systems groups, benchmarking groups, whatever it might be, to really look  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:38):**  at opportunities to make our business better. I think those opportunities that we're taking  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:44):**  on a slightly different and I think the necessity to do things differently rather than just  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:49):**  better is kind of a constant in our world. And maybe that's just for our business, but  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:54):**  certainly I feel like we've kind of nailed the low hanging fruit. And for us, it's a  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:59):**  case of how do we, I guess, continue to get those, not just one percenters, but look for  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:03):**  those five and 10 percenters to really start to make an impact on our business.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:09):**  What's an example of maybe something that you've done differently and I'm equally happy  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:13):**  for it to be something that worked or something that didn't work, but an example of maybe  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:17):**  and through the farming systems group or any of the other groups benchmarking or otherwise  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:22):**  that you felt like it was a bit of risk or something that maybe not everyone would have  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:28):**  had a go with, but that you guys did?  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:30):**  Yeah, so one of the things that we got right into was looking at four different ways to  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:36):**  look at technology and for what purpose, I guess you'd say. So we've had some workers  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:42):**  sort of have issues and a couple of other things that have sort of really impacted our  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:46):**  business. And I guess from a production perspective, we really wanted to accelerate our growth  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:52):**  and not do it in such an incremental way. We just wanted to make those gains slightly  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:57):**  quicker.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:58):**  So from that perspective, we started to look across, well, is it workplace health and safety  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:02):**  we're doing things for? Is it to increase production? Is it to drive other gains in  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:07):**  the business? So we really started to look at what technology we could adopt or implement  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:12):**  into our system to help make those larger changes.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:16):**  And it was really fortunate, we were working with partners with MLA through their producer  
**[0:10:20-0:10:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:20):**  program to introduce some to work down the production kind of trait. We recognized that  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:28):**  drought and continual sort of climate variability was something that was going to quite, was  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:33):**  still going to, no matter what, we're going to drive a lot of change in our business.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:37):**  So for us to better prepare for that, we really wanted to have a better handle on increasing  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:41):**  our genetics. So, and also having a really solid understanding of our genetics so that  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:45):**  we could then really be quite clear on what are our top producing sheep, what are our  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:50):**  low producing sheep. So in times, we knew sort of where we needed to put our focus on  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:57):**  and where we really needed to drive gains in our business. And we set some really clear  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:02):**  goals, I guess, for that. And we're sort of just embarking on sort of achieving those.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:07):**  So it's still going, but within that, to achieve that, we actually ended up going down the  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:11):**  EID path, which is an interesting approach. It's becoming quite common practice in some  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:17):**  areas. But for us, we put together a really interesting program and invested quite heavily  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:21):**  in terms of block profiling, in terms of getting a lot of, you know, just a lot of objective  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:29):**  information to make better decisions on. So we invested in sheep handlers in everything  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:34):**  you could possibly do to read tags. We've got consultants in to help us pull together  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:39):**  programs. We just came off sharing, we have six weeks of sharing and we just ended up  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:44):**  putting about 700 hoggard ewes. We did all the fleece testing and did a lot of management  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:51):**  of those. And I don't think it's necessarily new technology that we were picking up. Obviously,  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:56):**  EID has been around for a very long time. But in terms of how we actually build it into  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:01):**  our business was quite new for us and to be really committed to that. Just the machinery  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:05):**  and whatever, yeah, it costs us a fair bit of money in terms of a fairly large commitment.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:11):**  But I guess from that perspective, that was one way that we could see that we could accelerate  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:15):**  just a lot of gains and that really is across the business. So we weren't feeding sheep  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:19):**  that weren't productive. We were really identifying the genetics that were really going to help  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:23):**  drive our business. And certainly in terms of better understanding and improving our  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:28):**  management practices in alignment with that was really important for us.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:32):**  Tell me about when you decided to go down that path. It's really interesting to me that  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:37):**  you were thinking about areas across the business that technology could apply and that's really  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:42):**  what we coach startups to do. Is it time savings? Is it labor savings? Is it on the financial  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:49):**  side? Is it production gains? Is it whatever else benefits it might be? I'm curious how  
**[0:12:55-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:55):**  you decided on going down this path and whether the way it's expanded to different handlers  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:02):**  and consultants and technology is what you expected. Did you set out a project plan and  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:07):**  execute on it or was it a bit like jump in and then things changed and got way bigger  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:12):**  or way smaller than you thought? Tell me about the initial decision and then how it's panned  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:16):**  out versus what you expected.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:18):**  Yeah, that's an interesting question. I think for me it was a lot of competing situations  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:25):**  all coming together at the one time. And there were little funny things actually like an  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:30):**  application round being open for us to think it through. Admittedly, I am in this world  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:36):**  a lot in innovation. I started to think, how can we innovate? And to be honest, the benchmarking  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:41):**  group that we're involved in has a lot of large players and they can drive a lot of  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:47):**  gains because of the size of the corporate ag businesses in the group that we're a part  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:52):**  of. And they can drive a lot of gains through efficiencies in terms of what they're doing  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:55):**  and they can trial things. And it won't make the biggest difference if something goes wrong  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:00):**  in their business. And for us it was like, well, it does make a big difference because  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:03):**  a $40,000 investment for us could make or break that year, I guess you'd say, in one  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:10):**  technology. So for us, I guess there were just a number of factors coming together.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:14):**  My husband was a little bit, he probably wasn't early on quite on the same trajectory I was  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:21):**  in terms of this being something that 150% needed to happen within our business. And  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:26):**  I say that because at the end of the day, I go off to work in an office and can get  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:30):**  away from it. And he's literally dealing with the everyday nuts and bolts of running the  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:35):**  properties and whatever it might be. So from him, it was like a bit of a, oh God, more  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:39):**  things to worry about. But when we sort of started to see the opportunities and started  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:44):**  to speak to people about the way that they had either used that technology or the things  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:50):**  that were making a difference to their business, he kind of really got excited about what that  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:55):**  could offer. So I guess from our perspective, we then just went off and spoke to people.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:00):**  And of course, as I said, the MLA producer led program was sort of around at the time.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:04):**  I've often been asked, would you have done the project anyway? And I think the answer  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:10):**  is yes. We were quite committed to the trajectory or the approach that sort of gone down. But  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:15):**  from our perspective, it just really meant that it was accelerated. We did it all well.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:21):**  We did get the help in at the right time. So we didn't just bumble our way, make errors  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:24):**  and then bring it back to the same point where we started at. So from our perspective, I  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:31):**  guess we did think quite well about the project. I did set it out quite comprehensively, I  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:36):**  guess. So it has expanded and expanded in the more we got into it, the more you're like,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:42):**  oh, well we better get that technology because that will also help the project. And then  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:46):**  something else pops up and, oh yeah, we better do that as well. And oh, why don't you do  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:49):**  block profiling? Yes, we'll do block profiling. So I don't think I had a very solid, a really  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:55):**  good handle, I guess, early on in terms of where the absolute start and end point could  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:02):**  be to then really assess, because everything just seems like an add on and add on and a  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:06):**  good idea, but at some point, at what point have you got enough information to really  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:10):**  make that decision you were trying to make? And the rest of it is just a nice to have.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:14):**  So from that perspective, we're probably hitting the peak at this point. I'm sort of viewing  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:20):**  it as a, okay, let's consolidate where we're at and then maybe potentially build on post  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:26):**  once we get some more data in and really figure out how we can start to make some decisions.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:32):**  It has been slightly timing, good timing in that perspective because we are literally  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:37):**  have been feeding sheep since January and I know other people have been way worse than  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:42):**  us so I take that with the absolute respect to those people, but it's really crazily dry  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:46):**  here at the moment. And I guess from that perspective, it's meant that we really have  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:51):**  had to be confronted by some of the questions now. I mean, we're already a couple of hundred  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:55):**  thousand dollars into this dry period in terms of feeding sheep and things. So we're already  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:00):**  starting about to really start to think through particularly around those genetics, right?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:05):**  Where are our worst performing sheep? How can we start to do that and really manage  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:09):**  that system a little bit better based on the information? We're probably about six months  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:13):**  too early with the data in terms of we just don't have wide enough yet to really make  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:19):**  some of those critical decisions, but the confidence it has given us to know that what  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:24):**  information we will get to make that better decision is quite, yeah, I'm excited by that  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:29):**  going forward. So we are going to have dry times going forward. We're not naive enough  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:34):**  to know that and so I feel like this project and what we've done and the technology that  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:37):**  we're implementing will put us in better stead for that. So from that perspective, it's given  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:42):**  us a lot of confidence. Just given the number of sheep we're now managing and the partnerships  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:47):**  that we're delivering, it's given us a lot of confidence to continue with that.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:51):**  It's super interesting to me what you said actually early on there about how you, like  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:56):**  one of the first steps you took was asking around and that's something that I think is  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:00):**  true in like consumers like outside of farming. If I'm going to buy a new tablet or whatever,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:05):**  I might ask some friends and colleagues what they're using, but I feel like it's even more  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:10):**  prevalent in agriculture. Like you want to kind of see that someone else has had to go,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:14):**  especially for technologies that exist as opposed to new stuff. You want to know what  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:19):**  other people have tried and whether it's worked and talk to the folks in your benchmarking  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:24):**  group or kind of get that firsthand perspective. Do you feel like that's like how much of what  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:31):**  you ended up implementing was things that other people suggested versus things you found  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:36):**  not through word of mouth? So it's interesting in farming. So we're not  
**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:41):**  directly competing. So through the farming systems groups and whatever, we found some  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:48):**  really key people, I guess, in our friendship group and industry experts and whatever else  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:54):**  that have been really generous with their knowledge. What we did find with this particular  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:58):**  technology, given that it isn't actually that innovative at the moment, actually, because  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:02):**  the technology has been around for a while, we were actually surprised by how many people  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:06):**  were necessarily going down this path. So it was interesting tracking people down, I  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:11):**  guess. And I think to an extent, some people are doing it, as we said, sort of what we  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:16):**  would have done a bit piecemeal and a bit, you know, figuring some of this stuff out  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:20):**  as you go. Whereas we had the luxury, I guess, of doing it all at once. So from that perspective,  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:26):**  I think that was really quite critical to how far we've come through the program. But  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:30):**  certainly, you know, I think farmers, if you find the right people, they are very generous  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:35):**  with their knowledge. And I think that the key to not duplicate and not make other people's  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:40):**  mistakes is something that's really interesting. At the moment, my husband and I are looking  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:44):**  at, with the dry times, going down more of a feedlot scenario. So this is probably taking  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:50):**  it away from the technology space. But looking at the feedlot scenario, and we've got a couple  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:55):**  of thousand crossbred lambs that we've got to keep alive and keep, you know, really,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:00):**  I guess, building weight and all that kind of stuff. And what we've found is that people  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:04):**  have been, you know, it's quite a tricky business, actually, in terms of the feed and, you know,  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:09):**  things can go pear shaped quite quickly. And we've been quite astounded by, and again,  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:15):**  in that case, we've been asking a lot of questions and speaking to good friends who we know have  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:19):**  been in that space. And everyone's been quite open, actually. It's not always the case.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:24):**  There's certainly, you know, farmers and people and I think society in general, there's those  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:28):**  people that like to keep things to themselves and keep those lessons learned and opportunities  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:32):**  gained to themselves. But overall, we've actually, if you go in with an open mind and, you know,  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:37):**  and be quite respectful about what you're asking and, you know, the information you  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:41):**  get, actually, we found it quite interesting and then people have been quite open. And  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:46):**  from that perspective, we just learned so much and it's been so critical in terms of  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:51):**  sort of where we've got to with the project. And obviously, if we go ahead with this sort  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:54):**  of feedlot type arrangement, you know, I think from those perspectives, you know, it's been  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:59):**  really interesting. And I guess from our perspective, we're saying, well, now we've learned some  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:03):**  stuff, we've made mistakes, and we've done things, you know, a bit differently or whatever  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:07):**  it might be. And again, we're more than happy to share those learnings as well. So I think  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:11):**  what comes around goes around is how we're approaching it. But certainly it's been quite  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:15):**  critical to us, I guess, the success we've had to date in those projects. So it's been  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:20):**  really interesting.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:21):**  I imagine that that works the other way too, where if someone like got burned by a provider  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:25):**  or by a practice or someone that like they, their bad reputation is going to get shared  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:30):**  as well, that it's going to be a bit of a, you know, we didn't have a good experience  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:34):**  with this person or this company and like kind of watch out to those stories. I was  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:38):**  gonna say rumors, but they're true to those stories get around as well.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:42):**  Yeah, look, I think most of the conversations focus on production practices. So this work  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:48):**  didn't add this in, don't add that in, use that nutrient, don't use that nutrient kind  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:53):**  of scenario. There's certainly, I'm not going to lie in agriculture, it's pretty small industry  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:59):**  really. And particularly when you get down to a local level, everyone knows everybody  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:03):**  and knows everything about everybody, which is an interesting concept for city people,  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:07):**  I think. But basically, I think, yes, look, there is a lot of stories around providers  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:12):**  and, you know, experiences that you've had with good, bad or indifferent people in the  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:17):**  country do rely on that word of mouth as a really strong endorsement for certain products  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:22):**  or for businesses or service providers, whatever it might be. And it doesn't take very much,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:28):**  I agree, it doesn't take very much for those relationships to be solved if, you know, if  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:33):**  a problem exists or if, you know, someone's had a bad experience. And I think people are  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:38):**  pretty pragmatic if it's a personal issue and, you know, they just don't get on or whatever  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:42):**  it's happened, if there's been an issue and it's probably from both sides, I think we're  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:45):**  pretty good on picking that up. Whether it's a genuine issue or a genuine challenge, yeah,  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:49):**  that does get around pretty quickly. So whether or not you choose to, you know, still try  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:54):**  it yourself, I think is part of the causes and depending on the products and the level  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:58):**  of risk, I think is where people sort of have a play that. But yeah, I certainly think particularly  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:04):**  in the positive sort of sense, you know, certain providers or products, if someone talks about  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:09):**  it, talks it up, then that's a fairly good endorsement. And generally, country people  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:14):**  are pretty happy to accept someone's word on something.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:16):**  Yeah, no, it makes sense. I wanted to ask, you mentioned the technology that you guys  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:21):**  did implement was pretty much existing technology. So like EIDs and things that have been around  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:26):**  for a long time. Have you had much interaction with kind of the ag tech startup scene and  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:31):**  did you look at any of those companies to kind of build out some of those production  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:35):**  games you were hoping to get?  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:37):**  Yeah, that's interesting you say that. So I would classify myself as InverterCom as  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:43):**  being a little bit in that world given my work with an RDC, where we actually do have  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:49):**  a fair bit of interaction with the ag tech community. I would actually be, it's interesting  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:54):**  that no, we didn't initially in the terms of the EID stuff, we weren't, it's the technology,  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:01):**  it's the same, sorry I'm going around in circles, but essentially what it's funny with agriculture  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:06):**  in that the model that we use to implement products and whatever it might be, is that  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:11):**  you get given an end result and that you purchase that end result, whatever it looks like, and  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:16):**  then you use that. So in our case it was through our farming systems group, well it's actually  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:21):**  called Merino Link. They had a deal on for EIDs, so we just bought the product and put  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:26):**  it in our ear to look for sheep's fears and away we went. We also worked quite closely  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:30):**  with Clipex on all their technology to make the whole process and the infrastructure around  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:36):**  our program work. So it's interesting now that I am in that world that we basically  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:41):**  just waited for an opportunity that, you know, a product that suited us and we used it. What's  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:47):**  really interesting is that through some other work, actually in other, there is a tag kind  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:53):**  of a company that approached us independently through some work I did in Melbourne and they  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:00):**  came and I was talking about our farm and what we were trying to do and they actually,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:04):**  we did have a conversation with them about potential, it wasn't tags, it was like a tracking  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:10):**  system, like a GPS tracking process. So yeah, it was interesting that even though I'm in  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:15):**  that world, I actually didn't think at that time to approach, and I didn't really have  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:19):**  access to, the companies that you would argue that, you know, there's a fair few startups  
**[0:25:24-0:25:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:24):**  in the EID space. We literally went down the traditional purchase and supply path, which  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:31):**  yeah, I hadn't really thought about that until you'd asked the question to be honest, but  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:35):**  we have had interaction with AgTech. Yeah, right. And it's, I think it's interesting  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:40):**  and good that you've highlighted that you do have a, I would say more than a foot in  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:44):**  this world. Like you, I mean, we've done work together in the AgTech space and you're very  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:48):**  much part of the kind of AgTech community in, to the extent that that even is a thing,  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:54):**  which I think it is, you know, in Sydney and Melbourne and all over Australia. So I would  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:57):**  say you are super familiar with how this space works and Agri-futures has been active. But  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:02):**  you also wear the farmer hat. And so I think like, you're such an interesting person to  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:06):**  talk to you because you do experience this world through those two lenses, like as a  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:11):**  investor in this space and as a funder of research and as a person advancing the ecosystem,  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:16):**  but also as a farmer who is a user of these technologies, does that ever feel like, like,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:22):**  does that feel like an advantage to you that you have both sides or is it kind of confusing  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:26):**  because you're like pushing it forward on one side, but maybe not confident in it on  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:30):**  the other? Like what's the kind of interplay of those two roles?  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:32):**  Yeah, look, I actually think of them, one of my biggest assets, and if you ask my MD,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:38):**  I'm often like, no, that's crap. That won't work in the real world. My personality, as  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:42):**  you can probably tell, and Sarah, I know you well, is not to take a back seat. So it actually  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:47):**  makes me super confident, particularly in engaging with industry. You've got that background.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:52):**  I know that you're one of them. And I definitely think when it comes to that practical element  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:57):**  is so critical because you can often get, you know, I guess sidetracked by the hype  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:02):**  around things, but the practical realities of farming and how that works and being so  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:07):**  entrenched in agriculture is quite, you know, I think a unique perspective that I do have,  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:12):**  I feel like this is a job interview, so apologies for that. But my world is very random. So  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:18):**  I literally jenching shape one day and then in a boardroom in a capital city around the  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:22):**  country, another to interacting with ag tech. And again, you know, it's quite, I think you  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:28):**  need to have those experiences. But I love it. And I think from that perspective, I'm  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:33):**  hoping, you know, that's a real asset I can bring, particularly in my world, which is  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:38):**  very much in the cross-sectoral R&D space where there is a lot of issues. I'm not just  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:42):**  in one particular issue. It's actually working across a really broad range, which is interesting  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:47):**  because that's the stuff I deal with almost on a day to day basis on the farm. So from  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:52):**  that perspective, it's definitely an asset. And I bring a lot of that to my decision making  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:57):**  rightly or wrongly. Obviously it's all very above board and all that kind of stuff. But  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:02):**  in terms of actually working through projects and doing that analysis and thinking through  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:06):**  opportunities, it's definitely the two, actually there's a couple of different lenses, but  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:10):**  particularly those two are really important, I think, to sort of some of the projects and  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:15):**  the ideas and things that have kind of come out, particularly working with in the R&D  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:21):**  space. Previously in government, it was a bit trickier. There's a very long chain of  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:25):**  command. But even in that perspective, I think it's really helping with debt.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:31):**  You're hired.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:32):**  Yes, thank you. There we go.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:36):**  No, I'm just kidding. Do you get it on the other side as well? Like because other farmers  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:42):**  in Merino Link or otherwise know that you have a lens into the kind of tech innovation  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:46):**  research world, are you therefore a more like credible source or do you get questions from  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:51):**  the ag side about the ag tech side as well?  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:54):**  Yeah, that's interesting. I get surprised how little the two worlds know about each  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:59):**  other. And I say that with the greatest respect because obviously they're, you know, one working  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:03):**  for the other and vice versa. I definitely get a lot, particularly in the R&D side, but  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:08):**  how things operate, who's who in the zoo, what the political sensitivities are and how  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:15):**  things are rolling through. I do get a lot of questions and commentary are all usually  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:21):**  positive and inquisitive, I guess. So I think from that perspective, it does definitely  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:27):**  go both ways. And I think particularly, I should comment on the board of the Merino  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:31):**  Link. And I do think that there is a lot of, a lot you can bring because it's quite a different  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:36):**  world. It's not that service, I call it service sector to agriculture because there's a really  
**[0:29:43-0:29:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:43):**  large service sector like government, agribusiness, R&D corps, industry orgs even to an extent.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:51):**  You know, it's a big world and it's quite complex. And I think that's a bit of a skill  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:55):**  that I do work across that in my role. My role is actually to work across all those  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:01):**  systems. So from my perspective, it's been, yeah, that's probably the biggest thing I  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:06):**  love is actually making those connections between the two because it's not a place or  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:11):**  an experience, I guess, that everybody has. So I guess, and that's not through design,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:17):**  that was literally falling into certain roles and I guess keeping being really clear though  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:22):**  around that farming side. And that's where my sort of passion is. And I guess the vision  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:27):**  is to help make an impact and a change. And I think it's cost, I'll eventually do that.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:32):**  But I think at this point, the one percentage you do see that in little bits and pieces  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:37):**  of making those connections of issues, people, opportunities, whatever that might be. It's  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:43):**  those connections, I think that are really critical for ag because, you know, essentially  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:47):**  we do produce goods, but at the end of the day, it's such a big network and the people  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:52):**  within ag are just as important as the production.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:55):**  That's definitely been my experience. I sort of tell people that I got into ag for the  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:59):**  environmental aspect and saw the potential of technology, but I really loved it more  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:04):**  than I ever thought possible because of the people. And I think that, yeah, that just  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:08):**  resonates with me so much. There's some fantastic people working in agriculture and that diversity  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:13):**  of perspectives in the production sector and the service sector and different farming systems  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:18):**  is just really fascinating. So I'm curious for you why, like tell me about joining AgriFutures  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:24):**  because I imagine you had other options and it's, you know, a different RDC in some sense,  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:29):**  because of the emerging industries perspective. So was it emerging industries that drew you  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:33):**  to this role or the kind of cross sector nature or yeah, anything else? Why were you, why  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:39):**  AgriFutures?  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:40):**  So that's a really interesting one and it's not as good a story as I think you were hoping  
**[0:31:45-0:31:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:45):**  for. So basically there was a gap in some people, they needed some support to roll out  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:52):**  the people programs. So because the people and leadership programs, which have got some  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:57):**  fantastic initiatives, most well known probably for instance, the Rural Women's Award and  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:02):**  the Horizon Scholarship, but they do a myriad of other things as well, which is fantastic  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:07):**  for leadership in agriculture. I guess the bigger question for me is why have I stayed?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:12):**  And that's because I've really found a niche in the National Rural Issues Program. I am  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:18):**  a, what's the word, it's something on the lens of expert in nothing, master of everything.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:22):**  It's something basically saying that I work across a million different issues. And I think  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:28):**  that's been really attractive to me. So I came from a policy background and I guess  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:33):**  through the program that I'm working in now, it really is that ability to work across and  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:38):**  collaborate and make those connections on particular issues has been really insightful.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:46):**  And I guess for me, it was quite surprisingly so interesting to me. So a lot of it is building  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:51):**  relationships with people, but I get to work on things like immigration, tax, water, we've  
**[0:32:58-0:33:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:58):**  got the $100 billion project, community trust, freight and logistics, carbon, trade, everything  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:05):**  you could possibly imagine falls into the program that I manage under the, I call it  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:09):**  an arena called National Challenges and Opportunities. And I guess for me, it's really given me a  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:15):**  breadth of opportunity, I guess, within that policy space to really, I guess drive some  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:19):**  real discussion and in agriculture, everyone, you know, just it's quite an emo, everything's  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:24):**  emotive. Everyone's just got a response because it's an emotion versus actually having that  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:28):**  underpinning information to drive better policy and regulatory decisions. So for me, I guess  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:34):**  that ability to help drive some of those discussions by just providing the basic and really solid  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:40):**  foundation of information has been a really exciting thing for me and something that kind  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:45):**  of really naturally fits within my skillset and obviously having that farming background,  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:49):**  the government and the R&D kind of connection has been something that I've been able to  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:54):**  leverage, I guess, to really expand that role and the ability, I work really closely with  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:59):**  the National Farmers Federation, with the Department of Ag and of course all the other  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:03):**  RDCs to really drive some interesting projects and some of them are quite large, some of  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:08):**  them are quite small. But, you know, as a whole, I think that, you know, there's a really  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:12):**  solid information base, a research base to make some really solid decisions in agriculture  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:18):**  by whoever it might be. So from that perspective, the question is actually, yeah, why did I  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:22):**  stay? And I guess that has nailed it. I love my job.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:27):**  I love that and I'm also a person who wears many hats and so I love like all the different  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:31):**  opportunities you're exploring and areas you're learning about. I imagine that like every  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:35):**  day you get to learn a new thing or deep dive on a new issue and that's really fun. What  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:40):**  advice would you have for someone who like might be listening and thinks that that sounds  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:43):**  like an amazing job and that I want to do something like Jen? What sort of been key  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:49):**  to your success or what advice would you have for someone who wants to kind of be involved  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:54):**  in a similar role? Yeah, that's an interesting question because  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:57):**  I've actually kind of thought about how the hell did I get here, I guess. And to an extent,  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:02):**  I think the advice is, probably knows, in terms of, you know, one opportunity sort of  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:08):**  leads to another and some advice I got given recently was the next role isn't necessarily  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:14):**  the one that will get you there, but it may, it'll just give you a new set of skill sets.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:17):**  And I guess from my perspective, the benefit of my background has been that because I've  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:23):**  had such a varied background and different experiences and has allowed me to really get  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:28):**  some really interesting skill sets, I guess from that perspective, it's been really valuable  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:32):**  to not necessarily pick one path and stick with it. It's been a bit of a, you know, to  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:37):**  and fro because obviously I've done some in between times, I've done some consulting and  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:41):**  some farming and, you know, so there's been some, you know, the combination of those is  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:45):**  kind of, for some reason, really nailed this job. But I don't know how that happened. I  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:50):**  don't think it's quite designed. It's just, you know, from facilitating to, you know,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:56):**  bringing projects together to doing the analysis, to identifying research questions. And I guess  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:01):**  the biggest thing is that collaboration piece about, you know, learning to work with others  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:04):**  and understanding their needs and being able to address them and to solve those, I guess  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:09):**  has been really critical for me. So I don't know if it's a particular piece of advice,  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:15):**  but certainly I guess that ability just to grab any experiences you can and develop as  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:19):**  much as you can out of it. You just don't realize what you're going to bring to that  
**[0:36:23-0:36:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:23):**  next opportunity.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:24):**  Well, I appreciate the honesty. It's always easy to package up things in hindsight and  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:29):**  make it look really like it was structured in a linear path to where you got to, but  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:34):**  often it's not. And it is a kind of culmination of those experiences. You mentioned that you  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:39):**  cover emerging industries. What's an example of something that you're really excited about  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:44):**  in terms of emerging industries? I imagine people don't know as much about, you know,  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:48):**  things like ginger or tea tree oil or some of the industries you cover. What's either  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:52):**  a commodity or a technology or a project or something that you're excited about in the  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:58):**  emerging industry space?  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:59):**  Yeah, so within AgriFutures, we've actually got a really unique mandate. So if you look  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:04):**  at the other RDCs like the Meat and Life of Australia, Australian Wool Innovation, even  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:08):**  Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, they're all obviously got very specific industries  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:12):**  and within that there's a level of complexity. They've all got different types of things  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:16):**  that they're dealing with and obviously in some cases, slightly different industries  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:20):**  within the sort of core group of industries, if that makes sense. That's badly explained  
**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:26):**  and grains will have barley and wheats and all those different sort of sub sectors of  
**[0:37:30-0:37:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:30):**  the same industry.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:31):**  For AgriFutures, it's actually a really interesting place to work because, and we're not a catch-all  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:36):**  in any way, shape or form, but what we do do is we have a really, I'm calling it business  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:41):**  development, new industries. We all fall into the same category of really driving sort of  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:46):**  new and small, I guess, to really, I guess, grow to mature and big. So from our perspective,  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:52):**  we've, over the last four or five years, I guess, but more recently since we've changed  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:58):**  from the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation to AgriFutures Australia, we've  
**[0:38:02-0:38:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:02):**  had a really big change in terms of our location, moving from camera to Wagga, basically new  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:08):**  staff because of that change and everything. So from our perspective, we've had the, I  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:12):**  guess, really fortunate opportunity to really refocus the business and start to really drive,  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:17):**  I guess, some change in terms of the focus of the organisation. And to be honest, we've  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:22):**  taken a very much commercial focus. So for New and Emerging Industries, and Duncan Farquhise's  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:27):**  name manages that area, he's in the business development portfolio of our organisation,  
**[0:38:33-0:38:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:33):**  we really look at, I guess, it's building industries for, five industries to $10 million  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:42):**  over five years. That's pretty much the goal of that program. So essentially, we're looking  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:47):**  to partner with New and Emerging Industries. And industries is a, back in the day, it was  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:53):**  specifically industries. We've taken a slightly more commercial pathway that, you know, it  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:57):**  can be, you know, businesses that will build an industry. So there's a little bit more  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:03):**  private, I guess, partnerships than we've had in the past. But essentially, within that,  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:08):**  it's given us a lot of scope to work with some really interesting new things. So camel  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:13):**  milk, who knew the new almond milk, I guess I'm going to call it. So camel milk.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:19):**  Have you tried it?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:20):**  No, I haven't. I need to get out more.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:24):**  It's really funny. Sorry to interrupt you. I was at an ag tech pitch event in, I won't  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:32):**  say where, recently and there was a camel milk company and the guy from the company  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:37):**  came up to me after I gave a bit of a talk about, you know, ag tech and why it's exciting  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:41):**  what's happening. And he came up to me and said, you know, good talk, but you need to  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:45):**  be much more innovative. Like all the examples you gave, you're really not pushing the envelope.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:49):**  And so I really think further out there and I just like, was like, yep, that would be  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:54):**  the camel milk guy telling me that I'm not as far out as he is. So I really appreciate  
**[0:39:59-0:40:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:59):**  that.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:00):**  That's funny. Yeah. So it's about building a legitimate market. So, you know, things  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:05):**  are, insects are another one. You know, there are some really far out things, but there's  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:10):**  some other things that are under our nose that we just haven't explored. So there's  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:13):**  a lot in bush foods. There's a lot of, Kakadu plums, the one most people know, but carobs  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:19):**  and there's a whole heap of other red claw yabbies and things like that. But, you know,  
**[0:40:26-0:40:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:26):**  most of them, it's interesting though, there's a lot that focus on that export market. So  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:29):**  looking at what demand is from overseas and thinking, well, can we grow that in Australia?  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:33):**  So that's a bit of a generalization. One thing that we do do, so that's in the new industry  
**[0:40:38-0:40:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:38):**  space. One thing that my program has, through National Rural Issues is we do a lot of horizon  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:45):**  scanning and again, the uniqueness of our organization compared to some RDCs can give  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:51):**  us that slightly longer lens. So that's sort of 20 year horizon, which, you know, can be  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:57):**  difficult when, you know, industry is stuck in the mindset of I'm dealing with issues  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:01):**  today. So we've got that benefit, I guess, of being able to have that sort of foresighting  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:07):**  quite far out view of the world. One of our projects that we did with Queensland University  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:11):**  of Technology is actually to data mine through patients and other things and look for opportunities  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:17):**  outside the sector, but also overseas. So for technologies that do have relevance to  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:23):**  agriculture that we haven't explored yet. So, Laoran, I never know if I said that right.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:29):**  Laoran was one that was identified a while ago, but there's things like solar retransmission  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:33):**  they come up with where you can actually grab sunlight from the other side of the hemisphere  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:39):**  and redirect it back down so you can grow things 24 hours a day. That's one that could  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:43):**  maybe come to agriculture. Personal analytics, you know, really seeing that mainstream, so  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:50):**  really understanding our workforce and where our risk factors are. So at any point in time,  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:54):**  they can spot tiredness and whatever. So that's something that, you know, could be useful  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:58):**  in shearing sheds, for instance, or people that are quite manual. Manual work to support  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:05):**  issues before they happen. You know, so there is, and I would encourage anyone that wants  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:10):**  to have a look at that, because it's really interesting to jump on our website and look  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:14):**  up the Horizon Scans and just to see, I think we've got, we're the sixth in the series,  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:19):**  and I think it just went online a couple of days ago, the last in that most current series.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:24):**  So there's probably about 30 to 40 technologies that are profiled and some are, if you're  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:30):**  talking about camel milk and looking far out and a bit random, that's your place to go  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:34):**  because there is some really interesting and out there technologies that may have some  
**[0:42:38-0:42:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:38):**  application to agriculture. But also some, like I said, the digital twin stuff, the virtual  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:45):**  reality ARVR for agriculture, it's actually not as far out as we think and we're doing  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:49):**  some work in that space of R&D corps as well. So yeah, jump on our website and definitely  
**[0:42:54-0:42:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:54):**  have a look at some, there's some quite interesting stuff to look at.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:58):**  That's awesome. I love the science fiction element of it, but also the, like that's where  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:03):**  the future is going for sure. And so getting ahead of it and starting to think about, you  
**[0:43:07-0:43:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:07):**  know, what could it mean for me? That's where the kind of magic comes in. And I know you  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:10):**  guys are doing a lot of that work, so that's really great. And it was a perfect segue into  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:14):**  what I want to end with, which is giving you a chance to shamelessly plug where people  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:19):**  can find more information. So should they go to, they go to like what website are you  
**[0:43:24-0:43:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:24):**  on Twitter? Like how can they learn more about the things you've talked about and your journey  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:28):**  as well?  
**[0:43:29-0:43:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:29):**  Yeah, no worries. So the best option obviously is probably hit the AgriFutures website, agrifutures.com.au  
**[0:43:37-0:43:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:37):**  is probably the best place. In terms of me, I feel like this has been the whole thing  
**[0:43:40-0:43:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:40):**  has been a job interview. So apologies for that. On LinkedIn as Jennifer Medway and Twitter  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:47):**  Jen underscore Medway. So I'm really happy to connect with anyone that has any interest  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:52):**  in anything I've talked about. And plus, as I said, that connector, you know, with the  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:57):**  networks across the various range of RDCs, industry, government, whatever it might be.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:03):**  If anyone wants to get in contact, please don't hesitate. I'm always basically door  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:07):**  open for those types of conversations. I do think our processes are becoming a little  
**[0:44:12-0:44:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:12):**  bit more flexible in terms of how we can work. I get so many opportunities and hopefully  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:22):**  everything we absolutely would. So there we sort of do have some guidelines, I guess in  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:27):**  terms of how we can support new and emerging industries, new tech, whatever it might be.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:32):**  Leadership, people, you know, we kind of cover a fair bit in AgriFutures. But certainly the  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:37):**  program I manage or the arena, I guess, national challenges and opportunities. Yeah, I just  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:43):**  jump online. Anyone that's kind of interested in anything I've said, have a look because  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:48):**  there's some really interesting research that's out there and really happy to connect.

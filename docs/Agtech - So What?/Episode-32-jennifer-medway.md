### Agtech - So What?  (2019-01-28)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:00:35):**  ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where ag and tech  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:03):**  Just a quick bit of housekeeping here. I know that some of you mentioned this and really  appreciate the feedback that the volume, especially for my audio in a few of the episodes this  season has been really variable. We've tried to fix that and so hopefully that sorted out.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:16):**  But please do keep the feedback coming. This week's guest is Jennifer Medway. She is currently  the manager for research and innovation at Agri-Futures Australia where she looks after  research into emerging industries as well as ag tech. But Jen has a really varied career,  
**[0:01:34-0:01:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:34):**  including being a farmer herself with her husband and her family, but also working as  a consultant and as a policy officer and really across the agriculture industry. I really  liked this episode because we got to touch on Jen's perspective and experience as a farmer  
**[0:01:48-0:02:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:01:48):**  herself thinking about what technology to buy. And we talked through her buying decisions,  really how they went about choosing what technology to buy and how that process differs or is  similar in agriculture to in other industries or just for regular consumers. We also talk  
**[0:02:03-0:02:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:03):**  about technology during the drought and we touch on emerging industries. So things like  tea tree oil and ginger, really what is the future of agriculture look like from an emerging  industries perspective. I hope you enjoy this podcast.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:20):**  Good afternoon Jen Medway. Thanks so much for joining me on the podcast today.  No worries. Thanks for having me Sarah.  So I'd love to hear a little bit about your background. I had a ton of fun actually looking  
**[0:02:32-0:02:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:32):**  you up on LinkedIn because you've done a bunch of things that I didn't know you had done.  So I'm really excited to hear about them, but why don't we kick off with you telling  me a bit about your story.  
**[0:02:41-0:03:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:02:41):**  Yeah, no worries. So I am a fifth generation farmer from Gunning, New South Wales. And  basically my husband and I run a large-ish operation here as well as with my parents.  We have about 17,000 sheep, mostly wool, but also crossbred, first cross lambs that we  
**[0:03:01-0:03:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:01):**  turn off about three months. So basically sheep and sheep, we don't have cattle, but  yeah, we really always grown up as a farm girl, as one of three sisters, three girls,  sorry. So yeah, very much farming's in my veins, I guess you'd say, which I guess that  
**[0:03:17-0:03:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:17):**  led me to an Ag Economics degree at Sydney Uni, which was very interesting. And outside  of that I came, went to government actually. So I did about 10 years, less than 10 years  in the Department of Agriculture in Canberra. So I really did cut my teeth in the sort of,  
**[0:03:33-0:03:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:33):**  I guess, government space, but always had that very much the lens of farming. And then  since then I've worked for farming systems groups. I have, and more recently I managed  research and innovation at Agri-Futures Australia, which is one of 15 RDCs looking after research  
**[0:03:50-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:03:50):**  and innovation for the sector.  Fantastic. So what's it like working with your parents? I think it's really interesting  to me because it's so normal in farming to have like multi-generational businesses and  
**[0:04:02-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:02):**  people working together. I personally can't imagine working with my parents. So I'm curious  what that's like.  Well the good news is my parents are not people that listen to podcasts, so I can be honest  
**[0:04:13-0:04:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:13):**  on this one. Look, it does definitely have its challenges, but there are also some really  interesting and exciting things to work through, I guess, just not having to go through the  initiation phase of working with people and all that kind of stuff has meant that we can  
**[0:04:29-0:04:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:29):**  really, I guess, delve into some opportunities and have that back up, I guess, and knowing  that if something goes wrong, we've kind of got each other's back. And I mean that in  a financial sense, but also in terms of, I guess, the way that we manage our businesses.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:42):**  So I do like to say that our businesses are separate in some way. So we do everything  together. We share at the same time. We help each other with drenching and all that kind  of stuff, but when it actually comes to the bank balance at the end of the day, we do  
**[0:04:55-0:05:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:04:55):**  have two different businesses. So from that perspective, I guess it is collaborative to  an extent and we don't have some of those financial pressures that other families do  have. But being right next door to each other and, you know, as I said, you know, share  
**[0:05:09-0:05:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:09):**  machinery and other things, it certainly does, I think, actually help in our case. I'm actually  really fortunate that my husband is very laid back and works very, very well with my parents.  So from that perspective, from, you know, I guess from that working really closely with  
**[0:05:25-0:05:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:25):**  people that you also are related to, that actually hasn't been a bigger challenge. But  yes, I've probably been doing that arrangement for the last 15 or so years. So, so far, fingers  crossed, it's all working well.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:39):**  That's awesome. And does your husband come from a farming background as well?  He absolutely did. Yes. So he worked with, well, sort of worked with his parents actually  in terms of they sort of handed the property over. It's going to sound bad. We then sold  
**[0:05:54-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:05:54):**  that property and brought a whole country around us where we are now. So from our perspective,  we've really been able to, I guess, have from both sides of it, we were born into this sort  of farming community kind of sense. So from our perspective, it's kind of been in the  
**[0:06:10-0:06:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:10):**  blood. But, you know, even outside of that, it's something we're really passionate about.  It's not a chore, it's not a job that, you know, we sort of think, oh, God, we're stuck  with it. For kids and things that would have been nice to have explored and got out a little  
**[0:06:24-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:24):**  bit more, I guess. But, you know, it's hard to look back at the same time we've been for  relatively young people, I think we've done pretty well actually, in terms of growing  our business quite substantially. And I feel that that's really owing to the part that  
**[0:06:37-0:06:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:37):**  we have our families, but our backgrounds and, and obviously, surrounding ourselves  with good people and in terms of business and finance as well.  Has the industry changed a lot? You mentioned growing the business and, you know, some different  
**[0:06:50-0:07:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:06:50):**  transactions you've done. How has the industry changed since like from when you were little  and your parents were farming in the last 15 years that you've been doing it? Like,  what are some of the big things that have changed or maybe, you know, not a lot has  
**[0:07:02-0:07:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:02):**  changed?  No, a lot has changed. The big, the most obvious one for us, particularly in that growth phase,  is we're in the golden triangle of sort of sheep production, and we're only less, well  
**[0:07:13-0:07:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:13):**  about two hours from Sydney. So that has meant that for us to expand has actually been, and  I mean, it's across the board, so it's not just us, obviously. But in terms of being  able to afford land and, you know, in terms of working through the numbers, you know,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:28):**  it's a really big investment and something that can be quite scary for relatively young  people. I'm still putting myself in a young person category. And from that perspective,  we've had a couple of different business models to achieve that. So we've kind of used leasing  
**[0:07:43-0:07:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:43):**  as a stepping block to, you know, buying properties and whatever else. So from our perspective,  it's been, I guess, I'm being fortunate with my economics background. I'm quiet, you know,  business savvy, I guess, and I'm not putting other people down in any way, shape or form.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:07:57):**  It's just a skill set that I enjoy and have. And I just know across the industry, business  vacuum is something, you know, managing multi million dollar industries, and people don't  always have a really good handle on their gross margins and things. And I see that changing,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:11):**  I see that, you know, people are kind of starting, I think, to the culture of really treating  farm businesses as a business rather than just the family situation. And that's what  you do. And I guess the other thing that I see has really changed is the technology and  
**[0:08:28-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:28):**  the willingness to adopt technology and new practice. We happen to surround ourselves  through farming systems groups, benchmarking groups, whatever it might be, to really look  at opportunities to make our business better. I think those opportunities that we're taking  
**[0:08:44-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:44):**  on a slightly different and I think the necessity to do things differently rather than just  better is kind of a constant in our world. And maybe that's just for our business, but  certainly I feel like we've kind of nailed the low hanging fruit. And for us, it's a  
**[0:08:59-0:09:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:08:59):**  case of how do we, I guess, continue to get those, not just one percenters, but look for  those five and 10 percenters to really start to make an impact on our business.  What's an example of maybe something that you've done differently and I'm equally happy  
**[0:09:13-0:09:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:13):**  for it to be something that worked or something that didn't work, but an example of maybe  and through the farming systems group or any of the other groups benchmarking or otherwise  that you felt like it was a bit of risk or something that maybe not everyone would have  
**[0:09:28-0:09:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:28):**  had a go with, but that you guys did?  Yeah, so one of the things that we got right into was looking at four different ways to  look at technology and for what purpose, I guess you'd say. So we've had some workers  
**[0:09:42-0:09:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:42):**  sort of have issues and a couple of other things that have sort of really impacted our  business. And I guess from a production perspective, we really wanted to accelerate our growth  and not do it in such an incremental way. We just wanted to make those gains slightly  
**[0:09:57-0:10:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:09:57):**  quicker.  So from that perspective, we started to look across, well, is it workplace health and safety  we're doing things for? Is it to increase production? Is it to drive other gains in  
**[0:10:07-0:10:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:07):**  the business? So we really started to look at what technology we could adopt or implement  into our system to help make those larger changes.  And it was really fortunate, we were working with partners with MLA through their producer  
**[0:10:20-0:10:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:20):**  program to introduce some to work down the production kind of trait. We recognized that  drought and continual sort of climate variability was something that was going to quite, was  still going to, no matter what, we're going to drive a lot of change in our business.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:37):**  So for us to better prepare for that, we really wanted to have a better handle on increasing  our genetics. So, and also having a really solid understanding of our genetics so that  we could then really be quite clear on what are our top producing sheep, what are our  
**[0:10:50-0:11:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:10:50):**  low producing sheep. So in times, we knew sort of where we needed to put our focus on  and where we really needed to drive gains in our business. And we set some really clear  goals, I guess, for that. And we're sort of just embarking on sort of achieving those.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:07):**  So it's still going, but within that, to achieve that, we actually ended up going down the  EID path, which is an interesting approach. It's becoming quite common practice in some  areas. But for us, we put together a really interesting program and invested quite heavily  
**[0:11:21-0:11:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:21):**  in terms of block profiling, in terms of getting a lot of, you know, just a lot of objective  information to make better decisions on. So we invested in sheep handlers in everything  you could possibly do to read tags. We've got consultants in to help us pull together  
**[0:11:39-0:11:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:39):**  programs. We just came off sharing, we have six weeks of sharing and we just ended up  putting about 700 hoggard ewes. We did all the fleece testing and did a lot of management  of those. And I don't think it's necessarily new technology that we were picking up. Obviously,  
**[0:11:56-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:11:56):**  EID has been around for a very long time. But in terms of how we actually build it into  our business was quite new for us and to be really committed to that. Just the machinery  and whatever, yeah, it costs us a fair bit of money in terms of a fairly large commitment.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:11):**  But I guess from that perspective, that was one way that we could see that we could accelerate  just a lot of gains and that really is across the business. So we weren't feeding sheep  that weren't productive. We were really identifying the genetics that were really going to help  
**[0:12:23-0:12:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:23):**  drive our business. And certainly in terms of better understanding and improving our  management practices in alignment with that was really important for us.  Tell me about when you decided to go down that path. It's really interesting to me that  
**[0:12:37-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:37):**  you were thinking about areas across the business that technology could apply and that's really  what we coach startups to do. Is it time savings? Is it labor savings? Is it on the financial  side? Is it production gains? Is it whatever else benefits it might be? I'm curious how  
**[0:12:55-0:13:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:12:55):**  you decided on going down this path and whether the way it's expanded to different handlers  and consultants and technology is what you expected. Did you set out a project plan and  execute on it or was it a bit like jump in and then things changed and got way bigger  
**[0:13:12-0:13:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:12):**  or way smaller than you thought? Tell me about the initial decision and then how it's panned  out versus what you expected.  Yeah, that's an interesting question. I think for me it was a lot of competing situations  
**[0:13:25-0:13:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:25):**  all coming together at the one time. And there were little funny things actually like an  application round being open for us to think it through. Admittedly, I am in this world  a lot in innovation. I started to think, how can we innovate? And to be honest, the benchmarking  
**[0:13:41-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:41):**  group that we're involved in has a lot of large players and they can drive a lot of  gains because of the size of the corporate ag businesses in the group that we're a part  of. And they can drive a lot of gains through efficiencies in terms of what they're doing  
**[0:13:55-0:14:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:13:55):**  and they can trial things. And it won't make the biggest difference if something goes wrong  in their business. And for us it was like, well, it does make a big difference because  a $40,000 investment for us could make or break that year, I guess you'd say, in one  
**[0:14:10-0:14:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:10):**  technology. So for us, I guess there were just a number of factors coming together.  My husband was a little bit, he probably wasn't early on quite on the same trajectory I was  in terms of this being something that 150% needed to happen within our business. And  
**[0:14:26-0:14:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:26):**  I say that because at the end of the day, I go off to work in an office and can get  away from it. And he's literally dealing with the everyday nuts and bolts of running the  properties and whatever it might be. So from him, it was like a bit of a, oh God, more  
**[0:14:39-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:39):**  things to worry about. But when we sort of started to see the opportunities and started  to speak to people about the way that they had either used that technology or the things  that were making a difference to their business, he kind of really got excited about what that  
**[0:14:55-0:15:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:14:55):**  could offer. So I guess from our perspective, we then just went off and spoke to people.  And of course, as I said, the MLA producer led program was sort of around at the time.  I've often been asked, would you have done the project anyway? And I think the answer  
**[0:15:10-0:15:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:10):**  is yes. We were quite committed to the trajectory or the approach that sort of gone down. But  from our perspective, it just really meant that it was accelerated. We did it all well.  We did get the help in at the right time. So we didn't just bumble our way, make errors  
**[0:15:24-0:15:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:24):**  and then bring it back to the same point where we started at. So from our perspective, I  guess we did think quite well about the project. I did set it out quite comprehensively, I  guess. So it has expanded and expanded in the more we got into it, the more you're like,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:42):**  oh, well we better get that technology because that will also help the project. And then  something else pops up and, oh yeah, we better do that as well. And oh, why don't you do  block profiling? Yes, we'll do block profiling. So I don't think I had a very solid, a really  
**[0:15:55-0:16:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:15:55):**  good handle, I guess, early on in terms of where the absolute start and end point could  be to then really assess, because everything just seems like an add on and add on and a  good idea, but at some point, at what point have you got enough information to really  
**[0:16:10-0:16:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:10):**  make that decision you were trying to make? And the rest of it is just a nice to have.  So from that perspective, we're probably hitting the peak at this point. I'm sort of viewing  it as a, okay, let's consolidate where we're at and then maybe potentially build on post  
**[0:16:26-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:26):**  once we get some more data in and really figure out how we can start to make some decisions.  It has been slightly timing, good timing in that perspective because we are literally  have been feeding sheep since January and I know other people have been way worse than  
**[0:16:42-0:16:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:42):**  us so I take that with the absolute respect to those people, but it's really crazily dry  here at the moment. And I guess from that perspective, it's meant that we really have  had to be confronted by some of the questions now. I mean, we're already a couple of hundred  
**[0:16:55-0:17:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:16:55):**  thousand dollars into this dry period in terms of feeding sheep and things. So we're already  starting about to really start to think through particularly around those genetics, right?  Where are our worst performing sheep? How can we start to do that and really manage  
**[0:17:09-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:09):**  that system a little bit better based on the information? We're probably about six months  too early with the data in terms of we just don't have wide enough yet to really make  some of those critical decisions, but the confidence it has given us to know that what  
**[0:17:24-0:17:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:24):**  information we will get to make that better decision is quite, yeah, I'm excited by that  going forward. So we are going to have dry times going forward. We're not naive enough  to know that and so I feel like this project and what we've done and the technology that  
**[0:17:37-0:17:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:37):**  we're implementing will put us in better stead for that. So from that perspective, it's given  us a lot of confidence. Just given the number of sheep we're now managing and the partnerships  that we're delivering, it's given us a lot of confidence to continue with that.  
**[0:17:51-0:18:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:17:51):**  It's super interesting to me what you said actually early on there about how you, like  one of the first steps you took was asking around and that's something that I think is  true in like consumers like outside of farming. If I'm going to buy a new tablet or whatever,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:05):**  I might ask some friends and colleagues what they're using, but I feel like it's even more  prevalent in agriculture. Like you want to kind of see that someone else has had to go,  especially for technologies that exist as opposed to new stuff. You want to know what  
**[0:18:19-0:18:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:19):**  other people have tried and whether it's worked and talk to the folks in your benchmarking  group or kind of get that firsthand perspective. Do you feel like that's like how much of what  you ended up implementing was things that other people suggested versus things you found  
**[0:18:36-0:18:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:36):**  not through word of mouth? So it's interesting in farming. So we're not  directly competing. So through the farming systems groups and whatever, we found some  really key people, I guess, in our friendship group and industry experts and whatever else  
**[0:18:54-0:19:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:18:54):**  that have been really generous with their knowledge. What we did find with this particular  technology, given that it isn't actually that innovative at the moment, actually, because  the technology has been around for a while, we were actually surprised by how many people  
**[0:19:06-0:19:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:06):**  were necessarily going down this path. So it was interesting tracking people down, I  guess. And I think to an extent, some people are doing it, as we said, sort of what we  would have done a bit piecemeal and a bit, you know, figuring some of this stuff out  
**[0:19:20-0:19:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:20):**  as you go. Whereas we had the luxury, I guess, of doing it all at once. So from that perspective,  I think that was really quite critical to how far we've come through the program. But  certainly, you know, I think farmers, if you find the right people, they are very generous  
**[0:19:35-0:19:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:35):**  with their knowledge. And I think that the key to not duplicate and not make other people's  mistakes is something that's really interesting. At the moment, my husband and I are looking  at, with the dry times, going down more of a feedlot scenario. So this is probably taking  
**[0:19:50-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:19:50):**  it away from the technology space. But looking at the feedlot scenario, and we've got a couple  of thousand crossbred lambs that we've got to keep alive and keep, you know, really,  I guess, building weight and all that kind of stuff. And what we've found is that people  
**[0:20:04-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:04):**  have been, you know, it's quite a tricky business, actually, in terms of the feed and, you know,  things can go pear shaped quite quickly. And we've been quite astounded by, and again,  in that case, we've been asking a lot of questions and speaking to good friends who we know have  
**[0:20:19-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:19):**  been in that space. And everyone's been quite open, actually. It's not always the case.  There's certainly, you know, farmers and people and I think society in general, there's those  people that like to keep things to themselves and keep those lessons learned and opportunities  
**[0:20:32-0:20:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:32):**  gained to themselves. But overall, we've actually, if you go in with an open mind and, you know,  and be quite respectful about what you're asking and, you know, the information you  get, actually, we found it quite interesting and then people have been quite open. And  
**[0:20:46-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:46):**  from that perspective, we just learned so much and it's been so critical in terms of  sort of where we've got to with the project. And obviously, if we go ahead with this sort  of feedlot type arrangement, you know, I think from those perspectives, you know, it's been  
**[0:20:59-0:21:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:20:59):**  really interesting. And I guess from our perspective, we're saying, well, now we've learned some  stuff, we've made mistakes, and we've done things, you know, a bit differently or whatever  it might be. And again, we're more than happy to share those learnings as well. So I think  
**[0:21:11-0:21:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:11):**  what comes around goes around is how we're approaching it. But certainly it's been quite  critical to us, I guess, the success we've had to date in those projects. So it's been  really interesting.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:21):**  I imagine that that works the other way too, where if someone like got burned by a provider  or by a practice or someone that like they, their bad reputation is going to get shared  as well, that it's going to be a bit of a, you know, we didn't have a good experience  
**[0:21:34-0:21:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:34):**  with this person or this company and like kind of watch out to those stories. I was  gonna say rumors, but they're true to those stories get around as well.  Yeah, look, I think most of the conversations focus on production practices. So this work  
**[0:21:48-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:21:48):**  didn't add this in, don't add that in, use that nutrient, don't use that nutrient kind  of scenario. There's certainly, I'm not going to lie in agriculture, it's pretty small industry  really. And particularly when you get down to a local level, everyone knows everybody  
**[0:22:03-0:22:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:03):**  and knows everything about everybody, which is an interesting concept for city people,  I think. But basically, I think, yes, look, there is a lot of stories around providers  and, you know, experiences that you've had with good, bad or indifferent people in the  
**[0:22:17-0:22:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:17):**  country do rely on that word of mouth as a really strong endorsement for certain products  or for businesses or service providers, whatever it might be. And it doesn't take very much,  I agree, it doesn't take very much for those relationships to be solved if, you know, if  
**[0:22:33-0:22:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:33):**  a problem exists or if, you know, someone's had a bad experience. And I think people are  pretty pragmatic if it's a personal issue and, you know, they just don't get on or whatever  it's happened, if there's been an issue and it's probably from both sides, I think we're  
**[0:22:45-0:22:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:45):**  pretty good on picking that up. Whether it's a genuine issue or a genuine challenge, yeah,  that does get around pretty quickly. So whether or not you choose to, you know, still try  it yourself, I think is part of the causes and depending on the products and the level  
**[0:22:58-0:23:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:22:58):**  of risk, I think is where people sort of have a play that. But yeah, I certainly think particularly  in the positive sort of sense, you know, certain providers or products, if someone talks about  it, talks it up, then that's a fairly good endorsement. And generally, country people  
**[0:23:14-0:23:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:14):**  are pretty happy to accept someone's word on something.  Yeah, no, it makes sense. I wanted to ask, you mentioned the technology that you guys  did implement was pretty much existing technology. So like EIDs and things that have been around  
**[0:23:26-0:23:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:26):**  for a long time. Have you had much interaction with kind of the ag tech startup scene and  did you look at any of those companies to kind of build out some of those production  games you were hoping to get?  
**[0:23:37-0:23:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:37):**  Yeah, that's interesting you say that. So I would classify myself as InverterCom as  being a little bit in that world given my work with an RDC, where we actually do have  a fair bit of interaction with the ag tech community. I would actually be, it's interesting  
**[0:23:54-0:24:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:23:54):**  that no, we didn't initially in the terms of the EID stuff, we weren't, it's the technology,  it's the same, sorry I'm going around in circles, but essentially what it's funny with agriculture  in that the model that we use to implement products and whatever it might be, is that  
**[0:24:11-0:24:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:11):**  you get given an end result and that you purchase that end result, whatever it looks like, and  then you use that. So in our case it was through our farming systems group, well it's actually  called Merino Link. They had a deal on for EIDs, so we just bought the product and put  
**[0:24:26-0:24:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:26):**  it in our ear to look for sheep's fears and away we went. We also worked quite closely  with Clipex on all their technology to make the whole process and the infrastructure around  our program work. So it's interesting now that I am in that world that we basically  
**[0:24:41-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:24:41):**  just waited for an opportunity that, you know, a product that suited us and we used it. What's  really interesting is that through some other work, actually in other, there is a tag kind  of a company that approached us independently through some work I did in Melbourne and they  
**[0:25:00-0:25:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:00):**  came and I was talking about our farm and what we were trying to do and they actually,  we did have a conversation with them about potential, it wasn't tags, it was like a tracking  system, like a GPS tracking process. So yeah, it was interesting that even though I'm in  
**[0:25:15-0:25:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:15):**  that world, I actually didn't think at that time to approach, and I didn't really have  access to, the companies that you would argue that, you know, there's a fair few startups  in the EID space. We literally went down the traditional purchase and supply path, which  
**[0:25:31-0:25:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:31):**  yeah, I hadn't really thought about that until you'd asked the question to be honest, but  we have had interaction with AgTech. Yeah, right. And it's, I think it's interesting  and good that you've highlighted that you do have a, I would say more than a foot in  
**[0:25:44-0:25:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:44):**  this world. Like you, I mean, we've done work together in the AgTech space and you're very  much part of the kind of AgTech community in, to the extent that that even is a thing,  which I think it is, you know, in Sydney and Melbourne and all over Australia. So I would  
**[0:25:57-0:26:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:25:57):**  say you are super familiar with how this space works and Agri-futures has been active. But  you also wear the farmer hat. And so I think like, you're such an interesting person to  talk to you because you do experience this world through those two lenses, like as a  
**[0:26:11-0:26:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:11):**  investor in this space and as a funder of research and as a person advancing the ecosystem,  but also as a farmer who is a user of these technologies, does that ever feel like, like,  does that feel like an advantage to you that you have both sides or is it kind of confusing  
**[0:26:26-0:26:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:26):**  because you're like pushing it forward on one side, but maybe not confident in it on  the other? Like what's the kind of interplay of those two roles?  Yeah, look, I actually think of them, one of my biggest assets, and if you ask my MD,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:38):**  I'm often like, no, that's crap. That won't work in the real world. My personality, as  you can probably tell, and Sarah, I know you well, is not to take a back seat. So it actually  makes me super confident, particularly in engaging with industry. You've got that background.  
**[0:26:52-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:26:52):**  I know that you're one of them. And I definitely think when it comes to that practical element  is so critical because you can often get, you know, I guess sidetracked by the hype  around things, but the practical realities of farming and how that works and being so  
**[0:27:07-0:27:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:07):**  entrenched in agriculture is quite, you know, I think a unique perspective that I do have,  I feel like this is a job interview, so apologies for that. But my world is very random. So  I literally jenching shape one day and then in a boardroom in a capital city around the  
**[0:27:22-0:27:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:22):**  country, another to interacting with ag tech. And again, you know, it's quite, I think you  need to have those experiences. But I love it. And I think from that perspective, I'm  hoping, you know, that's a real asset I can bring, particularly in my world, which is  
**[0:27:38-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:38):**  very much in the cross-sectoral R&D space where there is a lot of issues. I'm not just  in one particular issue. It's actually working across a really broad range, which is interesting  because that's the stuff I deal with almost on a day to day basis on the farm. So from  
**[0:27:52-0:28:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:27:52):**  that perspective, it's definitely an asset. And I bring a lot of that to my decision making  rightly or wrongly. Obviously it's all very above board and all that kind of stuff. But  in terms of actually working through projects and doing that analysis and thinking through  
**[0:28:06-0:28:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:06):**  opportunities, it's definitely the two, actually there's a couple of different lenses, but  particularly those two are really important, I think, to sort of some of the projects and  the ideas and things that have kind of come out, particularly working with in the R&D  
**[0:28:21-0:28:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:21):**  space. Previously in government, it was a bit trickier. There's a very long chain of  command. But even in that perspective, I think it's really helping with debt.  You're hired.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:32):**  Yes, thank you. There we go.  No, I'm just kidding. Do you get it on the other side as well? Like because other farmers  in Merino Link or otherwise know that you have a lens into the kind of tech innovation  
**[0:28:46-0:28:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:46):**  research world, are you therefore a more like credible source or do you get questions from  the ag side about the ag tech side as well?  Yeah, that's interesting. I get surprised how little the two worlds know about each  
**[0:28:59-0:29:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:28:59):**  other. And I say that with the greatest respect because obviously they're, you know, one working  for the other and vice versa. I definitely get a lot, particularly in the R&D side, but  how things operate, who's who in the zoo, what the political sensitivities are and how  
**[0:29:15-0:29:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:15):**  things are rolling through. I do get a lot of questions and commentary are all usually  positive and inquisitive, I guess. So I think from that perspective, it does definitely  go both ways. And I think particularly, I should comment on the board of the Merino  
**[0:29:31-0:29:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:31):**  Link. And I do think that there is a lot of, a lot you can bring because it's quite a different  world. It's not that service, I call it service sector to agriculture because there's a really  large service sector like government, agribusiness, R&D corps, industry orgs even to an extent.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:29:51):**  You know, it's a big world and it's quite complex. And I think that's a bit of a skill  that I do work across that in my role. My role is actually to work across all those  systems. So from my perspective, it's been, yeah, that's probably the biggest thing I  
**[0:30:06-0:30:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:06):**  love is actually making those connections between the two because it's not a place or  an experience, I guess, that everybody has. So I guess, and that's not through design,  that was literally falling into certain roles and I guess keeping being really clear though  
**[0:30:22-0:30:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:22):**  around that farming side. And that's where my sort of passion is. And I guess the vision  is to help make an impact and a change. And I think it's cost, I'll eventually do that.  But I think at this point, the one percentage you do see that in little bits and pieces  
**[0:30:37-0:30:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:37):**  of making those connections of issues, people, opportunities, whatever that might be. It's  those connections, I think that are really critical for ag because, you know, essentially  we do produce goods, but at the end of the day, it's such a big network and the people  
**[0:30:52-0:31:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:30:52):**  within ag are just as important as the production.  That's definitely been my experience. I sort of tell people that I got into ag for the  environmental aspect and saw the potential of technology, but I really loved it more  
**[0:31:04-0:31:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:04):**  than I ever thought possible because of the people. And I think that, yeah, that just  resonates with me so much. There's some fantastic people working in agriculture and that diversity  of perspectives in the production sector and the service sector and different farming systems  
**[0:31:18-0:31:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:18):**  is just really fascinating. So I'm curious for you why, like tell me about joining AgriFutures  because I imagine you had other options and it's, you know, a different RDC in some sense,  because of the emerging industries perspective. So was it emerging industries that drew you  
**[0:31:33-0:31:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:33):**  to this role or the kind of cross sector nature or yeah, anything else? Why were you, why  AgriFutures?  So that's a really interesting one and it's not as good a story as I think you were hoping  
**[0:31:45-0:32:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:31:45):**  for. So basically there was a gap in some people, they needed some support to roll out  the people programs. So because the people and leadership programs, which have got some  fantastic initiatives, most well known probably for instance, the Rural Women's Award and  
**[0:32:02-0:32:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:02):**  the Horizon Scholarship, but they do a myriad of other things as well, which is fantastic  for leadership in agriculture. I guess the bigger question for me is why have I stayed?  And that's because I've really found a niche in the National Rural Issues Program. I am  
**[0:32:18-0:32:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:18):**  a, what's the word, it's something on the lens of expert in nothing, master of everything.  It's something basically saying that I work across a million different issues. And I think  that's been really attractive to me. So I came from a policy background and I guess  
**[0:32:33-0:32:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:33):**  through the program that I'm working in now, it really is that ability to work across and  collaborate and make those connections on particular issues has been really insightful.  And I guess for me, it was quite surprisingly so interesting to me. So a lot of it is building  
**[0:32:51-0:33:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:32:51):**  relationships with people, but I get to work on things like immigration, tax, water, we've  got the $100 billion project, community trust, freight and logistics, carbon, trade, everything  you could possibly imagine falls into the program that I manage under the, I call it  
**[0:33:09-0:33:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:09):**  an arena called National Challenges and Opportunities. And I guess for me, it's really given me a  breadth of opportunity, I guess, within that policy space to really, I guess drive some  real discussion and in agriculture, everyone, you know, just it's quite an emo, everything's  
**[0:33:24-0:33:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:24):**  emotive. Everyone's just got a response because it's an emotion versus actually having that  underpinning information to drive better policy and regulatory decisions. So for me, I guess  that ability to help drive some of those discussions by just providing the basic and really solid  
**[0:33:40-0:33:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:40):**  foundation of information has been a really exciting thing for me and something that kind  of really naturally fits within my skillset and obviously having that farming background,  the government and the R&D kind of connection has been something that I've been able to  
**[0:33:54-0:34:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:33:54):**  leverage, I guess, to really expand that role and the ability, I work really closely with  the National Farmers Federation, with the Department of Ag and of course all the other  RDCs to really drive some interesting projects and some of them are quite large, some of  
**[0:34:08-0:34:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:08):**  them are quite small. But, you know, as a whole, I think that, you know, there's a really  solid information base, a research base to make some really solid decisions in agriculture  by whoever it might be. So from that perspective, the question is actually, yeah, why did I  
**[0:34:22-0:34:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:22):**  stay? And I guess that has nailed it. I love my job.  I love that and I'm also a person who wears many hats and so I love like all the different  opportunities you're exploring and areas you're learning about. I imagine that like every  
**[0:34:35-0:34:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:35):**  day you get to learn a new thing or deep dive on a new issue and that's really fun. What  advice would you have for someone who like might be listening and thinks that that sounds  like an amazing job and that I want to do something like Jen? What sort of been key  
**[0:34:49-0:35:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:34:49):**  to your success or what advice would you have for someone who wants to kind of be involved  in a similar role? Yeah, that's an interesting question because  I've actually kind of thought about how the hell did I get here, I guess. And to an extent,  
**[0:35:02-0:35:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:02):**  I think the advice is, probably knows, in terms of, you know, one opportunity sort of  leads to another and some advice I got given recently was the next role isn't necessarily  the one that will get you there, but it may, it'll just give you a new set of skill sets.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:17):**  And I guess from my perspective, the benefit of my background has been that because I've  had such a varied background and different experiences and has allowed me to really get  some really interesting skill sets, I guess from that perspective, it's been really valuable  
**[0:35:32-0:35:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:32):**  to not necessarily pick one path and stick with it. It's been a bit of a, you know, to  and fro because obviously I've done some in between times, I've done some consulting and  some farming and, you know, so there's been some, you know, the combination of those is  
**[0:35:45-0:36:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:35:45):**  kind of, for some reason, really nailed this job. But I don't know how that happened. I  don't think it's quite designed. It's just, you know, from facilitating to, you know,  bringing projects together to doing the analysis, to identifying research questions. And I guess  
**[0:36:01-0:36:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:01):**  the biggest thing is that collaboration piece about, you know, learning to work with others  and understanding their needs and being able to address them and to solve those, I guess  has been really critical for me. So I don't know if it's a particular piece of advice,  
**[0:36:15-0:36:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:15):**  but certainly I guess that ability just to grab any experiences you can and develop as  much as you can out of it. You just don't realize what you're going to bring to that  next opportunity.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:24):**  Well, I appreciate the honesty. It's always easy to package up things in hindsight and  make it look really like it was structured in a linear path to where you got to, but  often it's not. And it is a kind of culmination of those experiences. You mentioned that you  
**[0:36:39-0:36:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:39):**  cover emerging industries. What's an example of something that you're really excited about  in terms of emerging industries? I imagine people don't know as much about, you know,  things like ginger or tea tree oil or some of the industries you cover. What's either  
**[0:36:52-0:37:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:36:52):**  a commodity or a technology or a project or something that you're excited about in the  emerging industry space?  Yeah, so within AgriFutures, we've actually got a really unique mandate. So if you look  
**[0:37:04-0:37:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:04):**  at the other RDCs like the Meat and Life of Australia, Australian Wool Innovation, even  Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, they're all obviously got very specific industries  and within that there's a level of complexity. They've all got different types of things  
**[0:37:16-0:37:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:16):**  that they're dealing with and obviously in some cases, slightly different industries  within the sort of core group of industries, if that makes sense. That's badly explained  and grains will have barley and wheats and all those different sort of sub sectors of  
**[0:37:30-0:37:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:30):**  the same industry.  For AgriFutures, it's actually a really interesting place to work because, and we're not a catch-all  in any way, shape or form, but what we do do is we have a really, I'm calling it business  
**[0:37:41-0:37:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:41):**  development, new industries. We all fall into the same category of really driving sort of  new and small, I guess, to really, I guess, grow to mature and big. So from our perspective,  we've, over the last four or five years, I guess, but more recently since we've changed  
**[0:37:58-0:38:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:37:58):**  from the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation to AgriFutures Australia, we've  had a really big change in terms of our location, moving from camera to Wagga, basically new  staff because of that change and everything. So from our perspective, we've had the, I  
**[0:38:12-0:38:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:12):**  guess, really fortunate opportunity to really refocus the business and start to really drive,  I guess, some change in terms of the focus of the organisation. And to be honest, we've  taken a very much commercial focus. So for New and Emerging Industries, and Duncan Farquhise's  
**[0:38:27-0:38:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:27):**  name manages that area, he's in the business development portfolio of our organisation,  we really look at, I guess, it's building industries for, five industries to $10 million  over five years. That's pretty much the goal of that program. So essentially, we're looking  
**[0:38:47-0:39:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:38:47):**  to partner with New and Emerging Industries. And industries is a, back in the day, it was  specifically industries. We've taken a slightly more commercial pathway that, you know, it  can be, you know, businesses that will build an industry. So there's a little bit more  
**[0:39:03-0:39:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:03):**  private, I guess, partnerships than we've had in the past. But essentially, within that,  it's given us a lot of scope to work with some really interesting new things. So camel  milk, who knew the new almond milk, I guess I'm going to call it. So camel milk.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:19):**  Have you tried it?  No, I haven't. I need to get out more.  It's really funny. Sorry to interrupt you. I was at an ag tech pitch event in, I won't  
**[0:39:32-0:39:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:32):**  say where, recently and there was a camel milk company and the guy from the company  came up to me after I gave a bit of a talk about, you know, ag tech and why it's exciting  what's happening. And he came up to me and said, you know, good talk, but you need to  
**[0:39:45-0:39:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:45):**  be much more innovative. Like all the examples you gave, you're really not pushing the envelope.  And so I really think further out there and I just like, was like, yep, that would be  the camel milk guy telling me that I'm not as far out as he is. So I really appreciate  
**[0:39:59-0:40:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:39:59):**  that.  That's funny. Yeah. So it's about building a legitimate market. So, you know, things  are, insects are another one. You know, there are some really far out things, but there's  
**[0:40:10-0:40:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:10):**  some other things that are under our nose that we just haven't explored. So there's  a lot in bush foods. There's a lot of, Kakadu plums, the one most people know, but carobs  and there's a whole heap of other red claw yabbies and things like that. But, you know,  
**[0:40:26-0:40:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:26):**  most of them, it's interesting though, there's a lot that focus on that export market. So  looking at what demand is from overseas and thinking, well, can we grow that in Australia?  So that's a bit of a generalization. One thing that we do do, so that's in the new industry  
**[0:40:38-0:40:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:38):**  space. One thing that my program has, through National Rural Issues is we do a lot of horizon  scanning and again, the uniqueness of our organization compared to some RDCs can give  us that slightly longer lens. So that's sort of 20 year horizon, which, you know, can be  
**[0:40:57-0:41:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:40:57):**  difficult when, you know, industry is stuck in the mindset of I'm dealing with issues  today. So we've got that benefit, I guess, of being able to have that sort of foresighting  quite far out view of the world. One of our projects that we did with Queensland University  
**[0:41:11-0:41:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:11):**  of Technology is actually to data mine through patients and other things and look for opportunities  outside the sector, but also overseas. So for technologies that do have relevance to  agriculture that we haven't explored yet. So, Laoran, I never know if I said that right.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:29):**  Laoran was one that was identified a while ago, but there's things like solar retransmission  they come up with where you can actually grab sunlight from the other side of the hemisphere  and redirect it back down so you can grow things 24 hours a day. That's one that could  
**[0:41:43-0:41:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:43):**  maybe come to agriculture. Personal analytics, you know, really seeing that mainstream, so  really understanding our workforce and where our risk factors are. So at any point in time,  they can spot tiredness and whatever. So that's something that, you know, could be useful  
**[0:41:58-0:42:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:41:58):**  in shearing sheds, for instance, or people that are quite manual. Manual work to support  issues before they happen. You know, so there is, and I would encourage anyone that wants  to have a look at that, because it's really interesting to jump on our website and look  
**[0:42:14-0:42:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:14):**  up the Horizon Scans and just to see, I think we've got, we're the sixth in the series,  and I think it just went online a couple of days ago, the last in that most current series.  So there's probably about 30 to 40 technologies that are profiled and some are, if you're  
**[0:42:30-0:42:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:30):**  talking about camel milk and looking far out and a bit random, that's your place to go  because there is some really interesting and out there technologies that may have some  application to agriculture. But also some, like I said, the digital twin stuff, the virtual  
**[0:42:45-0:42:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:45):**  reality ARVR for agriculture, it's actually not as far out as we think and we're doing  some work in that space of R&D corps as well. So yeah, jump on our website and definitely  have a look at some, there's some quite interesting stuff to look at.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:42:58):**  That's awesome. I love the science fiction element of it, but also the, like that's where  the future is going for sure. And so getting ahead of it and starting to think about, you  know, what could it mean for me? That's where the kind of magic comes in. And I know you  
**[0:43:10-0:43:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:10):**  guys are doing a lot of that work, so that's really great. And it was a perfect segue into  what I want to end with, which is giving you a chance to shamelessly plug where people  can find more information. So should they go to, they go to like what website are you  
**[0:43:24-0:43:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:24):**  on Twitter? Like how can they learn more about the things you've talked about and your journey  as well?  Yeah, no worries. So the best option obviously is probably hit the AgriFutures website, agrifutures.com.au  
**[0:43:37-0:43:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:37):**  is probably the best place. In terms of me, I feel like this has been the whole thing  has been a job interview. So apologies for that. On LinkedIn as Jennifer Medway and Twitter  Jen underscore Medway. So I'm really happy to connect with anyone that has any interest  
**[0:43:52-0:44:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:43:52):**  in anything I've talked about. And plus, as I said, that connector, you know, with the  networks across the various range of RDCs, industry, government, whatever it might be.  If anyone wants to get in contact, please don't hesitate. I'm always basically door  
**[0:44:07-0:44:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:07):**  open for those types of conversations. I do think our processes are becoming a little  bit more flexible in terms of how we can work. I get so many opportunities and hopefully  everything we absolutely would. So there we sort of do have some guidelines, I guess in  
**[0:44:27-0:44:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:27):**  terms of how we can support new and emerging industries, new tech, whatever it might be.  Leadership, people, you know, we kind of cover a fair bit in AgriFutures. But certainly the  program I manage or the arena, I guess, national challenges and opportunities. Yeah, I just  
**[0:44:43-0:44:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:43):**  jump online. Anyone that's kind of interested in anything I've said, have a look because  there's some really interesting research that's out there and really happy to connect.  Fantastic. Well, thank you so much for joining me today, Jen. And I imagine that lots of  
**[0:44:56-0:45:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:44:56):**  people will be checking out those links because it's some really fascinating stuff and really  cool that you're across it and bringing both the ag and kind of tech and emerging research  perspectives. So yeah, thanks again for joining me.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357328#t=0:45:07):**  No worries. Thank you very much.  Thank you for joining us on another episode of Ag Tech So What.

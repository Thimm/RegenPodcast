### Agtech - So What?  (2019-03-14)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between Ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:00:35):**  AgTech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where Ag and Tech  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:03):**  This week we had two guests on again, Kelly Pearce and Tanya Kilminster. They called in  together from Western Australia and I think we were a bit better this time on managing  the three person recording. So hopefully that worked out really well. Kelly and Tanya share  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:20):**  a little bit about their background, so I won't give that to you now. But one of the  things that I really enjoy is hearing about how different people end up at the intersection  of Ag and AgTech. And you know, Tanya comes from a farming family and Kelly doesn't and  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:32):**  yet they both have kind of found themselves bridging the Ag and the AgTech worlds nowadays,  which is a really great story. And I also love how their journey into the AgTech side  of things has helped them develop more empathy around what it's like to build software and  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:50):**  build technology, but also the needs of the users and just how important it is to have  the agriculture community involved early and often in AgTech. So I won't spoil any more  now. I'll let you hear it from Kelly and Tanya and hope you enjoy the episode.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:04):**  Hey, Tanya and Kelly, thanks so much for joining me on the podcast today.  Hi Sarah. Hi Sarah. Great to be here.  So I want to start with you, Kelly. I'll have you both give a little bit of your backgrounds,  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:17):**  but Kelly, tell me a little bit about yourself and your current role and actually the many  hats that you wear.  Yeah, look, I do wear a few hats. Look, I've got a background in agricultural research.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:28):**  I have a PhD and 15 years or so of experience working in research with different IDCs and  CRCs and borer groups. But over the last sort of 10 years, I've been farming in the wheat  belt, Western Australia, about two and a half hours south-east of Perth with my husband  
**[0:02:47-0:02:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:47):**  Alan and I've got two little kids and we're broadacre cropping and sheep producers. I  still have a few off-farm work interests and board roles. I've got a few board commitments  with different industry and groups and cooperative sector. And yeah, look, it's certainly an  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:04):**  interesting challenge and Tanya faces the same thing of balancing our professional careers  and our family and our farms as well.  What is your approach to balancing that? I'm sure it's less of a strategic approach and  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:18):**  more of like just keep all the balls in the air, but to the extent that maybe that's just  me, to the extent that you do have an approach to it, how do you think about balancing those  things?  
**[0:03:29-0:03:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:29):**  I've got a very supportive family. I'm really fortunate that I suppose over the last 15  years we've developed good networks and contacts. So it's not too complicated. I certainly need  help around the farm from time to time and with the kids. So I'm not afraid to ask for  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:48):**  help is probably what I'm trying to say.  Yeah, that's a good one. You mentioned the kind of research roles and being on boards.  How did you get involved? Tell me about kind of deciding to do your PhD, what you did your  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:02):**  PhD in and how you ended up in first the research world.  Look, I've got an Ag Science degree and did my PhD with the CSIRO. What was the salinity  CRC way back in the day? I've always loved science. It was something I wanted to focus  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:20):**  on at uni. Going into science and agricultural sciences is a really exciting field. Moving  I guess to the country and farming, it's a little bit more complicated to be able to  continue those roles. So the opportunities came up to take on more board roles and have  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:36):**  more of an impact and input to industry in those areas. I've had a bit more experience  with cooperative boards and I've really enjoyed that experience.  One of the things I've noticed and it could just be me, but I feel like in Ag there are  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:55):**  a lot of boards, like there's a lot of governance. I think that's true in other sectors, but  there's a lot of kind of emphasis on governance in Ag. What's your take on, is it particularly  necessary in Ag or is it just that's how we kind of get a lot of stakeholder involvement  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:11):**  because people are in a lot of different places or what's your, maybe I'm just overemphasizing  how much there is. What are your thoughts? Governance, I mean that's a fairly sort of  critical thing to ensure that we're actually achieving the outcomes that we want to achieve.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:31):**  Boards can vary from a Grower Group board, which is about ensuring that we're delivering  good regional R&D to our local community. Whereas, I've been on company boards where  governance is about ensuring the financial security of the organization. It just sort  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:48):**  of varies how you answer that question, but I'm really not answering this question very  well Sarah. No, that's all right. Why do you like to be on the boards? Obviously, it's  one of the opportunities for you. Do you see it as a good, it's obviously important to  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:02):**  make sure that the outcomes are achieved as you said. I imagine it's also good networking,  you get to learn things about different sectors, you get to meet different people. There's  probably some other benefits too. I guess where my head's at is recently, I'm on the  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:16):**  board of the Future Farmers Network and we've been talking about some of the benefits of  being involved in membership organizations and the benefits to young people and getting  involved in various more formal groups in agriculture. That's kind of where my head  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:30):**  was at is, why would someone like you get involved in something like this? What are  the benefits and why it's important for the industry to have some of these structures?  I mean, certainly it's really important to have that diversity of thought and opinion  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:43):**  coming into these organizations. I guess for me personally being involved, I'm on the farm,  for a farming business to run and a family and off-farm work commitments and being on  a board is a way of contributing to industry in a really positive way. It can really make  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:02):**  a difference if you do it correctly.  Yeah. Cool. Did you grow up on a farm?  No. No, I grew up in the northwest of Australia. So yeah, it's certainly coming into the science  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:15):**  field and ag science is a life-changing move.  Yeah. How did you choose ag science if you didn't grow up on a farm?  Well, I've always enjoyed science at school, so it was a natural fit for me to either choose  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:34):**  a medical or an agricultural field and I chose ag and made the right decision.  Okay. This is my last question for you as I just pepper you here with questions before  I go to Tanya. A lot of people have studied ag science and this is again maybe a stupid  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:49):**  question but what do you study in ag science? There's so many scientific aspects of ag.  I can't imagine you could do plant science and animal science and there's a million things  you could be digging into. What's the generic ag science degree cover?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:02):**  Well, I mean every uni that has it would have a different degree but I mean I went through  the University of Western Australia which at the time and still now has a strong agronomy,  soil science and ag economics and animal science components to it and I tended to go more down  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:20):**  the animal science component. My PhD was very livestock systems focused and the majority  of my research has been within livestock systems. So every uni would have their different focus  depending on who their academics are sometimes. Fair enough. That sounds like most other degrees  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:39):**  I suppose. All right, Tanya, tell me about yourself and the kind of multiple hats that  you wear as well. Okay. After you've grilled Kelly.  Yeah, are you nervous now? Yeah, it's my turn. So look, I am a born and  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:52):**  bred wheat belt WA girl, one of three daughters from a farming family in a little town called  Bruce Rock and that's about 250 kilometres east of Perth and yeah basically I did all  my schooling locally and then I went off to Perth to study a science degree and a bit  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:10):**  like Kelly, like I loved science but I at the time certainly didn't see myself in agriculture.  I felt that I had, I don't know, something bigger and something bigger. I don't know.  At the time of, you know, being a 17 year old, I didn't perhaps value their agricultural  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:28):**  industry like I do now, like you know that whole growing up thing. So I just wanted to  do science and I definitely wanted to go down that path of animal science and then yeah  I got my degree in microbiology with honours and then I went and worked for CSIRO but Kelly  
**[0:09:44-0:09:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:44):**  and my path didn't cross in our careers until, you know, probably I finished at CSIRO and  then Kelly came in just after me. But I went backpacking for a bit and then my boyfriend  and I decided we'd come home to his family farm which I think our parents were all happy  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:02):**  about because that was next door to my farm. So we went back to the family farm to his  and within weeks of me getting off an aeroplane I walked into the local Department of Agriculture  through the state government in a town called Merredin which is just up the road and is  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:18):**  the bigger regional centre and I managed to get a job just as a technical officer and  then I applied for their graduate program and I was successful and then for the last  18 years I've been based in Merredin as a farming systems development officer and over  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:34):**  that time my roles have sort of varied over time but I've really worked strongly in the  sheep industry in terms of production systems, traditional extension and really trying to  find ways of, you know, improving the productivity of our livestock systems, how we use sheep  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:54):**  in a sense of good rotational value to the business or to the farming system and how  we might use them for risk mitigation in our sort of complex low rainfall sort of environment  that we're in in this sort of region of WA. So I guess that's sort of where I've been  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:11):**  and then I guess the last decade and why I've sort of moved into this space is that in the  last decade we've really had some challenges from both the climate and a commerce point  of view that we're having drier winters so we really have from an economic point of view  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:27):**  every decision we make has to be like really critically thought out. If we miss a seeding  opportunity that could really pay at the end of the year, you know, if we have lack of  rain or, you know, or how we've done our fertiliser decisions. So in that whole farming system  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:43):**  sense we really need to utilise the data that's available to us to make much more informed  decisions and from about 2010 onwards we've had some really real doozies of seasons and  so farmers have really challenged us as a department not to ask for help in a handout  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:00):**  but ask for really good economic systems and financial literacy and now in this digital  space to really help with finding those solutions. So, you know, we work with a couple of really  strong rural groups out of the Merredin district and more further east and we are working with,  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:19):**  you know, utilising digital technologies in terms of IoT devices, improving our connectivity  across the region so we've actually got broadband internet access and really honing in on the  new technologies to, again, those data driven decisions.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:37):**  Wow, okay, a lot there. A couple of things I want to back up and dig into. So where did  you go backpacking?  Oh, well, we started in Africa and we moved from the south up through to, we got to about  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:50):**  Kenya backpacking and, you know, just catching crazy transport and then flew across to Egypt  and then from there Turkey, Eastern Europe, the UK, a bit of Western Europe, UK and then  America on the way home.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:05):**  Yeah, it was obviously your favourite.  No, Turkey is still my favourite. I love Turkey. Yeah, go back.  Good for you. And so what was the decision to come back on farming and I guess more,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:18):**  like tell me about when you went from sort of not appreciating Ag as much as you said  to kind of building that appreciation that you have for it now. Was there like a moment  that kind of changed it? Was it part of coming back to the farm or?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:30):**  Yeah, I think it was funny because my husband is like a boilermaker or welder by trade and  so he did that before going back to the farm and in his mid-twenties he was like, yeah,  I want to be farming and I was like, are you sure? Because mining industry is, you know,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:46):**  quite, quite, if we could go there, we could go where Kelly's from and you know, earn lots  of money and he goes, no, I really want to be a farmer. So yeah, it was kind of after  working for the department and I think being able to use my skills obviously and what I  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:02):**  realised even though I trained in the very technical space, I realised soon that I was  actually very much a people person and being a development officer and in the work of extension  and change management, I really felt, oh, I can be an advocate for agriculture and still  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:19):**  do good science. So I had the best of both worlds. I had good technical skills, but I  love working people and trying to make positive change. So I think it was not an epiphany  moment, but it was just that slow burn of really appreciating the industry we're in.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:35):**  And then back with our whole farming thing with my husband, we're now in our fifth production  season of going through succession. And so we farm my farm and half of my husband's original  family farm. So we've joined as one entity now and like I say, our fifth production year.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:54):**  And I think that has been a great foundation for me to really challenge what we know as  ag and why tech has got such a valuable role going forward because I'm always looking for  efficiencies, trying to save money, trying to make sure our inputs are cost effective  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:14):**  and utilise the data. Because we do, we generate lots and lots of data and often it sits there  in a data card or just not even really looked at. And I think it's there, we just need to  grab it and use it.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:30):**  Do you ever find that that statement is controversial? There's kind of some people who, and I'm simplifying  the world, but some people who would say the same thing, like this data is really useful,  we need to be using it. And others who are like, we have all this data, but it's definitely  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:44):**  not useful yet. Like I don't see why it's useful or I can't get any use out of it and  it's not clear to me why we're collecting it. Do you think that's like a spectrum of  views there or are there reasons why you'd think one or the other or is it certain types  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:56):**  of data? Kind of, I feel like it's starting to be said a lot, I guess this, we need to  collect more data, we need to use it to make better decisions. And that's, everyone's sort  of saying that, but I guess go a level deeper, like why is that important and kind of is  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:09):**  it important for everyone?  Yeah. And I think often it's localized data for your business. So what's going to make  a big difference in your business? And so I'll just, for an example, if I had a soil  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:20):**  moisture probe on my property, the data that I'm getting at that very localized area or  the weather station that's involved with that, that can help me make really good decisions  about seed time of seeding or the soil nutrition in terms of what fertilizers I might apply.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:37):**  So I think because, and that could be, that's real time. And so I can make those real time  decisions, but then if I start collecting that data over time, I can start seeing changes  in the seasons. I can see how in my different crop types that it might have a lesser effect  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:53):**  in some years and a better effect in others, or you throw it out the window and say, well,  that didn't work at all. But at least if you're starting to collect over time, that's the  bit we're not, I don't think we're quite there yet because the data might be there, but we're  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:09):**  possibly not analyzing it over time yet. And then to be able to see those trends and then  make even more informed decisions. So I think, I think I wouldn't sit on that side of the  fence saying there's all this data and we don't need to collect anymore. I think the  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:25):**  collection's often happening anyway, so let's use what's there and get the good, like we  know some good data scientists that really could hone their skills into this area and  start developing better algorithms. So for that predictive type work that I think going  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:41):**  forward, particularly when we look at climate change and the drop in rainfall for winter  out here, if we can start making better predictions based on that, then we're going to make much  more cost effective decisions. It's interesting. One of the kind of points  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:56):**  in there is the new types of skills you might need to use that data. So like data science  or obviously you get into machine learning and artificial intelligence and kind of more  and different skill sets. Do you see more people with those kinds of skill sets kind  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:10):**  of coming into the industry or working on the research side or is that still a gap?  I think, and it's very new. I would never even provided an opinion on this probably  a year ago, but just in talking to different software developers and people in this sort  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:26):**  of IT world, they're saying they can't fulfill the job opportunities that are there with  the amount of graduates that exist. So I think it's probably a massive gap, but then I think  we have a role in saying, well, we can't just say, let's all go out and get a data science  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:44):**  degree or a computer science degree. You need to be going within the Ag faculty perhaps.  We need to have those really strong data science subjects or even a core major in a degree  maybe. So I think if you can start getting the right people trained up with those skills,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:02):**  but it is specifically for Ag for another area, then that would be a good thing for  the industry. So I think it is a gap and it's a huge opportunity.  So you guys are going to both convince your kids to become data scientists then?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:17):**  Yeah, it's funny you say that because they learn coding from about year one at school  now. They are coding. And my oldest child, he's a bit like, oh, it's so boring. Like,  no, no, it's the future. It's not for everybody obviously. And that's the good thing about  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:33):**  life that you find what you love. But if you've got some background in that, they're going  to be so much more ahead of what we are. Like Kelly and I are just learning, we're on the  periphery of this. And if you learned it from the age of six, it's going to be natural.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:50):**  So it's going to be great for them. Yeah, sure. So I want to ask about kind of  your journey into more of the Ag tech side of things. And you mentioned sort of your  perspective changing a year ago. The reason I obviously get to know you guys is because  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:01):**  of your initial, what I would call a tech scan. Like you went out looking at a bunch  of different technology products for the kind of mixed farming systems and we're largely  not happy with what you found. So, um, maybe Kelly first, tell me a little bit about that  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:15):**  journey, kind of how you started down that path and what you found.  Well, I guess, uh, you know, I was really interested in how within my farming business  I could better use my, my farm data and seek sort of more real time business intelligence  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:29):**  really around that. So, you know, I started this sort of transition within my business  to more cloud accounting and Patek activity recording and reporting, um, and got really  frustrated quickly. It was a lot of hype and kindness out there, but the reality of what  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:45):**  was being delivered by industry. Um, and I even dabbled in a bit of programming, believe  it or not, um, to try and achieve some of the outcomes to get my, um, my dream, dream  goal. And  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:56):**  you must've been really frustrated to kind of pick up programming yourself. Like most,  you know, consumers wouldn't do that in the world, no matter how frustrated they are with  a tool. You must've been really frustrated.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:05):**  I'm still frustrated. I just don't have the time. Um, so a group of us, uh, you know,  we went to the digital ag collective. Um, we went to Sydney and we put a call out there.  Um, any data scientists, analysts, it experts come and meet with a group of Western Australian  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:23):**  producers who are really interested in pursuing technology for data integration and business  intelligence. And we were overwhelmed with response. And, uh, we had a, you know, we  went to this meeting, we organized it, we initiated it and we had some really clear  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:39):**  goals as to what we wanted to achieve there. Um, but you know, it's sort of, it was just  quite an incredible experience when you put a group of passionate producers in a room  with these really clever, smart people, what you could actually achieve. And, but the challenge  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:57):**  is how to create those feedback systems and incentives, um, to, to make this world go  round better. This data, this data, data chain. Um, so the kind of big, sorry to interrupt  you Kelly, is that the kind of big problem you were seeking to solve was this data chain,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:15):**  like things don't talk to each other. Was that kind of the main problem you were looking  to solve? Yep. I mean, I guess is this, we're collecting so much data, it's not integrating,  you know, any attempts, uh, to integrate data are being done by commercial players for commercial  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:31):**  gain. It's not agnostic. You're tied into particular programs. I mean, I use different  accounting programs to what Tanya uses, for example, and we don't want as an industry  to be tied into one, one program. And I guess what's frustrated me all along is knowing  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:45):**  that there's tech out there, you know, there's the platforms, there's the tools, you know,  that allow data to be pulled in and integrated and multiple sources to come together, but  we can't utilize that data properly. There's no standards or interoperability, common API's.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:01):**  And I think that's where the DAC, the digital ag collective, which is basically this sort  of grow group that Tanya and I and others, um, are on, on the move to, to create, um,  is to actually drive industry wide, you know, producer led frameworks and standards for,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:19):**  um, you know, for providers and incentivize and allow us the opportunity to give our experience,  be involved in the assessment of these technologies, share our pain points, you know, help co-develop  solutions together. I mean, there's, you know, there's all this talk about, um, this disconnect  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:38):**  between ag tech and, and farmers and producers. And I guess what we're proposing with the  digital ag collective is that we find a pretty good solution. Um, and we've got to be involved  from, from the ground up. Yeah. Interesting. So, um, walk me back to  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:56):**  you, you reach out to all these people and you go to Sydney and you set up some of these  meetings where the ag tech company is surprised to have such a like engaged and sharp and  tuned in girl group that were like, you know, trying to code their own, um, solutions. And  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:11):**  we're talking about interoperability and standards, or did you quite quickly move into solutions?  Were they trying to sell you on their products? Like what were the interactions in the room  actually like? There was a bit of that definitely selling,  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:22):**  but, um, we met some incredibly talented people in that, that week and they were, you know,  here we are laying on the table, you know, what we want from them. Um, and, and they  were actually able to say, look, this is actually possible. And, and that was what was exciting.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:39):**  I mean, we did come away feeling quite overwhelmed and realize very quickly that we needed to  take a breath and think about how we move forward with this. And that's where sort of  working with the likes of yous come in to try and work out what it is that we want to  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:57):**  try and achieve and is it achievable? Is it really stick in the first place?  Yeah. And I want to get an update on where you up to, but yeah, I wanted to ask you,  Tanya, kind of your, your view on this and was your experience similar or different to  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:08):**  Kelly's? Yeah, I was just going to add to what Kelly  said that I, you know, we had multinationals down to garage startups over the course of  a few days and, um, it was so interesting and the level of enthusiasm and that engagement  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:24):**  between them and us was incredible. And I must admit with multinational, they'll probably  just trying to suss out what we were really up to. You know, it was quite interesting,  but they were all extremely generous with their time and giving of their knowledge.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:37):**  And I think that to me gave us faith that as an industry and as you know, a tech here  and agriculture here, we actually have got opportunity to work together and try and get  a solution. But I think the biggest thing is whether we're commercial versus industry  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:56):**  good. And I think with the digital ed collective, it's very much about industry good and trying  to bring it, have a way of bringing all farms into it and bring everybody's knowledge up  to a level playing field to a degree. But working with different service providers,  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:14):**  they've got a different goal perhaps. And that's probably a big challenge in how we  convince commercial providers. We're not trying to steal your profit margin. We want to work  together. So everyone has exposure to what they can offer. And I guess that's where the  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:31):**  digital aid collective can potentially bring everyone in. And if I've got my accounting  software and Kelly's got hers, we don't need to change. But if we can actually be able  to pull that data through and be able to then link it in with other programs that we already  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:46):**  use, but have that real integration of data, that's a massive benefit to our business.  And as a commercial service provider, they should want you to be able to do that. And  yeah, I'm not sure how we do that. That's the Holy grail, I think, and what we dream  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:01):**  to achieve. But that would be what we're aspiring to, I guess.  And have you gotten a willingness from other producers and or the kind of technology providers  to be part of this? And I'm curious like what the reactions have been to people who think  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:16):**  you're crazy to get involved and even thinking about building or catalyzing innovations or  are people really excited and want to work with you? Do they feel threatened? What's  the response been?  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:25):**  I think it's been mostly positive. After we left Sydney in June, and Kelly's the main  person that to go to on all of this, but I know at one point Kelly was fielding all these  phone calls from the guys that we met and then the people that hadn't been able to see  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:41):**  us in that June trip, they still wanted to catch up because they definitely wanted to  work with growers, you know, they were really keen and and so it was very positive. And  I know some of the connections have continued. And I think and it's something that we'll  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:57):**  talk about further into the interview, perhaps, but you know, the structure of the digital  ag collective is extremely important in terms of for its longevity, and also how it can  get its funding source, and then potentially how it can work with providers because that  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:11):**  structure will make a lot of difference to you know, if you're going for government funding  or for other sources of money. So I'll let Kelly talk about that further. But we've almost  had to say, slow down everyone, we're still trying to find our way. And we're really and  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:29):**  it's probably because of Kelly's role on all these boards. She knows how important governance  is. And so we're trying to get the governance right. And that's really critical for us for  the digital ag collective to go forward.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:40):**  Yeah, Kelly, tell me a little bit about that. And I imagine some of the work on different  kinds of boards, you mentioned co-op boards before, like all the different experience  you have, how has that influenced what you're thinking in terms of governance for DAC?  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:52):**  Once a cooperator, always a cooperator, it's the sort of thing that people who work on  cooperatives say, but this digital ag collective, the key mantra behind it is that whatever  we do and achieve, it must be far more owned and controlled. And we're looking at some  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:08):**  sort of, you know, the legal entity will either be some sort of cooperative structure or incorporated  association or hybrid co-op. There's lots of different options and models out there.  Because we actually believe that this model is the best way to achieve sort of ownership  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:24):**  and accountability and transparency within this sort of space. We've had, we've got a  lot of due diligence that needs to be done. And it's a slow process.  And what's your approach to that? Are you looking more on the tech side? Are you looking  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:40):**  internationally? Like how are you, what are the kind of next steps from here?  Yeah, that's something that we're still trying to get our head around, a little bit of trouble  coming up, the Evoke conference. And there's a big ag tech summit in San Francisco that  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:55):**  I'll be heading over to next month. Just to try and start really working out who are our  partners and who are our collaborators moving forward. You know, we're, you know, the sort  of the nuts and bolts essentially of what we're trying to achieve is sort of like a  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:16):**  hub, I guess, for business intelligence. And Tanya's already sort of touched on this, where  we can start linking in these third party solution providers, ingesting their data,  you know, produce a specific sort of functionality around that, that, you know, once we link  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:31):**  in, you know, this data to be able to create customized dashboarding and reporting, and  it's also about creating the hub or the platform that allows for others to build their tools  onto. So it's quite critical really, for us to be getting out there and doing a lot of  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:47):**  talking, working in trying to identify the right partners to work with on this, because  we know we can do it. We know the technology's out there. It's just pulling in the right  people with the right intentions and ensuring that we have the right model, you know, legally  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:06):**  as well to ensure that producers feel there's ownership, but those providers and partners  that we work with are incentivized. And that's probably the critical thing is that everyone's  incentivized and we're utilizing, we're not going to be programming, but we're going to  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:21):**  facilitate people who are, if that makes sense. And so instead of having, you know, essentially  with this hub, instead of having, you know, all these startups with all their platforms,  essentially what we're hoping is that we can pull more raw data into the hub. Raw data  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:37):**  can be held there for perpetuity, which is incredibly important when you're thinking  about a co-op. And it, you know, it's that raw data that has a lot of, not just, it's  not financial value, but industry value for, you know, AI and human assisted machine learning  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:51):**  and utilizing that data in a positive way and allowing the farmers control over how  they utilize that data is incredibly important.  Yeah, I love it. And I imagine, like I can tell your, both of your passion for it and  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:06):**  all of the thinking that's gone into it and all of the complexity that you're now, well,  maybe have always really embraced that it's, it's not just an easy solution or, you know,  once we, once they're always get involved earlier and more often we'll change it. There's  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:20):**  like a lot of complexity in the model and in the governance and in the tech, as you've  explored specifically the tech side of things, like what it's like to build software and  how expensive and how long it takes and how hard it is. And, you know, how to create interfaces  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:33):**  and mockups and things, which I imagine you guys, you guys have done some of in exploring  this, has that changed at all your view of, or kind of empathy for the tech side? Like,  do you think about either adopting technology different or do you get why the tech companies  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:48):**  have made some of the decisions that they have made or kind of how has that experience,  if at all changed your, your view of the tech side?  Oh, absolutely. There's a lot more empathy there for particularly anyone that's, you  
**[0:33:00-0:33:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:00):**  know, trying to do a startup. I mean, it's a really hard slog and, you know, I mean,  certainly in our experience, it's finding the right people to help you. And that's what  the digital ag collective is, is that that's where we want to be is we want to be using  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:17):**  our knowledge and our experience to help those startups. You know, we have this collective  knowledge that we could better utilise and facilitate those outcomes for industry. So  just to add to that, I think, and obviously, Sarah, you work in this space, but nationally  
**[0:33:37-0:33:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:37):**  we see we've got quite a few accelerated programs now. And I think I almost feel like people  that startups that have these great ideas, but potentially haven't actually talked to  the industry or the people that have where their pain points are. So I would almost implore  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:57):**  that anyone that's got a great idea to actually somehow talk to growers and talk to farmers  and understand their industry first and actually understand if it really is the issue, because  if they might invest all their time, their money, their parents' money to build a great  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:15):**  solution, but it might not be an actually major problem. So I think the accelerator  programs are amazing, but there's almost a step before that for the startups to go, well,  you need to be working with growers and, you know, having that consultation and collaborative  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:30):**  approach to build the solution. And then I think they'll get much better buy-in from  the industry.  Yeah. One of the things that, so I'm interested in when you guys thought about coming to Sydney  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:42):**  and reaching out to the ag tech startups, was it hard to find them or to reach out to  them or get in front of them? Because one of the things that's really hard for the ag  tech side is like, how do I get in front of a farmer? Right? Like how do I, even if I  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:55):**  really want to do this kind of customer validation and figure it out, like how do I know that  I should call Kelly Pearson, WA, cause she can speak tech and speak ag and is willing  to help. And how do you, Kelly deal with when the 10th entrepreneur calls you and wants  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:09):**  more of your time? You know, that, that can get a bit annoying. So yeah. Was it easy for  you to find the ag tech startups and then what advice would you have for them in reaching  out? Should they go through grower groups or how should they get in touch?  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:21):**  Yeah, look, we, we had a lot of support from MLA from the outset. It is like a very good  digital strategy. Look, we put a LinkedIn post out and there's some Twitter and a few  other other social media means. And when I say overwhelmed, I must've had about nearly  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:39):**  50 people, organizations, individuals in this space contact me and we didn't have time to  meet with them all. It was really overwhelming, but I guess on that reverse side of your question  there, you know, WA, I mean, I don't like to say if we're unique, but we are a little  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:55):**  bit in that we have a really incredible network of grower groups or farming systems groups.  You call them on the East coast. We've got 45 grower groups in WA. You know, really significant  extension network around each of those, those groups. And how do we better facilitate perhaps,  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:15):**  you know, this is one solution, I suppose it's how do we facilitate those grower groups  to work with the ag tech providers and not get burnt out or, you know, lose out, lose  IP or not be incentivized to continue doing that. And that's sort of the critical question.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:32):**  And it's something, you know, I mean, one of my board roles is, is with the grower group  alliance. And that's something that we're certainly really focused on trying to ensure  that our groups get the opportunities to work with these ag tech startups and have the best  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:48):**  benefits for their business that might come from being an early adopter or just being  involved at the coalface of these technologies. But at the same time they're rewarded. You  know, I'm not necessarily saying financially but they're not just used and abused essentially.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:06):**  It's a it's a two way street.  Yeah, definitely. We're probably coming up here to the end and one kind of left field  question I wanted to ask you both is one thing I've noticed and it may be totally anecdotal,  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:21):**  but I'm seeing a lot of women on the ag side kind of moving into the ag tech side and a  lot of the kind of female entrepreneurs that come from the farming community or entrepreneurs  from the farming community are women. And I think it's amazing and fascinating and this  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:37):**  has been really rewarding to work with. But I'm curious, like, is that just anecdotal?  Do you think there's a reason for it? And what's your experience been like kind of being  a female farmer and a female now tech entrepreneur?  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:49):**  I'll have a go first. Look, I think in general when it comes to ag tech, there's a lot of  farmers jumping in like they've sort of stepped, they've been sort of on the fence for a bit,  but now we're seeing a lot of people jumping in and I think it's that data driven decision  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:05):**  making where they can see absolute benefits in terms of operational efficiencies or business  intelligence. So obviously a very long way to go, but they're interested asking questions  and the early adopters are jumping in. I think obviously ag has definitely been traditionally  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:22):**  a male oriented industry. But over the last 20 years, and that's certainly in my time  with my career with the government, definitely we're seeing a lot more females, a lot more  women in the industry and they could be from agronomists to research scientists, extension  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:40):**  officers, you know, they cover the whole gamut of the sectors of the industry. But what I  do see is that women on farms often are highly educated and bring a whole new skill set into  their business. And whether they're the ones pushing or driving into this space, again,  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:00):**  anecdotal bit like you, you see it, but you're not 100% sure if it's the women. But yeah,  it's definitely women are bringing good skills, good business governance into these businesses,  I think. And that's what I'm certainly seeing. Kel, do you want to add to that?  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:21):**  Well, I think, you know, women working within the business, their businesses to help adopt  and facilitate ag tech is a really natural fit for women. You know, I mean, I'll take  my example, I suppose, you know, I'm a bit more, I guess I don't want to use the word  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:37):**  housebound with family, but I'm not doing the day to day driving the header or, you  know, the air seeder. But my way of contributing to my farm business is to be doing the yield  mapping, to be doing the paddock recording, to be doing the accounting programs and the  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:58):**  business analysis, you know, that's what I want to be, that, you know, that's my role  and I really enjoy it. Not to say my husband's not interested in that, but, you know, it's  something that I really enjoy and I'd love to see a lot more women being empowered to,  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:40:15):**  you know, embrace, you know, taking a role in the ag tech adoption within their own farms.  So hopefully we can achieve that.  Yeah, look, it sounds like you guys are on your way to do that with your own journeys,  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:40:28):**  with your own families and with the digital ag collective as well. Thank you so much for  coming on and sharing your story. Where can anyone listening find out more about what  you guys are up to? Is there, should they get in touch with you? Can they find you on  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:40:41):**  Twitter? Is there a website? If they want to learn more, what can they do?  We're both on Twitter. We're in the process of doing the website. But look, email, piercekelly1wordatbigbond.com.  Yeah, cool. We'll have a look and put it in the show notes.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:40:59):**  We'd love to hear from anyone out there that is really interested to hear more and be part  of this digital ag collective as we develop this up. We need more supporters and advocates  for what we're trying to achieve.

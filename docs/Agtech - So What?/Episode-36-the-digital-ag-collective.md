### Agtech - So What?  (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 10:22:20)
**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:00:25):**  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:00:30):**  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between Ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:00:35):**  AgTech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:00:39):**  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where Ag and Tech  
**[0:00:44-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:00:44):**  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:03):**  This week we had two guests on again, Kelly Pearce and Tanya Kilminster. They called in  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:09):**  together from Western Australia and I think we were a bit better this time on managing  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:14):**  the three person recording. So hopefully that worked out really well. Kelly and Tanya share  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:20):**  a little bit about their background, so I won't give that to you now. But one of the  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:23):**  things that I really enjoy is hearing about how different people end up at the intersection  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:28):**  of Ag and AgTech. And you know, Tanya comes from a farming family and Kelly doesn't and  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:32):**  yet they both have kind of found themselves bridging the Ag and the AgTech worlds nowadays,  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:38):**  which is a really great story. And I also love how their journey into the AgTech side  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:43):**  of things has helped them develop more empathy around what it's like to build software and  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:50):**  build technology, but also the needs of the users and just how important it is to have  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:55):**  the agriculture community involved early and often in AgTech. So I won't spoil any more  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:01:59):**  now. I'll let you hear it from Kelly and Tanya and hope you enjoy the episode.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:04):**  Hey, Tanya and Kelly, thanks so much for joining me on the podcast today.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:10):**  Hi Sarah. Hi Sarah. Great to be here.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:13):**  So I want to start with you, Kelly. I'll have you both give a little bit of your backgrounds,  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:17):**  but Kelly, tell me a little bit about yourself and your current role and actually the many  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:21):**  hats that you wear.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:22):**  Yeah, look, I do wear a few hats. Look, I've got a background in agricultural research.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:28):**  I have a PhD and 15 years or so of experience working in research with different IDCs and  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:36):**  CRCs and borer groups. But over the last sort of 10 years, I've been farming in the wheat  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:42):**  belt, Western Australia, about two and a half hours south-east of Perth with my husband  
**[0:02:47-0:02:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:47):**  Alan and I've got two little kids and we're broadacre cropping and sheep producers. I  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:54):**  still have a few off-farm work interests and board roles. I've got a few board commitments  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:02:59):**  with different industry and groups and cooperative sector. And yeah, look, it's certainly an  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:04):**  interesting challenge and Tanya faces the same thing of balancing our professional careers  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:09):**  and our family and our farms as well.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:14):**  What is your approach to balancing that? I'm sure it's less of a strategic approach and  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:18):**  more of like just keep all the balls in the air, but to the extent that maybe that's just  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:23):**  me, to the extent that you do have an approach to it, how do you think about balancing those  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:28):**  things?  
**[0:03:29-0:03:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:29):**  I've got a very supportive family. I'm really fortunate that I suppose over the last 15  
**[0:03:37-0:03:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:37):**  years we've developed good networks and contacts. So it's not too complicated. I certainly need  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:44):**  help around the farm from time to time and with the kids. So I'm not afraid to ask for  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:48):**  help is probably what I'm trying to say.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:51):**  Yeah, that's a good one. You mentioned the kind of research roles and being on boards.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:03:57):**  How did you get involved? Tell me about kind of deciding to do your PhD, what you did your  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:02):**  PhD in and how you ended up in first the research world.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:05):**  Look, I've got an Ag Science degree and did my PhD with the CSIRO. What was the salinity  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:13):**  CRC way back in the day? I've always loved science. It was something I wanted to focus  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:20):**  on at uni. Going into science and agricultural sciences is a really exciting field. Moving  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:28):**  I guess to the country and farming, it's a little bit more complicated to be able to  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:32):**  continue those roles. So the opportunities came up to take on more board roles and have  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:36):**  more of an impact and input to industry in those areas. I've had a bit more experience  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:43):**  with cooperative boards and I've really enjoyed that experience.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:49):**  One of the things I've noticed and it could just be me, but I feel like in Ag there are  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:04:55):**  a lot of boards, like there's a lot of governance. I think that's true in other sectors, but  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:00):**  there's a lot of kind of emphasis on governance in Ag. What's your take on, is it particularly  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:07):**  necessary in Ag or is it just that's how we kind of get a lot of stakeholder involvement  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:11):**  because people are in a lot of different places or what's your, maybe I'm just overemphasizing  
**[0:05:15-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:15):**  how much there is. What are your thoughts? Governance, I mean that's a fairly sort of  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:23):**  critical thing to ensure that we're actually achieving the outcomes that we want to achieve.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:31):**  Boards can vary from a Grower Group board, which is about ensuring that we're delivering  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:35):**  good regional R&D to our local community. Whereas, I've been on company boards where  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:40):**  governance is about ensuring the financial security of the organization. It just sort  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:48):**  of varies how you answer that question, but I'm really not answering this question very  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:52):**  well Sarah. No, that's all right. Why do you like to be on the boards? Obviously, it's  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:05:56):**  one of the opportunities for you. Do you see it as a good, it's obviously important to  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:02):**  make sure that the outcomes are achieved as you said. I imagine it's also good networking,  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:07):**  you get to learn things about different sectors, you get to meet different people. There's  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:10):**  probably some other benefits too. I guess where my head's at is recently, I'm on the  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:16):**  board of the Future Farmers Network and we've been talking about some of the benefits of  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:20):**  being involved in membership organizations and the benefits to young people and getting  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:24):**  involved in various more formal groups in agriculture. That's kind of where my head  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:30):**  was at is, why would someone like you get involved in something like this? What are  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:33):**  the benefits and why it's important for the industry to have some of these structures?  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:39):**  I mean, certainly it's really important to have that diversity of thought and opinion  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:43):**  coming into these organizations. I guess for me personally being involved, I'm on the farm,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:49):**  for a farming business to run and a family and off-farm work commitments and being on  
**[0:06:53-0:07:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:06:53):**  a board is a way of contributing to industry in a really positive way. It can really make  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:02):**  a difference if you do it correctly.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:05):**  Yeah. Cool. Did you grow up on a farm?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:08):**  No. No, I grew up in the northwest of Australia. So yeah, it's certainly coming into the science  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:15):**  field and ag science is a life-changing move.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:21):**  Yeah. How did you choose ag science if you didn't grow up on a farm?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:25):**  Well, I've always enjoyed science at school, so it was a natural fit for me to either choose  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:34):**  a medical or an agricultural field and I chose ag and made the right decision.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:39):**  Okay. This is my last question for you as I just pepper you here with questions before  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:43):**  I go to Tanya. A lot of people have studied ag science and this is again maybe a stupid  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:49):**  question but what do you study in ag science? There's so many scientific aspects of ag.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:54):**  I can't imagine you could do plant science and animal science and there's a million things  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:07:58):**  you could be digging into. What's the generic ag science degree cover?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:02):**  Well, I mean every uni that has it would have a different degree but I mean I went through  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:07):**  the University of Western Australia which at the time and still now has a strong agronomy,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:13):**  soil science and ag economics and animal science components to it and I tended to go more down  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:20):**  the animal science component. My PhD was very livestock systems focused and the majority  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:26):**  of my research has been within livestock systems. So every uni would have their different focus  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:33):**  depending on who their academics are sometimes. Fair enough. That sounds like most other degrees  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:39):**  I suppose. All right, Tanya, tell me about yourself and the kind of multiple hats that  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:44):**  you wear as well. Okay. After you've grilled Kelly.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:47):**  Yeah, are you nervous now? Yeah, it's my turn. So look, I am a born and  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:52):**  bred wheat belt WA girl, one of three daughters from a farming family in a little town called  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:08:59):**  Bruce Rock and that's about 250 kilometres east of Perth and yeah basically I did all  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:06):**  my schooling locally and then I went off to Perth to study a science degree and a bit  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:10):**  like Kelly, like I loved science but I at the time certainly didn't see myself in agriculture.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:16):**  I felt that I had, I don't know, something bigger and something bigger. I don't know.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:23):**  At the time of, you know, being a 17 year old, I didn't perhaps value their agricultural  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:28):**  industry like I do now, like you know that whole growing up thing. So I just wanted to  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:34):**  do science and I definitely wanted to go down that path of animal science and then yeah  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:39):**  I got my degree in microbiology with honours and then I went and worked for CSIRO but Kelly  
**[0:09:44-0:09:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:44):**  and my path didn't cross in our careers until, you know, probably I finished at CSIRO and  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:51):**  then Kelly came in just after me. But I went backpacking for a bit and then my boyfriend  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:09:57):**  and I decided we'd come home to his family farm which I think our parents were all happy  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:02):**  about because that was next door to my farm. So we went back to the family farm to his  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:08):**  and within weeks of me getting off an aeroplane I walked into the local Department of Agriculture  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:13):**  through the state government in a town called Merredin which is just up the road and is  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:18):**  the bigger regional centre and I managed to get a job just as a technical officer and  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:23):**  then I applied for their graduate program and I was successful and then for the last  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:28):**  18 years I've been based in Merredin as a farming systems development officer and over  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:34):**  that time my roles have sort of varied over time but I've really worked strongly in the  
**[0:10:39-0:10:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:39):**  sheep industry in terms of production systems, traditional extension and really trying to  
**[0:10:47-0:10:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:47):**  find ways of, you know, improving the productivity of our livestock systems, how we use sheep  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:10:54):**  in a sense of good rotational value to the business or to the farming system and how  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:00):**  we might use them for risk mitigation in our sort of complex low rainfall sort of environment  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:06):**  that we're in in this sort of region of WA. So I guess that's sort of where I've been  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:11):**  and then I guess the last decade and why I've sort of moved into this space is that in the  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:16):**  last decade we've really had some challenges from both the climate and a commerce point  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:21):**  of view that we're having drier winters so we really have from an economic point of view  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:27):**  every decision we make has to be like really critically thought out. If we miss a seeding  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:33):**  opportunity that could really pay at the end of the year, you know, if we have lack of  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:37):**  rain or, you know, or how we've done our fertiliser decisions. So in that whole farming system  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:43):**  sense we really need to utilise the data that's available to us to make much more informed  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:48):**  decisions and from about 2010 onwards we've had some really real doozies of seasons and  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:11:55):**  so farmers have really challenged us as a department not to ask for help in a handout  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:00):**  but ask for really good economic systems and financial literacy and now in this digital  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:06):**  space to really help with finding those solutions. So, you know, we work with a couple of really  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:12):**  strong rural groups out of the Merredin district and more further east and we are working with,  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:19):**  you know, utilising digital technologies in terms of IoT devices, improving our connectivity  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:25):**  across the region so we've actually got broadband internet access and really honing in on the  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:33):**  new technologies to, again, those data driven decisions.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:37):**  Wow, okay, a lot there. A couple of things I want to back up and dig into. So where did  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:43):**  you go backpacking?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:44):**  Oh, well, we started in Africa and we moved from the south up through to, we got to about  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:50):**  Kenya backpacking and, you know, just catching crazy transport and then flew across to Egypt  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:12:57):**  and then from there Turkey, Eastern Europe, the UK, a bit of Western Europe, UK and then  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:03):**  America on the way home.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:05):**  Yeah, it was obviously your favourite.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:07):**  No, Turkey is still my favourite. I love Turkey. Yeah, go back.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:13):**  Good for you. And so what was the decision to come back on farming and I guess more,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:18):**  like tell me about when you went from sort of not appreciating Ag as much as you said  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:23):**  to kind of building that appreciation that you have for it now. Was there like a moment  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:27):**  that kind of changed it? Was it part of coming back to the farm or?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:30):**  Yeah, I think it was funny because my husband is like a boilermaker or welder by trade and  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:37):**  so he did that before going back to the farm and in his mid-twenties he was like, yeah,  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:41):**  I want to be farming and I was like, are you sure? Because mining industry is, you know,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:46):**  quite, quite, if we could go there, we could go where Kelly's from and you know, earn lots  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:51):**  of money and he goes, no, I really want to be a farmer. So yeah, it was kind of after  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:13:57):**  working for the department and I think being able to use my skills obviously and what I  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:02):**  realised even though I trained in the very technical space, I realised soon that I was  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:08):**  actually very much a people person and being a development officer and in the work of extension  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:13):**  and change management, I really felt, oh, I can be an advocate for agriculture and still  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:19):**  do good science. So I had the best of both worlds. I had good technical skills, but I  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:24):**  love working people and trying to make positive change. So I think it was not an epiphany  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:30):**  moment, but it was just that slow burn of really appreciating the industry we're in.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:35):**  And then back with our whole farming thing with my husband, we're now in our fifth production  
**[0:14:41-0:14:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:41):**  season of going through succession. And so we farm my farm and half of my husband's original  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:49):**  family farm. So we've joined as one entity now and like I say, our fifth production year.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:14:54):**  And I think that has been a great foundation for me to really challenge what we know as  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:00):**  ag and why tech has got such a valuable role going forward because I'm always looking for  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:07):**  efficiencies, trying to save money, trying to make sure our inputs are cost effective  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:14):**  and utilise the data. Because we do, we generate lots and lots of data and often it sits there  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:20):**  in a data card or just not even really looked at. And I think it's there, we just need to  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:27):**  grab it and use it.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:30):**  Do you ever find that that statement is controversial? There's kind of some people who, and I'm simplifying  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:37):**  the world, but some people who would say the same thing, like this data is really useful,  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:40):**  we need to be using it. And others who are like, we have all this data, but it's definitely  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:44):**  not useful yet. Like I don't see why it's useful or I can't get any use out of it and  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:47):**  it's not clear to me why we're collecting it. Do you think that's like a spectrum of  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:52):**  views there or are there reasons why you'd think one or the other or is it certain types  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:15:56):**  of data? Kind of, I feel like it's starting to be said a lot, I guess this, we need to  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:00):**  collect more data, we need to use it to make better decisions. And that's, everyone's sort  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:04):**  of saying that, but I guess go a level deeper, like why is that important and kind of is  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:09):**  it important for everyone?  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:10):**  Yeah. And I think often it's localized data for your business. So what's going to make  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:16):**  a big difference in your business? And so I'll just, for an example, if I had a soil  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:20):**  moisture probe on my property, the data that I'm getting at that very localized area or  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:26):**  the weather station that's involved with that, that can help me make really good decisions  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:31):**  about seed time of seeding or the soil nutrition in terms of what fertilizers I might apply.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:37):**  So I think because, and that could be, that's real time. And so I can make those real time  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:41):**  decisions, but then if I start collecting that data over time, I can start seeing changes  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:47):**  in the seasons. I can see how in my different crop types that it might have a lesser effect  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:53):**  in some years and a better effect in others, or you throw it out the window and say, well,  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:16:59):**  that didn't work at all. But at least if you're starting to collect over time, that's the  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:03):**  bit we're not, I don't think we're quite there yet because the data might be there, but we're  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:09):**  possibly not analyzing it over time yet. And then to be able to see those trends and then  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:14):**  make even more informed decisions. So I think, I think I wouldn't sit on that side of the  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:21):**  fence saying there's all this data and we don't need to collect anymore. I think the  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:25):**  collection's often happening anyway, so let's use what's there and get the good, like we  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:32):**  know some good data scientists that really could hone their skills into this area and  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:37):**  start developing better algorithms. So for that predictive type work that I think going  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:41):**  forward, particularly when we look at climate change and the drop in rainfall for winter  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:46):**  out here, if we can start making better predictions based on that, then we're going to make much  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:52):**  more cost effective decisions. It's interesting. One of the kind of points  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:17:56):**  in there is the new types of skills you might need to use that data. So like data science  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:01):**  or obviously you get into machine learning and artificial intelligence and kind of more  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:05):**  and different skill sets. Do you see more people with those kinds of skill sets kind  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:10):**  of coming into the industry or working on the research side or is that still a gap?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:15):**  I think, and it's very new. I would never even provided an opinion on this probably  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:21):**  a year ago, but just in talking to different software developers and people in this sort  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:26):**  of IT world, they're saying they can't fulfill the job opportunities that are there with  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:32):**  the amount of graduates that exist. So I think it's probably a massive gap, but then I think  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:38):**  we have a role in saying, well, we can't just say, let's all go out and get a data science  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:44):**  degree or a computer science degree. You need to be going within the Ag faculty perhaps.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:50):**  We need to have those really strong data science subjects or even a core major in a degree  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:18:57):**  maybe. So I think if you can start getting the right people trained up with those skills,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:02):**  but it is specifically for Ag for another area, then that would be a good thing for  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:09):**  the industry. So I think it is a gap and it's a huge opportunity.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:14):**  So you guys are going to both convince your kids to become data scientists then?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:17):**  Yeah, it's funny you say that because they learn coding from about year one at school  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:21):**  now. They are coding. And my oldest child, he's a bit like, oh, it's so boring. Like,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:28):**  no, no, it's the future. It's not for everybody obviously. And that's the good thing about  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:33):**  life that you find what you love. But if you've got some background in that, they're going  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:39):**  to be so much more ahead of what we are. Like Kelly and I are just learning, we're on the  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:44):**  periphery of this. And if you learned it from the age of six, it's going to be natural.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:50):**  So it's going to be great for them. Yeah, sure. So I want to ask about kind of  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:53):**  your journey into more of the Ag tech side of things. And you mentioned sort of your  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:19:56):**  perspective changing a year ago. The reason I obviously get to know you guys is because  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:01):**  of your initial, what I would call a tech scan. Like you went out looking at a bunch  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:06):**  of different technology products for the kind of mixed farming systems and we're largely  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:11):**  not happy with what you found. So, um, maybe Kelly first, tell me a little bit about that  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:15):**  journey, kind of how you started down that path and what you found.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:19):**  Well, I guess, uh, you know, I was really interested in how within my farming business  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:24):**  I could better use my, my farm data and seek sort of more real time business intelligence  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:29):**  really around that. So, you know, I started this sort of transition within my business  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:34):**  to more cloud accounting and Patek activity recording and reporting, um, and got really  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:40):**  frustrated quickly. It was a lot of hype and kindness out there, but the reality of what  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:45):**  was being delivered by industry. Um, and I even dabbled in a bit of programming, believe  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:50):**  it or not, um, to try and achieve some of the outcomes to get my, um, my dream, dream  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:55):**  goal. And  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:20:56):**  you must've been really frustrated to kind of pick up programming yourself. Like most,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:00):**  you know, consumers wouldn't do that in the world, no matter how frustrated they are with  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:03):**  a tool. You must've been really frustrated.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:05):**  I'm still frustrated. I just don't have the time. Um, so a group of us, uh, you know,  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:11):**  we went to the digital ag collective. Um, we went to Sydney and we put a call out there.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:17):**  Um, any data scientists, analysts, it experts come and meet with a group of Western Australian  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:23):**  producers who are really interested in pursuing technology for data integration and business  
**[0:21:28-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:28):**  intelligence. And we were overwhelmed with response. And, uh, we had a, you know, we  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:36):**  went to this meeting, we organized it, we initiated it and we had some really clear  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:39):**  goals as to what we wanted to achieve there. Um, but you know, it's sort of, it was just  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:46):**  quite an incredible experience when you put a group of passionate producers in a room  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:50):**  with these really clever, smart people, what you could actually achieve. And, but the challenge  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:21:57):**  is how to create those feedback systems and incentives, um, to, to make this world go  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:04):**  round better. This data, this data, data chain. Um, so the kind of big, sorry to interrupt  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:11):**  you Kelly, is that the kind of big problem you were seeking to solve was this data chain,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:15):**  like things don't talk to each other. Was that kind of the main problem you were looking  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:19):**  to solve? Yep. I mean, I guess is this, we're collecting so much data, it's not integrating,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:25):**  you know, any attempts, uh, to integrate data are being done by commercial players for commercial  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:31):**  gain. It's not agnostic. You're tied into particular programs. I mean, I use different  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:36):**  accounting programs to what Tanya uses, for example, and we don't want as an industry  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:40):**  to be tied into one, one program. And I guess what's frustrated me all along is knowing  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:45):**  that there's tech out there, you know, there's the platforms, there's the tools, you know,  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:50):**  that allow data to be pulled in and integrated and multiple sources to come together, but  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:22:55):**  we can't utilize that data properly. There's no standards or interoperability, common API's.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:01):**  And I think that's where the DAC, the digital ag collective, which is basically this sort  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:05):**  of grow group that Tanya and I and others, um, are on, on the move to, to create, um,  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:12):**  is to actually drive industry wide, you know, producer led frameworks and standards for,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:19):**  um, you know, for providers and incentivize and allow us the opportunity to give our experience,  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:27):**  be involved in the assessment of these technologies, share our pain points, you know, help co-develop  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:32):**  solutions together. I mean, there's, you know, there's all this talk about, um, this disconnect  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:38):**  between ag tech and, and farmers and producers. And I guess what we're proposing with the  
**[0:23:44-0:23:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:44):**  digital ag collective is that we find a pretty good solution. Um, and we've got to be involved  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:52):**  from, from the ground up. Yeah. Interesting. So, um, walk me back to  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:23:56):**  you, you reach out to all these people and you go to Sydney and you set up some of these  
**[0:24:00-0:24:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:00):**  meetings where the ag tech company is surprised to have such a like engaged and sharp and  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:07):**  tuned in girl group that were like, you know, trying to code their own, um, solutions. And  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:11):**  we're talking about interoperability and standards, or did you quite quickly move into solutions?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:15):**  Were they trying to sell you on their products? Like what were the interactions in the room  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:19):**  actually like? There was a bit of that definitely selling,  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:22):**  but, um, we met some incredibly talented people in that, that week and they were, you know,  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:29):**  here we are laying on the table, you know, what we want from them. Um, and, and they  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:35):**  were actually able to say, look, this is actually possible. And, and that was what was exciting.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:39):**  I mean, we did come away feeling quite overwhelmed and realize very quickly that we needed to  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:46):**  take a breath and think about how we move forward with this. And that's where sort of  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:53):**  working with the likes of yous come in to try and work out what it is that we want to  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:24:57):**  try and achieve and is it achievable? Is it really stick in the first place?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:00):**  Yeah. And I want to get an update on where you up to, but yeah, I wanted to ask you,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:04):**  Tanya, kind of your, your view on this and was your experience similar or different to  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:08):**  Kelly's? Yeah, I was just going to add to what Kelly  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:10):**  said that I, you know, we had multinationals down to garage startups over the course of  
**[0:25:17-0:25:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:17):**  a few days and, um, it was so interesting and the level of enthusiasm and that engagement  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:24):**  between them and us was incredible. And I must admit with multinational, they'll probably  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:28):**  just trying to suss out what we were really up to. You know, it was quite interesting,  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:33):**  but they were all extremely generous with their time and giving of their knowledge.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:37):**  And I think that to me gave us faith that as an industry and as you know, a tech here  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:43):**  and agriculture here, we actually have got opportunity to work together and try and get  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:50):**  a solution. But I think the biggest thing is whether we're commercial versus industry  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:25:56):**  good. And I think with the digital ed collective, it's very much about industry good and trying  
**[0:26:01-0:26:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:01):**  to bring it, have a way of bringing all farms into it and bring everybody's knowledge up  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:09):**  to a level playing field to a degree. But working with different service providers,  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:14):**  they've got a different goal perhaps. And that's probably a big challenge in how we  
**[0:26:19-0:26:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:19):**  convince commercial providers. We're not trying to steal your profit margin. We want to work  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:27):**  together. So everyone has exposure to what they can offer. And I guess that's where the  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:31):**  digital aid collective can potentially bring everyone in. And if I've got my accounting  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:36):**  software and Kelly's got hers, we don't need to change. But if we can actually be able  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:40):**  to pull that data through and be able to then link it in with other programs that we already  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:46):**  use, but have that real integration of data, that's a massive benefit to our business.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:51):**  And as a commercial service provider, they should want you to be able to do that. And  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:26:57):**  yeah, I'm not sure how we do that. That's the Holy grail, I think, and what we dream  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:01):**  to achieve. But that would be what we're aspiring to, I guess.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:06):**  And have you gotten a willingness from other producers and or the kind of technology providers  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:12):**  to be part of this? And I'm curious like what the reactions have been to people who think  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:16):**  you're crazy to get involved and even thinking about building or catalyzing innovations or  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:20):**  are people really excited and want to work with you? Do they feel threatened? What's  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:23):**  the response been?  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:25):**  I think it's been mostly positive. After we left Sydney in June, and Kelly's the main  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:31):**  person that to go to on all of this, but I know at one point Kelly was fielding all these  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:36):**  phone calls from the guys that we met and then the people that hadn't been able to see  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:41):**  us in that June trip, they still wanted to catch up because they definitely wanted to  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:46):**  work with growers, you know, they were really keen and and so it was very positive. And  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:52):**  I know some of the connections have continued. And I think and it's something that we'll  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:27:57):**  talk about further into the interview, perhaps, but you know, the structure of the digital  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:01):**  ag collective is extremely important in terms of for its longevity, and also how it can  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:06):**  get its funding source, and then potentially how it can work with providers because that  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:11):**  structure will make a lot of difference to you know, if you're going for government funding  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:17):**  or for other sources of money. So I'll let Kelly talk about that further. But we've almost  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:22):**  had to say, slow down everyone, we're still trying to find our way. And we're really and  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:29):**  it's probably because of Kelly's role on all these boards. She knows how important governance  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:34):**  is. And so we're trying to get the governance right. And that's really critical for us for  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:38):**  the digital ag collective to go forward.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:40):**  Yeah, Kelly, tell me a little bit about that. And I imagine some of the work on different  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:43):**  kinds of boards, you mentioned co-op boards before, like all the different experience  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:47):**  you have, how has that influenced what you're thinking in terms of governance for DAC?  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:52):**  Once a cooperator, always a cooperator, it's the sort of thing that people who work on  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:28:57):**  cooperatives say, but this digital ag collective, the key mantra behind it is that whatever  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:03):**  we do and achieve, it must be far more owned and controlled. And we're looking at some  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:08):**  sort of, you know, the legal entity will either be some sort of cooperative structure or incorporated  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:13):**  association or hybrid co-op. There's lots of different options and models out there.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:18):**  Because we actually believe that this model is the best way to achieve sort of ownership  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:24):**  and accountability and transparency within this sort of space. We've had, we've got a  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:31):**  lot of due diligence that needs to be done. And it's a slow process.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:36):**  And what's your approach to that? Are you looking more on the tech side? Are you looking  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:40):**  internationally? Like how are you, what are the kind of next steps from here?  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:44):**  Yeah, that's something that we're still trying to get our head around, a little bit of trouble  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:50):**  coming up, the Evoke conference. And there's a big ag tech summit in San Francisco that  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:29:55):**  I'll be heading over to next month. Just to try and start really working out who are our  
**[0:30:01-0:30:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:01):**  partners and who are our collaborators moving forward. You know, we're, you know, the sort  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:09):**  of the nuts and bolts essentially of what we're trying to achieve is sort of like a  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:16):**  hub, I guess, for business intelligence. And Tanya's already sort of touched on this, where  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:20):**  we can start linking in these third party solution providers, ingesting their data,  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:26):**  you know, produce a specific sort of functionality around that, that, you know, once we link  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:31):**  in, you know, this data to be able to create customized dashboarding and reporting, and  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:37):**  it's also about creating the hub or the platform that allows for others to build their tools  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:42):**  onto. So it's quite critical really, for us to be getting out there and doing a lot of  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:47):**  talking, working in trying to identify the right partners to work with on this, because  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:53):**  we know we can do it. We know the technology's out there. It's just pulling in the right  
**[0:30:59-0:31:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:30:59):**  people with the right intentions and ensuring that we have the right model, you know, legally  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:06):**  as well to ensure that producers feel there's ownership, but those providers and partners  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:12):**  that we work with are incentivized. And that's probably the critical thing is that everyone's  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:16):**  incentivized and we're utilizing, we're not going to be programming, but we're going to  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:21):**  facilitate people who are, if that makes sense. And so instead of having, you know, essentially  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:27):**  with this hub, instead of having, you know, all these startups with all their platforms,  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:31):**  essentially what we're hoping is that we can pull more raw data into the hub. Raw data  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:37):**  can be held there for perpetuity, which is incredibly important when you're thinking  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:40):**  about a co-op. And it, you know, it's that raw data that has a lot of, not just, it's  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:46):**  not financial value, but industry value for, you know, AI and human assisted machine learning  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:51):**  and utilizing that data in a positive way and allowing the farmers control over how  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:31:58):**  they utilize that data is incredibly important.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:01):**  Yeah, I love it. And I imagine, like I can tell your, both of your passion for it and  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:06):**  all of the thinking that's gone into it and all of the complexity that you're now, well,  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:10):**  maybe have always really embraced that it's, it's not just an easy solution or, you know,  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:16):**  once we, once they're always get involved earlier and more often we'll change it. There's  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:20):**  like a lot of complexity in the model and in the governance and in the tech, as you've  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:24):**  explored specifically the tech side of things, like what it's like to build software and  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:28):**  how expensive and how long it takes and how hard it is. And, you know, how to create interfaces  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:33):**  and mockups and things, which I imagine you guys, you guys have done some of in exploring  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:37):**  this, has that changed at all your view of, or kind of empathy for the tech side? Like,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:43):**  do you think about either adopting technology different or do you get why the tech companies  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:48):**  have made some of the decisions that they have made or kind of how has that experience,  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:53):**  if at all changed your, your view of the tech side?  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:32:55):**  Oh, absolutely. There's a lot more empathy there for particularly anyone that's, you  
**[0:33:00-0:33:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:00):**  know, trying to do a startup. I mean, it's a really hard slog and, you know, I mean,  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:07):**  certainly in our experience, it's finding the right people to help you. And that's what  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:12):**  the digital ag collective is, is that that's where we want to be is we want to be using  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:17):**  our knowledge and our experience to help those startups. You know, we have this collective  
**[0:33:22-0:33:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:22):**  knowledge that we could better utilise and facilitate those outcomes for industry. So  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:33):**  just to add to that, I think, and obviously, Sarah, you work in this space, but nationally  
**[0:33:37-0:33:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:37):**  we see we've got quite a few accelerated programs now. And I think I almost feel like people  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:45):**  that startups that have these great ideas, but potentially haven't actually talked to  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:51):**  the industry or the people that have where their pain points are. So I would almost implore  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:33:57):**  that anyone that's got a great idea to actually somehow talk to growers and talk to farmers  
**[0:34:02-0:34:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:02):**  and understand their industry first and actually understand if it really is the issue, because  
**[0:34:08-0:34:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:08):**  if they might invest all their time, their money, their parents' money to build a great  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:15):**  solution, but it might not be an actually major problem. So I think the accelerator  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:20):**  programs are amazing, but there's almost a step before that for the startups to go, well,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:25):**  you need to be working with growers and, you know, having that consultation and collaborative  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:30):**  approach to build the solution. And then I think they'll get much better buy-in from  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:35):**  the industry.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:36):**  Yeah. One of the things that, so I'm interested in when you guys thought about coming to Sydney  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:42):**  and reaching out to the ag tech startups, was it hard to find them or to reach out to  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:46):**  them or get in front of them? Because one of the things that's really hard for the ag  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:50):**  tech side is like, how do I get in front of a farmer? Right? Like how do I, even if I  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:55):**  really want to do this kind of customer validation and figure it out, like how do I know that  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:34:59):**  I should call Kelly Pearson, WA, cause she can speak tech and speak ag and is willing  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:04):**  to help. And how do you, Kelly deal with when the 10th entrepreneur calls you and wants  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:09):**  more of your time? You know, that, that can get a bit annoying. So yeah. Was it easy for  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:14):**  you to find the ag tech startups and then what advice would you have for them in reaching  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:18):**  out? Should they go through grower groups or how should they get in touch?  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:21):**  Yeah, look, we, we had a lot of support from MLA from the outset. It is like a very good  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:26):**  digital strategy. Look, we put a LinkedIn post out and there's some Twitter and a few  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:33):**  other other social media means. And when I say overwhelmed, I must've had about nearly  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:39):**  50 people, organizations, individuals in this space contact me and we didn't have time to  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:44):**  meet with them all. It was really overwhelming, but I guess on that reverse side of your question  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:50):**  there, you know, WA, I mean, I don't like to say if we're unique, but we are a little  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:35:55):**  bit in that we have a really incredible network of grower groups or farming systems groups.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:01):**  You call them on the East coast. We've got 45 grower groups in WA. You know, really significant  
**[0:36:07-0:36:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:07):**  extension network around each of those, those groups. And how do we better facilitate perhaps,  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:15):**  you know, this is one solution, I suppose it's how do we facilitate those grower groups  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:18):**  to work with the ag tech providers and not get burnt out or, you know, lose out, lose  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:25):**  IP or not be incentivized to continue doing that. And that's sort of the critical question.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:32):**  And it's something, you know, I mean, one of my board roles is, is with the grower group  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:37):**  alliance. And that's something that we're certainly really focused on trying to ensure  
**[0:36:41-0:36:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:41):**  that our groups get the opportunities to work with these ag tech startups and have the best  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:48):**  benefits for their business that might come from being an early adopter or just being  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:36:53):**  involved at the coalface of these technologies. But at the same time they're rewarded. You  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:00):**  know, I'm not necessarily saying financially but they're not just used and abused essentially.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:06):**  It's a it's a two way street.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:10):**  Yeah, definitely. We're probably coming up here to the end and one kind of left field  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:16):**  question I wanted to ask you both is one thing I've noticed and it may be totally anecdotal,  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:21):**  but I'm seeing a lot of women on the ag side kind of moving into the ag tech side and a  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:27):**  lot of the kind of female entrepreneurs that come from the farming community or entrepreneurs  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:33):**  from the farming community are women. And I think it's amazing and fascinating and this  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:37):**  has been really rewarding to work with. But I'm curious, like, is that just anecdotal?  
**[0:37:40-0:37:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:40):**  Do you think there's a reason for it? And what's your experience been like kind of being  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:44):**  a female farmer and a female now tech entrepreneur?  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:49):**  I'll have a go first. Look, I think in general when it comes to ag tech, there's a lot of  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:37:54):**  farmers jumping in like they've sort of stepped, they've been sort of on the fence for a bit,  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:00):**  but now we're seeing a lot of people jumping in and I think it's that data driven decision  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:05):**  making where they can see absolute benefits in terms of operational efficiencies or business  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:10):**  intelligence. So obviously a very long way to go, but they're interested asking questions  
**[0:38:15-0:38:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:15):**  and the early adopters are jumping in. I think obviously ag has definitely been traditionally  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:22):**  a male oriented industry. But over the last 20 years, and that's certainly in my time  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:29):**  with my career with the government, definitely we're seeing a lot more females, a lot more  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:35):**  women in the industry and they could be from agronomists to research scientists, extension  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:40):**  officers, you know, they cover the whole gamut of the sectors of the industry. But what I  
**[0:38:46-0:38:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:46):**  do see is that women on farms often are highly educated and bring a whole new skill set into  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:38:54):**  their business. And whether they're the ones pushing or driving into this space, again,  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:00):**  anecdotal bit like you, you see it, but you're not 100% sure if it's the women. But yeah,  
**[0:39:06-0:39:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:06):**  it's definitely women are bringing good skills, good business governance into these businesses,  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:15):**  I think. And that's what I'm certainly seeing. Kel, do you want to add to that?  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:21):**  Well, I think, you know, women working within the business, their businesses to help adopt  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:27):**  and facilitate ag tech is a really natural fit for women. You know, I mean, I'll take  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:33):**  my example, I suppose, you know, I'm a bit more, I guess I don't want to use the word  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:37):**  housebound with family, but I'm not doing the day to day driving the header or, you  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:43):**  know, the air seeder. But my way of contributing to my farm business is to be doing the yield  
**[0:39:48-0:39:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:48):**  mapping, to be doing the paddock recording, to be doing the accounting programs and the  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:39:58):**  business analysis, you know, that's what I want to be, that, you know, that's my role  
**[0:40:02-0:40:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:40:02):**  and I really enjoy it. Not to say my husband's not interested in that, but, you know, it's  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:40:09):**  something that I really enjoy and I'd love to see a lot more women being empowered to,  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:40:15):**  you know, embrace, you know, taking a role in the ag tech adoption within their own farms.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:40:21):**  So hopefully we can achieve that.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:40:23):**  Yeah, look, it sounds like you guys are on your way to do that with your own journeys,  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357324#t=0:40:28):**  with your own families and with the digital ag collective as well. Thank you so much for

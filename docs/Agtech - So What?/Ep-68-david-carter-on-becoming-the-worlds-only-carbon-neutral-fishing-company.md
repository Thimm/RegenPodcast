### Agtech - So What?  (2020-06-03)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast brought to you by Agthentic.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  Today I chat with an expert in a very different kind of agriculture, fisheries.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:13):**  David Carter is the CEO of Austral Fisheries and he shares how his career has taken him  from deckhand to CEO and some of the tough decisions he's made in his efforts to use  business to address social and environmental challenges.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:29):**  It surprised me how many common themes there are between what's happening in fisheries  and other types of agriculture.  Things like social license, the challenges of moving from a commodity to a branded premium  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:41):**  product, the use of technology to bring transparency to consumers and increasing pressures and  opportunities to become carbon neutral.  But before we get to all of that, David's story starts out back in 1978, not as CEO,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:57):**  but as a failed vet with a passion for the ocean.  Here's David.  I'm a failed vet.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:04](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:03):**  I'm a son of a vet, right?  So I'm a failed vet and I failed everything else.  And that's like the last time I entered my entrance score, let me into zoology at Melbourne  
**[0:01:13-0:01:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:13):**  with a bit of a marine.  So I fly, but it was just sort of follow an interest.  I'd been doing a lot of sailing.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:19):**  I've done Sydney Hobart and Melbourne Hobart yacht races, done scuba diving around, around  and best, great generally living the life of a Bohemian and figured, well, somebody  had said, if you can do what you love, then you never work a day in your life.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:36):**  So that was, that was broadly the strategy, but it was a fairly rough plan.  But at that stage it involved rather than a Google, but it involved the trip to the  post office and wading through, I don't know, 40 different versions of yellow pages for  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:52):**  the country and writing to anybody I thought was in the fish business that might be able  to use a Bohemian like myself.  And the end game was a couple of responses from Western Australia and my dear mother  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:09):**  stumped up the airfares to bring me over and have those couple of interviews.  And finally I signed up with, well, it was a two hour meeting when Murray France did  all the talking and he said a week later I was on a fishing boat out of Darwin as a trainee  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:26):**  millionaire still in training.  David was part of a newly created management training program where he'd start as a deck  hand and learn about all aspects of working as a fisherman.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:37):**  And then perhaps if he did well, move into management.  So what was it like to be a deck hand at that time?  Well, for starters, there was no internet.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:46):**  I went to sea two weeks before my 21st birthday and I was just too shit scared to mention  to anybody that I'd turned 21.  Plus there was some obscure, either too unknown hazing ceremony that I was going to be subjected  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:59):**  to.  But all that ran amuck.  And before telephones and wifi and WhatsApp and all the technology, we had radio telephones.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:08):**  So my darling mother got on the radio telephone through Darwin Radio and proceeded to tell  the world it was my 21st birthday because people just for sport back in those days used  to listen to the radio telephone calls.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:22):**  It was quite humorous.  Anyway, there was no hazing.  There might've been an eight ounce glass of whiskey involved at some point, but I got  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:33):**  off easy.  The company today is called Austro Fisheries, but back then it was called KFV Fisheries.  David had various roles from deck hand to ship builder and eventually into management  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:46):**  where he was able to watch the company and the industry evolve.  It was a monster operation.  Townsville base, 33 boats.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:54):**  We had our own floating dry dock, a factory for processing prawns.  We dealt with a facility in Karumba that had to support these boats.  We bought a mother ship that was supporting them.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:06):**  So every one of these involved different set of challenges.  There was then fuel shocks of the eighties where supply was short and we had to put in  our own fuel storage capability.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:20):**  And so it was just a magnificent series of challenges.  But then as the fishery started to struggle with that much pressure, things went in reverse.  So suddenly we had all these boats that were surplus to requirement and we started operating  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:34):**  in Burma, in Papua New Guinea or West Eirean.  We had boats that ended up off the coast of Oman.  There was different boats through the Arabian Gulf.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:44):**  Again, every one of those was just another extraordinary adventure.  As David gained more experience and moved into more senior roles, he started to see  opportunities to improve the business, to respond to demands from consumers and to move  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:58):**  from a commodity to a branded premium product.  So for most of my career, we've just been basic commodity producers, just completely  focused on getting the science right, getting the fisheries access right, getting the right  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:13):**  people on the right boats and then catching the product and satisfying the bank managers.  And then once you've caught it, it's put it on the wharf, find somebody who will take  the lot at the price of the day and breathe a huge sigh of relief.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:28):**  We then sort of found that along the way, different people were quite interested in  fisheries.  So a lot of the environmental NGOs wanted to know a lot more about actually what we  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:39):**  were doing.  It was no longer adequate just to say, trust me, we're doing the right thing.  And so introduced some of these notions around third party certification for sustainability  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:51):**  in fisheries.  And that all made pretty good sense to us.  We were investing in the science already.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:57):**  We had good policy settings in place to ensure that there wasn't too much capacity in these  fisheries.  And then once you had all of that right, you then started to think, well, what might be  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:08):**  possible with brands?  And one of the young chaps in our office who was tuned into these things was paying attention  to some other branding activity in other parts of the industry and started to have a bit  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:23):**  of a play with some of these things.  That ended up quite successful.  But it's also been a bit circular.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:32):**  So once you have a brand, you have something that you need to protect and something that  you can lose.  And so premium branding, again, for primary industries, it means you've got your head  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:45):**  above the parapet.  You've got something that folks can pick on if you get something right.  And so the organizational imperative is that, unlike perhaps the low key commodity producer,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:59):**  as a branded producer, your whole world changes.  You are now in the spotlight thinking about things like social license to operate.  Where are the dirty little secrets?  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:11):**  What is it that we've got to improve in order to make sure that we're better than great  at every turn?  What's an example of that, because I imagine that for people who've been on a similar journey,  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:23):**  they get it and will be nodding their heads.  But maybe for someone who hasn't made that transition, they're not quite sure what things  like social license mean for them.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:33):**  Do you have any specific examples?  Yeah, lots.  In fisheries, the challenges, the social license challenges that we face would be bycatch issues  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:43):**  in the tropical prawn fishery.  In Southern Ocean fisheries, it's related to things like threat of illegal fishing,  perhaps potentially some of the animal welfare stuff, again, which you'll be familiar listening  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:58):**  to and those you know broadly.  More recently, we've looked at our emissions intensity, how much CO2 the business produces.  Is that a problem for consumers?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:10):**  Is that become a touch point?  There's been quite a high profile public discourse around super trawlers, so that debate becomes  another area where fisheries can be criticised.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:22):**  The rub between recreational fishing and commercial fishing also is a point at which commercial  operators can end up disadvantaged.  And then things that are much more close to home, which is a tragedy we had just over  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:35):**  six years ago with the young deckie on one of our boats.  These black swan events can come at you from any direction, whether it's your sustainability  claims, the way you're managing bycatch, the amount of fuel you're doing, or the care and  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:52):**  attention to which you pay to the crews and the people in your system.  Any one of those is an area where your reputation can take a hit.  And with a brand, you become next level vulnerable.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:06):**  What's an example of how you manage one of those situations?  Because I can't imagine those decisions are easy and the tensions between profit or telling  a good story versus kind of leaning into the fact that it might not be perfect, but we  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:20):**  have room to improve any kind of specific examples or lessons that come out of that.  Yeah, lots.  So in the sustainability space, I think we've been marked by my legacy, which has been this  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:34):**  idea of collaboration and fearless transparency.  One example around bycatch, for example, in the Northern Pawn fishery was a few years  ago recognising that all the science had been done on bycatch in that fishery.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:52):**  We knew we interacted with 400 species or so that went back into the water in various  stages of alive or dead.  And the science said that's okay.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:01):**  But we also knew that it would not pass the sniff test.  For most Australians, the idea that one kilo of tiger prawns produce 5 or 6 or 7 kilos  of dead assorted marine life is offensive.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:17):**  And so it is about confront the brutal facts.  And it's kind of that fearless, raw honesty.  And so what we did was to get the industry to agree that, yes, this was a problem.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:29):**  We made a commitment with the minister and some representatives from WWF to focus on  bycatch reduction in the fishery using essentially the innovation and creativity of the gear  makers and the fishermen themselves.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:54](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:46):**  So we said we want to find a device that can reduce bycatch by 30% in 3 years without resultant  loss of the target species being the prawns.  So there was a few that thought, oh, gee, 30%, that's a big stretch.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:04):**  What if we don't make it?  To which my response was, well, if we don't make it and we've had a good crack, we're  still winners.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:11):**  We've still demonstrated the fact that we recognize this is a problem.  And we had a good crack at dealing with it.  And most normal thinking people would say that's okay, they're dinkum about this.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:25):**  But what we achieved was in two years a device that was capable of reducing bycatch by over  30%.  And indeed, we've created almost a competitive environment amongst operators to, if you like,  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:40):**  build the better mousetrap.  And so whilst we're not there yet, the bycatch story continues to evolve.  And there's some other species that we're looking carefully at that are disproportionately  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:51):**  impacted like swordfish and that sort of thing, which we continue to manage.  But equally, I think the secret there is just this, what I'd talk about, which is putting  your dirty little secrets out there and then be authentic, transparent about how you acknowledge  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:11):**  that they are a problem and what you're doing about them.  Yeah, I mean, I guess a couple of things there, the transparency for sure and the authenticity,  but the bravery to call it out and acknowledge that it's not perfect and in fact, it needs  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:24):**  to get better.  But then also setting of a target and it sounds like a target that was pretty ambitious.  You didn't say we need to reduce it by 5%, but really held the bar out high.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:33):**  And then the part I especially like is empowering people to solve the problem and actually giving  them the autonomy and the encouragement to say you're on the front lines, help us figure  this out because they probably know better than someone sitting back in the office.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:48):**  Yeah.  And there was a cash reward involved.  They were appropriately incentivized.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:53):**  So it was more than just altruism, but it was altruism that saw the industry leadership.  So yes, this is important and we'll make this cash available for a winner based on these  rules and we were happy to write the cheque.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:08):**  That's awesome.  Can you say how much it was for?  25 grand.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:12):**  Nice.  And it was just one winner?  One winner, but there's been subsequent winners who haven't had anything for their labors.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:19):**  And they've built on that work and produced further refinements that are more effective  again.  Nice.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:27):**  The other one you mentioned that I wanted to come back to was on some of the other drivers  from consumers in particular around the environment and you guys going down the path of being  carbon neutral.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:38):**  How did that decision come about and how much was it driven by consumers, by potential premiums?  What was the thinking there?  Yeah, interesting.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:49):**  So there's a whole bunch of stuff.  Again, some of these unlikely alliances.  I'm just going to step back before I step forward here, but when a few years ago Sea  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:57):**  Shepherd took an interest in illegal toothfish boats in the Southern Ocean, that was a pretty  scary moment.  And we've been, if you like, warned by some of the moderate NGOs to say, we will be careful.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:09):**  They're a bit crazy, those guys.  But again, we engaged, we've had an extraordinary relationship.  It resulted in a more or less collaboration that helped them secure the location.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:23):**  And finally a 110 day pursuit of a boat called the, an illegal fishing boat called the Thunder.  If any of you viewers get a chance, the documentary that deals with that is extraordinary.  And our small cameo role there involved one of our vessels joining in briefly in the pursuit  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:42):**  of the West Coast of Africa.  About days before the boat that they were pursuing was scuttled by the master of said  vessel and rescued by the Sea Shepherd crew and taken to a local jurisdiction where they  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:55):**  were successfully prosecuted.  So our relationship with Sea Shepherd is now rich and deep.  The work includes us funding some beach cleanup work they're doing in plastics up in the Gulf  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:09):**  of Carpentaria area.  And we have levels of furious agreement around the need for greater climate ambition, the  need for dealing with illegal fishing globally and trying to do something with marine ocean  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:24):**  plastics.  And so you'd say, well, there's an unlikely Alliance.  There's an NGO powered by vegans working collaboratively with a fishing company whose job it is to provide  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:37):**  protein for carnivores.  But on any measure, it's a unique and even I'd say a loving relationship where on those  things that are of mutual importance to us, we're really powerful allies.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:53):**  What was the initial conversation like when you did you reach out to them and then was  there resistance on their side?  If so?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:01):**  It began curiously with the Senate inquiry into affairs in sub-Antarctic.  One of our guys met with Jeff Hanson, who's the CEO of Perth Post.  We'd seen some of these social media posts, particularly about toothfish, they were still  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:15):**  learning their way.  Said colleague would go back diligently and say, no, you've got that wrong, but that's  right.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:22):**  Or you could say this differently.  And then gradually, yeah, we got up, we had a lunch and a few lunches and it's been some  amazing collaborations.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:34):**  We have a decent amount of Sea Shepherd stuff in our house because my partner's last name  is Shepherd.  And so for purely selfish reasons, he likes to buy their stuff.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:44):**  Very good.  And they're doing great work.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:49):**  So you had started telling that story from my question about carbon neutral and what  some of the drivers were there.  So help me connect those dots.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:57):**  Yeah, so I think again, we'd gone, I'm going to go back again.  Sorry to be difficult.  But 20 years ago we were involved in another collaboration that was the love child of Unilever,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:11):**  the big European heavyweight food manufacturer and WWF and created a thing called the Marine  Stewardship Council.  That's an initiative that provides third party sustainability certification for fisheries  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:24):**  or wild fisheries.  We were as a business, the first commercial supporter in the world to sign up to that.  And for us, it was a no brainer.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:34):**  It was just a chance to have vindicated the good work that we'd done in providing good  science based, good governance controls and a good understanding of fisheries impact on  ecosystems as a part of market facing proposition.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:50):**  So we were, here we were with a certification that could reward us for the work we're already  doing.  Was it really a no brainer?  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:57):**  Like, I'll push you a little bit on that because I imagine in hindsight now that it's become  such a bigger issue, it very much was.  But at the time I can imagine it wasn't that easy of a decision.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:08):**  It was 21 years ago, no.  In those days, the NGOs and the industry were at war.  The industry folk that we were dealing with was like, oh, be careful, you're feeding the  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:20):**  crocodile here.  You're going to get snapped.  But it's now ubiquitous, as you say.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:26):**  And I think, again, that's one of the one of the blessings of the legacy I inherit from  those that have gone before is that it was their leadership and the fundamental belief  in the value of the consumer facing sustainability claim as a tool for lifting really global  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:47):**  fisheries management practices.  As the fishing industry evolved and more companies got on board with sustainable management and  best practices, David, now CEO, knew that Austral needed to continue to innovate and  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:00):**  work to maintain the brand reputation that they'd worked so hard to earn.  So we've done all of those things and we got to that point where sort of the world had  caught up.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:09):**  So it seemed like everybody had MSC certification and they were doing other stuff and there  was all this haha.  And we got to that view where we thought, well, what does a progressive business do  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:21):**  next?  Where else can we find an outlet for our progressiveness?  And there is, as I said earlier, there's a few things there.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:29):**  It could have been the embrace around marine parks or the animal welfare stuff.  It could be more on bycatch.  But I kind of got personally stuck on the whole climate thing and fuel.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:42):**  Our fuel burns about 8 or 9 million litres a year.  And it's not that much when you figure we produce probably 4,000 odd tonnes of seafood,  but it just seemed like something that we could usefully do given that we see the impacts  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:57):**  of climate change almost daily in our business.  And it would be a bit churlish of us to be complaining or calling for greater action  on climate policy if we are ourselves a contributor.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:12):**  And so we did a fair bit of work looking at what that social license ingredient would  look like, what sort of reporting standards could we adopt, what kind of offsets could  be used and what kind of claim could we make.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:25):**  And there is still quite a confusing area, but we signed up to the Australian Federal  Government what was then the National Carbon Offset Standard.  We used some biodiverse carbon credits from a WA project and we took the plunge just over  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:44):**  four years ago with Julie Bishop, who was then foreign minister and who was not recently  off the back of the famous conference of parties that was in Paris to talk about global ambition  around climate.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:57):**  So that became a bit of a thing.  It was kind of like jumping off the 10 metre platform into the pool without any water in  it.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:08):**  Is that really how it felt?  Yeah, a little bit.  Because you were worried about the response from consumers and it like greenwashing or  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:16):**  what was the fear?  Yeah, a combination.  Yes, sort of the risk of opprobrium from our industry peers.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:25):**  We do like to conform, I guess as people we like to be viewed as kind of on the game.  So yeah, there was that fear.  There's the fear that having made this commitment, you've got to live it.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:37):**  And there's kind of no turning back.  And that's a pretty big call to make those sorts of promises.  And the uncertainty around is the market ready for this?  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:46):**  So I'm still firmly of the view that these things do have a value and that the right  consumers will pay a premium for that kind of progressiveness.  But four years ago, things are arguably different than they are today.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:03):**  So we've certainly had some benefit from the plunge, whether it's fully covered all those  costs, which is kind of really difficult to measure.  But being able to fold those thoughts and those values and those tangibles into the  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:20):**  brands that we have, you at least have a head start in being able to do what I'm describing  is unlock the value of our values in our supply chain.  The theme of making tough decisions around that kind of alignment to consumers, but also  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:39):**  the transparency and authenticity, like really consistently making those decisions even when  they're hard.  How is that playing out in the current world with coronavirus?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:49):**  Are there kind of tough decisions that you're facing now and trying to bring through that  same culture and values in this new scenario?  Yeah, I think as I sort of reflect on how we roll and who we are, I think if we've had  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:04):**  any success or if we've had a theme that it's been tended to do the right thing, not the  easy thing.  So whether it's with partnerships with Sea Shepherd or being the first MSC supporters  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:17):**  or going carbon neutral, it's the right thing.  Carbon neutral hasn't always been the cheapest thing either, by the way.  Probably more often than it's not the cheapest.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:28):**  But yeah, right now we're challenged.  So in a commercial sense, you're in a position where we've got customers that have contracted  cargos at pre-coronavirus levels and they're saying, my business doesn't exist anymore.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:42):**  Can you take this cargo back?  Can we renegotiate the price?  Now it's kind of instinctive for us to say, yeah, you're part of the family.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:51):**  We're in this for the long haul.  We're going to look after you.  But we've got other examples where suppliers to us are saying, no, the deal is not negotiable.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:00):**  You sign, suck it up.  Some of those are big numbers and that's a bit scary.  And you say, well, to what extent is that right?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:08):**  And how will that play out in a longer term relationship?  And we might end up parting company.  What are your thoughts on the kind of longer term, how supply chains in, especially in  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:22):**  the fisheries industry will change?  Yeah, it has been consuming me.  I can imagine.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:31):**  I think supply chains will shorten.  And we've seen some of that.  I think I just hope I'm not drinking my own cordial here.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:40):**  I think what we've been doing with Providence and Story and Local and Quality, I think that  that's still going to rule.  That's still going to be important.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:51):**  And I think brands, we're just seeing some early evidence that brands are still more  important than ever.  So yes, there's some significant changes.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:02):**  The way we work and play, the way we entertain and eat, some of these changes are going to  be permanent and long term.  And just domestically, this massive shift from the food service business into the eat  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:16):**  at home space.  Just dramatic.  And being able to accommodate that.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:23):**  And right now there's definitely some winners and losers.  So the frozen seafood guys are doing better than the premium fresh chilled or live.  And God knows how long that's going to last.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:37):**  Coronavirus aside, many of these trends are long term.  And for a company like Austrol, staying ahead has been key.  David is now looking to technology to help with this.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:48):**  I think that the natural consequence of the next level in the theme, which is this broad  narrative from the fisheries, the baseline fishery stuff that's around property rights  in fisheries, having that access, then investing in the science, and then having those third  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:07):**  party indoor certifications to verify that what you're doing is all best practice, to  then building and investing in the brands.  And then once you've got the brands, then it's still this challenge of telling the story.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:20):**  So it's still connecting what we do with those consumers that care about what we do.  And so we were invited to be the commercial partner in a development between Boston Consulting  Group Digital Ventures and WWF to produce a blockchain based provenance, transparency,  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:43):**  and tool platform.  Essentially what that does for consumers is allows at an individual level for consumers  to understand on a per fish basis where the product was caught, its journey to the plate,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:00):**  and anything else you want to know.  And so what's the state of the fishery that that's come from?  What's the certifications?  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:06):**  How are these carbon offsets available?  Any claim that we as a producer want to load into that platform, we can.  And then that is independently verified by a broader community who can say, yeah, we  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:21):**  can attest to that, or we can use external data to verify that that claim is accurate,  and then give consumers that confidence that they're buying the real thing.  So the platform itself does a few things for us.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:34):**  So at the back of the house, it allows us to do what we're describing is reduce some  transactional friction.  That is just to make, if you like, the paperwork of catching, reporting catches, unloading,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:48):**  selling, invoicing, all that sort of stuff easier and simpler.  At the front of the house, which I think the exciting part is the opportunity to build  a context for consumers that allow them to just get comfortable with who we are and what  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:05):**  we do with that whole authenticity piece about we're good guys, we're not perfect, we're  doing our best, we're recognising our problems, and we're working on them.  And we bring this to you with care and love.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:18):**  And then in so doing through that transparency, you build loyalty and loyalty builds premium.  So there's that piece that's going on.  And then finally, kind of the steak knives out of that proposition is, particularly in  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:33):**  that Chinese market, the idea that you can use this technology to give customers the  confidence that this brand hasn't been ripped off.  So that this food fraud issue, which is a bit of a hot topic issue, and I think it's  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:48):**  true of anything.  Once you've got a brand and a positioning that has a value above the commodity base,  then there will be those who would seek to benefit from things that look and feel and  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:02):**  smell the same but are not.  And so again, this technology allows consumers, for example, to read the code and be told,  well, you're the first one to read this, which would be very satisfying.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:13):**  But if you're the 1000th person to read this code, then maybe there's something fishy going  on.  Beyond just the transparency and protection against fraud, David sees opportunities for  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:23):**  this technology to provide data back from consumers to help the company tailor messaging  to each consumer based on what's important to them.  There's also some interesting data and it's probably this, that's some ethical questions  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:37):**  about the sort of things that you get from Google.  But if you scan this thing, we get to know your gender, obviously where you are, the  device that you've used to scan this thing.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:48):**  And that can tell us about, you know, if you've got your latest iPhone 11, then you must be  upwardly socially mobile.  Yeah, your first language and those sorts of things.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:59):**  And so you can start to, oh, and how much time you spent looking at what part of the  material that was available.  So we can start to, we get to curate messages that tell consumers kind of what they want  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:13):**  to hear.  So because the stories are so huge, you can be a consumer and say, well, really, I only  care about the culinary excellence of this product.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:22):**  So we could emphasize, this is a bit like Cambridge analytics, I suppose, we could emphasize  the high oil content, the Michelin star chefs around the world that are doing amazing things  and creating all these exotic dishes.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:37):**  And that could really inspire you.  Equally, you might be someone who's concerned about rumors of illegal fishing on this fish,  in which case we can give you a whole story about the work that's been done with all sorts  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:49):**  of other agencies and Sea Shepherd and take you to the video.  So all of those things become just a way of further building a connection.  And as I said earlier, this opportunity to unlock the value of our values.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:02):**  You can tell in speaking with David that he truly believes that doing the right thing,  even when it means tough decisions, is what will win out and that consumers will continue  to demand this more and more.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:14):**  It sort of also speaks to the idea that for a lot of these bigger things, whether it's  the climate policy stuff or beneficiaries management outcome or trying to stop so much  plastic getting into oceans, we're able to recognize that our role as a business is not  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:29):**  just to paying the shareholders a dividend.  And it's my view that business that's not relevant to its communities and the environment  more broadly, their days are numbered and that it's not a zero sum game.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:44):**  So we can do all these other good things and consumers will respond to that and shareholders  will benefit.  We will perform financially.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:56):**  My experience with fisheries is much more limited than other areas of agriculture.  But in grad school, when I was at MIT, we played a simulation game called Fish Banks.  I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but you have heard of it?  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:09):**  Yep.  So we played that and it's in fisheries simulation and you've got your fleet and you're in your  ocean and there's other fleets in other oceans and you're trying to be a business and operate  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:20):**  and you inevitably end up in a challenge of the commons, governing the commons issue where  you're like, right before the regulator comes in, we should all come up with the right principles  to manage the fishery.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:32):**  But your own self-interest is like, well, I'll just say that I'm going to do that and  then I'll go fish and make that last little bit of profit.  And it's so effective in highlighting even for a class of sustainability grad students  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:43):**  that kind of couldn't, you know, sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that couldn't really  get more aligned to what you think was the target kind of sustainability outcomes.  And you've got people cheating and lying and stealing within 25 minutes in this simulation  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:56):**  and there's 25 bucks on the line.  It was astounding to me.  But what you, yeah, well, I guess why I tell that story is to ask about the tension between  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:07):**  being a good citizen and the commercial interest.  And it seems like you guys have aligned both and that's in the DNA and you've made some  tough decisions and they've paid off for the heaven, but that's part of who you guys are.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:19):**  Is that ever hard if others aren't being good actors in that tension of being the individual  versus the industry?  Yes and no.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:31):**  So the benefit and the privilege, I guess, of having been involved in this one business  for this period is that the shareholders of my board, right or wrong, have an implicit  trust in me.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:45):**  I have an extraordinary level of kind of autonomy.  I feel that pressure.  So if I do, say, lead on this carbon neutral stuff, you know, I really do feel an obligation  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:58):**  to deliver.  So that makes me pretty fired up.  And yes, I'm disappointed when I see examples of short sighted greed in my industry colleagues,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:11):**  but I think it just leaves me more resolved to feel that we're playing our game.  We'll do what we can.  And if in being held to, say, a higher account, we're able to inspire others to follow us,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:28):**  then I feel we've had a win.  And one of the laments is that in this carbon neutral space in particular, now four years  on, we're still the only carbon neutral fishing company on the planet.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:40):**  So I can't have been that clever.  Well, it'll be interesting to see what changes.  It's definitely a shift in agriculture more broadly towards carbon neutral through a combination  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:49):**  of offsets and reductions in emission and technology that can drive those efficiencies.  But in almost all cases, there's still a long way to go.  Well, again, I think I reflect on a career where we've been privileged to have worthy  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:06):**  challenges, right?  Whether it's illegal fishing or restructuring the northern prawn fishery or indeed the death  of Ryan Donoghue and potentially COVID-19.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:17):**  They are the tests that prove the metal.  They are the ultimate measure of commitment to the values and the way you're wrong.  David, thank you so much.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:27):**  I really appreciate the candor and the stories that you've told there.  I think it will be interesting for an audience that usually hears about land-based agriculture,  but another really important part of the broader industry.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:37):**  So thank you so much for taking the time, especially when there's many other things  that could be and I'm sure are on your mind these days.  Yeah, it's actually nice.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:46):**  It's nice relief.  Thank you for joining us on another episode of Ag Tech So What.  You can stay up to date with the latest episodes and news at agtechsowhat.com.

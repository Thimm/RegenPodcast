### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 20:09:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast brought to you by Agthentic.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:06):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:08):**  Today I chat with an expert in a very different kind of agriculture, fisheries.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:13):**  David Carter is the CEO of Austral Fisheries and he shares how his career has taken him  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:19):**  from deckhand to CEO and some of the tough decisions he's made in his efforts to use  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:25):**  business to address social and environmental challenges.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:29):**  It surprised me how many common themes there are between what's happening in fisheries  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:33):**  and other types of agriculture.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:35):**  Things like social license, the challenges of moving from a commodity to a branded premium  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:41):**  product, the use of technology to bring transparency to consumers and increasing pressures and  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:47):**  opportunities to become carbon neutral.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:50):**  But before we get to all of that, David's story starts out back in 1978, not as CEO,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:00:57):**  but as a failed vet with a passion for the ocean.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:01):**  Here's David.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:02):**  I'm a failed vet.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:04](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:03):**  I'm a son of a vet, right?  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:04):**  So I'm a failed vet and I failed everything else.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:07):**  And that's like the last time I entered my entrance score, let me into zoology at Melbourne  
**[0:01:13-0:01:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:13):**  with a bit of a marine.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:14):**  So I fly, but it was just sort of follow an interest.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:17):**  I'd been doing a lot of sailing.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:19):**  I've done Sydney Hobart and Melbourne Hobart yacht races, done scuba diving around, around  
**[0:01:25-0:01:32](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:25):**  and best, great generally living the life of a Bohemian and figured, well, somebody  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:32):**  had said, if you can do what you love, then you never work a day in your life.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:36):**  So that was, that was broadly the strategy, but it was a fairly rough plan.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:41):**  But at that stage it involved rather than a Google, but it involved the trip to the  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:47):**  post office and wading through, I don't know, 40 different versions of yellow pages for  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:52):**  the country and writing to anybody I thought was in the fish business that might be able  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:01:58):**  to use a Bohemian like myself.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:01):**  And the end game was a couple of responses from Western Australia and my dear mother  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:09):**  stumped up the airfares to bring me over and have those couple of interviews.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:13):**  And finally I signed up with, well, it was a two hour meeting when Murray France did  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:19):**  all the talking and he said a week later I was on a fishing boat out of Darwin as a trainee  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:26):**  millionaire still in training.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:29):**  David was part of a newly created management training program where he'd start as a deck  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:33):**  hand and learn about all aspects of working as a fisherman.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:37):**  And then perhaps if he did well, move into management.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:41):**  So what was it like to be a deck hand at that time?  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:44):**  Well, for starters, there was no internet.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:46):**  I went to sea two weeks before my 21st birthday and I was just too shit scared to mention  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:51):**  to anybody that I'd turned 21.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:53):**  Plus there was some obscure, either too unknown hazing ceremony that I was going to be subjected  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:02:59):**  to.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:00):**  But all that ran amuck.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:02):**  And before telephones and wifi and WhatsApp and all the technology, we had radio telephones.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:08):**  So my darling mother got on the radio telephone through Darwin Radio and proceeded to tell  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:15):**  the world it was my 21st birthday because people just for sport back in those days used  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:19):**  to listen to the radio telephone calls.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:22):**  It was quite humorous.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:24):**  Anyway, there was no hazing.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:26):**  There might've been an eight ounce glass of whiskey involved at some point, but I got  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:33):**  off easy.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:34):**  The company today is called Austro Fisheries, but back then it was called KFV Fisheries.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:41):**  David had various roles from deck hand to ship builder and eventually into management  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:46):**  where he was able to watch the company and the industry evolve.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:51):**  It was a monster operation.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:53):**  Townsville base, 33 boats.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:54):**  We had our own floating dry dock, a factory for processing prawns.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:03:59):**  We dealt with a facility in Karumba that had to support these boats.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:04):**  We bought a mother ship that was supporting them.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:06):**  So every one of these involved different set of challenges.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:10):**  There was then fuel shocks of the eighties where supply was short and we had to put in  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:16):**  our own fuel storage capability.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:20):**  And so it was just a magnificent series of challenges.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:23):**  But then as the fishery started to struggle with that much pressure, things went in reverse.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:28):**  So suddenly we had all these boats that were surplus to requirement and we started operating  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:34):**  in Burma, in Papua New Guinea or West Eirean.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:38):**  We had boats that ended up off the coast of Oman.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:41):**  There was different boats through the Arabian Gulf.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:44):**  Again, every one of those was just another extraordinary adventure.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:49):**  As David gained more experience and moved into more senior roles, he started to see  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:53):**  opportunities to improve the business, to respond to demands from consumers and to move  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:04:58):**  from a commodity to a branded premium product.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:03):**  So for most of my career, we've just been basic commodity producers, just completely  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:08):**  focused on getting the science right, getting the fisheries access right, getting the right  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:13):**  people on the right boats and then catching the product and satisfying the bank managers.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:19):**  And then once you've caught it, it's put it on the wharf, find somebody who will take  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:23):**  the lot at the price of the day and breathe a huge sigh of relief.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:28):**  We then sort of found that along the way, different people were quite interested in  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:33):**  fisheries.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:34):**  So a lot of the environmental NGOs wanted to know a lot more about actually what we  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:39):**  were doing.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:40):**  It was no longer adequate just to say, trust me, we're doing the right thing.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:45):**  And so introduced some of these notions around third party certification for sustainability  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:51):**  in fisheries.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:52):**  And that all made pretty good sense to us.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:55):**  We were investing in the science already.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:05:57):**  We had good policy settings in place to ensure that there wasn't too much capacity in these  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:02):**  fisheries.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:03):**  And then once you had all of that right, you then started to think, well, what might be  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:08):**  possible with brands?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:11):**  And one of the young chaps in our office who was tuned into these things was paying attention  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:17):**  to some other branding activity in other parts of the industry and started to have a bit  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:23):**  of a play with some of these things.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:25):**  That ended up quite successful.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:28):**  But it's also been a bit circular.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:32):**  So once you have a brand, you have something that you need to protect and something that  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:37):**  you can lose.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:39):**  And so premium branding, again, for primary industries, it means you've got your head  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:45):**  above the parapet.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:47):**  You've got something that folks can pick on if you get something right.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:52):**  And so the organizational imperative is that, unlike perhaps the low key commodity producer,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:06:59):**  as a branded producer, your whole world changes.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:03):**  You are now in the spotlight thinking about things like social license to operate.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:08):**  Where are the dirty little secrets?  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:11):**  What is it that we've got to improve in order to make sure that we're better than great  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:17):**  at every turn?  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:19):**  What's an example of that, because I imagine that for people who've been on a similar journey,  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:23):**  they get it and will be nodding their heads.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:25):**  But maybe for someone who hasn't made that transition, they're not quite sure what things  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:31):**  like social license mean for them.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:33):**  Do you have any specific examples?  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:35):**  Yeah, lots.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:38):**  In fisheries, the challenges, the social license challenges that we face would be bycatch issues  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:43):**  in the tropical prawn fishery.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:46):**  In Southern Ocean fisheries, it's related to things like threat of illegal fishing,  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:53):**  perhaps potentially some of the animal welfare stuff, again, which you'll be familiar listening  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:07:58):**  to and those you know broadly.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:01):**  More recently, we've looked at our emissions intensity, how much CO2 the business produces.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:08):**  Is that a problem for consumers?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:10):**  Is that become a touch point?  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:12):**  There's been quite a high profile public discourse around super trawlers, so that debate becomes  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:18):**  another area where fisheries can be criticised.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:22):**  The rub between recreational fishing and commercial fishing also is a point at which commercial  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:27):**  operators can end up disadvantaged.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:30):**  And then things that are much more close to home, which is a tragedy we had just over  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:35):**  six years ago with the young deckie on one of our boats.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:41):**  These black swan events can come at you from any direction, whether it's your sustainability  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:46):**  claims, the way you're managing bycatch, the amount of fuel you're doing, or the care and  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:52):**  attention to which you pay to the crews and the people in your system.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:08:57):**  Any one of those is an area where your reputation can take a hit.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:02):**  And with a brand, you become next level vulnerable.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:06):**  What's an example of how you manage one of those situations?  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:09):**  Because I can't imagine those decisions are easy and the tensions between profit or telling  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:15):**  a good story versus kind of leaning into the fact that it might not be perfect, but we  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:20):**  have room to improve any kind of specific examples or lessons that come out of that.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:26):**  Yeah, lots.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:27):**  So in the sustainability space, I think we've been marked by my legacy, which has been this  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:34):**  idea of collaboration and fearless transparency.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:39):**  One example around bycatch, for example, in the Northern Pawn fishery was a few years  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:46):**  ago recognising that all the science had been done on bycatch in that fishery.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:52):**  We knew we interacted with 400 species or so that went back into the water in various  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:09:58):**  stages of alive or dead.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:00):**  And the science said that's okay.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:01):**  But we also knew that it would not pass the sniff test.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:05):**  For most Australians, the idea that one kilo of tiger prawns produce 5 or 6 or 7 kilos  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:13):**  of dead assorted marine life is offensive.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:17):**  And so it is about confront the brutal facts.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:21):**  And it's kind of that fearless, raw honesty.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:24):**  And so what we did was to get the industry to agree that, yes, this was a problem.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:29):**  We made a commitment with the minister and some representatives from WWF to focus on  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:37):**  bycatch reduction in the fishery using essentially the innovation and creativity of the gear  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:44):**  makers and the fishermen themselves.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:54](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:46):**  So we said we want to find a device that can reduce bycatch by 30% in 3 years without resultant  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:54):**  loss of the target species being the prawns.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:10:58):**  So there was a few that thought, oh, gee, 30%, that's a big stretch.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:04):**  What if we don't make it?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:06):**  To which my response was, well, if we don't make it and we've had a good crack, we're  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:10):**  still winners.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:11):**  We've still demonstrated the fact that we recognize this is a problem.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:15):**  And we had a good crack at dealing with it.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:18):**  And most normal thinking people would say that's okay, they're dinkum about this.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:25):**  But what we achieved was in two years a device that was capable of reducing bycatch by over  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:33):**  30%.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:34):**  And indeed, we've created almost a competitive environment amongst operators to, if you like,  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:40):**  build the better mousetrap.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:42):**  And so whilst we're not there yet, the bycatch story continues to evolve.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:47):**  And there's some other species that we're looking carefully at that are disproportionately  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:51):**  impacted like swordfish and that sort of thing, which we continue to manage.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:11:58):**  But equally, I think the secret there is just this, what I'd talk about, which is putting  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:05):**  your dirty little secrets out there and then be authentic, transparent about how you acknowledge  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:11):**  that they are a problem and what you're doing about them.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:14):**  Yeah, I mean, I guess a couple of things there, the transparency for sure and the authenticity,  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:20):**  but the bravery to call it out and acknowledge that it's not perfect and in fact, it needs  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:24):**  to get better.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:25):**  But then also setting of a target and it sounds like a target that was pretty ambitious.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:29):**  You didn't say we need to reduce it by 5%, but really held the bar out high.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:33):**  And then the part I especially like is empowering people to solve the problem and actually giving  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:39):**  them the autonomy and the encouragement to say you're on the front lines, help us figure  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:45):**  this out because they probably know better than someone sitting back in the office.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:49):**  And there was a cash reward involved.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:51):**  They were appropriately incentivized.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:53):**  So it was more than just altruism, but it was altruism that saw the industry leadership.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:12:59):**  So yes, this is important and we'll make this cash available for a winner based on these  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:03):**  rules and we were happy to write the cheque.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:08):**  That's awesome.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:09):**  Can you say how much it was for?  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:11):**  25 grand.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:12):**  Nice.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:13):**  And it was just one winner?  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:15):**  One winner, but there's been subsequent winners who haven't had anything for their labors.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:19):**  And they've built on that work and produced further refinements that are more effective  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:25):**  again.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:26):**  Nice.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:27):**  The other one you mentioned that I wanted to come back to was on some of the other drivers  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:32):**  from consumers in particular around the environment and you guys going down the path of being  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:37):**  carbon neutral.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:38):**  How did that decision come about and how much was it driven by consumers, by potential premiums?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:46):**  What was the thinking there?  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:47):**  Yeah, interesting.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:49):**  So there's a whole bunch of stuff.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:50):**  Again, some of these unlikely alliances.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:53):**  I'm just going to step back before I step forward here, but when a few years ago Sea  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:13:57):**  Shepherd took an interest in illegal toothfish boats in the Southern Ocean, that was a pretty  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:02):**  scary moment.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:03):**  And we've been, if you like, warned by some of the moderate NGOs to say, we will be careful.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:09):**  They're a bit crazy, those guys.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:11):**  But again, we engaged, we've had an extraordinary relationship.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:23](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:15):**  It resulted in a more or less collaboration that helped them secure the location.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:23):**  And finally a 110 day pursuit of a boat called the, an illegal fishing boat called the Thunder.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:29):**  If any of you viewers get a chance, the documentary that deals with that is extraordinary.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:36):**  And our small cameo role there involved one of our vessels joining in briefly in the pursuit  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:42):**  of the West Coast of Africa.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:45):**  About days before the boat that they were pursuing was scuttled by the master of said  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:49):**  vessel and rescued by the Sea Shepherd crew and taken to a local jurisdiction where they  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:55):**  were successfully prosecuted.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:14:57):**  So our relationship with Sea Shepherd is now rich and deep.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:02):**  The work includes us funding some beach cleanup work they're doing in plastics up in the Gulf  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:09):**  of Carpentaria area.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:11):**  And we have levels of furious agreement around the need for greater climate ambition, the  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:18):**  need for dealing with illegal fishing globally and trying to do something with marine ocean  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:24):**  plastics.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:25):**  And so you'd say, well, there's an unlikely Alliance.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:27):**  There's an NGO powered by vegans working collaboratively with a fishing company whose job it is to provide  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:37):**  protein for carnivores.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:48](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:39):**  But on any measure, it's a unique and even I'd say a loving relationship where on those  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:48):**  things that are of mutual importance to us, we're really powerful allies.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:53):**  What was the initial conversation like when you did you reach out to them and then was  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:15:57):**  there resistance on their side?  
**[0:16:00-0:16:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:00):**  If so?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:01):**  It began curiously with the Senate inquiry into affairs in sub-Antarctic.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:06):**  One of our guys met with Jeff Hanson, who's the CEO of Perth Post.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:11):**  We'd seen some of these social media posts, particularly about toothfish, they were still  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:15):**  learning their way.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:16):**  Said colleague would go back diligently and say, no, you've got that wrong, but that's  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:21):**  right.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:22):**  Or you could say this differently.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:32](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:24):**  And then gradually, yeah, we got up, we had a lunch and a few lunches and it's been some  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:32):**  amazing collaborations.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:34):**  We have a decent amount of Sea Shepherd stuff in our house because my partner's last name  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:38):**  is Shepherd.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:39):**  And so for purely selfish reasons, he likes to buy their stuff.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:44):**  Very good.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:45):**  And they're doing great work.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:48):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:49):**  So you had started telling that story from my question about carbon neutral and what  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:54):**  some of the drivers were there.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:56):**  So help me connect those dots.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:16:57):**  Yeah, so I think again, we'd gone, I'm going to go back again.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:02):**  Sorry to be difficult.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:03):**  But 20 years ago we were involved in another collaboration that was the love child of Unilever,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:11):**  the big European heavyweight food manufacturer and WWF and created a thing called the Marine  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:17):**  Stewardship Council.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:20):**  That's an initiative that provides third party sustainability certification for fisheries  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:24):**  or wild fisheries.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:26):**  We were as a business, the first commercial supporter in the world to sign up to that.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:33):**  And for us, it was a no brainer.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:34):**  It was just a chance to have vindicated the good work that we'd done in providing good  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:40):**  science based, good governance controls and a good understanding of fisheries impact on  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:45):**  ecosystems as a part of market facing proposition.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:50):**  So we were, here we were with a certification that could reward us for the work we're already  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:55):**  doing.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:56):**  Was it really a no brainer?  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:17:57):**  Like, I'll push you a little bit on that because I imagine in hindsight now that it's become  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:01):**  such a bigger issue, it very much was.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:04):**  But at the time I can imagine it wasn't that easy of a decision.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:08):**  It was 21 years ago, no.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:10):**  In those days, the NGOs and the industry were at war.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:16):**  The industry folk that we were dealing with was like, oh, be careful, you're feeding the  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:20):**  crocodile here.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:21):**  You're going to get snapped.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:23):**  But it's now ubiquitous, as you say.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:26):**  And I think, again, that's one of the one of the blessings of the legacy I inherit from  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:32):**  those that have gone before is that it was their leadership and the fundamental belief  
**[0:18:38-0:18:47](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:38):**  in the value of the consumer facing sustainability claim as a tool for lifting really global  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:47):**  fisheries management practices.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:50):**  As the fishing industry evolved and more companies got on board with sustainable management and  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:18:54):**  best practices, David, now CEO, knew that Austral needed to continue to innovate and  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:00):**  work to maintain the brand reputation that they'd worked so hard to earn.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:05):**  So we've done all of those things and we got to that point where sort of the world had  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:08):**  caught up.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:09):**  So it seemed like everybody had MSC certification and they were doing other stuff and there  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:14):**  was all this haha.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:16):**  And we got to that view where we thought, well, what does a progressive business do  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:21):**  next?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:22):**  Where else can we find an outlet for our progressiveness?  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:27):**  And there is, as I said earlier, there's a few things there.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:29):**  It could have been the embrace around marine parks or the animal welfare stuff.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:33):**  It could be more on bycatch.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:36):**  But I kind of got personally stuck on the whole climate thing and fuel.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:42):**  Our fuel burns about 8 or 9 million litres a year.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:46):**  And it's not that much when you figure we produce probably 4,000 odd tonnes of seafood,  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:52):**  but it just seemed like something that we could usefully do given that we see the impacts  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:19:57):**  of climate change almost daily in our business.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:02):**  And it would be a bit churlish of us to be complaining or calling for greater action  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:06):**  on climate policy if we are ourselves a contributor.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:12):**  And so we did a fair bit of work looking at what that social license ingredient would  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:18):**  look like, what sort of reporting standards could we adopt, what kind of offsets could  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:22):**  be used and what kind of claim could we make.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:25):**  And there is still quite a confusing area, but we signed up to the Australian Federal  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:31):**  Government what was then the National Carbon Offset Standard.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:44](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:34):**  We used some biodiverse carbon credits from a WA project and we took the plunge just over  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:44):**  four years ago with Julie Bishop, who was then foreign minister and who was not recently  
**[0:20:49-0:20:56](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:49):**  off the back of the famous conference of parties that was in Paris to talk about global ambition  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:56):**  around climate.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:20:57):**  So that became a bit of a thing.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:01):**  It was kind of like jumping off the 10 metre platform into the pool without any water in  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:07):**  it.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:08):**  Is that really how it felt?  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:09):**  Yeah, a little bit.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:11):**  Because you were worried about the response from consumers and it like greenwashing or  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:16):**  what was the fear?  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:18):**  Yeah, a combination.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:20):**  Yes, sort of the risk of opprobrium from our industry peers.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:25):**  We do like to conform, I guess as people we like to be viewed as kind of on the game.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:30):**  So yeah, there was that fear.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:32):**  There's the fear that having made this commitment, you've got to live it.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:37):**  And there's kind of no turning back.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:39):**  And that's a pretty big call to make those sorts of promises.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:43):**  And the uncertainty around is the market ready for this?  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:46):**  So I'm still firmly of the view that these things do have a value and that the right  
**[0:21:51-0:21:59](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:51):**  consumers will pay a premium for that kind of progressiveness.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:21:59):**  But four years ago, things are arguably different than they are today.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:03):**  So we've certainly had some benefit from the plunge, whether it's fully covered all those  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:10):**  costs, which is kind of really difficult to measure.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:14):**  But being able to fold those thoughts and those values and those tangibles into the  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:20):**  brands that we have, you at least have a head start in being able to do what I'm describing  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:27):**  is unlock the value of our values in our supply chain.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:33):**  The theme of making tough decisions around that kind of alignment to consumers, but also  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:39):**  the transparency and authenticity, like really consistently making those decisions even when  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:43):**  they're hard.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:45):**  How is that playing out in the current world with coronavirus?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:49):**  Are there kind of tough decisions that you're facing now and trying to bring through that  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:54):**  same culture and values in this new scenario?  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:22:58):**  Yeah, I think as I sort of reflect on how we roll and who we are, I think if we've had  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:04):**  any success or if we've had a theme that it's been tended to do the right thing, not the  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:10):**  easy thing.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:11):**  So whether it's with partnerships with Sea Shepherd or being the first MSC supporters  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:17):**  or going carbon neutral, it's the right thing.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:22):**  Carbon neutral hasn't always been the cheapest thing either, by the way.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:26):**  Probably more often than it's not the cheapest.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:28):**  But yeah, right now we're challenged.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:31):**  So in a commercial sense, you're in a position where we've got customers that have contracted  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:36):**  cargos at pre-coronavirus levels and they're saying, my business doesn't exist anymore.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:42):**  Can you take this cargo back?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:43):**  Can we renegotiate the price?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:45):**  Now it's kind of instinctive for us to say, yeah, you're part of the family.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:51):**  We're in this for the long haul.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:52):**  We're going to look after you.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:23:53):**  But we've got other examples where suppliers to us are saying, no, the deal is not negotiable.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:00):**  You sign, suck it up.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:02):**  Some of those are big numbers and that's a bit scary.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:05):**  And you say, well, to what extent is that right?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:08):**  And how will that play out in a longer term relationship?  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:12):**  And we might end up parting company.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:17):**  What are your thoughts on the kind of longer term, how supply chains in, especially in  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:22):**  the fisheries industry will change?  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:24):**  Yeah, it has been consuming me.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:28):**  I can imagine.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:31):**  I think supply chains will shorten.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:34):**  And we've seen some of that.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:36):**  I think I just hope I'm not drinking my own cordial here.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:40):**  I think what we've been doing with Providence and Story and Local and Quality, I think that  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:47):**  that's still going to rule.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:49):**  That's still going to be important.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:51):**  And I think brands, we're just seeing some early evidence that brands are still more  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:56):**  important than ever.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:24:58):**  So yes, there's some significant changes.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:02):**  The way we work and play, the way we entertain and eat, some of these changes are going to  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:08):**  be permanent and long term.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:10):**  And just domestically, this massive shift from the food service business into the eat  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:16):**  at home space.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:18):**  Just dramatic.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:20):**  And being able to accommodate that.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:23):**  And right now there's definitely some winners and losers.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:26):**  So the frozen seafood guys are doing better than the premium fresh chilled or live.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:33):**  And God knows how long that's going to last.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:37):**  Coronavirus aside, many of these trends are long term.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:41):**  And for a company like Austrol, staying ahead has been key.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:44):**  David is now looking to technology to help with this.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:48):**  I think that the natural consequence of the next level in the theme, which is this broad  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:25:55):**  narrative from the fisheries, the baseline fishery stuff that's around property rights  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:01):**  in fisheries, having that access, then investing in the science, and then having those third  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:07):**  party indoor certifications to verify that what you're doing is all best practice, to  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:13):**  then building and investing in the brands.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:16):**  And then once you've got the brands, then it's still this challenge of telling the story.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:20):**  So it's still connecting what we do with those consumers that care about what we do.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:26):**  And so we were invited to be the commercial partner in a development between Boston Consulting  
**[0:26:33-0:26:43](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:33):**  Group Digital Ventures and WWF to produce a blockchain based provenance, transparency,  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:43):**  and tool platform.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:46):**  Essentially what that does for consumers is allows at an individual level for consumers  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:26:53):**  to understand on a per fish basis where the product was caught, its journey to the plate,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:00):**  and anything else you want to know.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:01):**  And so what's the state of the fishery that that's come from?  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:05):**  What's the certifications?  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:06):**  How are these carbon offsets available?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:09):**  Any claim that we as a producer want to load into that platform, we can.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:14):**  And then that is independently verified by a broader community who can say, yeah, we  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:21):**  can attest to that, or we can use external data to verify that that claim is accurate,  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:27):**  and then give consumers that confidence that they're buying the real thing.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:31):**  So the platform itself does a few things for us.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:34):**  So at the back of the house, it allows us to do what we're describing is reduce some  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:40):**  transactional friction.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:43):**  That is just to make, if you like, the paperwork of catching, reporting catches, unloading,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:48):**  selling, invoicing, all that sort of stuff easier and simpler.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:53):**  At the front of the house, which I think the exciting part is the opportunity to build  
**[0:27:57-0:28:05](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:27:57):**  a context for consumers that allow them to just get comfortable with who we are and what  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:05):**  we do with that whole authenticity piece about we're good guys, we're not perfect, we're  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:10):**  doing our best, we're recognising our problems, and we're working on them.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:14):**  And we bring this to you with care and love.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:26](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:18):**  And then in so doing through that transparency, you build loyalty and loyalty builds premium.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:26):**  So there's that piece that's going on.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:28):**  And then finally, kind of the steak knives out of that proposition is, particularly in  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:33):**  that Chinese market, the idea that you can use this technology to give customers the  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:39):**  confidence that this brand hasn't been ripped off.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:42):**  So that this food fraud issue, which is a bit of a hot topic issue, and I think it's  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:48):**  true of anything.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:49):**  Once you've got a brand and a positioning that has a value above the commodity base,  
**[0:28:54-0:29:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:28:54):**  then there will be those who would seek to benefit from things that look and feel and  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:02):**  smell the same but are not.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:04):**  And so again, this technology allows consumers, for example, to read the code and be told,  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:10):**  well, you're the first one to read this, which would be very satisfying.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:13):**  But if you're the 1000th person to read this code, then maybe there's something fishy going  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:18):**  on.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:19):**  Beyond just the transparency and protection against fraud, David sees opportunities for  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:23):**  this technology to provide data back from consumers to help the company tailor messaging  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:29):**  to each consumer based on what's important to them.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:32):**  There's also some interesting data and it's probably this, that's some ethical questions  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:37):**  about the sort of things that you get from Google.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:40):**  But if you scan this thing, we get to know your gender, obviously where you are, the  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:45):**  device that you've used to scan this thing.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:48):**  And that can tell us about, you know, if you've got your latest iPhone 11, then you must be  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:53):**  upwardly socially mobile.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:55):**  Yeah, your first language and those sorts of things.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:29:59):**  And so you can start to, oh, and how much time you spent looking at what part of the  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:03):**  material that was available.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:13](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:06):**  So we can start to, we get to curate messages that tell consumers kind of what they want  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:13):**  to hear.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:14):**  So because the stories are so huge, you can be a consumer and say, well, really, I only  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:19):**  care about the culinary excellence of this product.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:22):**  So we could emphasize, this is a bit like Cambridge analytics, I suppose, we could emphasize  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:29):**  the high oil content, the Michelin star chefs around the world that are doing amazing things  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:33):**  and creating all these exotic dishes.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:37):**  And that could really inspire you.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:38):**  Equally, you might be someone who's concerned about rumors of illegal fishing on this fish,  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:43):**  in which case we can give you a whole story about the work that's been done with all sorts  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:49):**  of other agencies and Sea Shepherd and take you to the video.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:52):**  So all of those things become just a way of further building a connection.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:30:58):**  And as I said earlier, this opportunity to unlock the value of our values.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:02):**  You can tell in speaking with David that he truly believes that doing the right thing,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:07):**  even when it means tough decisions, is what will win out and that consumers will continue  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:12):**  to demand this more and more.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:14):**  It sort of also speaks to the idea that for a lot of these bigger things, whether it's  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:19):**  the climate policy stuff or beneficiaries management outcome or trying to stop so much  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:24):**  plastic getting into oceans, we're able to recognize that our role as a business is not  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:29):**  just to paying the shareholders a dividend.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:35):**  And it's my view that business that's not relevant to its communities and the environment  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:39):**  more broadly, their days are numbered and that it's not a zero sum game.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:44):**  So we can do all these other good things and consumers will respond to that and shareholders  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:51):**  will benefit.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:52):**  We will perform financially.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:31:56):**  My experience with fisheries is much more limited than other areas of agriculture.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:00):**  But in grad school, when I was at MIT, we played a simulation game called Fish Banks.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:05):**  I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but you have heard of it?  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:09):**  Yep.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:10):**  So we played that and it's in fisheries simulation and you've got your fleet and you're in your  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:16):**  ocean and there's other fleets in other oceans and you're trying to be a business and operate  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:20):**  and you inevitably end up in a challenge of the commons, governing the commons issue where  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:25):**  you're like, right before the regulator comes in, we should all come up with the right principles  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:30):**  to manage the fishery.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:32):**  But your own self-interest is like, well, I'll just say that I'm going to do that and  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:35):**  then I'll go fish and make that last little bit of profit.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:38):**  And it's so effective in highlighting even for a class of sustainability grad students  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:43):**  that kind of couldn't, you know, sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that couldn't really  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:46):**  get more aligned to what you think was the target kind of sustainability outcomes.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:52):**  And you've got people cheating and lying and stealing within 25 minutes in this simulation  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:56):**  and there's 25 bucks on the line.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:32:58):**  It was astounding to me.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:07](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:00):**  But what you, yeah, well, I guess why I tell that story is to ask about the tension between  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:07):**  being a good citizen and the commercial interest.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:11):**  And it seems like you guys have aligned both and that's in the DNA and you've made some  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:15):**  tough decisions and they've paid off for the heaven, but that's part of who you guys are.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:19):**  Is that ever hard if others aren't being good actors in that tension of being the individual  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:25):**  versus the industry?  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:27):**  Yes and no.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:38](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:31):**  So the benefit and the privilege, I guess, of having been involved in this one business  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:38):**  for this period is that the shareholders of my board, right or wrong, have an implicit  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:44):**  trust in me.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:45):**  I have an extraordinary level of kind of autonomy.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:49):**  I feel that pressure.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:51):**  So if I do, say, lead on this carbon neutral stuff, you know, I really do feel an obligation  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:58):**  to deliver.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:33:59):**  So that makes me pretty fired up.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:04):**  And yes, I'm disappointed when I see examples of short sighted greed in my industry colleagues,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:11):**  but I think it just leaves me more resolved to feel that we're playing our game.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:17):**  We'll do what we can.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:28](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:18):**  And if in being held to, say, a higher account, we're able to inspire others to follow us,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:28):**  then I feel we've had a win.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:30):**  And one of the laments is that in this carbon neutral space in particular, now four years  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:36):**  on, we're still the only carbon neutral fishing company on the planet.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:40):**  So I can't have been that clever.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:42):**  Well, it'll be interesting to see what changes.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:45):**  It's definitely a shift in agriculture more broadly towards carbon neutral through a combination  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:49):**  of offsets and reductions in emission and technology that can drive those efficiencies.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:55):**  But in almost all cases, there's still a long way to go.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:06](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:34:58):**  Well, again, I think I reflect on a career where we've been privileged to have worthy  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:06):**  challenges, right?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:07):**  Whether it's illegal fishing or restructuring the northern prawn fishery or indeed the death  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:14):**  of Ryan Donoghue and potentially COVID-19.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:20](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:17):**  They are the tests that prove the metal.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:20):**  They are the ultimate measure of commitment to the values and the way you're wrong.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:25):**  David, thank you so much.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:27):**  I really appreciate the candor and the stories that you've told there.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:30):**  I think it will be interesting for an audience that usually hears about land-based agriculture,  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:34):**  but another really important part of the broader industry.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:37):**  So thank you so much for taking the time, especially when there's many other things  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:41):**  that could be and I'm sure are on your mind these days.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:44):**  Yeah, it's actually nice.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:46):**  It's nice relief.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](http://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/david-carter-carbon-neutral-fishing#t=0:35:50):**  Thank you for joining us on another episode of Ag Tech So What.

### Agtech - So What?  (2021-01-20)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  There's nothing like starting off a conversation with a provocative statement, which is exactly  what our next guest, Gabrielle Chen, has done with the title of her new book.  Gabby is a journalist and author, and she's just started as the rural and regional editor  
**[0:00:21-0:00:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:00:21):**  at The Guardian in Australia.  She also lives on a farm in New South Wales.  The bottom line of the book is really that idea that farming and agriculture is exposed  to all of these existential problems that the world is trying to work out.  You know, where we go on climate change, how we use water more efficiently, soil loss,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:00:42):**  zoonotic diseases.  All of these issues agriculture is very exposed to.  So the world's problems are agriculture's problems, I think, like no other industry  in some ways.  Gabby's book is called Why You Should Give an F About Farming.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:00:58):**  Of course, if you're listening to this podcast, it probably means you already do.  But it's a good reminder to all of us involved in ag tech and agriculture that the average  person or eater, as Gabby calls them, is definitely not as aware of what actually happens in food  and ag as we might wish them to be.  So how do we make people give up?  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:01:17):**  I mean, how do we make them care about farming?  Even Gabby didn't really appreciate the importance and interconnectedness of ag until she found  herself on a farm.  I was a political journalist.  So I grew up in suburban Sydney and went into the media and made my way to political reporting.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:01:38):**  But it was only when I met a farmer, when was it?  In the 90s.  And as things got more serious, I moved to the farm in 1996.  And really, I still stayed fairly focused on politics for a long time.  And the farm just sort of went on around me.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:01:57):**  I was still, you know, working as a working journalist, and we had kids.  And so I'm a slow learner, I guess.  It took a long time for it to seep into me and to realize that this was actually a really  incredibly interesting industry and one that is exposed to a lot of things.  Yeah.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:02:20):**  What was it like, the original decision to move to the farm?  Like was that an easy or challenging decision to make?  Well, Sarah, you know, love is just a weird thing, isn't it?  And so I didn't really have a moment where I thought, holy shit, should I be doing this?  I just sort of dived in.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:02:43):**  I'm a bit of a survivor in the sense that, you know, some people are really connected  to place and I hadn't had that connection.  So it didn't bother me that much.  I think it was a worry for my family because my dad's from Singapore and, you know, a Chinese  Singaporean migrant.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:03:00):**  And so he had nothing, no sort of references for rural life at all.  And so I think he was possibly a bit worried.  He asked me if I'd seen Wake in Pride and I said, it's not like that bad.  So I think it didn't bother me at the time, but it was a serious transition.  It was hard at times, no doubt.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:03:25):**  I'm sure.  And I'm keen to hear more about that.  Like what you said before was that it took you a while to sort of go from the farm is  happening around you to getting involved.  How did that happen?  
**[0:03:36-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:03:36):**  So I am still largely not involved and I refer to it in the book as, you know, this is wholly  solely my husband's thing.  My interest as a political journalist, I guess, is around the policy questions that impinge  on ag and how that works for the industry, I guess, and the communities as a whole as  it's affected.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:04:01):**  But the transition, I think, was more as political debates changed and started to really examine  things like climate change.  My reporting was taking me along the Maori Darling Basin.  And so there were real fractures that I was seeing around irrigation and water debates  more generally.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:04:23):**  And all of these things were making their way into the political process.  So in the 2019 election, the reporting that I did was about very rusted on conservative  communities shaking up the way they vote.  And I was seeing political battles in some seats for the first time in forever.  And I thought, really, I've got to look at this more seriously and try and get under  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:04:50):**  the bonnet of what's happening in agriculture because it's impinging on politics.  Sure.  I would say, though, my experience has been that outsiders like myself and yourself coming  into ag can bring certainly different perspectives and hopefully sometimes interesting and helpful  perspectives.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:05:08):**  What were some of your initial reactions and experiences having come from a city background?  Well, so the whole economic signals situation in ag really surprised me, I guess.  The kind of middle family farmer, I guess, and that's very much kind of, I guess, where  we stand.  And so I'm very open about that.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:05:32):**  That's the perspective I come from.  So I don't see the very small end and I don't see the very large end.  But that sort of economic squeeze and the economic signals that say you only get a pay  rise based on yield, largely, if you're a commodity producer, that really surprised  me, the loss of, I guess, R&D, research and development.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:05:57):**  And as I got more interested in farming, I was sort of asking around like, where can  I learn about this?  Is there an extension officer that I can bring out to the place to ask what to do about this  galley that keeps washing or how to look at soil or do soil tests, like all of that infrastructure,  as I learned in the research of the book, but also in dealing with some issues on farm,  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:06:22):**  it really surprised me that that wasn't there because I'd heard that it was there previously.  And now that's changed.  And if you're the average age of an average farmer in Australia, which is late 50s, and  I'm 55, you probably, unlike me, you probably did your ag science or ag echoes or your  certificates and training, what, 30, 40 years ago, how do you keep up with this incredibly  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:06:53):**  dynamic sector that is changing literally by the day?  Some of the interviews I did for the book were just, it felt like they might be outdated,  you know, three months down the track when we went to publication.  And no one says that more than you, right?  You can see that happening.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:07:09):**  And so that all of those things really interested me.  Yeah.  Well, let's get into the book then.  So why don't you tell us about the title of the book?  But the title of the book is Why You Should Give an F About Farming.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:07:23):**  And what motivated you to write the book?  The motivation was, the last book I wrote was rusted off in 2018.  And that was very much about the politics of rural communities and why I saw that changing.  But there was only one chapter in there about agriculture.  And I covered a couple of things that I'd seen, you know, hit the political debates.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:07:46):**  And one of those was climate change.  And another was land usage fights between, say, farming and mining and that whole argument  about how we use land and who determines what land is used for.  And then, as I say, the elections rolled on, 2019 came, water shortages became a big issue  because we were in the middle of a roaring drought in the eastern states.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:08:08):**  And so I thought, I have to look at this further.  Like I have to think about whether this is the old industry that started white economy  in Australia riding off the back of sheep and is now a quaint little cottage industry,  which is sometimes how it's presented in mainstream debates, or whether it is actually still quite  central to the way we think about ourselves as a nation, but for different reasons.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:08:40):**  So the question I formulated in my head was why you should give a fig about farming or  whether indeed you should, because I might find that with lab grown food and vertical  farms in cities and all these different other ways to produce food, I might find that, you  know what, we don't have to worry about farming.  Maybe that's all done and gone and we'll just kind of limp on into the future.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:09:06):**  But in fact, I found the exact opposite for reasons I outline in the book.  Yeah.  And it ends up being a bit of a call to action that all of us, whether we're consumers or  eaters as you call them and live in cities, do need to think more about our food.  Tell me at least at a high level where you end up and maybe what was surprising about  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:09:28):**  that.  So the bottom line of the book is really that idea that farming and agriculture is exposed  to all of these existential problems that the world is trying to work out.  You know, where we go on climate change, how we use water more efficiently and how we will  cope with water shortages in the future.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:09:50):**  Soil loss, zoonotic diseases, we're in the middle of a pandemic that may have come out  of a wet market.  All of these issues agriculture is very exposed to.  So the world's problems are agriculture's problems, I think, like no other industry  in some ways.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:10:06):**  Then we go into this live experiment with the pandemic where we see food disappear from  shelves for sort of complex supply chain reasons.  And so I worked my way through that, but also went back because I'm in my 50s.  I began looking at politics in the 80s with the Hawke-Keating government in Australia.  And I guess the rise of a kind of market first ideology, some people refer to it as neoliberalism,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:10:34):**  but sort of annoys me that term because it pushes you into left and right camps.  So this kind of market first ideology that rises that the market is the natural system  that if everything else, all the other regulation was taken away, we are left with this natural  market system and that always produces the best outcomes.  And so I just wanted to look at that and reanalyze that and have a think about what happened  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:11:03):**  in that process.  And my contention is that somewhere in that arc from the 80s to now, there was a sweet  spot.  And sometimes in market systems, we throw the baby out with the bathwater because we  assume that all players are on a level playing field when they're clearly not.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:11:23):**  I mean, these are not deregulated markets.  These for me are reregulated markets because every, say every free trade agreement has  conditions.  Every market has conditions and regulations and legislations.  The free water market has rules around it.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:11:40):**  It is very opaque.  It's not a transparent market.  So I wanted to look at those things and just analyze and question government about why  it doesn't analyze this great experiment we've undergone in the last 40 years.  So at the end of that sort of analysis, I go into, I guess where two trends I see are  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:12:05):**  crashing into each other.  And one of those is the true cost of food is not included in the price on the supermarket  shelf.  So that is the cost of production producing that food and the cost to the natural capital  is not included in the price of food.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:12:22):**  And you can have all sorts of debates about whether people can afford the true cost of  food.  That's a completely connected, but that's another argument.  But at the same time, we've got these markets, these eaters, these companies that control  a lot of supply chain saying, we want you to look after the landscape, be on top of  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:12:45):**  your animal welfare, show transparency in all of your processes.  And we want you to do it while producing a liter of milk for a dollar and a loaf of bread  for $3.  Most Aussies will remember the milk price wars, which began in 2011 and lasted eight  years as the major supermarkets dropped milk prices to as low as $1 per liter or about  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:13:09):**  $2.80 per gallon.  There are many angles to the story, but it's indicative of the pressures to keep the price  of grocery store staples low and the impact of those pressures on farmers.  And Gabby is asking, if consumers want cheap food, how do we factor in the cost of production,  let alone the cost of natural capital and social license?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:13:29):**  So I guess where I land is really questioning philosophically how we value landscape and  how we value the communities and people that look after landscape, including indigenous  people, which are a really important part of this whole kind of argument about how we  look after land in Australia.  And the thing that surprised me, I guess, was people like Ken Henry, the head of Treasury  
**[0:13:55-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:13:55):**  for a long time, Alan Schwartz, big hedge fund trader that's really looking at and questioning  where the capitalism is broken and ends up saying outright in our interview, capitalism  is broken.  We don't value the things that are important to us and will take us forward.  So it became quite a philosophical book in the end, I think.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:14:21):**  You pull the thread of a farm and you end up in fundamental questions about how we want  to organize society.  It's great you bring up Ken Henry.  We actually just had him on the podcast and he's been talking about valuing natural capital  for a while now.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:14:39):**  Some people are listening and I think the momentum is increasing.  When do you think the ideas that he's talking about and that you're talking about here will  actually become part of mainstream agriculture and everyday farming, let alone what consumers  can actually see?  I think it's already starting.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:14:58):**  In some ways, it's hard to see because the more visible voices in ag that you see often  on social media and a lot of the people I talk to purely because they're really interested  in policy and how things work and question the system or love the system.  They have opinions.  I think a large portion of agriculture still is head down, bum up, trying to just get through  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:15:28):**  the day.  I don't think people in the consumer sphere are well aware of it but I think it will happen  more.  It interests me.  Someone's got to pay for it in the end, right?  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:15:44):**  So either the farmer pays, the environment pays, the consumer pays or the government  pays or a combination of all of those plus the private markets.  I think it won't be a simple, I don't see it shaking down into the simple clear system  where it will be either all government or all private markets.  I think it will be a messy confluence of different models.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:16:09):**  The main thing that worries me though is the verification aspects.  This is a political perspective.  If you get into a space where consumers don't trust that farmers are doing the work of improving  environments and they can't see that transparent information, then you get into sports rots  territory which in Australia was about basically paying money for jam based on where your political  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:16:35):**  electorate lies.  That's the thing that really worries me about this space.  That's a kind of a useful segue into ag tech.  I worry in these conversations that I run the risk of being a techno optimist of tech  will solve all these problems and will just decrease the cost and then no one has to pay  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:16:53):**  because obviously that's not the answer.  But you do highlight the role of tech and innovation in your book and especially around  how it can help Australia to reach net zero emissions by 2050.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I interviewed you obviously for the book and there was a real point to  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:17:11):**  that because I think what worries me most about my perspective and my view is it always  comes from the fractured end of the industry because journalists by nature focus on the  breakage points or the holes.  I was worried I was a little kind of more pessimistic than maybe the average person would  be in considering agriculture.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:17:37):**  I think the thing that I took from our conversation and conversations with other people is really  there is that optimism.  And I think of my own personal experience.  We have three kids.  I suspect none of them will come back to the farm, but one of them is particularly interested  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:17:55):**  in tech and is doing computer science and maths at uni at the moment.  And the only way that we can get him interested in the farm is when we talk about tech and  talk about what's possible.  And so that to me is a real kind of personal insight into what might spark people's interest  in the future that don't necessarily come at it from the old kind of multi-generational  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:18:23):**  farm family perspective.  And the other thing is that I think I learned was that a whole lot of people can be involved  in ag for different reasons.  And often we make a big song and dance about multi-generational farmers.  Ag tech to me is such a great way into the industry for people like my son who might  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:18:46):**  not be interested in the old kind of ways that his family has been doing things for  a couple of generations, but really kind of disrupting the system in a positive way.  I'm really excited about that.  I don't think ag tech can solve everything.  It's like a tool, right?  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:19:06):**  I think you might have even said that in the book, but I think it's really exciting.  And the thing I learned about ag tech that I took away was that we often, or government  particularly thinks of ag tech as a separate industry to say ag or whatever it is, health  education.  But it's applications spread right across all of those, every area.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:19:35):**  And so I think it's a massive opportunity for Australia because we've got such brains  here, but it worries me that the government don't recognise the capacity of that in agriculture  because we still think of agriculture in very traditional ways in Australia.  So tech to me is one of those industries that I would embed in ag if I was the Queen of  Australia as a sort of standalone expertise and always refer to it and think of it when  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:20:11):**  doing ag policy work, because I just think it's a no brainer.  What else would you do if you were Queen of Australia?  If I was Queen of Australia, I would have a national backyard plan.  I would think about land in terms of national strategy and agriculture in terms of national  security and work out, like you do with your backyard.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:20:35):**  I know where my veggie garden's going.  I know where my compost is going.  I know where my gravel pit goes.  I know the nice bits where I bring guests for lunch.  I would have that for Australia because I think we've had a lot of really interesting  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:20:50):**  and good policy institutes and some really interesting and fantastic reports.  One of those was National Outlook by Ken Henry and David Thode, where they actually make  the point about what you need for land management if you want Australia to sort of leap ahead  as opposed to status quo, which I think they call slow decline.  That's the kind of two trajectories that we can think about.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:21:19):**  We're at this really strategic point now.  The government's starting to change.  Now's the time to think about an Australia-wide land usage plan and supercharging local communities.  I think the pandemic has shown us that we really need robust local and regional supply  chains as well as the global supply chains.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:21:43):**  What would a national backyard plan be these days without soil carbon?  Gabby says that the growing interest in carbon sequestration is yet another example of why  a national land usage or backyard plan is desperately needed.  Because there will be competition.  We've seen in the past competition for things like say mining and prime ag land, say on  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:22:05):**  the Liverpool Plains was the most notable example to me where you have these kind of  dumb fights.  Should I put a coal mine here or should I use this incredible land to grow food?  I don't have to think about that one for very long.  But carbon sequestration projects will also be into the mix.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:22:23):**  We're seeing that happening now in the renewable energy zone.  There's a lot of movement and excitement there about energy production.  We're going to have to work out how we're going to do all of this.  Because you put a carbon sequestration program next to it or overlay it over the top of a  local community and you're going to have political angst.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:22:48):**  I think that's why we need more sort of strategy, more foresight in a kind of regional plan  that prepares local communities not only for the changes that happen because change is  hard in some communities, but also the opportunities are there.  The opportunities and the jobs that come with that.  I'm just asking the questions.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:23:13):**  I don't have all the solutions.  But there are a whole lot of smart people out there.  There are a whole lot of reports lying in bottom drawers that have some of these solutions.  I think aggregating that stuff and looking at the industry agriculture with tech embedded  in it would be just such a no brainer in terms of supercharging not just the industry, but  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:23:35):**  the rural and regional communities that often rely on the industry.  What's it been like for you to come in and ask some of these questions?  On one hand, you can say they're harmless.  I'm just asking the question.  And on another hand, you're challenging and questioning some of how it's been.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:23:53):**  I mean, just what's it been like for you coming in and asking some of these questions, not  having that background?  Well, I think having no background in it gives me license to ask what seem like simple and  dumb questions.  So how do we think this is going to work?  
**[0:24:12-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:24:12):**  Why is it, for example, that farmers maybe get advice from input suppliers that also  sell them things?  Why do processes and businesses further down the supply chains reach back?  Do we think that's a good thing?  The thing that scared me most was that we turn around in 10 or 20 years time and go,  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:24:35):**  oh, wow, we really stuffed that up.  Or maybe we lost opportunities that we could have made decisions on right now and had a  more connected policy.  And I am seriously colored by, I guess, covering all these elections where the only policy  debates I see ahead of the elections is how many roads, bridges and dams we have in regional  
**[0:24:59-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:24:59):**  Australia without any nuance around what communities actually need, not just in terms of infrastructure  but in terms of ideas to keep communities vibrant.  One of the challenging issues that you take on head on and that technology obviously has  a role in is around corporatization and disruption that kind of comes from that.  What's your prediction for farming in Australia?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:25:26):**  Is the mid-sized family farm that you talked about fading away?  And is that necessarily a bad thing?  I know we sort of tend to romanticize family farms in a way that I'd probably argue is  not exactly connected to reality.  Yes.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:25:40):**  Yeah, I think we do romanticize.  And I think from the research that I did and talking to big corporate farmers like Ed Peter  at Duxton, there's a real bullishness for agriculture that has not, I haven't seen in  the last couple of decades.  And I don't think there's an, that's an accident.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:26:05):**  In Australian history, since white settlement, I think, you know, we started with squatters.  We started with the big model, the big kind of industrial scale farming model and various  land acts have tried to break those up and had this kind of romanticized idea of a yeomanry  on the land that would charge not only export markets, but also they talked about it in  terms of democratization of land or creating communities, creating society.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:26:38):**  So I think there's definitely a romanticization of the middle family farmer.  I guess the thing that worries me is if this trend to corporatization stays, and I think  it will stay, I think there's definitely, you know, with a population projection of  about 10 billion by 2050, it will definitely stay.  There's massive global demand for food.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:27:03):**  Land is, in Australia particularly, is at scale and so is corporate ready.  There will be succession issues for family farms, particularly as the land prices, rural  land prices are going through the roof, dividing up the family farm gets harder and harder  as those prices rise.  So all of, for all of those reasons, I think that trend to the big will continue.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:27:29):**  Just changing tax a little bit.  We were really interested to read in the book about this trend around food tribes and sort  of food as identity.  I'm curious whether you see this as just a fad, something young people are involved in  now but will go away.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:27:44):**  You mentioned that as a young person, you spent your money on clothes for your identity  and others have tribes around music choices or maybe in my word around the next iPhone  launch.  Is this food tribe thing just a fad or something that could actually have an impact on the  system?  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:28:00):**  I think it'll have an impact on the system.  I was fascinated by Mike Lee, who's a food futurist.  The description of the food tribes where people determine their identity according to what  they eat, I think resonates with a lot of people.  We all know people who are very prescriptive about what they eat and why they choose to  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:28:27):**  eat what they eat.  I don't think that will be going away.  The thing that struck me about it was so close to politics.  This idea of identity being connected to your emotional level, to your gut literally, I  found fascinating and that you can make decisions just based on how you feel about something.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:28:50):**  Whereas we always assume it's much more intellectually driven.  I guess that goes to values, what your values are.  The other thing that interested me about Mike Lee's work is that work with farmers and how  to get more diversity onto their farms by using products that speak to consumers with  those values that are buying products on those values.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:29:19):**  I don't see that going away.  You would answer this question better than me, but maybe the markets are there for that  in the US.  I can't see that sort of example happening here where a big food company comes along  and says to a bunch of farmers, how do we make this work for what you want to grow that  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:29:41):**  suits your land and suits your microclimate?  We create a product, in this case crackers, that reflects the crop rotations in your area  that best suit your soil and your land.  Is that it?  Do you see it scaling like that here?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:29:59):**  Yeah.  I mean, it's super challenging, right?  Whether it comes from the here's what we should be growing and therefore here's how we design  a supply chain to enable that or more on the other end of here's what consumers want and  consumers, as you've said, are actually very disconnected from the fact that we even have  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:30:17):**  crop rotations or that seeds are planted with equipment or any number of things in agriculture.  I think it's more likely to come from the consumer side and what they perceive to be  valuable.  Just a quick example, I was sitting at MIT this week and talking to some students and  this gentleman spoke about his business where he's sourcing from local fishers in the Northeast  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:30:39):**  area and across the US and trying to scale up a marketplace to sell their fish and the  different bycatch and things direct to consumers.  The students had questions around like, well, why is it so expensive?  Because you say that you want to make this accessible, but you're 2X the price of Whole  Foods even.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:30:58):**  He was saying, well, Whole Foods is owned by Amazon.  They're actually positioned as this high-end market, but they're able to keep costs down.  We have that scale, we actually can't influence their production practices at all.  We have to take what we get and try to change the consumer side, which is really hard.  We just got right into this tension of who has the ability to have carrots and sticks  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:31:20):**  and to do so in a way that resonates with consumers, but actually matches what are the  realities of production or harvesting or whatever it might be.  Yeah, that's so interesting to me because I keep hitting this wall of, were you talking  about consumers taking more interest in where their food comes from and paying for more  of the cost of production if you do indeed want environmental outcomes.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:31:47):**  It always gets down to the fact that there are a portion of people who can't afford that  and want to buy the cheapest product and who are we to say they can't buy that.  Where I always land on it is, well, that's a cost to someone.  Is this a cross subsidy or how is that going to work?  It's exactly the challenge.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:32:11):**  Even my personal journey started, I came from the big is bad and we need these local options.  Then I ended up in a supermarket totally paralyzed by what you could buy because the small companies  didn't have sustainable packaging or the technologies to enable the transparency.  It was just marketing.  Did you believe them?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:32:29):**  Then how much does it cost?  Then the nutrition facts.  One of the powerful things of these big companies is that they can invest in the underlying  infrastructure to do things like bring transparency and to pay living wages when they so choose  and hopefully they do so more.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:32:45):**  I guess I've come full circle to the benefits of scale when they can choose to invest in  or when they do choose to invest in some of these sustainability attributes.  Where I get a little bit of hope is in some of the institutional investor pressures that  are coming onto these companies around task force for climate disclosure or science-based  target initiatives and things like this where it has to move beyond just screenwashing and  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:33:09):**  what the foundation does on the side to truly moving the needle.  That's causing them to say, well, how are we going to work with farmers?  Do we need to provide inputs?  How do we fill the gaps in extension and really roll up their sleeves to get involved in changing  the system?  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:33:23):**  I think that's starting to be pretty exciting.  The other thing that interests me is the recognition of large companies that they need that social  license and any examples where they might say environmental services is a great example.  A small to mid farmer is always going to get killed on scale when it comes to selling environmental  services whereas if you've got scale, you've got massive capacity to change the environmental  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:33:53):**  outcomes on the land.  Will there be, and I think there's already starting to be now partnerships where a big  company can help a bunch of smaller companies get that scale.  The other place where that might land in my view, and I think there is a co-op model starting,  is that a co-op where a bunch of small to mid-sized farmers get together and use the  
**[0:34:24-0:34:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:34:24):**  group and the scale to get through the complexities of environmental service contracts, which  is going to be a big thing.  There's a lot of chatter in the industry that I hear, particularly down the small to medium  end about how do we sign a 20-year contract?  What happens if we go into a roaring drought?  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:34:47):**  How will we be able to say that our soil carbon is sustained or what happens if a bushfire  comes through a tree lot that we've signed all this carbon over for?  They're the real worries in the industry that I hear about because if you want a farmer  with one employer, one employee and you're trying to get through everything in the day,  that's the hard bit.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:35:11):**  Sure, yeah, 100%.  I do believe big companies will have the resources to present it as a more holistic option.  There's the various practices around increasing soil organic matter that might help you sell  credits but, by the way, have a 10x uptick on just productivity and longevity because  of that gain in soil carbon or examples like that.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:35:33):**  I definitely see potential there.  I want to ask you about the farm, some closing thoughts here, but I do have one more question  just to change tack again.  We're speaking now just after International Rural Women's Day and you did interview some  really innovative female ag leaders in this book.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:35:49):**  I wanted to ask about the changing role of women in farming.  Actually, in your book, you describe them as change makers.  Why is that so?  I just think they approach things differently.  The women I spoke to just had a different approach and, I think, aren't bound by some  
**[0:36:08-0:36:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:36:08):**  of the conservative culture that men, in my experience, have been more affected by.  They're looking outside.  They're trying to think of new ways to do things.  They're hyper aware of the culture they're in.  They're very observant about the culture they're in and how they need to change that.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:36:29):**  That's why we have diversity, right?  That's why we go for diversity targets and things like that in other industries is to  bring a different set of eyes onto a problem and say, oh, how can I see my way through  this?  Maybe there's something else I can do here.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:36:45):**  To wrap here, Gabby, where did you land?  Is there an answer to the question, what's the best way to farm in the future in a way  that is productive but also sustainable?  Well, that's too big a question.  I think diversity is one of my keys.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:37:04):**  People are arguing about which system is best.  I think in some ways, it wastes a lot of energy saying, this system is best.  The whole rise of the term regenerative farming is something we haven't touched on.  There's a lot of energy wasted, I think, on arguments about which system is better.  I think diverse systems are good and we're going to have to work out how we resolve this  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:37:35):**  kind of tension between, on the one hand, when droughts happen, politicians come out  and say, we want rural communities, we want mom and dad farmers, we want all of this.  On the other hand, we're saying, we need scale, we need global capital, we need investment.  Surely, we need a diversity of all of these models.  We have to acknowledge the natural capital and the environmental costs of farming and  
**[0:38:01-0:38:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/19/why-you-should-give-a-fck-about-farming#t=0:38:01):**  do it better.  I think people are, but it has to be, when I think of the farm models around here, it  has to be safe to fail and reform has to happen with some understanding of the culture and  the system, the farming systems that people are working in.  Otherwise, you just won't get people to move.

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 19:29:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:12):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:17):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:27):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:31-0:00:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:31):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest has gone from scientist to consultant  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:43):**  to ag tech entrepreneur. Mark Ferguson, or Ferg, uses his broad range of experiences  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:50):**  to help sheep farmers be profitable, align with consumer demands, and get the best out  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:55):**  of their genetics. Now, sheep genetics might seem niche, but Ferg has a lot of insights  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:00):**  on ag tech adoption, research, commercialization, consumer preferences, and what it's like to  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:06):**  challenge longstanding ways of thinking and working in agriculture. Also, merinos are  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:12):**  pretty much the coolest animals, and you can't hang out with Ferg for very long and not start  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:15):**  to believe that. Ferg starts with his background. So I grew up on a farm in northwest Victoria  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:20):**  in the Mallee, a sheep and wheat farm. From there, from about the age of 11, I think we  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:25):**  started breeding sheep with my brother, who is still there farming and breeding sheep.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:30):**  Off to ag at Melbourne Uni, so a four-year degree there, which I was lucky enough to  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:34):**  have a cadetship, which got me involved with the Department of Prime Industries there in  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:38):**  Victoria. That led me to Hamilton to work with some great people around nutrition in  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:43):**  sheep, particularly in merinos. I guess that work then led me to wanting to understand  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:49):**  them at a whole greater level and combine my passion of genetics with work, I suppose.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:56):**  Off to Perth to do a PhD with the late Norm Adams, who was really interested in how we  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:02):**  breed sheep to better fit within the farming system, so did that. Then research career  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:07):**  off to New Zealand after that to do some work with the New Zealand Merino Company, where  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:11):**  we led a whole range of research to tackle a range of things, but really to get good  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:17):**  breeding systems implemented in New Zealand. From there, I started NextGen Agri to, I guess,  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:22):**  do the bits of all that stuff that I was really passionate about and thought we could make  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:25):**  the greatest change. What Ferg is really passionate about is sheep  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:29):**  genetics, but not all of his views are widely held in the industry.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:33):**  I guess our job, or part of what we do, is implementing good genetic programs, good breeding  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:38):**  programs on farm. The way we approach that differently is probably not just to think  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:42):**  about the profit side of that equation. Genics are just as good at controlling costs and  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:47):**  reducing time on farm as they are at increasing the output of animals. I think we are, to  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:52):**  our farming systems and to the animals, to breed animals that can prosper in our farming  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:56):**  environments are really matching genes to that environment so that they have higher  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:59):**  welfare plus higher production. Then to the animal happy and the farmer's happy is the  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:05):**  way we approach breeding. Never just how do we get more out of this animal, it's about  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:09):**  how do we fit that animal best in the system to make the whole thing fit better, better  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:14):**  for the farmer, better for the consumer, and better for the animals as well, is our approach.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:20):**  It's funny actually because from an outside perspective that seems obvious, like it seems  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:24):**  like good business and it seems like how you do things. But as I've learned more about  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:28):**  the sheep industry in particular, that's not how things have always been done. You've showed  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:32):**  me pictures of award-winning sheep from not too, too long ago that look very different  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:38):**  than the kind of sheep you'd advocate for today. Tell me a little bit about why that  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:42):**  view or that approach is maybe not controversial, but at least different than the way others  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:47):**  think. I don't have any traditional background in  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:54):**  the sheep breeding. We've approached it from just, yeah, from first principles from the  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:57):**  start. Just think about the kind of traits that would keep an animal on farm and keep  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:02):**  it healthy. Seeing animals really perform from being in better condition score was the  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:07):**  kind of really thing that I learned early and knowing that that was actually under genetic  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:11):**  control rather than just under feeding. Obviously you can feed animals to be fatter, but you  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:15):**  can also have animals that genetically want to be that way. It really stemmed from that  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:19):**  and seeing how those animals thrive in their environment just drives us every day. We've  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:23):**  got clients out there that are literally trucking off truckloads more of lambs because of that  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:29):**  approach rather than just thinking about it as how do we get more out of that animal.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:35):**  If we set an animal up right, we get more plus that animal is healthier.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:40):**  The success of this approach is not something that Ferg is just seeing in research projects.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:45):**  The Sutherland brothers at Benmore would be a great example of having a sheep type, which  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:49):**  was pretty traditional when I met them seven or eight years ago. Part of what we worked  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:53):**  with them was talking around condition scoring and managing those sheep, but they've implemented  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:59):**  lots of different size. You can see as the sheep have changed, they're now thousands  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:05):**  of more lambs are coming out of that production system. They're finishing them earlier. There's  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:08):**  a whole heap of things that have gone on as a result of just using size that had a bit  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:12):**  more fat in us or a bit more constitution and we're playing around, moving towards what  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:17):**  I would say is the modern animal. If farmers are getting value out of these  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:22):**  practices and this approach, why is it so controversial?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:26):**  Yeah, I guess across all of our lives, we're always hooked to paradigms of how we think  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:30):**  things should look because of what they used to look like. That's still something we do  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:34):**  every day. We come across people who are a little bit, I guess, less keen on the shape  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:40):**  of the animals or the way they look than what they used to, but the reality is if that animal  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:45):**  is healthier and is more profitable, then we're crazy not to go down that line.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:50):**  Ferg believes that the power of genetics has the potential to not only help farmers be  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:55):**  more profitable, but also to help them align with consumer preferences. Ferg's time at  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:00):**  New Zealand Marino helped to shape this view as he got to see it happening firsthand.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:05):**  My time there was definitely instrumental in really, for the first time, being exposed  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:11):**  to overseas brands directly as in meeting those people and taking them on farm and understanding  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:16):**  the types of questions they are asking and where that was coming from. I had the opportunity  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:20):**  through New Zealand Marino to travel the states a couple of times and get exposed directly  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:24):**  to those consumer markets. It becomes absolutely crystal clear once you're in those conversations  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:31):**  what the future is going to look like in terms of their expectations of us as farmers and  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:36):**  people that work on farms. That time at New Zealand Marino really showed me how much they  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:42):**  value not just animal welfare, but also that relationship with farmers. When their beliefs  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:49):**  align with the farming beliefs, then that's a really great story and a great opportunity,  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:55):**  which New Zealand Marino, through their ZQ program, have really capitalized on.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:59):**  Overseas markets love hearing farmers' stories, particularly when their values align with  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:03):**  their own. Tell me, what's an example of that? Either  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:06):**  a conversation you had with one of those people from a brand or some of the work that you  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:11):**  were doing when you were there. Help us. Because I think a lot of people talk about it in farming  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:14):**  like, oh, well, now we have social media, so let's just tell the story of the farms.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:17):**  Then you'll get a premium and connect with consumers and everyone will be happy. Obviously,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:21):**  it doesn't really work like that. Yes, I guess the mulesing thing is a direct,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:26):**  really, really great example of how New Zealand Marino basically took the hit more than 10  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:32):**  years ago and said, through our ZQ program, we won't sell mules wool. That has set them  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:38):**  up for long-term contracts. Icebreaker were the ones that led that. They've now got 10-year  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:43):**  contracts with New Zealand growers and growers around the world based on their ethos of producing  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:49):**  the fibre in the way they believe it should be produced. I've got clients in New Zealand  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:54):**  that have a 10-year contract with Icebreaker knowing what that price or at least exactly  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:58):**  how that price mechanism works for a decade in advance, which is just completely different  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:02):**  for animal agriculture, really. That doesn't exist anywhere in the world that I am aware  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:06):**  of. That has been 100% led by that trust that you build by listening and working closely  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:12):**  with those customers. That's so interesting. You've had examples,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:17):**  I think, of those brand managers going out and actually being on a station and seeing  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:21):**  how different it is or challenging their own expectations or understanding of farming.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:26):**  Any good stories about that kind of thing? Yeah, we had the whole management crew from  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:31):**  Smartwool on farm a number of years ago. There's a bit of an offshoot breeding program I've  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:38):**  been working on for a while, which is breeding short-tailed sheep, and seeing their eyes  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:42):**  light up when you show them those animals and explain how that could be and just how  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:47):**  engaged they are. That whole discussion around how we can do things differently, that really  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:53):**  shaped the way I see the future. What's the so-what here for farmers or even  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:59):**  for agtech companies looking to tap into some of these macro consumer trends?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:03):**  I think what farmers completely underestimate all the time is how much they are the rock  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:08):**  stars to these brands. When you get these people out from these big brands in the US  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:15):**  or Japan or China or wherever, they absolutely love being on farm. They love meeting the  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:20):**  families, the kids, the dogs, and experiencing what we probably take for granted in our industry,  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:27):**  like being out in the open. I know we all love and that's probably a big part of why  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:32):**  we work in industry is the environment we get to work in. We probably take it for granted  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:36):**  how important that is to these international brands and how important it is for them to  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:40):**  feel that connection of who they're, where they're sourcing that fibre from, because  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:44):**  it really helps tell the story right through that connection to both what you get to do  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:50):**  when you're wearing wool but also where that wool is coming from and that connection is  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:55):**  huge. Having witnessed that several times firsthand with taking brands out on farms,  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:59):**  that's really powerful and really good to ground through some of the things that we  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:03):**  were thinking of. We were starting a small, short-tail breeding program and just taking  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:07):**  the brand to visit that and see what their reaction was. It was really important to help.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:12):**  Another one, we were putting sensors on sheep to try and understand welfare and getting  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:17):**  the brand reaction to that was really important to make sure we weren't just off in fairy  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:20):**  land thinking this was important to them, but actually seeing them firsthand that they  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:25):**  did think it was important.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:27):**  For anyone who's less familiar with the sheep industry, I asked Ferg to explain exactly  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:31):**  what he means about the short-tail program.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:33):**  Obviously, the sheep are obviously born with long tails, or some are and some aren't. Short-tail  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:39):**  length is heritable, so we can actually change that to a point where you no longer have to  
**[0:10:43-0:10:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:43):**  remove the tail and it can still not get any health issues and it can go through life without  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:51):**  that process, I suppose. That's a way off. It's not like we're going to achieve that  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:55):**  next year, but I think that's definitely part of our future.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:59):**  What are some other traits that you're looking at or other changes to the animal that align  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:04):**  with environment or with consumers that you're excited about that are coming online or in  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:09):**  the near future, you think?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:11):**  I think disease resistance is a big one. No one likes to see unhealthy animals, least  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:16):**  of all farmers. We have traditionally got around that through management processes and  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:22):**  chemicals. Obviously, we've got a world where chemicals are less and less okay in terms  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:27):**  of our consumer expectations, so breeding animals that actually look after themselves.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:31):**  Foot rot resistance has been something we've been working on for a number of years. Foot  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:35):**  rots are as exactly as it sounds. They're the disease of sheep's feet. What we've shown  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:40):**  over the last seven years in New Zealand is that we can breed sheep that don't get that  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:43):**  illness. For 20 years, we've known you can do that for internal parasites, so worms.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:49):**  You can breed sheep that are much less susceptible to worms. Same with flies. There are a number  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:54):**  of our great clients who have over the last 10, 15 years have bred an animal that doesn't  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:00):**  get fly stroke anywhere near to the same rate as others.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:04):**  I think all of those breeding approaches where you reduce animal illness and reduce chemical  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:09):**  use has to have some really good legs going forward.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:14):**  When you talk about this stuff with clients, is it because we obviously work in the ag  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:18):**  tech space and talk a lot about adoption? Some of these changes you're talking about  
**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:21):**  making are 10-year programs and you won't see the results for a long time. Are people  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:28):**  just true believers and they go on that journey? I can imagine in the app world, people want  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:33):**  a silver bullet that helps in a couple months or a year and they want to see results. Talking  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:37):**  about a 10-year change must be really tough to get people on board. What's the psychology  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:42):**  and adoption dynamics?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:44):**  It's really interesting and it differs between individuals obviously, same as it does in  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:50):**  tech. I guess once people see it actually working an individual animal, they're sold.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:57):**  But until that happens, it's a leap of faith. It really has been a seven-year lag now in  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:03):**  our foot rot work that this year, last year was the first time people really started to  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:07):**  take note of that and start putting it into breeding programs. People that know the technology  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:14):**  works, it's just an add-on to that. They trust that if it's going to come out as a breeding  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:19):**  value, then they'll be able to implement it and it will work. Until they see it and see  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:24):**  those animals that it's highlighted as being resistant and then seeing what it means on  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:27):**  their farm, that's when they really... It does need to be implemented on farm for people  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:32):**  to really see it and believe it. But there's enough background knowledge of how breeding  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:38):**  values have worked for every other thing that people are willing to take that leap of faith  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:42):**  and believe that we'll deliver something useful.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:46):**  That's crazy. Are there still people who find all of this, everything you've said in the  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:50):**  last 10 or 15 minutes pretty controversial or would push back hard and what would that  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:56):**  argument look like or is everyone on board with what you've said?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:59):**  No, not everyone's on board. There's an element of people that think we should be able to  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:05):**  farm the way we always have or we should be able to breed the animals the way we always  
**[0:14:08-0:14:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:08):**  have and that's their prerogative. There's definitely a significant spectrum of beliefs  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:16):**  across the industry and lots of those don't align with our thinking. But I guess the reality  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:23):**  is that the change is happening and if you're not changing, then there's only really one  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:30):**  way the business is going.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:32):**  How does it feel? What's it like for you? It can be tough to be out on the cutting edge  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:36):**  of some things and feel like there's people pulling you back or pulling against you or  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:40):**  fighting against you. What is it? I don't know. Any examples that come to mind or any  
**[0:14:43-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:43):**  moments where it's been like any good stories of that tension? Have you ever been booed  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:54):**  off stage?  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:57):**  Not directly to my face. I think in my younger days, I was much more, I guess, with the front  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:01):**  people more now. I'm confident that the way we approach and breeding and the way that  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:07):**  the industry is going to go, that we don't need to convince others. There's enough good  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:11):**  people coming along for the ride that we have a good future. There's definitely people out  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:18):**  there who think this is not going to be the way, but I think the same could be said for  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:24):**  blockbusters.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:25):**  There's all those examples of disruption that you know better than I do that people sat  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:28):**  there and watched the freight train come at them until it went over the top of them and  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:33):**  didn't change. I don't want to be part of an industry that sits there and waits for  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:37):**  the freight train. I want to be on that freight train and going into the future.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:42):**  I like that one thing you have on your website is farming in our hearts, science in our heads,  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:46):**  and that kind of balance of passion but data-driven approaches, I guess, is one way to sum that  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:52):**  up.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:53):**  Yeah. That was a great moment. I was driving along in the middle of western Victoria when  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:58):**  I came up with that, but I think it is exactly how we are. We are all very passionate about  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:02):**  farming. It's in our veins. It's in our hearts. It's what we sleep and breathe, but we also  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:09):**  approach that with a level of science, a level of knowledge, a level of data, and really  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:15):**  try and think about it not just from an emotional way but in a business sense and in a scientific  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:22):**  sense.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:24):**  You have been on farm. You've been on the research and science side. You've been in  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:28):**  a commercial company, and now you're out on your own. Tell me about what was the decision  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:34):**  like to go out on your own? Was there a moment where you said, I have to do this? Was it  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:38):**  hard? Tell me a little bit about that.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:41):**  Yeah. I think I sort of had two goes at that. Before I went to New Zealand Marino Company,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:45):**  I was almost going to go out on my own. I sort of started building that way, and then  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:50):**  the opportunity to go to New Zealand and do that job came up. I sort of shelved that for  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:55):**  a while, but there was always this burning desire to – I'm not sure whether it was  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:59):**  just because I didn't like being controlled or whether I wanted to go out and do my own  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:03):**  thing, but I guess I was always going to do it. It was a matter of just biting the bullet.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:08):**  It was tough. It was about three young children. The big thing is financial security, obviously.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:14):**  Going out on your own means you need to find money to live, and also then to grow, you've  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:21):**  got to employ people. That real first six months where you – well, that first step  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:25):**  where the wages have stopped but you're not sure where the next income is coming from  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:30):**  is uncomfortable to say the least. I don't think that goes away that quickly because  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:34):**  you're always looking to grow. You're always looking to employ new people and do new things.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:39):**  Yeah, it's a different – yeah, it certainly has been a really great learning journey and  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:45):**  a great experience. I used to think I worked hard until you actually worked for yourself  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:50):**  and then you really know you work hard. But it's great work and there's lots of people  
**[0:17:56-0:18:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:56):**  listening who will be entrepreneurs or self-starters or people on the land that know that it's  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:03):**  great working. It's so much better working for yourself and knowing that those hours  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:06):**  you're putting in are growing a better future for you and your family is the plan.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:12):**  Tell me about the NextGen model. You guys have done a combination of consulting and  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:18):**  research and playing with technology and online. Give us your pitch where you're up to right  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:23):**  now.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:24):**  Yeah, so NextGen is a combination of all things I like. So we made a company that did all  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:30):**  those things. I guess at our core, we are a consulting business to farmers pretty much  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:36):**  solely around genetics, implementing good genetic programs across from Western Australia  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:41):**  through to both islands of New Zealand. So we've got clients all over the place. So at  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:45):**  our core is that consulting and that direct dealing with farmers and we're really, really  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:51):**  fortunate to work with some of the industry's best and it's great to get out of bed and  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:56):**  work with those people. I've also, obviously with my research career and desire to do things  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:01):**  at an industry level, we do industry research on behalf of the organisations like AWI, MLA.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:07):**  We still work for New Zealand Reno. We do a range of different sort of project management  
**[0:19:11-0:19:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:11):**  slash research work. We also have just, as of this week, have just launched an online  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:21):**  training aspect to our business. We definitely understand that you can't, a consulting model  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:26):**  where you run all over the country is not easy on us or our families, but it's also  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:32):**  not easy on farmers having to go to workshops on days that suit us, not them. So we really  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:38):**  see a great future in online training. So we're trying to package up some of what we  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:43):**  do into online training where people can learn from our experiences and the work that we're  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:48):**  doing in the comfort of their own offices or farms and at a time that suits them best.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:53):**  And then wrap around that some support through Facebook groups and through closed Zoom calls  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:58):**  and those sort of things where people can ask questions directly of us and really grow  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:02):**  our ability to interact with people 24-7 and across a much wider geography than we can  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:09):**  by jumping in rental cars and planes that we do now.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:13):**  Do you see more kind of support in agriculture moving online? I mean, it's such an interesting  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:17):**  tension of now you can access information anywhere and you can be part of a community  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:21):**  of whether it's early adopters or seed stock folks or whatever niche you're in, you can  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:26):**  find them online, but there's also, I guess, a traditional view of agriculture that's kind  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:30):**  of sitting down at the pub or shaking hands and truly relationship based, which I guess  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:35):**  implies you have to be in person. Is there a tension there or is online just an enhancement  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:40):**  of what you can do in person?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:42):**  Yeah, I think success will be a combination. I often hear clients say they go to a full  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:51):**  day workshop or something they've driven three hours for and they only really went there  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:56):**  to hear one speaker and there's seven others they sort of heard and had a cup of tea or  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:00):**  a beer and then went home again. So to me, the online training makes that a whole lot  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:04):**  more efficient because you can just hear that one speaker and even interact with them at  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:08):**  a whole much better level if there's not the tyranny of distance involved and the timing  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:14):**  issues. But I also think that you can't just do online and you can't just, people need  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:21):**  to learn from each other as well as learning from so-called experts. So getting them in  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:26):**  a room and interacting is critical. So walking that tightrope is going to be something we  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:30):**  need to learn over the next few years and we're keen to have sort of member days where  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:36):**  we get the people in regions together to get that social action because without that, I  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:41):**  think it would be difficult to keep the community and keep that growth going.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:47):**  One of the things we talk about in ag tech a lot is, well in startups generally, is personas  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:51):**  and kind of knowing who your market is and who you're really selling to and that not  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:56):**  everyone in livestock or everyone who's a sheep farmer is actually the same market.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:00):**  You have early adopters and things like that. How would you describe your kind of persona,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:05):**  your market and how did you come upon that? Because it's appealing to say, oh, it's online,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:10):**  anyone can download my course and I hope thousands and thousands do. Or is it more, we're really  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:14):**  targeting these kinds of people or these kinds of growers?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:19):**  I think we're targeting farming couples that have taken on some debt to either grow their  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:24):**  family business or to buy a new one. So I guess our target persona is those young, youngish  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:30):**  and I call myself young at mid-40s who are really taking on some significant debt, some  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:36):**  significant stresses associated with that, some significant sort of, I guess, family  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:40):**  pressures to succeed and just wrapping around a layer of support around those people that  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:45):**  helps them make some pretty big decisions. We're not talking about small, just backyard  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:51):**  operations. These can be several million dollar businesses, tens of million dollar businesses  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:56):**  and they're making some decisions that aren't that comfortable and need some support. So  
**[0:23:02-0:23:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:02):**  I think our persona probably is that couple farming family that really want to get on  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:09):**  and grow their businesses, but also have a bit of pressure from debt like we all do.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:15):**  Interesting you say farming family. That's one of the big things that I know you and  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:18):**  I have talked about a lot, the kind of role of families in decision making and that it's  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:21):**  not just maybe the bloke you see on the farm that it's actually a family and lots of intricacies  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:27):**  to how those decisions are made. So I don't know if you have anything to say about that.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:31):**  I guess one of the articles you wrote recently that you can see now on the website, I can  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:34):**  link to it, is around how farmers are just people who farm and there's all this, I guess,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:39):**  hype around what are farmers and are they really different than other people? But at  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:43):**  the end of the day, they're just people.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:46):**  Yeah I guess I'm really, really strong on that. Having grown up, my mum and dad worked  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:49):**  very closely together to make ends meet and to get our farm ticking over and get us all  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:55):**  educated and doing what we do now. All the people that I work with, there's some great  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:01):**  farming couples and some great farming families out there and so to limit that to just the,  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:06):**  I guess the stereotypical male would be a limitation and not something that I think  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:11):**  is even relevant to agriculture. It's about that whole family and how that works together  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:15):**  to make a business and make decisions and go forward. There's never an individual who's  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:22):**  doing it all and the other person's just got their feet up on the couch.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:25):**  Beyond just rethinking extension and what the future of livestock consulting will look  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:29):**  like, NextGen Agri and Ferg have been playing with tech in a more traditional ag tech sense  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:35):**  as well. This all started for Ferg with a trip to where I'm from, Silicon Valley.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:40):**  Yeah, just being in the industry and getting exposed to, I could pretty much link it back  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:45):**  to going to Silicon Valley for the first time and just getting exposed to the tech world  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:49):**  there through New Zealand Reno and just hearing about what was happening in augmented reality,  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:55):**  what was happening in machine learning, what was happening in gene editing, what was happening  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:59):**  in some of the fantastic speakers we're exposed to at Stanford University. They really just  
**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:04):**  lifted my sights completely about what the future looks like. I guess the great opportunity  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:11):**  for us in Ag is that we know these problems better than anybody and so I wanted to be  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:16):**  part of that tech future where we know the problem clearly, we understand the tech enough  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:22):**  to be able to apply that. We've done a variety of things. We've done some things around sensor  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:26):**  tags. The thing that we're really interested in is the ability to apply image analysis  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:32):**  to problems on farm. The one that we're really running at the moment is facial recognition  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:37):**  in sheep because that'll underpin a whole heap of changes that we can make through automated.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:43):**  We can automate lots of measurement, lots of understanding of what's happening on farm  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:46):**  if we can get facial recognition working. That's our current focus.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:51):**  This is like a camera and taking a picture of a sheep and saying, okay, this is the sheep  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:55):**  or are you saying other things about the sheep? What are you actually measuring? Where are  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:00):**  the cameras? Tell us a little bit about their... Give us a picture of what that looks like.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:05):**  Yeah, so we did some work with AWI where we had a crate set up and had four cameras around  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:10):**  that crate and took a heap of images of each sheep and then through collaboration with  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:14):**  University of Sydney, analyzed all that and worked out that in concept form that worked.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:19):**  We could tell sheep separately from each other. I think in that work, we had 1,900 individuals  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:25):**  and it would tell us 99% plus accuracy which individual that was just by the photo of it.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:31):**  Were you surprised by that? I guess yes and kind of no because I know  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:37):**  that I walk through the airports every day and the only thing that lets me in the gate  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:41):**  is facial recognition cameras under that controlled scenario. I guess there's no reason that sheep  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:47):**  are different than humans apart from a few obvious aspects. But that work wasn't taking  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:55):**  us closer to... Because putting sheep in a crate, if you've got them in a crate, you  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:58):**  know they are and you can weigh them and do everything else you need to.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:01):**  So we wanted to move that to how can we do that out on farm or in a more commercial context.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:07):**  So now we're running retraining models. We've got a race set up that's got four cameras  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:13):**  on it. So we run sheep through which gives us about 30 frames, so 30 individual images  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:18):**  of the sheep as they bolt through, same as any normal drafting race, drenching race.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:24):**  We run them down that and the idea is that that would be directly linked to a camera  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:28):**  in the paddock and so that once the ID, once it runs past, the animal is linked to its  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:33):**  EID, to its RFID and then we know who it is and then so an image of that sheep, wherever  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:38):**  it is on the farm, we'll know who that animal is. That's the work we're doing right now  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:43):**  to train that model. So at the moment we've run around about six or 700 sheep through  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:50):**  that race plus we've taken images of those individual sheep out on in a paddock and so  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:55):**  we're retraining machine learning model at the moment to do that and if that works then  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:59):**  we sort of onto the next stages of actual behavioral tracking and working out when they're  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:04):**  grazing, when they're doing whatever from images. So we've got a range of different  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:08):**  work through students and collaborations going on across that spectrum at the moment.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:13):**  That is super exciting. So that in itself could become its own business or kind of take  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:19):**  all of this work to the next level. Is that the vision and the aspiration?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:23):**  Yeah, so geneSmith.ai is a company that is sort of waiting to be formed once we get some  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:30):**  of this working. So we see that as being a standalone component which will become a spin-off  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:35):**  from NextGen Agri which will be mainly, which will focus on consulting and that online training  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:42):**  aspect plus some research. But we see that whole tech space as sort of having, growing  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:48):**  a life of its own and getting its own team and really driving forward because it's just  
**[0:28:52-0:28:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:52):**  an enormous opportunity to really take big steps in the sheep industry towards understanding  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:59):**  what individuals are doing the same as what we see in yield monitoring and in horticulture  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:04):**  and cropping and what we see in dairy cows in the sheep industry. We really have been  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:09):**  limited to mob-based stuff and if we get beyond that then we open up a whole new level of  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:14):**  opportunity that really is just sitting there waiting to be explored.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:19):**  I'm excited to have you back on the podcast in a year or two and hear an update on how  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:24):**  that's going.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:25):**  Hopefully one, not two.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:28):**  Deal. When you talk to farmers, whether clients or not, about this work and facial recognition  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:35):**  and all this tech, what's the response like?  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:38):**  We don't talk so much about the tech but about what we can do with it which is matching news  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:45):**  to the lambs, matching performance to the animal ones, monitoring animals remotely.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:51):**  Those sort of things get people really excited. I think the big one is just that they want  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:57):**  to know their animals are healthy and happy and if they've got a system that helps them  
**[0:30:00-0:30:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:00):**  do that with a level of integrity that means that they can go on holiday or they can go  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:07):**  to town that day and do something else knowing that their animals are safe and happy, that  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:12):**  peace of mind I think is a massive aspect. There's also obviously the upside in terms  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:16):**  of productivity but first and foremost the people across agriculture love seeing healthy  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:22):**  animals and any system that helps them be really early with making changes to make sure  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:27):**  their animals are healthy and productive. I think that gets people excited, that real  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:31):**  ability to monitor animals at a whole new level.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:35):**  It ties back to your point about consumers as well. There's increasing pressure on being  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:39):**  able to prove some of those kinds of things, welfare and well-being and keeping that clean  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:45):**  green image there. I imagine there's some potential there as well.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:48):**  Yeah, I understand that. We started off with a sense of work with really that in mind and  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:54):**  we talked about that to those brand partners. They love the concept of monitoring animals  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:59):**  24-7 and so it wasn't just a pipe dream that the animals were being looked after. They  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:05):**  really were monitored and looked after and that resonates with farmers and it does with  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:11):**  consumers. With an expert like Ferg on the show, it'd  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:15):**  be a mistake not to ask about the future of the sheep industry and where he sees things  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:19):**  headed. Yeah, I guess I'm very, as we all are, we're  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:24):**  just consumer trends and what's changing and I think the current strong demand for wool  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:31):**  we're seeing and for natural fibre, I think that seems to be not just a flash in the pan.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:36):**  It seems to be a real thing and that's stemming from a real desire from some of these big  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:42):**  brands to really have a product they can stand behind in terms of the whole backstory of  
**[0:31:46-0:31:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:46):**  that product. I think we're in for good days in the natural fibre industry. I think as  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:54):**  we understand more about microfibres going into oceans and the whole heap of things that  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:58):**  plastics are doing to the planet and the natural fibre that biodegrades within six months of  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:03):**  hitting the ground, ticks a lot of boxes in terms of the raw footprint of growing wool  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:10):**  production. I don't think we can sit back and say, yes,  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:14):**  jobs right, we produce protein and the world needs more protein and so we're going to be  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:19):**  in for great times and we produce wool and the world needs more wool. We're in for great  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:22):**  times. I think we need to be really smart and think about what that looks like. If we  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:27):**  are going to demand a premium price, we have to be premium producers so we need to be really  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:31):**  aware of what that consumer wants. They're going to wool because they want to have a  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:34):**  really good backstory but they're not going to go to wool if there's skeletons in the  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:38):**  closet that put that brand at risk. We need to be really thinking about what's happening  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:44):**  on farm, what's happening in our breeding, what's happening across everything we do in  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:47):**  our marketing, in our manufacture, what's happening across that whole spectrum that  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:53):**  might be viewed negatively in 10 years and think about how, I guess in our lifetime,  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:58):**  how much more scrutiny has come on what we're doing and more aware people are of what's  
**[0:33:03-0:33:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:03):**  happening both on farm but in that whole process from farm right through to garment. I think  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:11):**  we need to be really aware of making sure we're squeaky clean and we are producing in  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:16):**  a really premium way and I think environmental credentials and welfare are going to lead  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:21):**  to that. For anyone listening who's excited about what Ferg and NextGen Agri have been  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:26):**  up to, check out the show notes for links to the blog, Twitter and the website which  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:30):**  they've recently updated, launching a number of courses and online options. I also asked  
**[0:33:35-0:33:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:35):**  Ferg to give us a shameless plug for where to find him. So www.nextgenagri.com is where  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:42):**  you'll find our website and there's a whole heap of information on there, opportunities  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:46):**  to get access to us. Articles will be going up frequently and then opportunities to get  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:52):**  access to us through subscription and through online training.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:56):**  Great, I would like to keep hearing updates from you. I learn a lot and have been really  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:34:01):**  fortunate to have someone like you teach me so much about the sheep industry. So thanks  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:34:05):**  for that and I'm really excited to see where all of this goes.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:34:09):**  Thanks Sarah, I look forward to continuing to work with you.

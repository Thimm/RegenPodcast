### Agtech - So What?  (2020-02-19)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest has gone from scientist to consultant  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:00:43):**  to ag tech entrepreneur. Mark Ferguson, or Ferg, uses his broad range of experiences  to help sheep farmers be profitable, align with consumer demands, and get the best out  of their genetics. Now, sheep genetics might seem niche, but Ferg has a lot of insights  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:00):**  on ag tech adoption, research, commercialization, consumer preferences, and what it's like to  challenge longstanding ways of thinking and working in agriculture. Also, merinos are  pretty much the coolest animals, and you can't hang out with Ferg for very long and not start  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:15):**  to believe that. Ferg starts with his background. So I grew up on a farm in northwest Victoria  in the Mallee, a sheep and wheat farm. From there, from about the age of 11, I think we  started breeding sheep with my brother, who is still there farming and breeding sheep.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:30):**  Off to ag at Melbourne Uni, so a four-year degree there, which I was lucky enough to  have a cadetship, which got me involved with the Department of Prime Industries there in  Victoria. That led me to Hamilton to work with some great people around nutrition in  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:01:43):**  sheep, particularly in merinos. I guess that work then led me to wanting to understand  them at a whole greater level and combine my passion of genetics with work, I suppose.  Off to Perth to do a PhD with the late Norm Adams, who was really interested in how we  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:02):**  breed sheep to better fit within the farming system, so did that. Then research career  off to New Zealand after that to do some work with the New Zealand Merino Company, where  we led a whole range of research to tackle a range of things, but really to get good  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:17):**  breeding systems implemented in New Zealand. From there, I started NextGen Agri to, I guess,  do the bits of all that stuff that I was really passionate about and thought we could make  the greatest change. What Ferg is really passionate about is sheep  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:29):**  genetics, but not all of his views are widely held in the industry.  I guess our job, or part of what we do, is implementing good genetic programs, good breeding  programs on farm. The way we approach that differently is probably not just to think  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:42):**  about the profit side of that equation. Genics are just as good at controlling costs and  reducing time on farm as they are at increasing the output of animals. I think we are, to  our farming systems and to the animals, to breed animals that can prosper in our farming  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:02:56):**  environments are really matching genes to that environment so that they have higher  welfare plus higher production. Then to the animal happy and the farmer's happy is the  way we approach breeding. Never just how do we get more out of this animal, it's about  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:09):**  how do we fit that animal best in the system to make the whole thing fit better, better  for the farmer, better for the consumer, and better for the animals as well, is our approach.  It's funny actually because from an outside perspective that seems obvious, like it seems  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:24):**  like good business and it seems like how you do things. But as I've learned more about  the sheep industry in particular, that's not how things have always been done. You've showed  me pictures of award-winning sheep from not too, too long ago that look very different  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:38):**  than the kind of sheep you'd advocate for today. Tell me a little bit about why that  view or that approach is maybe not controversial, but at least different than the way others  think. I don't have any traditional background in  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:03:54):**  the sheep breeding. We've approached it from just, yeah, from first principles from the  start. Just think about the kind of traits that would keep an animal on farm and keep  it healthy. Seeing animals really perform from being in better condition score was the  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:07):**  kind of really thing that I learned early and knowing that that was actually under genetic  control rather than just under feeding. Obviously you can feed animals to be fatter, but you  can also have animals that genetically want to be that way. It really stemmed from that  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:19):**  and seeing how those animals thrive in their environment just drives us every day. We've  got clients out there that are literally trucking off truckloads more of lambs because of that  approach rather than just thinking about it as how do we get more out of that animal.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:35):**  If we set an animal up right, we get more plus that animal is healthier.  The success of this approach is not something that Ferg is just seeing in research projects.  The Sutherland brothers at Benmore would be a great example of having a sheep type, which  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:04:49):**  was pretty traditional when I met them seven or eight years ago. Part of what we worked  with them was talking around condition scoring and managing those sheep, but they've implemented  lots of different size. You can see as the sheep have changed, they're now thousands  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:05):**  of more lambs are coming out of that production system. They're finishing them earlier. There's  a whole heap of things that have gone on as a result of just using size that had a bit  more fat in us or a bit more constitution and we're playing around, moving towards what  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:17):**  I would say is the modern animal. If farmers are getting value out of these  practices and this approach, why is it so controversial?  Yeah, I guess across all of our lives, we're always hooked to paradigms of how we think  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:30):**  things should look because of what they used to look like. That's still something we do  every day. We come across people who are a little bit, I guess, less keen on the shape  of the animals or the way they look than what they used to, but the reality is if that animal  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:05:45):**  is healthier and is more profitable, then we're crazy not to go down that line.  Ferg believes that the power of genetics has the potential to not only help farmers be  more profitable, but also to help them align with consumer preferences. Ferg's time at  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:00):**  New Zealand Marino helped to shape this view as he got to see it happening firsthand.  My time there was definitely instrumental in really, for the first time, being exposed  to overseas brands directly as in meeting those people and taking them on farm and understanding  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:16):**  the types of questions they are asking and where that was coming from. I had the opportunity  through New Zealand Marino to travel the states a couple of times and get exposed directly  to those consumer markets. It becomes absolutely crystal clear once you're in those conversations  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:31):**  what the future is going to look like in terms of their expectations of us as farmers and  people that work on farms. That time at New Zealand Marino really showed me how much they  value not just animal welfare, but also that relationship with farmers. When their beliefs  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:06:49):**  align with the farming beliefs, then that's a really great story and a great opportunity,  which New Zealand Marino, through their ZQ program, have really capitalized on.  Overseas markets love hearing farmers' stories, particularly when their values align with  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:03):**  their own. Tell me, what's an example of that? Either  a conversation you had with one of those people from a brand or some of the work that you  were doing when you were there. Help us. Because I think a lot of people talk about it in farming  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:14):**  like, oh, well, now we have social media, so let's just tell the story of the farms.  Then you'll get a premium and connect with consumers and everyone will be happy. Obviously,  it doesn't really work like that. Yes, I guess the mulesing thing is a direct,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:26):**  really, really great example of how New Zealand Marino basically took the hit more than 10  years ago and said, through our ZQ program, we won't sell mules wool. That has set them  up for long-term contracts. Icebreaker were the ones that led that. They've now got 10-year  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:43):**  contracts with New Zealand growers and growers around the world based on their ethos of producing  the fibre in the way they believe it should be produced. I've got clients in New Zealand  that have a 10-year contract with Icebreaker knowing what that price or at least exactly  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:07:58):**  how that price mechanism works for a decade in advance, which is just completely different  for animal agriculture, really. That doesn't exist anywhere in the world that I am aware  of. That has been 100% led by that trust that you build by listening and working closely  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:12):**  with those customers. That's so interesting. You've had examples,  I think, of those brand managers going out and actually being on a station and seeing  how different it is or challenging their own expectations or understanding of farming.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:26):**  Any good stories about that kind of thing? Yeah, we had the whole management crew from  Smartwool on farm a number of years ago. There's a bit of an offshoot breeding program I've  been working on for a while, which is breeding short-tailed sheep, and seeing their eyes  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:42):**  light up when you show them those animals and explain how that could be and just how  engaged they are. That whole discussion around how we can do things differently, that really  shaped the way I see the future. What's the so-what here for farmers or even  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:08:59):**  for agtech companies looking to tap into some of these macro consumer trends?  I think what farmers completely underestimate all the time is how much they are the rock  stars to these brands. When you get these people out from these big brands in the US  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:15):**  or Japan or China or wherever, they absolutely love being on farm. They love meeting the  families, the kids, the dogs, and experiencing what we probably take for granted in our industry,  like being out in the open. I know we all love and that's probably a big part of why  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:32):**  we work in industry is the environment we get to work in. We probably take it for granted  how important that is to these international brands and how important it is for them to  feel that connection of who they're, where they're sourcing that fibre from, because  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:44):**  it really helps tell the story right through that connection to both what you get to do  when you're wearing wool but also where that wool is coming from and that connection is  huge. Having witnessed that several times firsthand with taking brands out on farms,  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:09:59):**  that's really powerful and really good to ground through some of the things that we  were thinking of. We were starting a small, short-tail breeding program and just taking  the brand to visit that and see what their reaction was. It was really important to help.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:12):**  Another one, we were putting sensors on sheep to try and understand welfare and getting  the brand reaction to that was really important to make sure we weren't just off in fairy  land thinking this was important to them, but actually seeing them firsthand that they  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:25):**  did think it was important.  For anyone who's less familiar with the sheep industry, I asked Ferg to explain exactly  what he means about the short-tail program.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:33):**  Obviously, the sheep are obviously born with long tails, or some are and some aren't. Short-tail  length is heritable, so we can actually change that to a point where you no longer have to  remove the tail and it can still not get any health issues and it can go through life without  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:10:51):**  that process, I suppose. That's a way off. It's not like we're going to achieve that  next year, but I think that's definitely part of our future.  What are some other traits that you're looking at or other changes to the animal that align  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:04):**  with environment or with consumers that you're excited about that are coming online or in  the near future, you think?  I think disease resistance is a big one. No one likes to see unhealthy animals, least  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:16):**  of all farmers. We have traditionally got around that through management processes and  chemicals. Obviously, we've got a world where chemicals are less and less okay in terms  of our consumer expectations, so breeding animals that actually look after themselves.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:31):**  Foot rot resistance has been something we've been working on for a number of years. Foot  rots are as exactly as it sounds. They're the disease of sheep's feet. What we've shown  over the last seven years in New Zealand is that we can breed sheep that don't get that  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:11:43):**  illness. For 20 years, we've known you can do that for internal parasites, so worms.  You can breed sheep that are much less susceptible to worms. Same with flies. There are a number  of our great clients who have over the last 10, 15 years have bred an animal that doesn't  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:00):**  get fly stroke anywhere near to the same rate as others.  I think all of those breeding approaches where you reduce animal illness and reduce chemical  use has to have some really good legs going forward.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:14):**  When you talk about this stuff with clients, is it because we obviously work in the ag  tech space and talk a lot about adoption? Some of these changes you're talking about  making are 10-year programs and you won't see the results for a long time. Are people  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:28):**  just true believers and they go on that journey? I can imagine in the app world, people want  a silver bullet that helps in a couple months or a year and they want to see results. Talking  about a 10-year change must be really tough to get people on board. What's the psychology  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:42):**  and adoption dynamics?  It's really interesting and it differs between individuals obviously, same as it does in  tech. I guess once people see it actually working an individual animal, they're sold.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:12:57):**  But until that happens, it's a leap of faith. It really has been a seven-year lag now in  our foot rot work that this year, last year was the first time people really started to  take note of that and start putting it into breeding programs. People that know the technology  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:14):**  works, it's just an add-on to that. They trust that if it's going to come out as a breeding  value, then they'll be able to implement it and it will work. Until they see it and see  those animals that it's highlighted as being resistant and then seeing what it means on  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:27):**  their farm, that's when they really... It does need to be implemented on farm for people  to really see it and believe it. But there's enough background knowledge of how breeding  values have worked for every other thing that people are willing to take that leap of faith  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:42):**  and believe that we'll deliver something useful.  That's crazy. Are there still people who find all of this, everything you've said in the  last 10 or 15 minutes pretty controversial or would push back hard and what would that  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:13:56):**  argument look like or is everyone on board with what you've said?  No, not everyone's on board. There's an element of people that think we should be able to  farm the way we always have or we should be able to breed the animals the way we always  
**[0:14:08-0:14:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:08):**  have and that's their prerogative. There's definitely a significant spectrum of beliefs  across the industry and lots of those don't align with our thinking. But I guess the reality  is that the change is happening and if you're not changing, then there's only really one  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:30):**  way the business is going.  How does it feel? What's it like for you? It can be tough to be out on the cutting edge  of some things and feel like there's people pulling you back or pulling against you or  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:40):**  fighting against you. What is it? I don't know. Any examples that come to mind or any  moments where it's been like any good stories of that tension? Have you ever been booed  off stage?  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:14:57):**  Not directly to my face. I think in my younger days, I was much more, I guess, with the front  people more now. I'm confident that the way we approach and breeding and the way that  the industry is going to go, that we don't need to convince others. There's enough good  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:11):**  people coming along for the ride that we have a good future. There's definitely people out  there who think this is not going to be the way, but I think the same could be said for  blockbusters.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:25):**  There's all those examples of disruption that you know better than I do that people sat  there and watched the freight train come at them until it went over the top of them and  didn't change. I don't want to be part of an industry that sits there and waits for  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:37):**  the freight train. I want to be on that freight train and going into the future.  I like that one thing you have on your website is farming in our hearts, science in our heads,  and that kind of balance of passion but data-driven approaches, I guess, is one way to sum that  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:15:52):**  up.  Yeah. That was a great moment. I was driving along in the middle of western Victoria when  I came up with that, but I think it is exactly how we are. We are all very passionate about  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:02):**  farming. It's in our veins. It's in our hearts. It's what we sleep and breathe, but we also  approach that with a level of science, a level of knowledge, a level of data, and really  try and think about it not just from an emotional way but in a business sense and in a scientific  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:22):**  sense.  You have been on farm. You've been on the research and science side. You've been in  a commercial company, and now you're out on your own. Tell me about what was the decision  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:34):**  like to go out on your own? Was there a moment where you said, I have to do this? Was it  hard? Tell me a little bit about that.  Yeah. I think I sort of had two goes at that. Before I went to New Zealand Marino Company,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:45):**  I was almost going to go out on my own. I sort of started building that way, and then  the opportunity to go to New Zealand and do that job came up. I sort of shelved that for  a while, but there was always this burning desire to – I'm not sure whether it was  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:16:59):**  just because I didn't like being controlled or whether I wanted to go out and do my own  thing, but I guess I was always going to do it. It was a matter of just biting the bullet.  It was tough. It was about three young children. The big thing is financial security, obviously.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:14):**  Going out on your own means you need to find money to live, and also then to grow, you've  got to employ people. That real first six months where you – well, that first step  where the wages have stopped but you're not sure where the next income is coming from  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:30):**  is uncomfortable to say the least. I don't think that goes away that quickly because  you're always looking to grow. You're always looking to employ new people and do new things.  Yeah, it's a different – yeah, it certainly has been a really great learning journey and  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:17:45):**  a great experience. I used to think I worked hard until you actually worked for yourself  and then you really know you work hard. But it's great work and there's lots of people  listening who will be entrepreneurs or self-starters or people on the land that know that it's  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:03):**  great working. It's so much better working for yourself and knowing that those hours  you're putting in are growing a better future for you and your family is the plan.  Tell me about the NextGen model. You guys have done a combination of consulting and  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:18):**  research and playing with technology and online. Give us your pitch where you're up to right  now.  Yeah, so NextGen is a combination of all things I like. So we made a company that did all  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:30):**  those things. I guess at our core, we are a consulting business to farmers pretty much  solely around genetics, implementing good genetic programs across from Western Australia  through to both islands of New Zealand. So we've got clients all over the place. So at  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:18:45):**  our core is that consulting and that direct dealing with farmers and we're really, really  fortunate to work with some of the industry's best and it's great to get out of bed and  work with those people. I've also, obviously with my research career and desire to do things  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:01):**  at an industry level, we do industry research on behalf of the organisations like AWI, MLA.  We still work for New Zealand Reno. We do a range of different sort of project management  slash research work. We also have just, as of this week, have just launched an online  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:21):**  training aspect to our business. We definitely understand that you can't, a consulting model  where you run all over the country is not easy on us or our families, but it's also  not easy on farmers having to go to workshops on days that suit us, not them. So we really  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:38):**  see a great future in online training. So we're trying to package up some of what we  do into online training where people can learn from our experiences and the work that we're  doing in the comfort of their own offices or farms and at a time that suits them best.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:19:53):**  And then wrap around that some support through Facebook groups and through closed Zoom calls  and those sort of things where people can ask questions directly of us and really grow  our ability to interact with people 24-7 and across a much wider geography than we can  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:09):**  by jumping in rental cars and planes that we do now.  Do you see more kind of support in agriculture moving online? I mean, it's such an interesting  tension of now you can access information anywhere and you can be part of a community  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:21):**  of whether it's early adopters or seed stock folks or whatever niche you're in, you can  find them online, but there's also, I guess, a traditional view of agriculture that's kind  of sitting down at the pub or shaking hands and truly relationship based, which I guess  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:35):**  implies you have to be in person. Is there a tension there or is online just an enhancement  of what you can do in person?  Yeah, I think success will be a combination. I often hear clients say they go to a full  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:20:51):**  day workshop or something they've driven three hours for and they only really went there  to hear one speaker and there's seven others they sort of heard and had a cup of tea or  a beer and then went home again. So to me, the online training makes that a whole lot  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:04):**  more efficient because you can just hear that one speaker and even interact with them at  a whole much better level if there's not the tyranny of distance involved and the timing  issues. But I also think that you can't just do online and you can't just, people need  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:21):**  to learn from each other as well as learning from so-called experts. So getting them in  a room and interacting is critical. So walking that tightrope is going to be something we  need to learn over the next few years and we're keen to have sort of member days where  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:36):**  we get the people in regions together to get that social action because without that, I  think it would be difficult to keep the community and keep that growth going.  One of the things we talk about in ag tech a lot is, well in startups generally, is personas  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:21:51):**  and kind of knowing who your market is and who you're really selling to and that not  everyone in livestock or everyone who's a sheep farmer is actually the same market.  You have early adopters and things like that. How would you describe your kind of persona,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:05):**  your market and how did you come upon that? Because it's appealing to say, oh, it's online,  anyone can download my course and I hope thousands and thousands do. Or is it more, we're really  targeting these kinds of people or these kinds of growers?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:19):**  I think we're targeting farming couples that have taken on some debt to either grow their  family business or to buy a new one. So I guess our target persona is those young, youngish  and I call myself young at mid-40s who are really taking on some significant debt, some  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:36):**  significant stresses associated with that, some significant sort of, I guess, family  pressures to succeed and just wrapping around a layer of support around those people that  helps them make some pretty big decisions. We're not talking about small, just backyard  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:22:51):**  operations. These can be several million dollar businesses, tens of million dollar businesses  and they're making some decisions that aren't that comfortable and need some support. So  I think our persona probably is that couple farming family that really want to get on  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:09):**  and grow their businesses, but also have a bit of pressure from debt like we all do.  Interesting you say farming family. That's one of the big things that I know you and  I have talked about a lot, the kind of role of families in decision making and that it's  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:21):**  not just maybe the bloke you see on the farm that it's actually a family and lots of intricacies  to how those decisions are made. So I don't know if you have anything to say about that.  I guess one of the articles you wrote recently that you can see now on the website, I can  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:34):**  link to it, is around how farmers are just people who farm and there's all this, I guess,  hype around what are farmers and are they really different than other people? But at  the end of the day, they're just people.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:23:46):**  Yeah I guess I'm really, really strong on that. Having grown up, my mum and dad worked  very closely together to make ends meet and to get our farm ticking over and get us all  educated and doing what we do now. All the people that I work with, there's some great  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:01):**  farming couples and some great farming families out there and so to limit that to just the,  I guess the stereotypical male would be a limitation and not something that I think  is even relevant to agriculture. It's about that whole family and how that works together  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:15):**  to make a business and make decisions and go forward. There's never an individual who's  doing it all and the other person's just got their feet up on the couch.  Beyond just rethinking extension and what the future of livestock consulting will look  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:29):**  like, NextGen Agri and Ferg have been playing with tech in a more traditional ag tech sense  as well. This all started for Ferg with a trip to where I'm from, Silicon Valley.  Yeah, just being in the industry and getting exposed to, I could pretty much link it back  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:45):**  to going to Silicon Valley for the first time and just getting exposed to the tech world  there through New Zealand Reno and just hearing about what was happening in augmented reality,  what was happening in machine learning, what was happening in gene editing, what was happening  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:24:59):**  in some of the fantastic speakers we're exposed to at Stanford University. They really just  lifted my sights completely about what the future looks like. I guess the great opportunity  for us in Ag is that we know these problems better than anybody and so I wanted to be  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:16):**  part of that tech future where we know the problem clearly, we understand the tech enough  to be able to apply that. We've done a variety of things. We've done some things around sensor  tags. The thing that we're really interested in is the ability to apply image analysis  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:32):**  to problems on farm. The one that we're really running at the moment is facial recognition  in sheep because that'll underpin a whole heap of changes that we can make through automated.  We can automate lots of measurement, lots of understanding of what's happening on farm  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:25:46):**  if we can get facial recognition working. That's our current focus.  This is like a camera and taking a picture of a sheep and saying, okay, this is the sheep  or are you saying other things about the sheep? What are you actually measuring? Where are  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:00):**  the cameras? Tell us a little bit about their... Give us a picture of what that looks like.  Yeah, so we did some work with AWI where we had a crate set up and had four cameras around  that crate and took a heap of images of each sheep and then through collaboration with  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:14):**  University of Sydney, analyzed all that and worked out that in concept form that worked.  We could tell sheep separately from each other. I think in that work, we had 1,900 individuals  and it would tell us 99% plus accuracy which individual that was just by the photo of it.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:31):**  Were you surprised by that? I guess yes and kind of no because I know  that I walk through the airports every day and the only thing that lets me in the gate  is facial recognition cameras under that controlled scenario. I guess there's no reason that sheep  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:26:47):**  are different than humans apart from a few obvious aspects. But that work wasn't taking  us closer to... Because putting sheep in a crate, if you've got them in a crate, you  know they are and you can weigh them and do everything else you need to.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:01):**  So we wanted to move that to how can we do that out on farm or in a more commercial context.  So now we're running retraining models. We've got a race set up that's got four cameras  on it. So we run sheep through which gives us about 30 frames, so 30 individual images  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:18):**  of the sheep as they bolt through, same as any normal drafting race, drenching race.  We run them down that and the idea is that that would be directly linked to a camera  in the paddock and so that once the ID, once it runs past, the animal is linked to its  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:33):**  EID, to its RFID and then we know who it is and then so an image of that sheep, wherever  it is on the farm, we'll know who that animal is. That's the work we're doing right now  to train that model. So at the moment we've run around about six or 700 sheep through  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:27:50):**  that race plus we've taken images of those individual sheep out on in a paddock and so  we're retraining machine learning model at the moment to do that and if that works then  we sort of onto the next stages of actual behavioral tracking and working out when they're  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:04):**  grazing, when they're doing whatever from images. So we've got a range of different  work through students and collaborations going on across that spectrum at the moment.  That is super exciting. So that in itself could become its own business or kind of take  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:19):**  all of this work to the next level. Is that the vision and the aspiration?  Yeah, so geneSmith.ai is a company that is sort of waiting to be formed once we get some  of this working. So we see that as being a standalone component which will become a spin-off  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:35):**  from NextGen Agri which will be mainly, which will focus on consulting and that online training  aspect plus some research. But we see that whole tech space as sort of having, growing  a life of its own and getting its own team and really driving forward because it's just  
**[0:28:52-0:28:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:28:52):**  an enormous opportunity to really take big steps in the sheep industry towards understanding  what individuals are doing the same as what we see in yield monitoring and in horticulture  and cropping and what we see in dairy cows in the sheep industry. We really have been  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:09):**  limited to mob-based stuff and if we get beyond that then we open up a whole new level of  opportunity that really is just sitting there waiting to be explored.  I'm excited to have you back on the podcast in a year or two and hear an update on how  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:24):**  that's going.  Hopefully one, not two.  Deal. When you talk to farmers, whether clients or not, about this work and facial recognition  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:35):**  and all this tech, what's the response like?  We don't talk so much about the tech but about what we can do with it which is matching news  to the lambs, matching performance to the animal ones, monitoring animals remotely.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:29:51):**  Those sort of things get people really excited. I think the big one is just that they want  to know their animals are healthy and happy and if they've got a system that helps them  do that with a level of integrity that means that they can go on holiday or they can go  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:07):**  to town that day and do something else knowing that their animals are safe and happy, that  peace of mind I think is a massive aspect. There's also obviously the upside in terms  of productivity but first and foremost the people across agriculture love seeing healthy  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:22):**  animals and any system that helps them be really early with making changes to make sure  their animals are healthy and productive. I think that gets people excited, that real  ability to monitor animals at a whole new level.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:35):**  It ties back to your point about consumers as well. There's increasing pressure on being  able to prove some of those kinds of things, welfare and well-being and keeping that clean  green image there. I imagine there's some potential there as well.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:30:48):**  Yeah, I understand that. We started off with a sense of work with really that in mind and  we talked about that to those brand partners. They love the concept of monitoring animals  24-7 and so it wasn't just a pipe dream that the animals were being looked after. They  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:05):**  really were monitored and looked after and that resonates with farmers and it does with  consumers. With an expert like Ferg on the show, it'd  be a mistake not to ask about the future of the sheep industry and where he sees things  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:19):**  headed. Yeah, I guess I'm very, as we all are, we're  just consumer trends and what's changing and I think the current strong demand for wool  we're seeing and for natural fibre, I think that seems to be not just a flash in the pan.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:36):**  It seems to be a real thing and that's stemming from a real desire from some of these big  brands to really have a product they can stand behind in terms of the whole backstory of  that product. I think we're in for good days in the natural fibre industry. I think as  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:31:54):**  we understand more about microfibres going into oceans and the whole heap of things that  plastics are doing to the planet and the natural fibre that biodegrades within six months of  hitting the ground, ticks a lot of boxes in terms of the raw footprint of growing wool  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:10):**  production. I don't think we can sit back and say, yes,  jobs right, we produce protein and the world needs more protein and so we're going to be  in for great times and we produce wool and the world needs more wool. We're in for great  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:22):**  times. I think we need to be really smart and think about what that looks like. If we  are going to demand a premium price, we have to be premium producers so we need to be really  aware of what that consumer wants. They're going to wool because they want to have a  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:34):**  really good backstory but they're not going to go to wool if there's skeletons in the  closet that put that brand at risk. We need to be really thinking about what's happening  on farm, what's happening in our breeding, what's happening across everything we do in  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:32:47):**  our marketing, in our manufacture, what's happening across that whole spectrum that  might be viewed negatively in 10 years and think about how, I guess in our lifetime,  how much more scrutiny has come on what we're doing and more aware people are of what's  
**[0:33:03-0:33:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:03):**  happening both on farm but in that whole process from farm right through to garment. I think  we need to be really aware of making sure we're squeaky clean and we are producing in  a really premium way and I think environmental credentials and welfare are going to lead  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:21):**  to that. For anyone listening who's excited about what Ferg and NextGen Agri have been  up to, check out the show notes for links to the blog, Twitter and the website which  they've recently updated, launching a number of courses and online options. I also asked  
**[0:33:35-0:33:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:35):**  Ferg to give us a shameless plug for where to find him. So www.nextgenagri.com is where  you'll find our website and there's a whole heap of information on there, opportunities  to get access to us. Articles will be going up frequently and then opportunities to get  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:33:52):**  access to us through subscription and through online training.  Great, I would like to keep hearing updates from you. I learn a lot and have been really  fortunate to have someone like you teach me so much about the sheep industry. So thanks  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=575058#t=0:34:05):**  for that and I'm really excited to see where all of this goes.  Thanks Sarah, I look forward to continuing to work with you.  Thank you for joining us on another episode of Ag Tech So What. You can stay up to date

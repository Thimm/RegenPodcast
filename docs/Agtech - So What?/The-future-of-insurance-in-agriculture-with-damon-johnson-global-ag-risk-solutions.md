### Agtech - So What?  (2022-06-15)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm Sarah Nolette.  In production agriculture, especially for commodity grains, producers face the ever  
**[0:00:12-0:00:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:12):**  unpredictable and unknown risk that is the weather.  One toolset they have to manage this is insurance, a product category and sector that is something  of a black box for most people in the ag industry.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:22):**  If it's a black box for you, check out our previous episode where we did a 101 on the  industry.  But continue on because there's plenty of insights here.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:30):**  And there's some interesting things happening at the intersection of ag insurance and technology  that might just change the way the whole industry deals with climate risk.  Let's take the coverage and let's just package it in the bag or in the jug or whatever the  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:43):**  packages that goes out to the farm and just give that peace of mind to the farmer that  as they purchase this product, it's already coming with the coverage.  And I almost liken it to like a canola seed or a corn seed that has a treatment on it  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:54):**  that as you put it in the ground, you have protection against insects or disease, but  you also have protection against heat.  And it's just something you can't see, but it's there.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:03):**  That's Damon Johnson, the director of strategic projects at Parametric.Ag based in Yorkton,  Saskatchewan in Canada.  We invited him on today to talk about the future of ag insurance, a slowly evolving  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:13):**  space that could nevertheless prove transformative.  But let's start with Damon.  Though he has a long history in financial and enterprise risk management and a deep  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:21):**  interest in markets and economics, he also describes himself as just a farm kid from  Saskatchewan.  In that way, Parametric.Ag was an outgrowth of his obsession with farm economics and data  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:32):**  architecture.  He found a home at Global Ag Risk, an 11 year old private production cost insurance carrier  in Western Canada.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:39):**  The idea of teaming up with Global Ag Risk, Damon says, started at a hockey game, a story  we'll return to.  But we felt it was important to start today's conversation with a bit of background on how  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:48):**  the ag insurance space works.  Here's Damon.  I think everyone thinks of it the same way, has different levels of understanding with  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:56):**  it.  And because risk and return are highly correlated where greater risk comes greater reward.  But I would say the number of options are fairly limited or the level of sophistication,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:08):**  and it's not a knock on understanding or sophistication, but the level of sophistication of the products  and thinking about cat loss type of bonds and different things or hedging type products  where you need to be classified as a sophisticated investor are available.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:21):**  But the actual adoption of them is quite low just because it's a heavy product to understand,  but then actually execute within that plan.  So with those two things in mind, us as a company, our mindset is we think about risk  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:34):**  as being behavioral.  And we all grew up on small family farms, and I'm no different growing up under the  wing of my father who he, you want to go for it every year.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:44):**  You want to make the best agronomic decisions, the best marketing decisions.  All those things are going to in a successful year are going to make you successful.  And we, from a behavioral standpoint, we want the farmer, the producer to make those decisions  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:57):**  for the best outcome.  But there's always that thought in your back, your mind of what if it doesn't rain or what  if we get hail or whatever, we get a frost and those things are going to happen.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:05):**  And we just see those all the time, but we want the farmer from a behavioral standpoint  to go make those best decisions for their farm.  And then if the bad thing happens, they know that risk is transferred off their farm and  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:16):**  we've got their back.  So that's really how we approach that methodology.  And that thought of risk is from that standpoint of we still want to empower decision-making  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:25):**  and solid operational financial management decisions for that farm for the best possible  outcome.  One of the reasons that I think insurance is a really tough space to innovate in and  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:37):**  that we haven't seen drastic changes in many years is just that cost of customer acquisition  is really high.  And especially like how you're talking about it, if it's gotta be a conversation over a  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:47):**  pickup truck and in person and this shared reality, like that is both great from a relationship  perspective and yet tough from like a cost of customer acquisition perspective.  How do you see that tension and do you think it's changing?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:02):**  Like most things they are.  And it's, I say that this in the best way possible that Ag tends to always be catching  up to other industries.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:09):**  And when you look at adoption of electronic processes or different things like that, and  it's just the nature of the industry, whether it's adoption of Ag Tech technologies that  you're very familiar with their insurance processes, or even just online banking and  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:25):**  different kind of direct payments from elevators that happen electronically.  There's just a little bit of that kind of need to wait it out and see other people do  it first before I get into it.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:33):**  And when we look at current state and traditionally insurance has been, you said it is, I would  say it's for people process and paper heavy.  You envision no back offices with a lot of people in it because there's a lot of paperwork  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:45):**  and analysis, whether it's underwriting administration finance to get done.  There's lots of paperwork and believe it or not people still use fax machines to send  stuff back and forth.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:53):**  And that's still a way that we communicate and then just the people to support all of  that as well too.  And we certainly, we have those types of functions as well, and they're incredibly important  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:01):**  for our business and they always will be.  And I think about what points within that, that sales cycle or that, that cycle where  we deliver products to the farm of what can change.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:13):**  And I'm very keen to reduce friction within that sales process so that the consumer or  the farmer in this case can become educated on the products with facts and knowledge in  order to as they maybe engage still with an advisor, but they're they're educated, they're  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:28):**  informed.  And it's not so much an educational journey as much as it is about an application journey  on their farm.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:34):**  I see that one being a big one.  And that's simply, I think a function for us and the industry of taking something that's  in cloudy and generally unknown a little bit when it comes down to like the black and white  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:45):**  of products and just making it very transparent.  I think that's a big one.  Product development is one that I'm really keen to again, and we've talked about parametrics  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:54):**  a little bit in a bit, I think too, but we need to open the door to just more options.  And more choice for the producer.  And I think another big one too, and we're starting to see it in other industries and  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:06:06):**  it's certainly coming into the insurance or the crop insurance industry more is that allowing  the farmer to use the data that's generated on their farm or by their farm or that surrounds  their farm that has a direct impact on production and operations as part of the underwriting  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:06:22):**  and the insurance process and not so much and based less so on area averages and different  things like that to aggregate everybody into a group and you participate within that.  There's a really neat opportunity to do that.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:06:36):**  And I think the last one too, and I think it gets a lot of talk, but in practice we  haven't seen it, but I think we will is this ESG concept picturing like a credit or a token  type of process for farmers who are practicing sustainability and good farm stewardship,  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:06:51):**  whether it's carbon capture or whatever the case may be, but getting credit for those  sustainable practices on their farm because through the value chain, insurers and reinsurers  and everybody involved that it's highly valuable.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:01):**  Yeah, we're absolutely seeing that in the consumer space.  There's all kinds of things that say, well, if I can prove that I exercise and I don't  drink and then like my insurance premiums go down and say the way I take care of my  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:12):**  health impacts my insurance.  And you could imagine that's not too crazy to say the way a farmer takes care of their  farm could impact their insurance, but easy to say and hard to do.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:21):**  For sure.  Absolutely.  So I imagine it gets into a tough even, yeah, like a sales conversation there because you  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:28):**  get into like value judgments about good practices and bad practices, like challenging to keep  it objective rather than a kind of subjective view.  It is.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:39):**  And just to relate a story, I was at a recent accelerator function and there was a number  of mentors and industry participants in a room and the concept comes up about sustainable  agriculture and regenerative agriculture and all these kinds of different buzzwords that  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:52):**  we hear and see out there.  And by definition or perhaps a perception is that we, and I'm including myself as a  farmer now, is that we are not deploying these practices and we need to obtain this social  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:08:04):**  license with the divide between rural and urban markets that we're going to start to  employ in these things where the farmer, my peers, every farmer I know goes to every extent  and already has been practicing all these sustainability practices on their farm just  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:08:20):**  because it's a really good darn business and it's good for their farm.  It's something that they can easily get their back up because it almost comes across as  almost like an accusation where it's, what do you mean?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:08:29):**  We're doing these things, but we just need to do a really good job of proving it and  where there's value in that data or those practices.  Like you said, if you've got life insurance and your Fitbit's telling you that you're  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:08:39):**  working out and you're healthy and you're getting lots of sleep, that should be beneficial  as the person that's being covered.  And we see that no differently or that coming down the pipeline is also an input into the  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:08:50):**  ultimate insurable decision.  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's go back to that hockey game where you started talking about parametric insurance.  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:08:58):**  Yeah.  Tell me about how that conversation went and why you ended up down that path.  Yeah, no.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:04):**  So it's so that my, my two cohorts, Dave and Grant were, they were, they were at a hockey  game.  I wasn't there.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:11):**  And anyways, as hockey games go, it is, there's great socializing, there's good action and  maybe a couple of beverages involved.  But with, you know, key market participants in the insurance space, and I very vividly  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:22):**  remember the next morning, Dave phoned me up with this concept of frankly, all the best  decisions start with the question about how might we create a canola heat blast product  for Western Canadian farmers using a weather source, whether it's a weather station or  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:35):**  a gridded network or something like that was really the framework of the conversation.  And me being obsessive to that point, I really started grinding on that.  And this is going back to, you know, 2019, frankly.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:45):**  So it was there's been a long tail on the exploration development to get to market,  but that's really the impetus of where that started from was, you know, people just kind  of socializing on the topic.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:55):**  There might be something there, but we don't know to idea generation to proof of concept  or pre-commercialization.  And here we are, you know, three and a half years ago, very quickly in that sense.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:04):**  But that's really frankly, where that came from.  Never underestimate the power of curiosity and maybe a beer or two.  Tell me what parametric insurance is defined it maybe for anyone who's not familiar.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:14):**  Yeah.  So, parametrics or index structured insurances, they're not new that they're, they exist in  the market now at a farm market level.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:24):**  They're just not widely adopted and I'll get into that, but there've been more widely used  in reinsurance and sovereign kind of catastrophic bond type of coverages where you're detecting  a larger area or a Caribbean country from a hurricane or different events like that,  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:42):**  where there's a catastrophic element to it regardless of where traditional indemnity  based insurance or crop insurance, I'll just say they're designed to compensate the farmer  or the participant for a loss in the loss of genuine yield or revenue where a parametric  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:58):**  cover pays out claims based on an index of event triggers that caused the loss to happen.  And so, for example, creating an index of, you know, the frequency and severity of excess  heat in Western Canada so that where if we know that when it gets excessively hot during  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:14):**  the pollination period of a canola's plant development, it is significantly detrimental  to yield development and then revenue for that crop.  So for us, it's to, if there's excess heat during the critical flowering pollination  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:28):**  development stage of that crop is that so much heat accumulates, we will pay the producer  based off of that and not have to assess the actual loss or damage to the crop using that  very long tail of that claims adjudication, filing, review, and then payment history.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:44):**  That's the key difference.  Yeah.  So just to say that back and make sure I understand in the non-parametric world, we actually have  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:51):**  to verify that event did happen.  And so it's, yes, my, there was hail on my farm or my house did burn down or whatever  it is, and here's my proof.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:00):**  And you get into this argument about I'm incentivized as a consumer to maximize my claim.  Whereas in the parametric case, it's like it did or didn't trip the trigger.  We did, I didn't fall into that heat range and there's no, it doesn't need to have happened  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:11):**  on my farm and I approve it.  It's just the trigger tripped or it didn't.  Absolutely.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:16):**  Awesome.  And so what are the benefits there from an insurance company in terms of cost of claim  makes a lot of sense to me.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:23):**  What are some of the other benefits for a parametric?  And I guess if it hasn't been adopted so far, why not?  Yeah.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:29):**  Yeah.  One of the detractors from broad development of parametrics is the cost to establish them  is it's fairly significant, honestly.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:38):**  So that, you know, it is an investment in, in, in the strategy but you have to build  the products in order to get them, them to market the costs where you start to, you know,  see some real efficiency and all just the first time I use the word scale in our conversation,  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:55):**  but the ability to scale is fairly significant in that once we've built a product and I'll  just use our canola heat blast product as an example, once we built it whether we're  ensuring 20 or 30,000 acres or this year we've grown, you know, 44, 45 X from where we were  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:10):**  last year is that we're able to scale up in within that same structure because we don't  need to add people and paper and processes because it's all data driven and we very specifically  the main key drivers we've built parametrics and the parametrics.ag platform and product  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:27):**  is that within it we've got all of the historical analytics and display them to the farmer with  within it we've got the quoting, the binding, the transaction process are all stored within  it as well as transparency on the progress of the current state to a claim outcome and  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:45):**  then all the claims are adjudicated and analyzed and settled within the same process as well  too and that's all just done systematically with no human intervention service.  So that's where the opportunity comes from is that once you get the idea and you've structured  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:59):**  the product and built the system the way that we have and we encourage others to do is that  you can go from, you know, one to a million acres without adding an extra human into that  process just because it's all completely systematic and we see that as being we touched on it  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:15):**  at the start of the discussion here was reducing the friction from that sales process whereby,  you know, say a more traditional sale or acquisition of an insurance policy for your farm may take  several hours within our product from start to finish from analysis to quote to getting  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:32):**  your policies about eight or nine minute process that all happens over your desktop computer  in your office in that you touched on too the acquisition cost or the transaction costs  significantly become reduced as you scale up on an acreage just because your delivery  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:46):**  costs stay flat or actually go down when you get to scale.  When you talk about product development, my sense is there's a few elements in there.  One is figuring out like, okay, what are the parameters we actually want to set and what  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:58):**  is the modeling show and how are we going to balance the benefit for the customer with  us actually making money here?  And then there's all the software elements of how do we embed that in a product and how  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:08):**  do we get something that's user-facing?  So there's a modeling maybe climatic science element.  There's a financial element and then there's like a technical software element.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:17):**  Is that a fair breakdown?  Yeah, a hundred percent.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:21):**  It's and again, we're not doing anything new here.  We're just taking the pieces to the puzzle or trying to solve new puzzles with things  that already exist.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:27):**  And it's really that collision of weather data because we're solely based on weather  type of exposures, agronomic data, and that's generally created from like a crop development  or a growth stage model of a crop canola or wheat or lentils.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:40):**  And then the financial data that attaches to it or underpins it in order to create that  premium structure and delivery to the market.  So it's three of those independently don't become a product, but until you actually,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:52):**  those three actually collide within a Venn diagram is where the parametric structure  comes from.  And yeah, exactly.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:58):**  There's a ton of analysis and modeling that has to take place on the insurance side, as  well as on the the review of the historical time series of frequency and severity of the  weather.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:16:10):**  And then you also have to test the actuarial models, which is a whole other science in  itself.  And then only, and only if when you've done all those things effectively, then you start  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:16:18):**  to move that into the user interface and all of your enterprise systems that support your  policies, your administration, the finance components.  I recently created a mind map of what it takes to develop a parametric product.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:16:30):**  And it started off with two databases, but it went off in about, I think there's 104  different tentacles of development that need to be addressed that only come back to actual  marketable product once you've done all those effectively.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:16:42):**  So it's, and maybe the reason that there hasn't been a lot of like farm based analytics or  farm based parametrics, I should say is that it's actually pretty stinking hard to do.  I enjoy it.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:16:54):**  Maybe that makes me a little bit strange, but that is the challenge.  And one that we took on is we evaluated why parametric or index type of structures were  offered at the farm level.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:17:03):**  Why was there no staying power?  Why didn't they stick around?  Why wasn't there a lot of adoption?  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:17:07):**  A lot of it came down to the cost, but at the same time, there wasn't a lot of education  on the product distribution.  It was difficult because you had this kind of innovative product, but it still had to  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:17:17):**  be delivered, you know, through, you know, paper-based sales system, which created friction  within it.  But at the end of the day, you know, a lot of it came down to just bad data and a lot  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:17:25):**  of basis risks that were still inherently built into the product.  Sounds challenging.  Talk about the journey a little bit for you, any like false starts, failures, pivots?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:17:36):**  I'm sure there's many.  The biggest one, and I'm just, I'm a little bit obsessive just on the data and different  formulas, but we spent a lot of time off to start looking at using actual, and we talked,  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:17:46):**  I mentioned basis risk before, but we talked about, do you use a network of actual physical  infield weather stations that are going to monitor, report, verify, and settle the data  that you require to, and test the different, different networks and different pieces of  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:01):**  architecture with that.  Only to realize that wasn't actually how we were going to proceed with the project.  We spent a while on that and knowing that we had to, but we pivoted very quickly and  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:09):**  very deliberately to establish establishing our own high resolution gridded weather structure,  where we're monitoring and verifying the data on a six mile by six mile basis without the  actual reliance on any infield weather stations and solely using satellite and radar sources  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:23):**  that are, again, are readily available to everybody, but until you apply different methodologies  to it, where it's accurate and transparent at a very localized level, it becomes a very  general data set.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:34):**  And through that journey, that's one that I'll always think about and talk about was  that just because, you know, it took a significant amount of time and testing and investment  only to realize it was something that you didn't want to do and pivot to something else.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:48):**  But yeah, along the way, and I analyze and override, I analyze everything and that means  it probably takes a little bit more time.  And knowing now what I knew then, you kind of move through the process a little bit more  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:58):**  fluid now, knowing where some of the roadblocks or barriers that we hit before we kind of  overcome them.  And that experience now allows us to move through it or move around it and to the solution  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:19:08):**  much more quickly.  Where you guys have come from is from an existing insurance company.  And so part of the work that you don't have to do is get an insurance company on board  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:19:16):**  to actually support these products from the kind of upstream perspective.  You could also imagine coming at insurance from the data collection side.  If you've got a bunch of on-farm data or you're kind of in that space, you could come at it  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:19:28):**  that way, or you could come at it from, we actually have the customer interface and come  back and develop products that way.  What's your argument for coming at it the way that you have and do you see pros and  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:19:37):**  cons there?  I do.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:19:40):**  I love the question just because it's something we talk about a lot.  More in the competitive sense of as this evolves, where do we stand and other companies that  are more of a fully integrated digital tech type of company are coming up with different  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:19:53):**  insurance offers now.  Whereas a lot of the data is there or data infrastructure is there and it's really to  add on the insurance piece.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:20:00):**  There's different companies that are more of a software development firm that want to  add on ag tech and insurance, which in my opinion is incredibly difficult to do, but  I bring that up in the sense that I made the comment that I'm really glad that we were  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:20:12):**  able to come at it from an insurance standpoint, because the actually the insurance part was  the hardest part of the whole thing.  If you can imagine just with the actuarial work and the reinsurance and the different  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:20:23):**  things that come into place, that's the one component that was really hard and actually  plugging in the data and establishing the data structures in the grand scheme of it  was what was fairly simple.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:20:34):**  Whereas if an ag tech company wanting to become an insurance company, in my opinion, is just  would be much more difficult just because the insurance side is it's actually really  difficult and time intensive and layered and regulatory compliance type of commitments  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:20:49):**  and disciplines that you have to employ and all of that as well too.  So just the red tape and the compliance that surrounds that side of it is fairly tedious.  How does the time question change with parametric insurance versus other kinds of insurance?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:03):**  I imagine that you can evaluate risk in a more real time way because again, it's not  did it already happen to my farm?  It's more at that regional or pooled scale.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:14):**  Yeah.  How does the time element play out?  I'm really passionate about this one.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:19):**  Time is time in the space is incredibly important and I'll include distance in that and I'll  describe that in a second.  But time to your point is as we've evolved, the data has become much more available, but  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:31):**  the reliance on not old stale data, but delays in receiving the data.  And this is one frankly, one small issue we dealt with last year is that we were, we had  about a five day lag in the data as it came into us that we processed it and displayed  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:45):**  it to the customer and created transparency.  And I'm really proud of what we've done to overcome that.  But time both from a historical standpoint of having a really long time series to base  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:55):**  our analysis from a, again, the severity and risk standpoint in order to really establish  a good index that the farm's going to be structured to is really important.  And then as well, it's incredibly sophisticated, complex processes where we're getting data  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:10):**  from different resolutions piped into our systems where we're applying our methods to  it and we're applying it to every six mile by six mile grid across our market on a daily  basis.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:20):**  And it's taking something from satellites up in the atmosphere and making it really  easy to see and understand at the farm level.  And that's been huge.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:28):**  And again, when we talked about adoption in the past where there's a lag in the data or  you're relying on last year's data or data from 30 days ago, they're just that kind of  gap in time creates a little bit of uncertainty here on easiness within that total product  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:44):**  cycle.  That's such a big one.  And again, I talked about distance before, and when I say that it's as important is that,  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:50):**  like I said, we were where we've got basis risk available, where we're actually not measuring  the risk that's happening on my farm because the instrument or the weather station is 18  miles away, that space in between those two points, then the weather that's actually occurring  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:04):**  is so significantly different quite often.  So the farmer's not actually being insured for the actual outcome that could be present  or creating risk on that farm where we're that time element and reducing the amount  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:17):**  of time and the amount of drag as it comes into the product was incredibly important.  We're also looked at again, where we've got, we're spatially, a hundred percent spatially  and temporally complete within the distance within our data structure because we have  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:30):**  no gaps in between farm locations or if they farm in multiple locations.  We're really proud of that where we say we have maps with no gaps and that the basis  risk both from a time element and a distance element is incredibly mitigated because of  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:44):**  those two factors.  Talk about other enabling technologies.  Obviously there's been stuff on the scientific side, on the technological side.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:53):**  When you zoom out and look forward, is there like untapped potential somewhere else that  you're really excited about?  Yeah.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:59):**  Further to in the agronomic spaces, I'm not a professional agronomist by any stretch.  It's all home-based and just learning from my dad and my peers.  The one that's really exciting, Sarah, is as we start to look at, definitely the weather,  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:11):**  but agronomics, just different disease pressures that become present on farms or even insects  for that matter is the predictive analytics when it comes to disease pressure, whether  it's fusarium in Durham, we just go to tainian canola or white mold in a soybean crop is  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:27):**  that from a crop modeling standpoint, in the past, they're generally been fairly accurate,  but with which to structure some type of coverage around is a little bit more difficult or there's  more basis risk in it just because there's so many factors that go into it.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:41):**  But just working with some people really closely, even just had some looked at some interesting  technology today from a disease modeling standpoint is that's becoming really impressive.  And that's a situation or apparel that affects crops at every point on the globe.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:56):**  And I think that one's really exciting and one that we're watching really closely.  Yeah, one of our hypotheses is that if you, as we understand more about the seeds and  the inputs and soil science, you almost can think about baking in the risk questions to  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:11):**  the products, which then you think about, well, okay, how does the conversation about  buying insurance go?  Does it actually, is it much more embedded in the supply chain versus from a separate  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:19):**  provider?  What do you think about that theory?  I love this topic just because as you'll be spending most of this discussion talking about  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:26):**  developing products and distributing to the farm through a very traditional sales sense,  whether it goes through a digital platform or an agent.  When as we're really proud of the work that we're doing with Corteva AgriScience that  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:38):**  we announced last year, where essentially in saying having the farmer, having to do  the research to go and acquire the coverage, knowing that heat and canola can be detrimental  to the yield and the profitability outcome to it.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:50):**  Let's take the coverage and let's just package it in the bag or in the jog or whatever the  package is that goes out to the farm.  And we're executing on that right now.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:58):**  We're really excited about it and just give that peace of mind to the farmer that as they  purchase this product, it's already coming with the coverage.  And I almost liken it to like canola seed or a corn seed that has a treatment on it,  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:09):**  that as you put it in the ground, you have protection against insects or disease, but  you also have protection against heat.  And it's just something you can't see, but it's there.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:17):**  And since then, we've been engaged with some of the biggest companies and we're all talking  about that same type of concept of there's again, a behavioral element of maybe not doing  something because something bad might happen to that crop.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:29):**  You spray a fungicide and it gets hot in July and really the effectiveness of application.  It's not so present.  And it's to say, go farm, go do the application.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:37):**  If it gets really hot, we'll reimburse you the cost of the product and application and  really take that delay or that uneasiness in that decision-making away, knowing that  if cost is the pivotal piece of why you wouldn't do something in a case that something bad  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:50):**  happens.  And I think that's going to be a big one.  And I've got a pretty good sense of it just because my whiteboard that I'm looking at  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:58):**  is full of different products and ideas and companies that are interested in doing things  like this.  And it's seed and chemical manufacturers and it's crop and grain merchants and commodity  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:27:10):**  companies and digital ag companies.  And it's really exciting because it tells me that regardless of who it is or what it  is that everybody is thinking that this is the new and not just a trend, but this is  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:27:21):**  this new real anchor in the industry is implementing some of these innovative coverages that they're  not created to replace or disband any existing multi-parallel coverages on a farm.  But it's to layer in across the full risk management plan for that farm, whether they  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:27:37):**  have to go and seek it out and buy it on their own, or whether it's packaged within products  that they already buy just as part of their core operational processes that they need  to do in order to plant their crops.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:27:46):**  What other changes do you think we'll see if you zoom out 10 years or so?  What looks different about ag insurance than it does today?  I think the big one is that I keep coming back to it's that specific farm experience  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:00):**  or that, or the data that's coming off the farm feeding into the insurance application  where it's not just solely based off of area averages or production averages for your farm,  or maybe just solely based off of your own financial statements.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:15):**  And I would say this for like banking and finance and fintech and insure tech and all  these different other types of things.  But as a farmer and somebody who loves to play with data and create data structures,  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:24):**  I would like to see farmers to start to get credit for that are using and collecting and  deploying really sophisticated data elements on their farm for tracking and monitoring  what they're doing as part of that equation.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:36):**  I think that's going to be a big one and only because we have some catching up to do on  that one.  And I think once it gets there, it's going to be really important.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:44):**  But again, with that, that's going to require the farmers to actually adopt that technology.  And there's a little bit of a history there.  So I think that lots of promises have been made and lots haven't been delivered.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:53):**  So there's a little bit of like resistance to adopt or re adopt until something's more  widely proven.  And there's a little bit of an inverse relationship between those two.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:01):**  But I think once those two meet and start to go in the right directions to be incredibly  positive for farmers that are looking to establish really robust risk management plans for their  farm.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:10):**  Do you think there's a limit to customization?  Do we get into this?  We know so much actually that it either becomes like not worth it for the farmer or we can't  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:22):**  ensure it because we know so much.  And if you overlay kind of climate risk, I don't know.  Do you see any big shifts or tensions there?  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:29):**  For sure.  Not ultimately, when I say for sure, not in terms of there being a lack of urgency to  adopt, but it's as data just becomes or it is more ubiquitous, but as it becomes prepared  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:42):**  to taking sophisticated data and preparing it simply and creating more of an open forum  for it to be observed and applied or even simulated on a farm.  And I hope this happens if the farmer, the consumer will begin to make those decisions  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:56):**  for themselves more readily and figure those things out for themselves without having to  be necessarily in a resold or sold a product every year.  And that's really my dream is just to have this space where there's a lot of options  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:09):**  and there's a lot of choice for the farmers and all the companies are building things  that from a sustainability sense and reducing the friction to get to market is applying  that to farmers that are going to use these things.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:20):**  You talked a little bit in the beginning, David, about the difference between say the  US and Canada and somewhere like Australia, where there are fewer options here.  I guess it gets me thinking about the way that you could argue ag insurance alters incentives  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:34):**  in markets.  And I guess maybe an existential or philosophical question around do we think ag insurance is  good and is there any world where we're ensuring production that we shouldn't be as risk increases  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:47):**  or maybe we, I don't know, is there any kind of, yeah, attention in that question?  There's tension there.  There's some distinct sides to that question at the end of the day.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:57):**  And again, there's some recency bias coming into play with it here.  When we think about at its source, but 2021 was from, I'm just, I'm talking about Western  Canada and much of the United States was a major drought and excessive heat and things  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:10):**  that we haven't seen in 40, 50 years.  And so again, I use that word recency bias, but it was said simply is that I cannot imagine  the outcome, how differently the outcome would have been without such a robust and well-established  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:24):**  and well-supported crop insurance industry in Canada and United States.  And it was just a tough year and we are one of many companies that were very happy that  we were able to support so many farms that put so much money back into communities so  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:38):**  that these folks can continue to do what they love and do it very well and get them through  a tough time from that standpoint.  And the other side of it too, the contention comes from it's taxpayer money funding a lot  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:50):**  of these programs there, right?  So it's, and that's a whole different political discussion we could have for another day,  but it is that it's the taxpayer money.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:00):**  People that work nine to five jobs are funding crop insurance programs, which then subs,  or I should say, which go into subsidizing and cost sharing crop insurance programs that  farmers use.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:11):**  And when you see on the news, how many billions of dollars have gone back to farmers from  these partially taxpayer funded programs, it just creates a little bit of a divide.  This conversation with Damon really got us thinking hard about how the future of ag insurance  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:22):**  might evolve.  And a few things stood out.  Though ag insurance has, for some time, been a notoriously low innovation space, depending  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:29):**  on a lot of paper and one-on-one sales versus digital alternatives, the incentives are becoming  stronger to use more data.  Not least because different farmers don't just experience variations in weather impacts,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:41):**  they also carry different inherent risks by virtue of their production practices.  We think that the ag insurance space, like so many others, will trend towards evaluating  farmers on how sustainable their practices are using farmers' own data or other available  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:55):**  sources such that policies will become more tailored and personalized as a result.  Parametric products are undoubtedly another big piece of the puzzle.  As Damon described, the difference between needing to spend hours with a broker to get  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:33:06):**  a policy and hours, days, or weeks, getting a payout, versus spending less than 10 minutes  to get a quote online and getting more or less automatic reimbursements in a matter  of days is a seismic shift.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:33:18):**  We expect that as farmers become more tech savvy and climate risks increase, this kind  of ease and speed will become essential.  Finally we're extremely interested in the idea of really novel insurance products that  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:33:29):**  could be offered, as Damon described them, as a kind of product add-on or embedded.  The potential value add to a farmer of getting an insurance product attached to an input  is really twofold.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:33:39):**  Not only could it be uniquely well suited to the product at hand, as opposed to a generic  policy, it could also save the farmer the time and energy they would have spent securing  that policy.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:33:49):**  When we think of how that insurance product works of course, and how much it costs, the  devil would surely be in the details.  For now, that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:33:58):**  Thanks to our guest Damon Johnson of parametrics.ag and Global Ag Risk Solutions.

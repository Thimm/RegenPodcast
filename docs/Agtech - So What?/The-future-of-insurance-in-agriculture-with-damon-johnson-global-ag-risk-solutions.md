**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:22):**  If it's a black box for you, check out our previous episode where we did a 101 on the  
**[0:00:27-0:00:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:27):**  industry.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:28):**  But continue on because there's plenty of insights here.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:30):**  And there's some interesting things happening at the intersection of ag insurance and technology  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:34):**  that might just change the way the whole industry deals with climate risk.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:38):**  Let's take the coverage and let's just package it in the bag or in the jug or whatever the  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:43):**  packages that goes out to the farm and just give that peace of mind to the farmer that  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:47):**  as they purchase this product, it's already coming with the coverage.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:50):**  And I almost liken it to like a canola seed or a corn seed that has a treatment on it  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:54):**  that as you put it in the ground, you have protection against insects or disease, but  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:00:58):**  you also have protection against heat.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:00):**  And it's just something you can't see, but it's there.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:03):**  That's Damon Johnson, the director of strategic projects at Parametric.Ag based in Yorkton,  
**[0:01:08-0:01:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:08):**  Saskatchewan in Canada.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:09):**  We invited him on today to talk about the future of ag insurance, a slowly evolving  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:13):**  space that could nevertheless prove transformative.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:16):**  But let's start with Damon.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:17):**  Though he has a long history in financial and enterprise risk management and a deep  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:21):**  interest in markets and economics, he also describes himself as just a farm kid from  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:26):**  Saskatchewan.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:27):**  In that way, Parametric.Ag was an outgrowth of his obsession with farm economics and data  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:32):**  architecture.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:33):**  He found a home at Global Ag Risk, an 11 year old private production cost insurance carrier  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:37):**  in Western Canada.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:39):**  The idea of teaming up with Global Ag Risk, Damon says, started at a hockey game, a story  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:43):**  we'll return to.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:44):**  But we felt it was important to start today's conversation with a bit of background on how  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:48):**  the ag insurance space works.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:50):**  Here's Damon.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:51):**  I think everyone thinks of it the same way, has different levels of understanding with  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:56):**  it.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:01:57):**  And because risk and return are highly correlated where greater risk comes greater reward.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:03):**  But I would say the number of options are fairly limited or the level of sophistication,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:08):**  and it's not a knock on understanding or sophistication, but the level of sophistication of the products  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:13):**  and thinking about cat loss type of bonds and different things or hedging type products  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:17):**  where you need to be classified as a sophisticated investor are available.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:21):**  But the actual adoption of them is quite low just because it's a heavy product to understand,  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:27):**  but then actually execute within that plan.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:29):**  So with those two things in mind, us as a company, our mindset is we think about risk  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:34):**  as being behavioral.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:36):**  And we all grew up on small family farms, and I'm no different growing up under the  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:41):**  wing of my father who he, you want to go for it every year.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:44):**  You want to make the best agronomic decisions, the best marketing decisions.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:48):**  All those things are going to in a successful year are going to make you successful.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:52):**  And we, from a behavioral standpoint, we want the farmer, the producer to make those decisions  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:57):**  for the best outcome.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:02:59):**  But there's always that thought in your back, your mind of what if it doesn't rain or what  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:02):**  if we get hail or whatever, we get a frost and those things are going to happen.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:05):**  And we just see those all the time, but we want the farmer from a behavioral standpoint  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:10):**  to go make those best decisions for their farm.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:13):**  And then if the bad thing happens, they know that risk is transferred off their farm and  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:16):**  we've got their back.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:17):**  So that's really how we approach that methodology.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:20):**  And that thought of risk is from that standpoint of we still want to empower decision-making  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:25):**  and solid operational financial management decisions for that farm for the best possible  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:30):**  outcome.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:31):**  One of the reasons that I think insurance is a really tough space to innovate in and  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:37):**  that we haven't seen drastic changes in many years is just that cost of customer acquisition  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:43):**  is really high.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:44):**  And especially like how you're talking about it, if it's gotta be a conversation over a  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:47):**  pickup truck and in person and this shared reality, like that is both great from a relationship  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:53):**  perspective and yet tough from like a cost of customer acquisition perspective.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:03:57):**  How do you see that tension and do you think it's changing?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:02):**  Like most things they are.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:03):**  And it's, I say that this in the best way possible that Ag tends to always be catching  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:08):**  up to other industries.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:09):**  And when you look at adoption of electronic processes or different things like that, and  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:14):**  it's just the nature of the industry, whether it's adoption of Ag Tech technologies that  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:19):**  you're very familiar with their insurance processes, or even just online banking and  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:25):**  different kind of direct payments from elevators that happen electronically.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:28):**  There's just a little bit of that kind of need to wait it out and see other people do  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:32):**  it first before I get into it.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:33):**  And when we look at current state and traditionally insurance has been, you said it is, I would  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:38):**  say it's for people process and paper heavy.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:41):**  You envision no back offices with a lot of people in it because there's a lot of paperwork  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:45):**  and analysis, whether it's underwriting administration finance to get done.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:49):**  There's lots of paperwork and believe it or not people still use fax machines to send  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:52):**  stuff back and forth.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:53):**  And that's still a way that we communicate and then just the people to support all of  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:57):**  that as well too.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:04:58):**  And we certainly, we have those types of functions as well, and they're incredibly important  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:01):**  for our business and they always will be.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:04):**  And I think about what points within that, that sales cycle or that, that cycle where  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:08):**  we deliver products to the farm of what can change.

**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:33):**  on their farm.

**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:36):**  And that's simply, I think a function for us and the industry of taking something that's  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:41):**  in cloudy and generally unknown a little bit when it comes down to like the black and white

**[0:05:48-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:48):**  I think that's a big one.

**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:05:59):**  And more choice for the producer.

**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:06:06):**  it's certainly coming into the insurance or the crop insurance industry more is that allowing

**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:06:28):**  things like that to aggregate everybody into a group and you participate within that.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:06:32):**  There's a really neat opportunity to do that.

**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:00):**  and everybody involved that it's highly valuable.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:01):**  Yeah, we're absolutely seeing that in the consumer space.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:04):**  There's all kinds of things that say, well, if I can prove that I exercise and I don't  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:08):**  drink and then like my insurance premiums go down and say the way I take care of my

**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:21):**  For sure.

**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:28):**  get into like value judgments about good practices and bad practices, like challenging to keep

**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:38):**  It is.

**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:42):**  of mentors and industry participants in a room and the concept comes up about sustainable

**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:54):**  And by definition or perhaps a perception is that we, and I'm including myself as a  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:07:59):**  farmer now, is that we are not deploying these practices and we need to obtain this social

**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:08:39):**  working out and you're healthy and you're getting lots of sleep, that should be beneficial

**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:08:53):**  Let's go back to that hockey game where you started talking about parametric insurance.  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:08:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:08:59):**  Tell me about how that conversation went and why you ended up down that path.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:03):**  Yeah, no.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:04):**  So it's so that my, my two cohorts, Dave and Grant were, they were, they were at a hockey  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:09):**  game.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:10):**  I wasn't there.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:11):**  And anyways, as hockey games go, it is, there's great socializing, there's good action and  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:15):**  maybe a couple of beverages involved.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:17):**  But with, you know, key market participants in the insurance space, and I very vividly  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:22):**  remember the next morning, Dave phoned me up with this concept of frankly, all the best  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:26):**  decisions start with the question about how might we create a canola heat blast product  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:31):**  for Western Canadian farmers using a weather source, whether it's a weather station or  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:35):**  a gridded network or something like that was really the framework of the conversation.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:39):**  And me being obsessive to that point, I really started grinding on that.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:42):**  And this is going back to, you know, 2019, frankly.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:45):**  So it was there's been a long tail on the exploration development to get to market,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:49):**  but that's really the impetus of where that started from was, you know, people just kind  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:54):**  of socializing on the topic.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:55):**  There might be something there, but we don't know to idea generation to proof of concept  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:09:59):**  or pre-commercialization.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:01):**  And here we are, you know, three and a half years ago, very quickly in that sense.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:04):**  But that's really frankly, where that came from.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:07):**  Never underestimate the power of curiosity and maybe a beer or two.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:10):**  Tell me what parametric insurance is defined it maybe for anyone who's not familiar.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:15):**  So, parametrics or index structured insurances, they're not new that they're, they exist in  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:22):**  the market now at a farm market level.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:24):**  They're just not widely adopted and I'll get into that, but there've been more widely used  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:28):**  in reinsurance and sovereign kind of catastrophic bond type of coverages where you're detecting  
**[0:10:34-0:10:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:10:34):**  a larger area or a Caribbean country from a hurricane or different events like that,

**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:09):**  heat in Western Canada so that where if we know that when it gets excessively hot during  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:14):**  the pollination period of a canola's plant development, it is significantly detrimental  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:20):**  to yield development and then revenue for that crop.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:24):**  So for us, it's to, if there's excess heat during the critical flowering pollination  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:28):**  development stage of that crop is that so much heat accumulates, we will pay the producer  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:34):**  based off of that and not have to assess the actual loss or damage to the crop using that

**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:44):**  That's the key difference.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:46):**  So just to say that back and make sure I understand in the non-parametric world, we actually have  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:51):**  to verify that event did happen.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:54):**  And so it's, yes, my, there was hail on my farm or my house did burn down or whatever  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:11:58):**  it is, and here's my proof.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:00):**  And you get into this argument about I'm incentivized as a consumer to maximize my claim.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:05):**  Whereas in the parametric case, it's like it did or didn't trip the trigger.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:07):**  We did, I didn't fall into that heat range and there's no, it doesn't need to have happened  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:11):**  on my farm and I approve it.

**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:15):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:16):**  Awesome.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:17):**  And so what are the benefits there from an insurance company in terms of cost of claim  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:21):**  makes a lot of sense to me.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:23):**  What are some of the other benefits for a parametric?  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:25):**  And I guess if it hasn't been adopted so far, why not?  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:30):**  One of the detractors from broad development of parametrics is the cost to establish them  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:35):**  is it's fairly significant, honestly.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:38):**  So that, you know, it is an investment in, in, in the strategy but you have to build  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:43):**  the products in order to get them, them to market the costs where you start to, you know,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:49):**  see some real efficiency and all just the first time I use the word scale in our conversation,  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:55):**  but the ability to scale is fairly significant in that once we've built a product and I'll  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:12:59):**  just use our canola heat blast product as an example, once we built it whether we're  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:04):**  ensuring 20 or 30,000 acres or this year we've grown, you know, 44, 45 X from where we were  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:10):**  last year is that we're able to scale up in within that same structure because we don't  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:15):**  need to add people and paper and processes because it's all data driven and we very specifically  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:21):**  the main key drivers we've built parametrics and the parametrics.ag platform and product  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:27):**  is that within it we've got all of the historical analytics and display them to the farmer with  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:33):**  within it we've got the quoting, the binding, the transaction process are all stored within  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:39):**  it as well as transparency on the progress of the current state to a claim outcome and  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:45):**  then all the claims are adjudicated and analyzed and settled within the same process as well  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:49):**  too and that's all just done systematically with no human intervention service.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:54):**  So that's where the opportunity comes from is that once you get the idea and you've structured  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:13:59):**  the product and built the system the way that we have and we encourage others to do is that  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:05):**  you can go from, you know, one to a million acres without adding an extra human into that  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:10):**  process just because it's all completely systematic and we see that as being we touched on it  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:15):**  at the start of the discussion here was reducing the friction from that sales process whereby,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:21):**  you know, say a more traditional sale or acquisition of an insurance policy for your farm may take  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:27):**  several hours within our product from start to finish from analysis to quote to getting  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:32):**  your policies about eight or nine minute process that all happens over your desktop computer  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:37):**  in your office in that you touched on too the acquisition cost or the transaction costs  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:42):**  significantly become reduced as you scale up on an acreage just because your delivery  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:46):**  costs stay flat or actually go down when you get to scale.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:49):**  When you talk about product development, my sense is there's a few elements in there.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:54):**  One is figuring out like, okay, what are the parameters we actually want to set and what  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:14:58):**  is the modeling show and how are we going to balance the benefit for the customer with  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:02):**  us actually making money here?  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:04):**  And then there's all the software elements of how do we embed that in a product and how  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:08):**  do we get something that's user-facing?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:10):**  So there's a modeling maybe climatic science element.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:14):**  There's a financial element and then there's like a technical software element.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:17):**  Is that a fair breakdown?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:19):**  Yeah, a hundred percent.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:21):**  It's and again, we're not doing anything new here.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:22):**  We're just taking the pieces to the puzzle or trying to solve new puzzles with things  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:26):**  that already exist.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:27):**  And it's really that collision of weather data because we're solely based on weather  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:31):**  type of exposures, agronomic data, and that's generally created from like a crop development  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:37):**  or a growth stage model of a crop canola or wheat or lentils.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:40):**  And then the financial data that attaches to it or underpins it in order to create that  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:45):**  premium structure and delivery to the market.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:47):**  So it's three of those independently don't become a product, but until you actually,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:52):**  those three actually collide within a Venn diagram is where the parametric structure  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:56):**  comes from.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:57):**  And yeah, exactly.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:15:58):**  There's a ton of analysis and modeling that has to take place on the insurance side, as  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:16:03):**  well as on the the review of the historical time series of frequency and severity of the  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:16:09):**  weather.

**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:16:13):**  itself.

**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:16:18):**  to move that into the user interface and all of your enterprise systems that support your

**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:37):**  that just because, you know, it took a significant amount of time and testing and investment  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:43):**  only to realize it was something that you didn't want to do and pivot to something else.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:48):**  But yeah, along the way, and I analyze and override, I analyze everything and that means  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:53):**  it probably takes a little bit more time.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:54):**  And knowing now what I knew then, you kind of move through the process a little bit more  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:18:58):**  fluid now, knowing where some of the roadblocks or barriers that we hit before we kind of

**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:19:16):**  to actually support these products from the kind of upstream perspective.

**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:03):**  I imagine that you can evaluate risk in a more real time way because again, it's not

**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:15):**  How does the time element play out?  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:17):**  I'm really passionate about this one.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:19):**  Time is time in the space is incredibly important and I'll include distance in that and I'll

**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:31):**  the reliance on not old stale data, but delays in receiving the data.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:36):**  And this is one frankly, one small issue we dealt with last year is that we were, we had  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:41):**  about a five day lag in the data as it came into us that we processed it and displayed

**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:47):**  And I'm really proud of what we've done to overcome that.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:50):**  But time both from a historical standpoint of having a really long time series to base  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:21:55):**  our analysis from a, again, the severity and risk standpoint in order to really establish  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:00):**  a good index that the farm's going to be structured to is really important.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:04):**  And then as well, it's incredibly sophisticated, complex processes where we're getting data  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:10):**  from different resolutions piped into our systems where we're applying our methods to  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:15):**  it and we're applying it to every six mile by six mile grid across our market on a daily  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:19):**  basis.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:20):**  And it's taking something from satellites up in the atmosphere and making it really  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:24):**  easy to see and understand at the farm level.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:27):**  And that's been huge.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:28):**  And again, when we talked about adoption in the past where there's a lag in the data or  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:33):**  you're relying on last year's data or data from 30 days ago, they're just that kind of  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:38):**  gap in time creates a little bit of uncertainty here on easiness within that total product  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:44):**  cycle.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:45):**  That's such a big one.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:46):**  And again, I talked about distance before, and when I say that it's as important is that,  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:50):**  like I said, we were where we've got basis risk available, where we're actually not measuring  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:55):**  the risk that's happening on my farm because the instrument or the weather station is 18  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:22:59):**  miles away, that space in between those two points, then the weather that's actually occurring  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:04):**  is so significantly different quite often.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:06):**  So the farmer's not actually being insured for the actual outcome that could be present  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:12):**  or creating risk on that farm where we're that time element and reducing the amount  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:17):**  of time and the amount of drag as it comes into the product was incredibly important.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:21):**  We're also looked at again, where we've got, we're spatially, a hundred percent spatially  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:26):**  and temporally complete within the distance within our data structure because we have  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:30):**  no gaps in between farm locations or if they farm in multiple locations.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:35):**  We're really proud of that where we say we have maps with no gaps and that the basis  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:40):**  risk both from a time element and a distance element is incredibly mitigated because of  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:44):**  those two factors.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:45):**  Talk about other enabling technologies.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:48):**  Obviously there's been stuff on the scientific side, on the technological side.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:53):**  When you zoom out and look forward, is there like untapped potential somewhere else that  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:56):**  you're really excited about?  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:23:59):**  Further to in the agronomic spaces, I'm not a professional agronomist by any stretch.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:04):**  It's all home-based and just learning from my dad and my peers.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:07):**  The one that's really exciting, Sarah, is as we start to look at, definitely the weather,  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:11):**  but agronomics, just different disease pressures that become present on farms or even insects  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:17):**  for that matter is the predictive analytics when it comes to disease pressure, whether  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:22):**  it's fusarium in Durham, we just go to tainian canola or white mold in a soybean crop is  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:27):**  that from a crop modeling standpoint, in the past, they're generally been fairly accurate,  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:32):**  but with which to structure some type of coverage around is a little bit more difficult or there's  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:37):**  more basis risk in it just because there's so many factors that go into it.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:41):**  But just working with some people really closely, even just had some looked at some interesting  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:45):**  technology today from a disease modeling standpoint is that's becoming really impressive.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:50):**  And that's a situation or apparel that affects crops at every point on the globe.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:56):**  And I think that one's really exciting and one that we're watching really closely.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:24:59):**  Yeah, one of our hypotheses is that if you, as we understand more about the seeds and  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:05):**  the inputs and soil science, you almost can think about baking in the risk questions to  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:11):**  the products, which then you think about, well, okay, how does the conversation about  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:15):**  buying insurance go?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:16):**  Does it actually, is it much more embedded in the supply chain versus from a separate  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:19):**  provider?  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:20):**  What do you think about that theory?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:22):**  I love this topic just because as you'll be spending most of this discussion talking about  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:26):**  developing products and distributing to the farm through a very traditional sales sense,  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:31):**  whether it goes through a digital platform or an agent.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:34):**  When as we're really proud of the work that we're doing with Corteva AgriScience that  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:38):**  we announced last year, where essentially in saying having the farmer, having to do  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:42):**  the research to go and acquire the coverage, knowing that heat and canola can be detrimental  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:47):**  to the yield and the profitability outcome to it.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:50):**  Let's take the coverage and let's just package it in the bag or in the jog or whatever the  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:55):**  package is that goes out to the farm.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:56):**  And we're executing on that right now.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:25:58):**  We're really excited about it and just give that peace of mind to the farmer that as they  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:02):**  purchase this product, it's already coming with the coverage.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:05):**  And I almost liken it to like canola seed or a corn seed that has a treatment on it,  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:09):**  that as you put it in the ground, you have protection against insects or disease, but  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:14):**  you also have protection against heat.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:15):**  And it's just something you can't see, but it's there.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:17):**  And since then, we've been engaged with some of the biggest companies and we're all talking  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:21):**  about that same type of concept of there's again, a behavioral element of maybe not doing  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:26):**  something because something bad might happen to that crop.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:29):**  You spray a fungicide and it gets hot in July and really the effectiveness of application.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:34):**  It's not so present.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:35):**  And it's to say, go farm, go do the application.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:37):**  If it gets really hot, we'll reimburse you the cost of the product and application and  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:41):**  really take that delay or that uneasiness in that decision-making away, knowing that  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:45):**  if cost is the pivotal piece of why you wouldn't do something in a case that something bad  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:50):**  happens.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:51):**  And I think that's going to be a big one.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:54):**  And I've got a pretty good sense of it just because my whiteboard that I'm looking at  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:26:58):**  is full of different products and ideas and companies that are interested in doing things  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:27:02):**  like this.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:27:03):**  And it's seed and chemical manufacturers and it's crop and grain merchants and commodity  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:27:10):**  companies and digital ag companies.

**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:27:32):**  But it's to layer in across the full risk management plan for that farm, whether they

**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:27:51):**  What looks different about ag insurance than it does today?  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:27:55):**  I think the big one is that I keep coming back to it's that specific farm experience  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:00):**  or that, or the data that's coming off the farm feeding into the insurance application  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:05):**  where it's not just solely based off of area averages or production averages for your farm,  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:11):**  or maybe just solely based off of your own financial statements.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:15):**  And I would say this for like banking and finance and fintech and insure tech and all  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:19):**  these different other types of things.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:20):**  But as a farmer and somebody who loves to play with data and create data structures,  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:24):**  I would like to see farmers to start to get credit for that are using and collecting and  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:29):**  deploying really sophisticated data elements on their farm for tracking and monitoring  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:33):**  what they're doing as part of that equation.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:36):**  I think that's going to be a big one and only because we have some catching up to do on  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:41):**  that one.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:42):**  And I think once it gets there, it's going to be really important.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:44):**  But again, with that, that's going to require the farmers to actually adopt that technology.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:48):**  And there's a little bit of a history there.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:50):**  So I think that lots of promises have been made and lots haven't been delivered.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:53):**  So there's a little bit of like resistance to adopt or re adopt until something's more  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:57):**  widely proven.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:28:59):**  And there's a little bit of an inverse relationship between those two.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:01):**  But I think once those two meet and start to go in the right directions to be incredibly  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:05):**  positive for farmers that are looking to establish really robust risk management plans for their  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:09):**  farm.

**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:14):**  Do we get into this?  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:16):**  We know so much actually that it either becomes like not worth it for the farmer or we can't  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:22):**  ensure it because we know so much.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:23):**  And if you overlay kind of climate risk, I don't know.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:26):**  Do you see any big shifts or tensions there?  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:29):**  For sure.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:30):**  Not ultimately, when I say for sure, not in terms of there being a lack of urgency to  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:36):**  adopt, but it's as data just becomes or it is more ubiquitous, but as it becomes prepared  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:42):**  to taking sophisticated data and preparing it simply and creating more of an open forum  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:46):**  for it to be observed and applied or even simulated on a farm.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:50):**  And I hope this happens if the farmer, the consumer will begin to make those decisions  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:29:56):**  for themselves more readily and figure those things out for themselves without having to  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:00):**  be necessarily in a resold or sold a product every year.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:04):**  And that's really my dream is just to have this space where there's a lot of options  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:09):**  and there's a lot of choice for the farmers and all the companies are building things  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:13):**  that from a sustainability sense and reducing the friction to get to market is applying  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:18):**  that to farmers that are going to use these things.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:20):**  You talked a little bit in the beginning, David, about the difference between say the  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:24):**  US and Canada and somewhere like Australia, where there are fewer options here.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:28):**  I guess it gets me thinking about the way that you could argue ag insurance alters incentives  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:34):**  in markets.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:35):**  And I guess maybe an existential or philosophical question around do we think ag insurance is  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:40):**  good and is there any world where we're ensuring production that we shouldn't be as risk increases  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:47):**  or maybe we, I don't know, is there any kind of, yeah, attention in that question?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:53):**  There's tension there.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:54):**  There's some distinct sides to that question at the end of the day.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:30:57):**  And again, there's some recency bias coming into play with it here.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:01):**  When we think about at its source, but 2021 was from, I'm just, I'm talking about Western  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:06):**  Canada and much of the United States was a major drought and excessive heat and things  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:10):**  that we haven't seen in 40, 50 years.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:13):**  And so again, I use that word recency bias, but it was said simply is that I cannot imagine  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:18):**  the outcome, how differently the outcome would have been without such a robust and well-established  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:24):**  and well-supported crop insurance industry in Canada and United States.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:29):**  And it was just a tough year and we are one of many companies that were very happy that  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:35):**  we were able to support so many farms that put so much money back into communities so  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:38):**  that these folks can continue to do what they love and do it very well and get them through  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:42):**  a tough time from that standpoint.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:44):**  And the other side of it too, the contention comes from it's taxpayer money funding a lot  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:50):**  of these programs there, right?  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:51):**  So it's, and that's a whole different political discussion we could have for another day,  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:31:56):**  but it is that it's the taxpayer money.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:00):**  People that work nine to five jobs are funding crop insurance programs, which then subs,  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:05):**  or I should say, which go into subsidizing and cost sharing crop insurance programs that  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:10):**  farmers use.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:11):**  And when you see on the news, how many billions of dollars have gone back to farmers from  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:14):**  these partially taxpayer funded programs, it just creates a little bit of a divide.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:18):**  This conversation with Damon really got us thinking hard about how the future of ag insurance  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:22):**  might evolve.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:23):**  And a few things stood out.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:25):**  Though ag insurance has, for some time, been a notoriously low innovation space, depending  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:29):**  on a lot of paper and one-on-one sales versus digital alternatives, the incentives are becoming  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:34):**  stronger to use more data.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:36):**  Not least because different farmers don't just experience variations in weather impacts,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:41):**  they also carry different inherent risks by virtue of their production practices.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:45):**  We think that the ag insurance space, like so many others, will trend towards evaluating  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:49):**  farmers on how sustainable their practices are using farmers' own data or other available  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:32:55):**  sources such that policies will become more tailored and personalized as a result.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/16/parametric-crop-insurance-damon-johnson#t=0:33:00):**  Parametric products are undoubtedly another big piece of the puzzle.

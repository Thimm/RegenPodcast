### Agtech - So What?  (2021-12-15)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agbende Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  We often talk on this podcast about the game-changing role of ag tech through the lenses of investment  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:12):**  and business.  But if ag tech is truly going to make such an impact, not just on farming and food, but  also society, then what's the role of government?  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:21):**  Supporting a farmer is, it sounds like noble, I think.  It has a ring to it.  But supporting a tech company sounds horrible.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:30):**  So then it's like, what about supporting a high-tech farmer?  What does that mean?  That's Salvatore Lovallo, who probably has one of the most interesting and unique bios  
**[0:00:40-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:40):**  you'll ever hear.  By the age of 27, he had visited every country, making him one of the youngest people in the  world to do so.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:48):**  He's worked at McKinsey in the Middle East and Africa, has farms in Tanzania, and now  lives in Abu Dhabi, where he works for the investment office as head of foreign direct  investment.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:56):**  Salvatore actually grew up in Indiana, but not on a farm.  Instead, his passion for agriculture and ag tech stems from an interest in economic development.  As you'll hear, he spent much of his life challenging conventional economic indicators  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:10):**  and KPIs to try to understand what actually benefits local communities.  And for Salvatore, all roads lead back to farming.  Indiana obviously is very agricultural.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:22):**  I mean, I did grow up 10 minutes from where the farms were.  I had nothing in my childhood to do with that, to be honest.  And so I never really thought that I would end up here.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:34):**  There's no kind of a great story of growing up on a farm and wanting new innovations.  So really the interest in agriculture, I think, came much later, and it came out of an interest  in economic development and then just realizing that 60% of the world is subsistence farmers.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:50):**  And that's where it started.  I started when I was 19, an NGO called Trail of Seeds, which worked on culturally inclusive  development with farmers around the world.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:58):**  So we worked in Tanzania, in Venezuela, in Brazil, in the Amazon region, and island of  St. Kitts, all with different types of farming communities about ways to develop.  And that was kind of the first exposure to it.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:11):**  And then it's popped up in different ways in my career in economic development in the  past decade or so.  And you have come to own, as I understand it, a farm or a couple of farms in Tanzania.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:22):**  How did that come about and what do you farm?  Yeah, so the first project I did with Trail of Seeds was in the small village of Mangula,  Tanzania.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:30):**  And we fell in love with it when we were there.  We stayed for a couple of months.  And the format of support that Trail of Seeds did was called introspection workshops.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:38):**  So we would work with the community to help them kind of go through a journey of thinking  about identity, development, and culturally inclusivity.  And then at the end of that, we would have some grants that would be left to them to  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:49):**  decide what to put that towards.  Because it was a subsistence farming community, most of the grants went to different types  of farming activities.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:57):**  We helped a primary school with, they had like an agricultural class.  So we provided equipment for that.  We provided a water pump for another farmer co-op.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:05):**  And I went back maybe like a year and a half later to see what had happened with the grants,  to like meet my friends again, and fell in love all over again with the place and decided,  you know, rather than coming back at like random intervals and trying to help them in  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:18):**  different ways, I would buy a farm, it would give me a reason to come back and it would  also help them more.  It's something that they could do sustainably.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:26):**  And now every year when I go back, we typically look at more farmland, I can help some of  my individual friends or the group of youth who are not so youth anymore, actually, because  this was 10 years ago at the beginning.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:37):**  So we grow mostly rice.  So it's a rice growing region in Central Tanzania.  But I love cassava, so I've demanded that a lot of cassava be planted just because it's  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:47):**  my favorite thing to eat while I'm there.  And then they also went with a special program through the government to plant a couple of  hectares of mahogany trees.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:54):**  And then the government actually gave them this cultural dance troupe, more uniforms  and stuff, which was an exciting trade they wanted to do.  Wow, fascinating.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:04):**  It's such an interesting tension in development work, right, where you're kind of have this  fly-in, fly-out dynamic, but then you also want to be embedded in the community.  And it sounds like you've found a way to do a little bit of both.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:15):**  I think that it's, that's why when you're studying development, you're really studying  like critical development, because you're studying a history of failure.  And so what we were realizing is that we were looking at all these projects around the world  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:28):**  and saying what we hated about them and how they were doing it wrong.  And so me and a couple friends who I went to boarding school with, we all kind of were  studying development in different ways.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:36):**  And we wanted kind of like on the ground experience.  And we really thought about, okay, how do we play as little of a role as we can and  yet also guide them through it?  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:45):**  Because it becomes a strange dynamic where these random teenagers from wealthy parts  of the world walk in and pretend that they know anything.  But at the same time, if you just go in immediately and say, hey, like, what do you want this  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:57):**  money for?  They're going to give the answers that you think or that they think you want.  And so what we really did is try to get to know the communities as much as we can really  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:05):**  leave it up to them.  But by leading them through conversations, and by leading, I don't mean that we gave  them any knowledge at all.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:11):**  We really moderated conversations that they were aware of.  And at the end, they made selections.  And what was interesting in all the projects that we did in all these different farming  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:21):**  communities around the world is that typically when you think about development, you first  think about, and this is from the most macro way to the most micro community level stuff,  you think about, okay, how do I make more money?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:31):**  And when you actually dig down into it and you say, what are your goals?  It's usually about social cohesion, about connectivity.  And then when you think, okay, let's think about development as not just increasing economic  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:43):**  indicators, but increasing quality of life, increasing the way the community works together,  then what they end up picking to do is it might be related to economic activity.  So it might be like we gave farming for the school to teach kids, right?  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:57):**  We gave a group of farmers uniforms and drums for the dancing that they do kind of on the  side.  And so completely separately, we published a book of songs in the indigenous language.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:08):**  So it ends up being kind of different.  And now, this is like maybe a little over 10 years ago that we did this and looking  at my role that I do at the investment office, it's the same thing.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:18):**  We talk about not looking at development as just an increase in economic indicators, but  how do we address societal goals?  How do we look at sector disruption?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:27):**  And so that kind of idea of culturally inclusive development has continued from the villages  I was working in to now one of the 30 biggest economies and doing hundreds of millions of  dollars of investment to help development.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:40):**  Super interesting parallels.  I'm curious, do you have an example of that dynamic where they tell you what they think  you want to hear?  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:46):**  Like what do they think you want to hear when you arrive in one of these development projects  in terms of like they think you want to fund X, but actually it doesn't really matter?  Yeah.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:56):**  When we were working with a group of women farmers in the island of St. Kitts in the  Caribbean, they knew we were coming to give grants and they instantly said, we need like  blenders, we need like refrigerators because they're like, what we do is we do agro-processing,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:10):**  we make cheeses, we make juices, whatever from the agricultural products.  And they thought, okay, like they're going to come here and say, look at what we do and  want us to do it better.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:18):**  And what we do is we make this and by do they mean how we make money is this.  And they then went through our introspection workshops, which include identity exercises,  leadership exercises, as well as I kind of like societal mapping.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:31):**  And at the end they said, you know what, like what we do isn't agro-processing.  What we do is we bring women together.  And so it would be great to have blenders and refrigerators, et cetera.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:40):**  But what we would actually like is a clubhouse because right now we have to gather in our  own homes and we have to kick out the kids and the husbands.  And it's never like a space where we can just be ourselves.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:50):**  So when we ask them, what do you do?  Typically what people hear is how, how are you valued?  What is your value?  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:57):**  And typically people then say, oh, this is how I make money or how we like earn money.  So if you can help me do what I do, when you end up asking these questions and digging  down into a community and we say, what do you do?  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:09):**  They're like, oh, we bring women together.  So we enable them to do what they do by doing that clubhouse.  And so I think that was a really kind of like perfect example of what we meant by culturally  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:18):**  inclusive development and often is forgotten when people come in and they have like very  quantitative KPIs or metrics that they're trying to measure.  And in reality, it doesn't typically happen that way.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:30):**  That's a really good story.  And that identity question is so key, right?  Even like most of the, at least Western world, you meet people and the first question is  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:37):**  like, what do you do?  Right?  You have this like identity tied to your job, but obviously it's much more complex than  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:43):**  that.  I used to do this thing on planes because I used to be a consultant, so I had to fly  all the time.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:49):**  And the person sitting next to you, if you talk to them, would say, what do you do?  And I said, when someone says, what do you do?  They're asking, how should I value you?  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:56):**  How can I connect to you?  How do I not connect with you?  And it also dictates the next hour of conversation or whatever.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:04):**  And so I, at the time when I was younger, I was a really big dancer, partly from where  we were in East Africa and the Caribbean.  So I said, I'm always going to say I dance.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:12):**  And so I was on the plane from the States to Abu Dhabi and this woman said, oh, like,  what are you doing?  I said, I dance.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:19):**  And I was dancing for like over like hours and hours is really fun.  As we were landing, I said something about, oh, I have to go to work in Saudi like tomorrow.  Like I'm going to be tired though.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:28):**  She was like, wow, I didn't know that they, they danced in Saudi Arabia.  And I was like, well, they do, but I'm a consultant.  I'm going there to do like business.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:37):**  And she was like, you said you dance.  And I was like, I do dance.  Like, you know, you didn't ask me where I work.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:43):**  You asked what I do.  And yeah, I think I've always liked that one thing about like identity.  Identity is both how we define ourselves, but also others define us and we're not always  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:51):**  in control of it.  We make a lot of assumptions and prejudices about people, you know, and trying to empower  your yourself to, to make your own identity, I think is really important to like mental  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:02):**  health really.  Yeah.  Your identity for a while was as a traveler.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:08):**  Tell me how that sort of came about.  It sounds like from the consulting and having been on the road quite a lot for many years.  It started again at the, so I went to international boarding school.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:17):**  It's called United World College.  There's 200 students from 90 different countries.  There's about 18 campuses around the world.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:24):**  So from 16 to 18, I was surrounded by people from, from all over the world.  Obviously when we graduate, you know, in Indiana graduation, you end up spending the next few  weeks at graduation parties down the street, you know, with, with everybody.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:36):**  At United World College, when you graduate, everybody gets on planes to 80 different countries.  And so I wanted to go see my friends in there, like where they, where they were from to understand  them more.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:46):**  I mean, it's also much cheaper, right?  Because I would often just pay for the flight.  I would stay at their houses, their mothers would cook food for us and stuff.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:52):**  So it started by traveling to see people that I knew.  Also my parent, my father was born in Italy.  My mother's German, so visiting family there.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:00):**  And then when I was studying and working in development, especially because I was doing  comparative development, I would often go somewhere, but then see all the neighboring  places and try and like understand.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:09):**  So for example, alongside that first project with Trail of Seeds in Tanzania, I got a research  grant from my university to study the East African community, which was like a newly  formed block of countries.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:21):**  So I went to Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, to see how they each were like reacting  differently to, to that union.  And I would always do that.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:29):**  Like I would always, if I went to, like when I lived in India, I also went to Nepal, you  know, when I was in Germany, you know, I'd also go to like the places around.  And so the number of countries I've been to kind of like started adding up.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:43):**  When I was a consultant, I was, I think I worked in like a dozen countries or more.  And also, you know, we would be able to use the points that we had to travel kind of all  over.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:52):**  And then I was like finishing my analyst program at McKinsey, where I was consulting and I  decided to take off six months to go to West Africa, which is like the region of the world  that I hadn't been to yet.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:05):**  But Ebola had happened or was happening, it was ending, I think.  And so it kind of cut my trip in half.  I couldn't finish it all in the six months that I wanted to.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:13):**  And I had to go back to America for a wedding or something.  And I was like, you know what, I'll take another six months, but this time I'll structure it,  I'll like make it my job, I'll start like social media sharing and, you know, be a little  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:23):**  bit more like mindful in what I'm doing.  And it turned into a year, at the end of that year, I had hit that I had been to like 150  countries, which is a lot, which is an incredible amount.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:32):**  And I actually did a podcast, kind of like this, where I was talking, it was like accounting  countries podcast about, you know, people who were visiting a lot of places.  And I'd gotten the attention of it because I'd been to 150 and I was like 25 at the time.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:46):**  And they said, you know, in the podcast, they're, and this is October, I think 2016, they're  like, you know, you can be the youngest to visit every country, you're only like 40 away,  no one's ever like done it younger than you, you know, it's going to be great.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:00):**  And in the podcast, I'm like, absolutely not.  Like I love my job, I want to get back to economic development work, maybe I'll finish  it sometime in the future, but definitely not now.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:10):**  And I did go back to work, I worked for venture capital fund focused on Indian healthcare  companies in New York.  But because I was in New York, a lot of those travelers were there, I started like talking  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:18):**  to them, engaging with that community a little bit more.  And I then decided, okay, you know what, I will go and finish.  And then, you know, I spent the next six or so months, I ended up finishing in November  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:29):**  2017, as the youngest person who'd been to every country.  And you're right for a very long time.  And even now, I'm often, you know, this is hi, this is Salvatore, I've been to every  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:39):**  country in the world, it's like a sentence I've said 500,000 times.  And that's great.  I remember when I finished, my father said to me, like, I had this big party in Malta  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:48):**  where I finished, a lot of my friends came and my parents and stuff.  And they, he was like, this will be on your, in your obituary, which I thought was crazy.  I was like 27, but accomplishing something that I'll always be known for.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:00):**  And I don't think like, and I thought it was like, crazy to say at the time, but then,  you know, now many years later, and people still introduce me as that a lot.  But also now being head of FDI at audio is also something I'm often introduced as.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:13):**  And so it's interesting how you, one of my mentors that president of NYU, John Sexton,  he said, he would always find himself as a comma person.  He's like, you know, like, he was John Sexton, comma president of NYU.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:24):**  And he's like, never forget what's before the comma, you know, like too many people  define themselves by what's after the comma.  So I never forget what's before, which I think is always important because if you ask me  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:36):**  who I am, I think the traveling and the, the, like the professional career is, is definitely  not in the top five.  It's so interesting.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:43):**  I mean, again, it goes to identity and how the public or like the, the society we live  in, right.  Wants to put us in boxes.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:50):**  We actually talk about that a lot with agriculture, where there's this pressure to sort of build  credibility around how long you've been farming or what your connections are to farming.  And so you get into conversations where like, I'm a fifth generation farmer, and that's  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:01):**  supposed to be better than being a third generation farmer.  And in some ways, you know, great stewardship of the land and family and history and knowledge  and other ways, like you might be better if you're a third generation than a fifth generation  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:11):**  or a first generation and like, you know, what does that really matter?  So I think it plays out in all kinds of contexts.  I think about that a lot now in terms of like new forms of agricultural production and also  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:23):**  in terms of like workforce in agriculture, because especially when you think about that  identities aren't just individuals identities.  If you think about countries, I don't know if you think about Abu Dhabi and agriculture,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:33):**  I'm sure that, you know, I don't know what you're you're tackling is going to be the  title but people are going to be like, why agriculture in Abu Dhabi?  There's no it's not green at all.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:41):**  Right.  And that is, you know, I used to say, like, I often say, like, when you're flying over  Ukraine, you know, 100 years ago, you see all like is the breadbasket, you see greenery,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:52):**  you know, 25 years ago, you fly over the Netherlands, you see all these glass houses.  In the future, you're going to be seeing indoor vertical farms, you're going to be seeing  laboratories that are that are growing meats, and you're going to be seeing like, huge algae  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:03):**  fields, you know, it's what agriculture is, is so different now.  And we need to be like open to that kind of change, like shifting what we think of in  terms of agriculture.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:14):**  And it's not just like a community or societal thing.  It's really governments also, we need to shift the way we think about agriculture, because  the way you regulate traditional farmers is totally different than the way that you're  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:23):**  going to look at regulating high tech farming.  It's totally different than the way that you need to provide support to it.  Also in the investment community, you have a lot of people so excited about like agriculture  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:33):**  technology companies are putting hundreds of millions into companies.  But agriculture as a sector works very differently than most other sectors, right?  You're not going to have one person feed the world, right?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:43):**  We have 7 billion people eating every day and God willing, and that is always going  to happen.  We have 25,000 farms in Abu Dhabi, we're going to need thousands of vertical farms.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:53):**  So when we talk about the three that we have supported, air farms, pure harvest, matter  farms, I'm always like, that's the beginning.  There's so many more that we will need if we really want to feed the world in this way.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:05):**  So what does agriculture actually look like in the UAE today?  As you'll hear, they have some pretty big challenges.  But that also means plenty of opportunities for ag tech.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:16):**  In the UAE, we import about 90% of our food.  So we're very food insecure.  But we've been focusing on agriculture, really looking into the future and really looking  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:24):**  at like technology innovations that we can apply to the sector.  We do have 25,000 farms, the majority of those are what we call like hobby farms.  In the past, what they would do is each family would kind of be given a farm and they could,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:37):**  you know, grow what they want, given some technology to do that.  We do have a lot of like tomatoes, cucumbers, pumpkin squash that you can grow on the farms.  And a lot of people do, but really, there are not so many, like large scale production  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:51):**  facilities currently in the UAE.  We do have a handful of some of like industry leaders like Al Dahra, Elite Agro.  We also have some like milk producers and meat producers.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:03):**  But it's quite small, right?  I mean, it makes up less than 10% of what is consumed.  So the way that we have been focused on looking at agriculture technology is in two ways.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:14):**  The first is on providing new technologies for these traditional farmers.  So what kind of ways can we make them more sustainable in terms of water management,  in terms of utility management, in terms of space by providing them new fertilizers, precision  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:28):**  agriculture tools, you know, water management, irrigation, sensors, you know, IoT, also like  agriculture robots and drones and anything that we can look at those 25,000 farmers and  identify which of those want to upskill, which of those want to become like production players,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:42):**  and seeing how that can work because the majority of agriculture is of course still in traditional  farming, and we want to make sure that we are enabling them to succeed.  But the focus of what we've been doing is really new methods of food production.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:55):**  So we've been looking at indoor vertical farming, aquaculture, new forms of protein production,  like algae, cellular based protein growth, looking at how we can regulate and support  all of these new areas.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:07):**  And so that's been the focus of the work that we've done at the Abu Dhabi Investment Office.  But of course, doing that balance between supporting the existing agriculture players  and attracting the new ones to join in the bay.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:18):**  How do you think about it in terms of one goal might be to increase food production  domestically around that kind of scarcity conversation and getting that 90% imports  to flip or go down.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:29):**  Another would be actually developing technology and being a kind of exporter of the technology,  like you might argue Israel is or the US or even Australia, just selling those robotics  or seeds or whatever it might be to the rest of the world.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:41):**  How do you think about those two priorities?  Are they both equal or is one sort of more important than the other?  That's a great question.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:49):**  I mean, the way that we've been looking at it is a lot of different ways.  And what's nice about the way that the investment office supports companies is that we're not  diluting them.  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:58):**  We're not taking equity.  We're not doing like loan repayments.  We're really here as a catalyzing program.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:03):**  We also don't, we don't like try to pick winners before they compete or master plan the economy.  So we're really saying if you're willing to make the investment, if it's a proven technology  or you've like proven R&D, then come here and we can do it and we will help you to make  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:16):**  that happen.  In terms of the goals then of what we're trying to get out of that, there are, there's kind  of like goals of what we do with the investment and the goals of what we do in the sector.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:25):**  With the investment, we're looking at it really in kind of that broader holistic way where  we do have goals like minimum investment.  We do want it to be like tech companies coming in and supporting.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:35):**  We do look at the number of high skilled jobs.  We're also looking at the interactions with the ecosystem, especially in terms of education  and upskilling.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:43):**  So we work a lot with the UAE college of agriculture to make sure that like students are graduating  and going into these programs.  We also do then look at like sector disruption and that can be through new IP patents that  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:53):**  are done.  So a lot of the projects we've supported are R&D and also looking at how much is produced.  In terms of then the goals that we have for the sector, food security more broadly, we  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:03):**  kind of have three goals.  The first is import substitution.  So part of that is about supply chain.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:09):**  I don't think that we're aiming to be 100% food sufficient.  We are also, for example, earlier in the year, we as Abu Dhabi through one of our sovereign  funds, ABQ, purchased the majority stake in Louis Dreyfus, the agriculture logistics player.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:27):**  That isn't to bring them here, but it's to be a part of that supply chain and be kind  of at the forefront of the logistics of that.  We're also looking at how do we diversify our imports.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:36):**  Another goal, the second goal is on sustainability.  So we waste about 196 kilograms of food per person per year in the UAE.  A lot of that is warehousing and shelf life waste.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:46):**  So it's not actually even coming to the consumer yet before it gets wasted.  We can look at technologies around like shelf life support.  We can look at technologies again on like pulled supply chain and different stuff like  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:58):**  that.  But it's really a societal thing.  We're very hospitable in the Gulf.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:03):**  When people come, we want to give them more food than they could ever eat, just to kind  of show that, which is also a little bit historical.  We've had a lot of severe times in terms of being able to feed an entire population.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:14):**  And so having a celebration with people and showing them all the food is really is societally  important.  And then the final goal is of course on the local production.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:25):**  And that can be both in the quantum that's produced here.  But as you said on technology, we really want Abu Dhabi to be a center for desert and arid  climate agriculture.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:36):**  So about a third of the world is living in desert and arid climates.  That number is only increasing.  And we believe that the technologies that we can research here are going to be globally  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:47):**  exportable.  They're going to be able to impact the populations around the world in places you might not want  to be doing that R&D, right?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:54):**  Like the Sahel, like Central Asia.  And so we're able to provide that support and hopefully the solutions that will be developed  here in the UAE will be able to be applied around the world.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:05):**  And that's kind of the focus always of the UAE in every sector that we work, because  we're quite small.  I mean, we're the 30th biggest economy, but we only have 10 million people.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:14):**  And so we often say that any company in Abu Dhabi has to be instantly global.  And a lot of companies are using Abu Dhabi as a stepping stone to wider markets like  South Asia, like East Africa, like the broader Middle East.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:26):**  So we're excited for companies to use us as their base.  It's an interesting parallel to Australia for a bunch of reasons.  One, obviously desert climate and need for investment in climate adaptive agriculture.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:37):**  Also the sort of jumping off point, Australia gets sort of the reputation and pathway for  access into Asia, but also this tension that's really playing out in Australia right now  around do we think of ag tech as support for technology for our farmers to produce more?  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:51):**  And really the goal is to become a hundred billion dollar production industry of food  and fiber.  And or do we want to sell more technology and commercialize more research and become  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:00):**  the provider of technology to the world and the way that government might need to support  that, the way that we would attract capital and entrepreneurs and create connections and  be part of the global ecosystem would look quite differently.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:12):**  You're not necessarily talking about trade deals or things like that for selling technology,  but you are for selling beef into China or whatever it might be.  And so there's this interesting question of how do you support both the production of  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:24):**  food and fiber ecosystem with technology and the growth of the technology ecosystem and  the venture investment and the entrepreneurship and all the networks that need to play out  there.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:34):**  So it sounds like in some ways Australia is a small player participating meaningfully  in a big way globally.  So some interesting parallels that people might not have really thought about between  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:42):**  UAE and Australia.  You know, I think people don't know the way that agriculture sector works now in terms  of all of it, the workforce, the production methods, the science behind it, the government  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:56):**  support.  And so they, as it moves into a higher tech angle and it starts to maybe have regulation  or support that is similar to other technology, then people are like, whoa, wait, like, you  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:10):**  know why some of these parallels are maybe seem like unfair, right?  Supporting a farmer is, it sounds like noble, I think it like has a ring to it, you know,  but supporting like a tech company sound like doesn't like sounds horrible.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:23):**  Those capitalists, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So then it's like, what about supporting a high tech farmer?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:30):**  Like what does that mean?  And so I think there needs to be like a comfort that like governments, governments have in  this.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:36):**  And I think like the food security angle is a really important one because that is why  we support farmers, right?  Should people make money as they're producing food?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:43):**  Like, yes.  You know, should they be able to attract that kind of talent, you know, and be the type  of like high growth companies that enable them to grow and be able to provide food to  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:51):**  more people?  Yes.  The role of government in business always makes for an interesting discussion.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:58):**  It's hard to reconcile the tension between too much regulation and too little.  On the one hand, it's hard for regulators to keep up with the pace of rapidly changing  technologies.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:08):**  On the other hand, for agriculture, there are so many variables outside of anyone's  control.  So governments can play a pivotal role in offering assurances and support to attract  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:17):**  investment.  And that's what the Emirati government is doing, trying to both address food security  and be strategic in developing a knowledge economy.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:25):**  The UAE has even launched Food Tech Valley, a hub for ag tech innovation, the specific  focus on vertical farming, aquaculture and hydroponics.  But to make it happen, the regulations needed to change.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:38):**  We launched our agriculture innovation, our ag tech innovation program in March 2019.  And at the time, there was no high tech agricultural economic license.  So you couldn't be registered as like a high tech agriculture company, either an agriculture  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:53):**  company or tech company, which had different activities that you could do and really confuse  people in terms of what they could import, how they were managed, etc.  So we, back in 2019, we worked with the Department of Economic Development and others to get  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:08):**  that license out there to be able to support companies in this field.  That's like a very basic kind of thing, but really shows like how we, as there are new  economic activities, you have to have new economic licenses that then like look at that  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:20):**  and regulate that.  We've also looked at the land use, right?  So we have a lot of our companies are located in the different free zones that we have in  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:28):**  Qizad and Zones Corp and in others.  A lot of our agricultural production is in Al Ain, though, a city in Abu Dhabi, Emirati,  that's a little bit further away.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:37):**  And so we've been looking at, okay, where can high tech farming companies be?  A lot of the farming land is reserved for nationals.  We did then in the past year, we changed our foreign ownership policy.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:49):**  So most economic activities are able to have 100% foreign ownership onshore, meaning that  the companies don't only have to be in the free zones in order to operate, which opens  up a lot of areas for the companies to look at and makes it more competitive in terms  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:02):**  of like land.  And then there's the regulation in terms of what we're eating, which is more around like  aquaculture and cellular based agriculture.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:10):**  And that's something that we're still looking at and seeing how we can play a role in that  and make sure that we are enabling the new waves of technology.  And so we are constantly taking the feedback of the private sector saying, you know, what  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:24):**  do you think needs to change?  How would that help getting the information from them?  And the role that the Abu Dhabi Investment Office plays is really as that liaison.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:31):**  So we kind of, we connect the impact of regulatory change to the process of it.  And so I think often we'll have regulators or other government departments who want to  make X, Y, and Z change, but they're not able to be like, and if we make this change, all  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:47):**  of these companies will come here.  Whereas when we're talking to all those companies, we can kind of make that connection and make  a more powerful narrative for some of that regulatory change.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:57):**  And so we also are quite lucky that we're in an environment politically or like structurally  within our government that we can make decisions really, really quickly.  I think the best form of government for economic development is the system that we have in  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:11):**  the UAE because we're able to think really long term.  We're able to think really kind of like inspirationally and innovatively and also like holistically  for the entire population, you know, rather than just for like a 51% of it.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:23):**  And then you end up getting great decisions made fast, looking towards the future.  Another example of that, which is more strategic than regulatory, is we were the first country  in the world to have a Ministry of Food Security.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:35):**  Last year during COVID, that ministry also grew to be the Ministry of Food and Water  Security.  And then just a few weeks ago, also the climate change portfolio was given.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:43):**  So it's now the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, which includes the food and  water security policies.  And so having that kind of strategic vision and being a part of what we think the future  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:53):**  can look like is really important to having that being a topic not only for investors  and not only for the government, but for the society as well.  It brings up an interesting point around this.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:04):**  I don't know if it's actually real or perceived, but definitely perceived at least in terms  of like Americans and Australians and maybe a more Western view of what it's like to do  business in the Middle East and maybe in Abu Dhabi in particular.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:15):**  What are some of the big cultural differences that you found?  And do you think those are more exaggerated in Western minds or it's actually easier to  do business maybe than people perceive?  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:25):**  That's a great question that's hard for me to answer because I've been here since I was  20.  So it's like my entire adulthood.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:29):**  I've done work in international context, but always with some kind of Abu Dhabi angle where  I've always been based here working on other things.  But what I can speak on is the way that investors have come to us.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:40):**  And I think that they are really shocked by the openness and the transparency.  Also what I often say is what you know about Abu Dhabi isn't wrong.  It's just old because we're changing stuff so much that we'll have people come in still.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:54):**  It was only a year or so ago we're 100% foreign ownership.  And people think, oh, but I can't even do that because I need a 51% partner.  That's no longer true.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:03):**  There is some kind of level of hesitancy, I think, to the region more broadly.  And yet there is so much excitement for the broader Middle East in terms of the economic  growth, in terms of South Asia, in terms of East Africa.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:17):**  And I think, again, going back to that point of us being a jumping off point to it, we're  the safest city in the world five years in a row.  We have the highest quality of life.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:26):**  I think we're top five happiest city to live in.  We keep increasing that.  We're the number one place for ease of doing business in the Middle East.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:33):**  And so once people get on the ground, they realize, wow, actually, why would I not want  to be based here and work around?  And especially now with the change in terms of remote working and where the location of  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:49):**  where workers are living is different than the location of where they're doing business,  we're seeing a lot more people saying, all right, 0% tax, high quality of life, great  access to the rest of the world.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:01):**  It's really attractive.  And also, I think the positive change, our perceptions of places and people going back  to the identity tends to be a static view.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:10):**  And yet people and places are incredibly dynamic.  And so what we try to show people is like, if you explore the opportunity of Abu Dhabi  in the past and it didn't work for whatever reason, come now, tell us why that is, see  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:24):**  how it has changed.  And maybe it'll, and I'm certain that you will be positively surprised with that.  One of the things that we see as investors is there's this often tension for startups  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:35):**  in particular in an ag tech, there are a lot of startups because it is a pretty new industry  where they might have the temptation to kind of follow the money.  You know, if an investor, like we get it all the time being in Australia, we might have  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:45):**  a U S company that even preemptively before we say anything reaches out and says, oh,  and I'd be happy to dedicate your potential, you know, your percent of funds that you're  going to invest into my company, into our Australia strategy.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:55):**  And we're like, well, is Australia actually on your roadmap?  Or are you just saying that so that we hopefully give you the money?  I'd be curious, does that dynamic play out for you guys?  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:04):**  It's a absolutely happens.  I think to anybody, I mean, I wish my LinkedIn inbox on no one, it's just, I don't know if  that app is useful to anybody other than reading news, which is great.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:17):**  But the no, for sure.  I think that what we are interested in is like sustainable investment.  And we mean that both in terms of like environmentally sustainable and culturally sustainable, but  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:29):**  also looking at, are these companies going to stick, right?  Like, will they stay?  We're not interested in any way at just kind of like throwing money at the wall and hoping  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:38):**  some of it sticks, right?  That's why we provide our support in a rebate program, which I think is actually the best  that I've seen in my like 12 or so years in economic development, because we're basically  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:49):**  saying, we will pay back costs after they're incurred in Abu Dhabi.  So we're not giving a lot of upfront funding and then saying, you know, we hope that you'll  invest in Abu Dhabi.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:58):**  We're saying once you've invested in Abu Dhabi, once you've made that strategic decision,  then we can pay back a percentage of the costs that you have incurred here.  We also don't look at covering like opex costs because then again, once the incentive amount  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:09):**  will go down, it won't be as relevant.  So we're looking more like kind of R&D projects, helping them to do what they would do anyway  in a bigger way or a better way or a faster way.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:18):**  It's always the question that we are asked when we're talking about like new investment  opportunities is would they do it without us?  And in a way it's a trick question because if they wouldn't do it without us, then we  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:29):**  don't want to convince them only through the money.  If they would do it without us, then is this a good use of government funding?  So what we're always looking at is, okay, what is the, like the perfect situation is  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:39):**  a company that comes and says, I'm thinking about doing something in the Middle East.  It makes complete sense in my strategy.  I'm looking at desert and arid climates.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:46):**  I'm looking to expand to different parts of the world.  I can use it as a base.  Here's what I am planning for the next three years.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:53):**  But you know, if we could support X, Y, or Z way, then I could do this much in year one  or this one much in year two.  It's obviously not just a verbal conversation.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:02):**  It's looking really deeply at business plans and saying, okay, like what makes sense or  what doesn't make sense?  What within the market can actually catalyze it?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:08):**  Do we think it makes sense?  We are not sector owners at the Abu Dhabi investment office.  We work really closely with the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, with the Abu  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:16):**  Dhabi Agriculture Food Safety Authority to try and create like a one Abu Dhabi approach.  And then we say, okay, is this something that's strategically interesting?  Is it something that's a viable business model?  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:26):**  Is it something that is a good use of government funding?  And then we make our decisions and it really comes down to that balance.  I think only the future will see, right?  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:34):**  Definitely.  We see a lot of perverse incentives.  Governments trying to pick winners or also just things that sort of divide up the pie  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:40):**  rather than grow it, which is pretty frustrating.  But one of the things you said that really interested me was when you fly over these  countries, you can sort of get a sense of what production looks like.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:49):**  And if you imagine flying over UAE in the future, you know, maybe it's a bunch of what  looks sort of like factories because they're growing vegetables or they're growing meat  or whatever it might be inside.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:59):**  It raises this interesting transparency question for the food system, I believe.  And this is just an Abu Dhabi question.  Like when we consumers sort of want to know more about where their food comes from and  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:09):**  we have this trend of satellite imagery where we're going to be able to see all the production.  And so, you know, what you do outside is mostly going to be public knowledge.  If we're growing things outside, if we're growing things inside, do we have that same  
**[0:36:20-0:36:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:20):**  kind of push for transparency?  Yeah, I think that's a great question that I've always found fascinating.  When I'm in the States, I live in New York and it's funny to be like in one of the biggest  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:31):**  cities in the world, but then have people like obsessed with like where their salad  is sourced from because it's not typically there.  So I think there's good opportunities.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:40):**  For example, one of the companies in Abu Dhabi called Emirates Bio Farm, they're the largest  organic farm in the UAE, I believe.  They have also like a restaurant at the side that I think they even have like hotel rooms  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:50):**  where you can like stay and they give you kind of that experience to understand what  farming looks like in the Emirates.  I think that's really great.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:57):**  Also with the rise of social media and also just how beautiful farming can be, we have  a lot of stuff, for example, like Pure Harvest, one of the companies that we've supported,  has a beautiful facility in LA and, you know, their social media has incredible photos of  
**[0:37:09-0:37:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:09):**  this and I think they do want to share that with the world.  Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting question.  It goes back to all those kinds of things, identities and access to food and lots of  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:17):**  these challenging technical and philosophical questions.  That's one of the things that excites me about AgTech is the diversity of perspectives that  we now need in this industry that might not have been true in the past and is increasingly  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:29):**  true in a place like Abu Dhabi where you have different, really different kinds of production  systems.  It sounds like an increasingly so in the future.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:35):**  Yeah, I mean, I always find it crazy when people think like farming in a leafy green  is so different than farming, like a berry is so different than farming like a livestock,  right?  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:49):**  Like they are all called farmers and it seems it's like such a catch all and I think people  don't realize how much of a catch all that is and how complicated it is to look at different  cultivars and the different types of skill sets that will be required in the workforce  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:03):**  in agriculture in the future, but also the different types of like investments that we  need to focus on.  I think that's kind of the holy grail of a lot of this food security stuff, especially  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:11):**  in like indoor closed environment agriculture.  And I would love to see what types of technologies can really be like mass produced and mass  like put out into the world and to like I joke that my farms in Tanzania are organic,  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:24):**  but it's just because there is no fertilizer available in that part of the country.  So when will the technologies that I'm investing in reach my farm?  Probably a long time in the future unless we start looking in different ways.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:37):**  Yeah, well, I like that aspiration.  I think we absolutely need it.  Are there any parallels or lessons that you have drawn from your time in developing countries  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:45):**  and working with smallholder farmers that you're applying now sitting in still a development  role, but a pretty different context with audio?  Yeah, and I think more than more than people think.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:56):**  I mean, I think there's some of my former classmates who think I've like sold out because  I'm in a suit and I think it's funny because I feel like I'm doing exactly what I studied.  But I think it really goes back to that point I was making about like originally like trail  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:06):**  of seeds like the NGO I was doing and looking at like culturally inclusive development and  holistic development.  What I like is that we're not just looking for ROI, we're not just looking for like an  
**[0:39:16-0:39:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:16):**  economic return.  Our director general often would describe what we were doing as nation building.  It's really about thinking what should the economy look like?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:25):**  What are the goals of these sectors that we're focusing on?  And it's at a much more like macro stage, at least kind of like the strategic vision.  But I like working with the individual companies and seeing how they like fit into that puzzle.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:37):**  And it's the most exciting conversations with them isn't about the investment they've made  or the number of jobs or any of that, but it's about these kind of like societal impacts  that they're able to have and seeing the connections.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:47):**  And that also links back to the travel, which, you know, when I visited every country, I'd  always say what I learned the most is that everybody's the same and that we share 90%.  And when you look at the most successful companies, when you look at the most successful investments,  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:02):**  when you look at the most successful people, they're really playing on that kind of connectivity  and that human dimension.  And I hope more and more so we will get to that where more companies, more and more investors,  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:14):**  more governments are looking at this kind of culturally inclusive way of approaching  development.  And definitely operating on that human level is so much of the venture capital world, especially  
**[0:40:23-0:40:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:23):**  is like, you know, metrics and deals and play the game.  And I find it really frustrating.  It's like these are people and jobs and lives.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:30):**  And if we forget that, then, you know, what the heck are we doing?  So I definitely find that frustrating.  Is there a story that you have from your travels that kind of comes to mind or you have found  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:38):**  particularly relevant in applying it to what you're doing now?  I think that it's, I do often think back on my village in Tanzania.  I still go there every year.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:50):**  And I think about the people that I had helped there.  And what I try and what I'm trying to do is to not separate this glitzy image of the future  from the reality of most people in the world.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:03):**  Right.  And to realize that there is so much separation and inequality now in the world.  And so when I think of my farm, which is, you know, like on dirt roads, people making  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:15):**  less than a couple dollars a day, you know, and then you're thinking about what are the  types of innovations that can help them sometime, like, you know, over time.  But I often think when I hear something, I wonder who will it actually impact?  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:30):**  You know, we talked about like saving the world.  We meaning a lot of investors come in saying this product is going to change the way we  do.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:36):**  We consume healthcare.  It's going to change the way we do this.  By we, they're talking about like a really niche, small elite percent of the population.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:45):**  And so I think traveling around the world, you expand that idea of we.  And I don't want to like forget that when I'm looking at the investments that I'm doing.  Maybe like one short story that I was once on a shared taxi, like a truck that was filled  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:02):**  with like 15 people going from the forest region in Guinea into, into Mali.  And it was like a 26 hour journey.  And I was sitting on the same seat.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:11):**  Like I had to share a seat with this guy.  And the first few hours of the trip, all we did was talk about like, we talked about like  football, like Ronaldo versus Messi.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:20):**  We talked about like, if we wanted to get married and like, like normal kind of like  guy conversations.  And then I said, Oh, like, you know, why are you going to Mali?  
**[0:42:28-0:42:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:28):**  And he explained that he's actually trying to get to Italy, like he was going to go across  the Sahara and he was going to try and like get on a boat and like get into Italy.  And it hit me that even though for all these hours, we were literally doing the same thing,  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:40):**  right?  Like we were like sitting like cheek to cheek on this seat, do like literally doing the  exact same thing.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:46):**  We weren't in any way doing the same thing, right?  We were, it was completely different.  I was like a tourist doing this for fun, like taking photos.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:53):**  And he was like trying to make a better life for himself and his family.  And so I think it's everything that we do is about like perception and you might be  like doing the exact same thing, or you might see somebody and you think they're doing X,  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:05):**  Y, or Z, but it goes back to that.  The question at the beginning of values, like what are, what do you do?  And it's not just like what you're physically doing or what the actions are, but like, why  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:14):**  are you doing it?  And I would hope that in all the investment decisions that we make and all the like the  strategic decisions that we're making, that we're not just like doing it to, you know,  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:25):**  for ourselves that we're like thinking more, more broadly and that we realize that you  can do things with intention in a way that really impacts the world more than if you're  just doing it without thinking about that kind of value.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:40):**  And that's it for another episode of AgTech So What.  Thank you to Salvatore, Head of Foreign Direct Investment at the Abu Dhabi Investment Office.  And that's the last episode of AgTech So What for 2021.

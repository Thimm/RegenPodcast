### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agbende Group.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:06):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:07):**  We often talk on this podcast about the game-changing role of ag tech through the lenses of investment  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:12):**  and business.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:13):**  But if ag tech is truly going to make such an impact, not just on farming and food, but  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:17):**  also society, then what's the role of government?  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:21):**  Supporting a farmer is, it sounds like noble, I think.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:24):**  It has a ring to it.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:26):**  But supporting a tech company sounds horrible.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:30):**  So then it's like, what about supporting a high-tech farmer?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:34):**  What does that mean?  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:36):**  That's Salvatore Lovallo, who probably has one of the most interesting and unique bios  
**[0:00:40-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:40):**  you'll ever hear.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:41):**  By the age of 27, he had visited every country, making him one of the youngest people in the  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:46):**  world to do so.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:48):**  He's worked at McKinsey in the Middle East and Africa, has farms in Tanzania, and now  
**[0:00:52-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:52):**  lives in Abu Dhabi, where he works for the investment office as head of foreign direct  
**[0:00:55-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:55):**  investment.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:00:56):**  Salvatore actually grew up in Indiana, but not on a farm.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:00):**  Instead, his passion for agriculture and ag tech stems from an interest in economic development.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:06):**  As you'll hear, he spent much of his life challenging conventional economic indicators  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:10):**  and KPIs to try to understand what actually benefits local communities.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:15):**  And for Salvatore, all roads lead back to farming.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:20):**  Indiana obviously is very agricultural.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:22):**  I mean, I did grow up 10 minutes from where the farms were.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:27):**  I had nothing in my childhood to do with that, to be honest.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:31):**  And so I never really thought that I would end up here.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:34):**  There's no kind of a great story of growing up on a farm and wanting new innovations.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:40):**  So really the interest in agriculture, I think, came much later, and it came out of an interest  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:44):**  in economic development and then just realizing that 60% of the world is subsistence farmers.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:50):**  And that's where it started.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:51):**  I started when I was 19, an NGO called Trail of Seeds, which worked on culturally inclusive  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:56):**  development with farmers around the world.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:01:58):**  So we worked in Tanzania, in Venezuela, in Brazil, in the Amazon region, and island of  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:03):**  St. Kitts, all with different types of farming communities about ways to develop.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:07):**  And that was kind of the first exposure to it.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:11):**  And then it's popped up in different ways in my career in economic development in the  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:15):**  past decade or so.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:17):**  And you have come to own, as I understand it, a farm or a couple of farms in Tanzania.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:22):**  How did that come about and what do you farm?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:24):**  Yeah, so the first project I did with Trail of Seeds was in the small village of Mangula,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:29):**  Tanzania.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:30):**  And we fell in love with it when we were there.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:32):**  We stayed for a couple of months.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:33):**  And the format of support that Trail of Seeds did was called introspection workshops.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:38):**  So we would work with the community to help them kind of go through a journey of thinking  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:43):**  about identity, development, and culturally inclusivity.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:46):**  And then at the end of that, we would have some grants that would be left to them to  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:49):**  decide what to put that towards.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:51):**  Because it was a subsistence farming community, most of the grants went to different types  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:55):**  of farming activities.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:02:57):**  We helped a primary school with, they had like an agricultural class.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:00):**  So we provided equipment for that.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:02):**  We provided a water pump for another farmer co-op.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:05):**  And I went back maybe like a year and a half later to see what had happened with the grants,  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:09):**  to like meet my friends again, and fell in love all over again with the place and decided,  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:15):**  you know, rather than coming back at like random intervals and trying to help them in  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:18):**  different ways, I would buy a farm, it would give me a reason to come back and it would  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:23):**  also help them more.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:24):**  It's something that they could do sustainably.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:26):**  And now every year when I go back, we typically look at more farmland, I can help some of  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:30):**  my individual friends or the group of youth who are not so youth anymore, actually, because  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:35):**  this was 10 years ago at the beginning.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:37):**  So we grow mostly rice.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:39):**  So it's a rice growing region in Central Tanzania.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:42):**  But I love cassava, so I've demanded that a lot of cassava be planted just because it's  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:47):**  my favorite thing to eat while I'm there.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:49):**  And then they also went with a special program through the government to plant a couple of  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:52):**  hectares of mahogany trees.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:54):**  And then the government actually gave them this cultural dance troupe, more uniforms  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:03:59):**  and stuff, which was an exciting trade they wanted to do.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:02):**  Wow, fascinating.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:04):**  It's such an interesting tension in development work, right, where you're kind of have this  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:06):**  fly-in, fly-out dynamic, but then you also want to be embedded in the community.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:11):**  And it sounds like you've found a way to do a little bit of both.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:15):**  I think that it's, that's why when you're studying development, you're really studying  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:20):**  like critical development, because you're studying a history of failure.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:23):**  And so what we were realizing is that we were looking at all these projects around the world  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:28):**  and saying what we hated about them and how they were doing it wrong.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:31):**  And so me and a couple friends who I went to boarding school with, we all kind of were  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:34):**  studying development in different ways.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:36):**  And we wanted kind of like on the ground experience.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:38):**  And we really thought about, okay, how do we play as little of a role as we can and  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:43):**  yet also guide them through it?  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:45):**  Because it becomes a strange dynamic where these random teenagers from wealthy parts  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:50):**  of the world walk in and pretend that they know anything.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:54):**  But at the same time, if you just go in immediately and say, hey, like, what do you want this  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:57):**  money for?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:04:59):**  They're going to give the answers that you think or that they think you want.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:02):**  And so what we really did is try to get to know the communities as much as we can really  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:05):**  leave it up to them.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:06):**  But by leading them through conversations, and by leading, I don't mean that we gave

**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:11):**  We really moderated conversations that they were aware of.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:15):**  And at the end, they made selections.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:17):**  And what was interesting in all the projects that we did in all these different farming  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:21):**  communities around the world is that typically when you think about development, you first  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:25):**  think about, and this is from the most macro way to the most micro community level stuff,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:29):**  you think about, okay, how do I make more money?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:31):**  And when you actually dig down into it and you say, what are your goals?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:35):**  It's usually about social cohesion, about connectivity.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:39):**  And then when you think, okay, let's think about development as not just increasing economic  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:43):**  indicators, but increasing quality of life, increasing the way the community works together,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:48):**  then what they end up picking to do is it might be related to economic activity.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:53):**  So it might be like we gave farming for the school to teach kids, right?  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:05:57):**  We gave a group of farmers uniforms and drums for the dancing that they do kind of on the  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:02):**  side.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:03):**  And so completely separately, we published a book of songs in the indigenous language.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:08):**  So it ends up being kind of different.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:10):**  And now, this is like maybe a little over 10 years ago that we did this and looking  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:15):**  at my role that I do at the investment office, it's the same thing.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:18):**  We talk about not looking at development as just an increase in economic indicators, but  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:23):**  how do we address societal goals?  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:25):**  How do we look at sector disruption?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:27):**  And so that kind of idea of culturally inclusive development has continued from the villages  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:32):**  I was working in to now one of the 30 biggest economies and doing hundreds of millions of  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:37):**  dollars of investment to help development.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:40):**  Super interesting parallels.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:41):**  I'm curious, do you have an example of that dynamic where they tell you what they think  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:45):**  you want to hear?  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:46):**  Like what do they think you want to hear when you arrive in one of these development projects  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:50):**  in terms of like they think you want to fund X, but actually it doesn't really matter?  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:06:56):**  When we were working with a group of women farmers in the island of St. Kitts in the  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:00):**  Caribbean, they knew we were coming to give grants and they instantly said, we need like  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:04):**  blenders, we need like refrigerators because they're like, what we do is we do agro-processing,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:10):**  we make cheeses, we make juices, whatever from the agricultural products.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:14):**  And they thought, okay, like they're going to come here and say, look at what we do and  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:17):**  want us to do it better.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:18):**  And what we do is we make this and by do they mean how we make money is this.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:22):**  And they then went through our introspection workshops, which include identity exercises,  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:27):**  leadership exercises, as well as I kind of like societal mapping.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:31):**  And at the end they said, you know what, like what we do isn't agro-processing.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:35):**  What we do is we bring women together.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:37):**  And so it would be great to have blenders and refrigerators, et cetera.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:40):**  But what we would actually like is a clubhouse because right now we have to gather in our  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:44):**  own homes and we have to kick out the kids and the husbands.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:47):**  And it's never like a space where we can just be ourselves.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:50):**  So when we ask them, what do you do?  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:54):**  Typically what people hear is how, how are you valued?  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:56):**  What is your value?  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:07:57):**  And typically people then say, oh, this is how I make money or how we like earn money.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:02):**  So if you can help me do what I do, when you end up asking these questions and digging  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:06):**  down into a community and we say, what do you do?  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:09):**  They're like, oh, we bring women together.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:10):**  So we enable them to do what they do by doing that clubhouse.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:14):**  And so I think that was a really kind of like perfect example of what we meant by culturally  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:18):**  inclusive development and often is forgotten when people come in and they have like very  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:24):**  quantitative KPIs or metrics that they're trying to measure.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:27):**  And in reality, it doesn't typically happen that way.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:30):**  That's a really good story.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:31):**  And that identity question is so key, right?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:33):**  Even like most of the, at least Western world, you meet people and the first question is  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:37):**  like, what do you do?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:38):**  Right?  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:39):**  You have this like identity tied to your job, but obviously it's much more complex than  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:43):**  that.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:44):**  I used to do this thing on planes because I used to be a consultant, so I had to fly  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:48):**  all the time.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:49):**  And the person sitting next to you, if you talk to them, would say, what do you do?  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:52):**  And I said, when someone says, what do you do?  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:55):**  They're asking, how should I value you?  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:56):**  How can I connect to you?  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:58):**  How do I not connect with you?  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:08:59):**  And it also dictates the next hour of conversation or whatever.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:04):**  And so I, at the time when I was younger, I was a really big dancer, partly from where  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:08):**  we were in East Africa and the Caribbean.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:10):**  So I said, I'm always going to say I dance.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:12):**  And so I was on the plane from the States to Abu Dhabi and this woman said, oh, like,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:17):**  what are you doing?  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:18):**  I said, I dance.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:19):**  And I was dancing for like over like hours and hours is really fun.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:23):**  As we were landing, I said something about, oh, I have to go to work in Saudi like tomorrow.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:27):**  Like I'm going to be tired though.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:28):**  She was like, wow, I didn't know that they, they danced in Saudi Arabia.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:33):**  And I was like, well, they do, but I'm a consultant.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:36):**  I'm going there to do like business.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:37):**  And she was like, you said you dance.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:39):**  And I was like, I do dance.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:40):**  Like, you know, you didn't ask me where I work.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:43):**  You asked what I do.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:44):**  And yeah, I think I've always liked that one thing about like identity.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:47):**  Identity is both how we define ourselves, but also others define us and we're not always  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:51):**  in control of it.

**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:09:57):**  your yourself to, to make your own identity, I think is really important to like mental

**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:04):**  Your identity for a while was as a traveler.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:08):**  Tell me how that sort of came about.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:10):**  It sounds like from the consulting and having been on the road quite a lot for many years.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:15):**  It started again at the, so I went to international boarding school.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:17):**  It's called United World College.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:18):**  There's 200 students from 90 different countries.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:21):**  There's about 18 campuses around the world.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:24):**  So from 16 to 18, I was surrounded by people from, from all over the world.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:28):**  Obviously when we graduate, you know, in Indiana graduation, you end up spending the next few  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:33):**  weeks at graduation parties down the street, you know, with, with everybody.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:36):**  At United World College, when you graduate, everybody gets on planes to 80 different countries.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:40):**  And so I wanted to go see my friends in there, like where they, where they were from to understand  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:45):**  them more.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:46):**  I mean, it's also much cheaper, right?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:47):**  Because I would often just pay for the flight.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:49):**  I would stay at their houses, their mothers would cook food for us and stuff.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:52):**  So it started by traveling to see people that I knew.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:56):**  Also my parent, my father was born in Italy.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:10:58):**  My mother's German, so visiting family there.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:00):**  And then when I was studying and working in development, especially because I was doing  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:04):**  comparative development, I would often go somewhere, but then see all the neighboring  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:08):**  places and try and like understand.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:09):**  So for example, alongside that first project with Trail of Seeds in Tanzania, I got a research  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:15):**  grant from my university to study the East African community, which was like a newly  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:19):**  formed block of countries.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:21):**  So I went to Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, to see how they each were like reacting  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:26):**  differently to, to that union.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:28):**  And I would always do that.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:29):**  Like I would always, if I went to, like when I lived in India, I also went to Nepal, you  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:34):**  know, when I was in Germany, you know, I'd also go to like the places around.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:39):**  And so the number of countries I've been to kind of like started adding up.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:43):**  When I was a consultant, I was, I think I worked in like a dozen countries or more.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:47):**  And also, you know, we would be able to use the points that we had to travel kind of all  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:51):**  over.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:52):**  And then I was like finishing my analyst program at McKinsey, where I was consulting and I  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:11:57):**  decided to take off six months to go to West Africa, which is like the region of the world  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:03):**  that I hadn't been to yet.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:05):**  But Ebola had happened or was happening, it was ending, I think.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:08):**  And so it kind of cut my trip in half.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:09):**  I couldn't finish it all in the six months that I wanted to.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:13):**  And I had to go back to America for a wedding or something.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:14):**  And I was like, you know what, I'll take another six months, but this time I'll structure it,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:18):**  I'll like make it my job, I'll start like social media sharing and, you know, be a little  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:23):**  bit more like mindful in what I'm doing.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:25):**  And it turned into a year, at the end of that year, I had hit that I had been to like 150  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:29):**  countries, which is a lot, which is an incredible amount.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:32):**  And I actually did a podcast, kind of like this, where I was talking, it was like accounting  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:37):**  countries podcast about, you know, people who were visiting a lot of places.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:42):**  And I'd gotten the attention of it because I'd been to 150 and I was like 25 at the time.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:46):**  And they said, you know, in the podcast, they're, and this is October, I think 2016, they're  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:52):**  like, you know, you can be the youngest to visit every country, you're only like 40 away,  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:12:56):**  no one's ever like done it younger than you, you know, it's going to be great.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:00):**  And in the podcast, I'm like, absolutely not.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:03):**  Like I love my job, I want to get back to economic development work, maybe I'll finish  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:07):**  it sometime in the future, but definitely not now.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:10):**  And I did go back to work, I worked for venture capital fund focused on Indian healthcare  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:13):**  companies in New York.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:15):**  But because I was in New York, a lot of those travelers were there, I started like talking  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:18):**  to them, engaging with that community a little bit more.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:21):**  And I then decided, okay, you know what, I will go and finish.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:24):**  And then, you know, I spent the next six or so months, I ended up finishing in November  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:29):**  2017, as the youngest person who'd been to every country.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:32):**  And you're right for a very long time.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:34):**  And even now, I'm often, you know, this is hi, this is Salvatore, I've been to every  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:39):**  country in the world, it's like a sentence I've said 500,000 times.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:43):**  And that's great.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:44):**  I remember when I finished, my father said to me, like, I had this big party in Malta  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:48):**  where I finished, a lot of my friends came and my parents and stuff.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:51):**  And they, he was like, this will be on your, in your obituary, which I thought was crazy.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:13:56):**  I was like 27, but accomplishing something that I'll always be known for.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:00):**  And I don't think like, and I thought it was like, crazy to say at the time, but then,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:04):**  you know, now many years later, and people still introduce me as that a lot.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:08):**  But also now being head of FDI at audio is also something I'm often introduced as.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:13):**  And so it's interesting how you, one of my mentors that president of NYU, John Sexton,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:17):**  he said, he would always find himself as a comma person.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:21):**  He's like, you know, like, he was John Sexton, comma president of NYU.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:24):**  And he's like, never forget what's before the comma, you know, like too many people  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:28):**  define themselves by what's after the comma.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:31):**  So I never forget what's before, which I think is always important because if you ask me  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:36):**  who I am, I think the traveling and the, the, like the professional career is, is definitely  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:41):**  not in the top five.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:42):**  It's so interesting.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:43):**  I mean, again, it goes to identity and how the public or like the, the society we live  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:48):**  in, right.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:49):**  Wants to put us in boxes.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:50):**  We actually talk about that a lot with agriculture, where there's this pressure to sort of build

**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:14:58):**  And so you get into conversations where like, I'm a fifth generation farmer, and that's  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:01):**  supposed to be better than being a third generation farmer.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:04):**  And in some ways, you know, great stewardship of the land and family and history and knowledge  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:08):**  and other ways, like you might be better if you're a third generation than a fifth generation  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:11):**  or a first generation and like, you know, what does that really matter?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:15):**  So I think it plays out in all kinds of contexts.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:18):**  I think about that a lot now in terms of like new forms of agricultural production and also

**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:27):**  identities aren't just individuals identities.

**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:33):**  I'm sure that, you know, I don't know what you're you're tackling is going to be the

**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:39):**  There's no it's not green at all.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:41):**  Right.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:42):**  And that is, you know, I used to say, like, I often say, like, when you're flying over

**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:55):**  In the future, you're going to be seeing indoor vertical farms, you're going to be seeing  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:15:59):**  laboratories that are that are growing meats, and you're going to be seeing like, huge algae  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:03):**  fields, you know, it's what agriculture is, is so different now.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:07):**  And we need to be like open to that kind of change, like shifting what we think of in  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:12):**  terms of agriculture.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:14):**  And it's not just like a community or societal thing.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:17):**  It's really governments also, we need to shift the way we think about agriculture, because  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:20):**  the way you regulate traditional farmers is totally different than the way that you're  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:23):**  going to look at regulating high tech farming.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:26):**  It's totally different than the way that you need to provide support to it.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:29):**  Also in the investment community, you have a lot of people so excited about like agriculture  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:33):**  technology companies are putting hundreds of millions into companies.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:36):**  But agriculture as a sector works very differently than most other sectors, right?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:40):**  You're not going to have one person feed the world, right?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:43):**  We have 7 billion people eating every day and God willing, and that is always going  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:49):**  to happen.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:50):**  We have 25,000 farms in Abu Dhabi, we're going to need thousands of vertical farms.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:53):**  So when we talk about the three that we have supported, air farms, pure harvest, matter  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:16:58):**  farms, I'm always like, that's the beginning.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:00):**  There's so many more that we will need if we really want to feed the world in this way.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:05):**  So what does agriculture actually look like in the UAE today?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:09):**  As you'll hear, they have some pretty big challenges.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:12):**  But that also means plenty of opportunities for ag tech.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:16):**  In the UAE, we import about 90% of our food.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:19):**  So we're very food insecure.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:21):**  But we've been focusing on agriculture, really looking into the future and really looking  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:24):**  at like technology innovations that we can apply to the sector.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:28):**  We do have 25,000 farms, the majority of those are what we call like hobby farms.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:34):**  In the past, what they would do is each family would kind of be given a farm and they could,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:37):**  you know, grow what they want, given some technology to do that.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:40):**  We do have a lot of like tomatoes, cucumbers, pumpkin squash that you can grow on the farms.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:46):**  And a lot of people do, but really, there are not so many, like large scale production  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:51):**  facilities currently in the UAE.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:54):**  We do have a handful of some of like industry leaders like Al Dahra, Elite Agro.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:17:59):**  We also have some like milk producers and meat producers.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:03):**  But it's quite small, right?  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:04):**  I mean, it makes up less than 10% of what is consumed.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:08):**  So the way that we have been focused on looking at agriculture technology is in two ways.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:14):**  The first is on providing new technologies for these traditional farmers.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:18):**  So what kind of ways can we make them more sustainable in terms of water management,  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:23):**  in terms of utility management, in terms of space by providing them new fertilizers, precision  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:28):**  agriculture tools, you know, water management, irrigation, sensors, you know, IoT, also like  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:33):**  agriculture robots and drones and anything that we can look at those 25,000 farmers and  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:37):**  identify which of those want to upskill, which of those want to become like production players,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:42):**  and seeing how that can work because the majority of agriculture is of course still in traditional  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:47):**  farming, and we want to make sure that we are enabling them to succeed.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:51):**  But the focus of what we've been doing is really new methods of food production.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:18:55):**  So we've been looking at indoor vertical farming, aquaculture, new forms of protein production,  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:00):**  like algae, cellular based protein growth, looking at how we can regulate and support  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:05):**  all of these new areas.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:07):**  And so that's been the focus of the work that we've done at the Abu Dhabi Investment Office.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:11):**  But of course, doing that balance between supporting the existing agriculture players  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:14):**  and attracting the new ones to join in the bay.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:18):**  How do you think about it in terms of one goal might be to increase food production  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:22):**  domestically around that kind of scarcity conversation and getting that 90% imports  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:26):**  to flip or go down.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:29):**  Another would be actually developing technology and being a kind of exporter of the technology,  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:34):**  like you might argue Israel is or the US or even Australia, just selling those robotics  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:39):**  or seeds or whatever it might be to the rest of the world.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:41):**  How do you think about those two priorities?  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:43):**  Are they both equal or is one sort of more important than the other?  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:48):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:49):**  I mean, the way that we've been looking at it is a lot of different ways.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:52):**  And what's nice about the way that the investment office supports companies is that we're not  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:57):**  diluting them.  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:58):**  We're not taking equity.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:19:59):**  We're not doing like loan repayments.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:01):**  We're really here as a catalyzing program.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:03):**  We also don't, we don't like try to pick winners before they compete or master plan the economy.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:07):**  So we're really saying if you're willing to make the investment, if it's a proven technology  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:12):**  or you've like proven R&D, then come here and we can do it and we will help you to make  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:16):**  that happen.

**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:22):**  of like goals of what we do with the investment and the goals of what we do in the sector.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:25):**  With the investment, we're looking at it really in kind of that broader holistic way where  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:30):**  we do have goals like minimum investment.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:31):**  We do want it to be like tech companies coming in and supporting.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:35):**  We do look at the number of high skilled jobs.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:37):**  We're also looking at the interactions with the ecosystem, especially in terms of education  
**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:42):**  and upskilling.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:43):**  So we work a lot with the UAE college of agriculture to make sure that like students are graduating  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:47):**  and going into these programs.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:49):**  We also do then look at like sector disruption and that can be through new IP patents that  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:53):**  are done.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:20:54):**  So a lot of the projects we've supported are R&D and also looking at how much is produced.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:00):**  In terms of then the goals that we have for the sector, food security more broadly, we  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:03):**  kind of have three goals.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:05):**  The first is import substitution.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:07):**  So part of that is about supply chain.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:09):**  I don't think that we're aiming to be 100% food sufficient.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:13):**  We are also, for example, earlier in the year, we as Abu Dhabi through one of our sovereign  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:20):**  funds, ABQ, purchased the majority stake in Louis Dreyfus, the agriculture logistics player.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:27):**  That isn't to bring them here, but it's to be a part of that supply chain and be kind  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:31):**  of at the forefront of the logistics of that.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:33):**  We're also looking at how do we diversify our imports.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:36):**  Another goal, the second goal is on sustainability.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:39):**  So we waste about 196 kilograms of food per person per year in the UAE.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:43):**  A lot of that is warehousing and shelf life waste.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:46):**  So it's not actually even coming to the consumer yet before it gets wasted.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:51):**  We can look at technologies around like shelf life support.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:55):**  We can look at technologies again on like pulled supply chain and different stuff like  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:58):**  that.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:21:59):**  But it's really a societal thing.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:01):**  We're very hospitable in the Gulf.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:03):**  When people come, we want to give them more food than they could ever eat, just to kind  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:07):**  of show that, which is also a little bit historical.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:10):**  We've had a lot of severe times in terms of being able to feed an entire population.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:14):**  And so having a celebration with people and showing them all the food is really is societally  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:20):**  important.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:21):**  And then the final goal is of course on the local production.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:25):**  And that can be both in the quantum that's produced here.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:29):**  But as you said on technology, we really want Abu Dhabi to be a center for desert and arid  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:34):**  climate agriculture.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:36):**  So about a third of the world is living in desert and arid climates.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:40):**  That number is only increasing.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:42):**  And we believe that the technologies that we can research here are going to be globally  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:47):**  exportable.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:48):**  They're going to be able to impact the populations around the world in places you might not want  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:52):**  to be doing that R&D, right?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:54):**  Like the Sahel, like Central Asia.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:22:56):**  And so we're able to provide that support and hopefully the solutions that will be developed  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:01):**  here in the UAE will be able to be applied around the world.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:05):**  And that's kind of the focus always of the UAE in every sector that we work, because  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:09):**  we're quite small.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:10):**  I mean, we're the 30th biggest economy, but we only have 10 million people.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:14):**  And so we often say that any company in Abu Dhabi has to be instantly global.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:18):**  And a lot of companies are using Abu Dhabi as a stepping stone to wider markets like  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:23):**  South Asia, like East Africa, like the broader Middle East.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:26):**  So we're excited for companies to use us as their base.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:29):**  It's an interesting parallel to Australia for a bunch of reasons.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:32):**  One, obviously desert climate and need for investment in climate adaptive agriculture.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:37):**  Also the sort of jumping off point, Australia gets sort of the reputation and pathway for  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:42):**  access into Asia, but also this tension that's really playing out in Australia right now  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:46):**  around do we think of ag tech as support for technology for our farmers to produce more?  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:51):**  And really the goal is to become a hundred billion dollar production industry of food  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:56):**  and fiber.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:23:57):**  And or do we want to sell more technology and commercialize more research and become  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:00):**  the provider of technology to the world and the way that government might need to support  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:04):**  that, the way that we would attract capital and entrepreneurs and create connections and  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:09):**  be part of the global ecosystem would look quite differently.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:12):**  You're not necessarily talking about trade deals or things like that for selling technology,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:17):**  but you are for selling beef into China or whatever it might be.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:20):**  And so there's this interesting question of how do you support both the production of  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:24):**  food and fiber ecosystem with technology and the growth of the technology ecosystem and  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:29):**  the venture investment and the entrepreneurship and all the networks that need to play out  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:33):**  there.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:34):**  So it sounds like in some ways Australia is a small player participating meaningfully  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:37):**  in a big way globally.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:38):**  So some interesting parallels that people might not have really thought about between  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:42):**  UAE and Australia.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:43):**  You know, I think people don't know the way that agriculture sector works now in terms  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:50):**  of all of it, the workforce, the production methods, the science behind it, the government  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:56):**  support.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:24:57):**  And so they, as it moves into a higher tech angle and it starts to maybe have regulation  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:05):**  or support that is similar to other technology, then people are like, whoa, wait, like, you  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:10):**  know why some of these parallels are maybe seem like unfair, right?  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:15):**  Supporting a farmer is, it sounds like noble, I think it like has a ring to it, you know,  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:19):**  but supporting like a tech company sound like doesn't like sounds horrible.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:23):**  Those capitalists, yeah.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:25):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:26):**  So then it's like, what about supporting a high tech farmer?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:30):**  Like what does that mean?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:31):**  And so I think there needs to be like a comfort that like governments, governments have in  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:35):**  this.

**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:39):**  we support farmers, right?

**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:44):**  You know, should they be able to attract that kind of talent, you know, and be the type

**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:54):**  The role of government in business always makes for an interesting discussion.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:25:58):**  It's hard to reconcile the tension between too much regulation and too little.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:02):**  On the one hand, it's hard for regulators to keep up with the pace of rapidly changing  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:07):**  technologies.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:08):**  On the other hand, for agriculture, there are so many variables outside of anyone's  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:12):**  control.

**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:17):**  investment.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:18):**  And that's what the Emirati government is doing, trying to both address food security  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:22):**  and be strategic in developing a knowledge economy.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:25):**  The UAE has even launched Food Tech Valley, a hub for ag tech innovation, the specific  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:30):**  focus on vertical farming, aquaculture and hydroponics.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:34):**  But to make it happen, the regulations needed to change.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:38):**  We launched our agriculture innovation, our ag tech innovation program in March 2019.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:45):**  And at the time, there was no high tech agricultural economic license.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:48):**  So you couldn't be registered as like a high tech agriculture company, either an agriculture  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:53):**  company or tech company, which had different activities that you could do and really confuse  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:26:58):**  people in terms of what they could import, how they were managed, etc.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:02):**  So we, back in 2019, we worked with the Department of Economic Development and others to get  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:08):**  that license out there to be able to support companies in this field.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:11):**  That's like a very basic kind of thing, but really shows like how we, as there are new  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:16):**  economic activities, you have to have new economic licenses that then like look at that  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:20):**  and regulate that.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:22):**  We've also looked at the land use, right?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:24):**  So we have a lot of our companies are located in the different free zones that we have in  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:28):**  Qizad and Zones Corp and in others.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:31):**  A lot of our agricultural production is in Al Ain, though, a city in Abu Dhabi, Emirati,  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:36):**  that's a little bit further away.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:37):**  And so we've been looking at, okay, where can high tech farming companies be?  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:41):**  A lot of the farming land is reserved for nationals.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:44):**  We did then in the past year, we changed our foreign ownership policy.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:49):**  So most economic activities are able to have 100% foreign ownership onshore, meaning that  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:54):**  the companies don't only have to be in the free zones in order to operate, which opens  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:27:59):**  up a lot of areas for the companies to look at and makes it more competitive in terms  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:02):**  of like land.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:03):**  And then there's the regulation in terms of what we're eating, which is more around like  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:07):**  aquaculture and cellular based agriculture.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:10):**  And that's something that we're still looking at and seeing how we can play a role in that  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:15):**  and make sure that we are enabling the new waves of technology.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:20):**  And so we are constantly taking the feedback of the private sector saying, you know, what  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:24):**  do you think needs to change?  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:25):**  How would that help getting the information from them?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:28):**  And the role that the Abu Dhabi Investment Office plays is really as that liaison.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:31):**  So we kind of, we connect the impact of regulatory change to the process of it.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:38):**  And so I think often we'll have regulators or other government departments who want to  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:43):**  make X, Y, and Z change, but they're not able to be like, and if we make this change, all  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:47):**  of these companies will come here.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:49):**  Whereas when we're talking to all those companies, we can kind of make that connection and make  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:52):**  a more powerful narrative for some of that regulatory change.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:28:57):**  And so we also are quite lucky that we're in an environment politically or like structurally  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:02):**  within our government that we can make decisions really, really quickly.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:06):**  I think the best form of government for economic development is the system that we have in  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:11):**  the UAE because we're able to think really long term.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:14):**  We're able to think really kind of like inspirationally and innovatively and also like holistically  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:18):**  for the entire population, you know, rather than just for like a 51% of it.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:23):**  And then you end up getting great decisions made fast, looking towards the future.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:28):**  Another example of that, which is more strategic than regulatory, is we were the first country  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:32):**  in the world to have a Ministry of Food Security.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:35):**  Last year during COVID, that ministry also grew to be the Ministry of Food and Water  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:38):**  Security.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:39):**  And then just a few weeks ago, also the climate change portfolio was given.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:43):**  So it's now the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, which includes the food and  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:46):**  water security policies.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:47):**  And so having that kind of strategic vision and being a part of what we think the future  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:53):**  can look like is really important to having that being a topic not only for investors  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:29:58):**  and not only for the government, but for the society as well.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:02):**  It brings up an interesting point around this.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:04):**  I don't know if it's actually real or perceived, but definitely perceived at least in terms  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:08):**  of like Americans and Australians and maybe a more Western view of what it's like to do  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:11):**  business in the Middle East and maybe in Abu Dhabi in particular.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:15):**  What are some of the big cultural differences that you found?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:17):**  And do you think those are more exaggerated in Western minds or it's actually easier to  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:21):**  do business maybe than people perceive?  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:25):**  That's a great question that's hard for me to answer because I've been here since I was  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:27):**  20.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:28):**  So it's like my entire adulthood.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:29):**  I've done work in international context, but always with some kind of Abu Dhabi angle where  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:34):**  I've always been based here working on other things.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:36):**  But what I can speak on is the way that investors have come to us.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:40):**  And I think that they are really shocked by the openness and the transparency.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:45):**  Also what I often say is what you know about Abu Dhabi isn't wrong.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:48):**  It's just old because we're changing stuff so much that we'll have people come in still.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:30:54):**  It was only a year or so ago we're 100% foreign ownership.

**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:08):**  And yet there is so much excitement for the broader Middle East in terms of the economic

**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:21):**  the safest city in the world five years in a row.

**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:39):**  to be based here and work around?  
**[0:31:42-0:31:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:42):**  And especially now with the change in terms of remote working and where the location of  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:49):**  where workers are living is different than the location of where they're doing business,  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:31:53):**  we're seeing a lot more people saying, all right, 0% tax, high quality of life, great

**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:08):**  to the identity tends to be a static view.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:10):**  And yet people and places are incredibly dynamic.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:14):**  And so what we try to show people is like, if you explore the opportunity of Abu Dhabi  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:20):**  in the past and it didn't work for whatever reason, come now, tell us why that is, see  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:24):**  how it has changed.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:26):**  And maybe it'll, and I'm certain that you will be positively surprised with that.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:31):**  One of the things that we see as investors is there's this often tension for startups  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:35):**  in particular in an ag tech, there are a lot of startups because it is a pretty new industry  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:39):**  where they might have the temptation to kind of follow the money.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:42):**  You know, if an investor, like we get it all the time being in Australia, we might have  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:45):**  a U S company that even preemptively before we say anything reaches out and says, oh,  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:50):**  and I'd be happy to dedicate your potential, you know, your percent of funds that you're  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:53):**  going to invest into my company, into our Australia strategy.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:55):**  And we're like, well, is Australia actually on your roadmap?  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:32:57):**  Or are you just saying that so that we hopefully give you the money?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:00):**  I'd be curious, does that dynamic play out for you guys?  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:04):**  It's a absolutely happens.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:06):**  I think to anybody, I mean, I wish my LinkedIn inbox on no one, it's just, I don't know if  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:13):**  that app is useful to anybody other than reading news, which is great.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:17):**  But the no, for sure.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:19):**  I think that what we are interested in is like sustainable investment.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:23):**  And we mean that both in terms of like environmentally sustainable and culturally sustainable, but  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:29):**  also looking at, are these companies going to stick, right?  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:32):**  Like, will they stay?  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:34):**  We're not interested in any way at just kind of like throwing money at the wall and hoping  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:38):**  some of it sticks, right?  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:40):**  That's why we provide our support in a rebate program, which I think is actually the best  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:44):**  that I've seen in my like 12 or so years in economic development, because we're basically  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:49):**  saying, we will pay back costs after they're incurred in Abu Dhabi.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:52):**  So we're not giving a lot of upfront funding and then saying, you know, we hope that you'll  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:56):**  invest in Abu Dhabi.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:33:58):**  We're saying once you've invested in Abu Dhabi, once you've made that strategic decision,  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:01):**  then we can pay back a percentage of the costs that you have incurred here.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:05):**  We also don't look at covering like opex costs because then again, once the incentive amount  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:09):**  will go down, it won't be as relevant.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:11):**  So we're looking more like kind of R&D projects, helping them to do what they would do anyway  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:15):**  in a bigger way or a better way or a faster way.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:18):**  It's always the question that we are asked when we're talking about like new investment  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:21):**  opportunities is would they do it without us?  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:24):**  And in a way it's a trick question because if they wouldn't do it without us, then we  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:29):**  don't want to convince them only through the money.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:31):**  If they would do it without us, then is this a good use of government funding?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:35):**  So what we're always looking at is, okay, what is the, like the perfect situation is  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:39):**  a company that comes and says, I'm thinking about doing something in the Middle East.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:43):**  It makes complete sense in my strategy.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:44):**  I'm looking at desert and arid climates.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:46):**  I'm looking to expand to different parts of the world.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:48):**  I can use it as a base.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:50):**  Here's what I am planning for the next three years.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:53):**  But you know, if we could support X, Y, or Z way, then I could do this much in year one  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:34:58):**  or this one much in year two.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:00):**  It's obviously not just a verbal conversation.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:02):**  It's looking really deeply at business plans and saying, okay, like what makes sense or  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:05):**  what doesn't make sense?  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:06):**  What within the market can actually catalyze it?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:08):**  Do we think it makes sense?  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:10):**  We are not sector owners at the Abu Dhabi investment office.

**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:23):**  Is it something that's a viable business model?  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:26):**  Is it something that is a good use of government funding?  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:28):**  And then we make our decisions and it really comes down to that balance.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:31):**  I think only the future will see, right?  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:34):**  Definitely.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:35):**  We see a lot of perverse incentives.

**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:40):**  rather than grow it, which is pretty frustrating.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:43):**  But one of the things you said that really interested me was when you fly over these  
**[0:35:46-0:35:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:46):**  countries, you can sort of get a sense of what production looks like.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:49):**  And if you imagine flying over UAE in the future, you know, maybe it's a bunch of what  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:54):**  looks sort of like factories because they're growing vegetables or they're growing meat

**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:35:59):**  It raises this interesting transparency question for the food system, I believe.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:03):**  And this is just an Abu Dhabi question.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:05):**  Like when we consumers sort of want to know more about where their food comes from and  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:09):**  we have this trend of satellite imagery where we're going to be able to see all the production.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:13):**  And so, you know, what you do outside is mostly going to be public knowledge.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:17):**  If we're growing things outside, if we're growing things inside, do we have that same  
**[0:36:20-0:36:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:20):**  kind of push for transparency?  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:22):**  Yeah, I think that's a great question that I've always found fascinating.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:28):**  When I'm in the States, I live in New York and it's funny to be like in one of the biggest  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:31):**  cities in the world, but then have people like obsessed with like where their salad  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:35):**  is sourced from because it's not typically there.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:38):**  So I think there's good opportunities.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:40):**  For example, one of the companies in Abu Dhabi called Emirates Bio Farm, they're the largest  
**[0:36:44-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:44):**  organic farm in the UAE, I believe.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:46):**  They have also like a restaurant at the side that I think they even have like hotel rooms  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:50):**  where you can like stay and they give you kind of that experience to understand what  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:54):**  farming looks like in the Emirates.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:55):**  I think that's really great.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:36:57):**  Also with the rise of social media and also just how beautiful farming can be, we have  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:01):**  a lot of stuff, for example, like Pure Harvest, one of the companies that we've supported,  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:04):**  has a beautiful facility in LA and, you know, their social media has incredible photos of  
**[0:37:09-0:37:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:09):**  this and I think they do want to share that with the world.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:11):**  Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting question.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:13):**  It goes back to all those kinds of things, identities and access to food and lots of  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:17):**  these challenging technical and philosophical questions.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:20):**  That's one of the things that excites me about AgTech is the diversity of perspectives that  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:24):**  we now need in this industry that might not have been true in the past and is increasingly  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:29):**  true in a place like Abu Dhabi where you have different, really different kinds of production  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:32):**  systems.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:33):**  It sounds like an increasingly so in the future.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:35):**  Yeah, I mean, I always find it crazy when people think like farming in a leafy green  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:43):**  is so different than farming, like a berry is so different than farming like a livestock,  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:48):**  right?  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:49):**  Like they are all called farmers and it seems it's like such a catch all and I think people  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:54):**  don't realize how much of a catch all that is and how complicated it is to look at different  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:37:59):**  cultivars and the different types of skill sets that will be required in the workforce  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:03):**  in agriculture in the future, but also the different types of like investments that we  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:06):**  need to focus on.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:07):**  I think that's kind of the holy grail of a lot of this food security stuff, especially  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:11):**  in like indoor closed environment agriculture.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:13):**  And I would love to see what types of technologies can really be like mass produced and mass  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:19):**  like put out into the world and to like I joke that my farms in Tanzania are organic,  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:24):**  but it's just because there is no fertilizer available in that part of the country.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:27):**  So when will the technologies that I'm investing in reach my farm?  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:33):**  Probably a long time in the future unless we start looking in different ways.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:37):**  Yeah, well, I like that aspiration.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:39):**  I think we absolutely need it.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:40):**  Are there any parallels or lessons that you have drawn from your time in developing countries  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:45):**  and working with smallholder farmers that you're applying now sitting in still a development  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:49):**  role, but a pretty different context with audio?  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:53):**  Yeah, and I think more than more than people think.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:56):**  I mean, I think there's some of my former classmates who think I've like sold out because  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:38:59):**  I'm in a suit and I think it's funny because I feel like I'm doing exactly what I studied.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:03):**  But I think it really goes back to that point I was making about like originally like trail  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:06):**  of seeds like the NGO I was doing and looking at like culturally inclusive development and  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:11):**  holistic development.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:12):**  What I like is that we're not just looking for ROI, we're not just looking for like an  
**[0:39:16-0:39:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:16):**  economic return.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:18):**  Our director general often would describe what we were doing as nation building.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:22):**  It's really about thinking what should the economy look like?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:25):**  What are the goals of these sectors that we're focusing on?  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:28):**  And it's at a much more like macro stage, at least kind of like the strategic vision.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:31):**  But I like working with the individual companies and seeing how they like fit into that puzzle.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:37):**  And it's the most exciting conversations with them isn't about the investment they've made  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:41):**  or the number of jobs or any of that, but it's about these kind of like societal impacts  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:44):**  that they're able to have and seeing the connections.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:47):**  And that also links back to the travel, which, you know, when I visited every country, I'd  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:52):**  always say what I learned the most is that everybody's the same and that we share 90%.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:39:57):**  And when you look at the most successful companies, when you look at the most successful investments,  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:02):**  when you look at the most successful people, they're really playing on that kind of connectivity  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:06):**  and that human dimension.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:09):**  And I hope more and more so we will get to that where more companies, more and more investors,  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:14):**  more governments are looking at this kind of culturally inclusive way of approaching  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:18):**  development.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:19):**  And definitely operating on that human level is so much of the venture capital world, especially  
**[0:40:23-0:40:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:23):**  is like, you know, metrics and deals and play the game.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:26):**  And I find it really frustrating.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:28):**  It's like these are people and jobs and lives.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:30):**  And if we forget that, then, you know, what the heck are we doing?  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:32):**  So I definitely find that frustrating.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:34):**  Is there a story that you have from your travels that kind of comes to mind or you have found  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:38):**  particularly relevant in applying it to what you're doing now?  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:43):**  I think that it's, I do often think back on my village in Tanzania.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:48):**  I still go there every year.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:50):**  And I think about the people that I had helped there.  
**[0:40:52-0:41:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:40:52):**  And what I try and what I'm trying to do is to not separate this glitzy image of the future  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:00):**  from the reality of most people in the world.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:03):**  Right.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:04):**  And to realize that there is so much separation and inequality now in the world.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:09):**  And so when I think of my farm, which is, you know, like on dirt roads, people making

**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:18):**  types of innovations that can help them sometime, like, you know, over time.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:24):**  But I often think when I hear something, I wonder who will it actually impact?  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:30):**  You know, we talked about like saving the world.

**[0:41:35-0:41:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:35):**  do.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:36):**  We consume healthcare.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:37):**  It's going to change the way we do this.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:39):**  By we, they're talking about like a really niche, small elite percent of the population.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:45):**  And so I think traveling around the world, you expand that idea of we.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:50):**  And I don't want to like forget that when I'm looking at the investments that I'm doing.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:41:55):**  Maybe like one short story that I was once on a shared taxi, like a truck that was filled  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:02):**  with like 15 people going from the forest region in Guinea into, into Mali.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:07):**  And it was like a 26 hour journey.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:09):**  And I was sitting on the same seat.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:11):**  Like I had to share a seat with this guy.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:14):**  And the first few hours of the trip, all we did was talk about like, we talked about like  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:18):**  football, like Ronaldo versus Messi.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:20):**  We talked about like, if we wanted to get married and like, like normal kind of like  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:23):**  guy conversations.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:25):**  And then I said, Oh, like, you know, why are you going to Mali?  
**[0:42:28-0:42:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:28):**  And he explained that he's actually trying to get to Italy, like he was going to go across  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:31):**  the Sahara and he was going to try and like get on a boat and like get into Italy.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:35):**  And it hit me that even though for all these hours, we were literally doing the same thing,  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:40):**  right?  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:41):**  Like we were like sitting like cheek to cheek on this seat, do like literally doing the  
**[0:42:45-0:42:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:45):**  exact same thing.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:46):**  We weren't in any way doing the same thing, right?  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:49):**  We were, it was completely different.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:50):**  I was like a tourist doing this for fun, like taking photos.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:53):**  And he was like trying to make a better life for himself and his family.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:42:56):**  And so I think it's everything that we do is about like perception and you might be  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:02):**  like doing the exact same thing, or you might see somebody and you think they're doing X,  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:05):**  Y, or Z, but it goes back to that.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:07):**  The question at the beginning of values, like what are, what do you do?  
**[0:43:11-0:43:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:11):**  And it's not just like what you're physically doing or what the actions are, but like, why  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:14):**  are you doing it?

**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:19):**  strategic decisions that we're making, that we're not just like doing it to, you know,  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:25):**  for ourselves that we're like thinking more, more broadly and that we realize that you  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:29):**  can do things with intention in a way that really impacts the world more than if you're  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:33):**  just doing it without thinking about that kind of value.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/12/14/-government-in-agtech-ecosystems#t=0:43:40):**  And that's it for another episode of AgTech So What.

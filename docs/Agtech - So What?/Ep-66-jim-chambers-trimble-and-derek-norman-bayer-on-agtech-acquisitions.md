**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:02:59):**  of development when it comes to an investment.

**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:07):**  I think, largely speaking, our venture group, which is called Leaps by Bayer, similar to  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:12):**  many corporate venture groups.

**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:23):**  platforms that are future growth opportunities for Bayer.

**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:35):**  help shift the paradigm in agriculture.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:37):**  The way I look at it personally, Bayer, like Syngenta, like Corteva, and BASF, they're  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:42):**  very good at chemistry, very good at seeds.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:44):**  That has been a very good and continues to be a great product platform delivering a lot

**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:22):**  Once again, looking at the history of the bigger ag tech acquisitions, my own observation  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:27):**  is that it's usually been the first mover or the first company to be mature in a space  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:31):**  that's really been ending up in essentially the most valuable acquisition.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:39):**  So it's usually that first mover tends to be the big winner, I think, in ag tech, at  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:43):**  least so far.

**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:48):**  and unique stories.

**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:56):**  to keep competition at bay.

**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:10:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:10:53):**  No, that makes a lot of sense.

**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:10:59):**  LP or I have no LPs.

**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:05):**  fine, are they pretty rigid with a Bayer would never go into X, Y, and Z?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:11):**  Or are they pretty open like, hey, let's see where these things go?  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:15):**  I would say pretty open.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:17):**  I mean, I spent nine years at Syngenta before joining Bayer.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:20):**  And I could probably speak for both, at least maybe I'm a little more dated in my experience  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:23):**  at Syngenta.

**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:29):**  We are allowed to push the boundaries a little bit.

**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:47):**  from now, you've got to be within scope of that.

**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:00):**  And it's a company called CoverCress in St. Louis, a really interesting company.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:04):**  And I think it really does break the boundaries.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:07):**  They're a company that's trying, they're using breeding and gene editing to convert penny

**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:26):**  It's not a crop.

**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:29):**  So it takes time and capital and patience to develop.

**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:39):**  major row crops.

**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:45):**  That would take patience and resources that just aren't present in a bigger company.

**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:59):**  to take a risk and fail a little bit.

**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:07):**  Or more importantly, that could be offered to growers in the future.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:11):**  Right.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:12):**  You mentioned the merger between Bayer and Monsanto.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:14):**  How was the merging of the venture arms?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:17):**  So I joined last year about a year and a month ago.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:21):**  And basically we brought together, on Monsanto, there was a portfolio of about 10 or 12 companies.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:26):**  And then Bayer has also made, Bayer's got also a pharmaceuticals business and had made  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:32):**  some investments mainly on the pharma side, but a couple of investments in the agricultural  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:36):**  space.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:37):**  So we basically brought them under one team, one umbrella, one approach, largely pretty  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:41):**  smooth.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:42):**  I would say personally, it just took me some time to get up and running and get to know  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:45):**  everybody.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:46):**  So once again, if any of those folks are in the audience, I appreciate the patience given  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:50):**  as we, as I got up to speed and we built out our team.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:54):**  But largely speaking, it went pretty smoothly.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:57):**  And I would say, yeah, I think we tried to bring the best of both worlds to how we approach  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:02):**  making investments now.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:04):**  So I think Monsanto really, within their ventures team, I think they had a great reputation  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:09):**  internally, great reputation externally, and built up a good portfolio.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:13):**  Same on the LEAP side.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:14):**  And so we've really, probably with more of a reputation in the pharmaceutical space.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:18):**  So we've been able to bring that together in one team now.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:21):**  And if I remember correctly, LEAPs by Bayer actually started by kind of incubating new  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:26):**  ventures of their own instead of going out and finding new ones.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:29):**  So I assume you still do that.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:30):**  And if so, when do you decide whether, hey, it's time for us just to build this from in-house  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:34):**  from scratch or go out and see what's in the market to try to invest in?  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:39):**  Yep.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:40):**  So that's how, that was sort of the original approach of LEAPs.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:42):**  And so we created a company called JoinBio, which is a partnership with Ginkgo to look  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:46):**  at making microbes that are able to fix nitrogen and generally provide benefits for crops.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:53):**  I would say that wasn't necessarily a unique approach.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:55):**  I think once again, if you look at the sort of legacy Monsanto portfolio, we have a great  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:58):**  company called Pairwise Plants.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:00):**  That is a very similar sort of a company created from scratch to really build the sort of best  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:05):**  in class gene editing capabilities for plants of all types, all the way from berries and  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:09):**  produce to row crops.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:11):**  Ultimately, it comes down to, I think, looking at what are the available technologies and  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:18):**  what do we think the technologies are that are going to be breakthroughs and paradigm  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:22):**  shifting.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:23):**  So I think stepping back, I mean, looking backwards, it's a little easier to see those.

**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:58):**  But I would say that's what I think we really look at both, just to be clear.

**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:06):**  proposition.

**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:10):**  And be good about positioning yourself there.

**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:23):**  doing, that is very effective because it's a great way to get airtime and awareness built.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:28):**  So I think it's very good and very helpful to build that awareness at that, it's called

**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:35):**  I think one of the challenges in agriculture is that there's relatively few partners.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:39):**  It takes time to test compounds and to test products.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:44):**  All the big ad companies like to do that before they get too far along in, let's say an M&A  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:49):**  discussion or a big partnership.

**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:19:10):**  And of course, get to know the corporate venture investors at each of the companies.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:19:15):**  The M&A and the ventures, it's not firmly linked, but I always say, if there's an instinct

**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:20:57):**  from Wilbur Ellis.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:20:58):**  So there's that tier of companies.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:02):**  They're hungry, they want growth, and they may not be as distracted.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:06):**  So I think it's worth looking there and getting to know those folks also.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:10):**  Okay, that's excellent.

**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:16):**  You mentioned earlier, there's been a fair amount of exits, maybe on the smaller scale,  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:19):**  that don't make the headlines because maybe they're not venture-backed celebration type

**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:36):**  I think it comes down, I think, probably it's going to be this industry consolidation, certainly  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:42):**  hasn't helped.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:43):**  So that's been a headwind.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:44):**  I mean, that's just taken up mindshare and bandwidth that previously existed.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:48):**  And I think there's just been uncertainty on strategy.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:52):**  So it's been harder to make big bets.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:54):**  Commodity prices definitely don't help.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:56):**  I don't think that's been a direct headwind.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:58):**  But I think those are the main drivers.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:01):**  But I'd also say on the technology side, there have been not a huge number of companies that  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:06):**  have broken out and gained a lot of traction, let's say, in the digital ag space.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:11):**  There are certainly a few, but it hasn't been, I think, just it's not a critique necessarily  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:16):**  to companies.

**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:21):**  When you look at digital ag, it's really got started in 2013, 2012, maybe a little bit  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:26):**  earlier.

**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:30):**  I was at Syngenta in Perth.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:32):**  That was very early in the days.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:34):**  But that was only for me.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:35):**  That was eight or nine years ago.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:37):**  I think Agworld had been around probably three years at that time.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:41):**  So I think it takes time.

**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:43):**  It's hard when you're comparing ourselves to the tech space and how fast things move

**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:49):**  Right.

**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:53):**  earlier when you said you talked about kind of indoor ag.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:56):**  Do you see potential opportunity in indoor ag for some big exits?  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:23:01):**  So in indoor ag itself, I'm probably not as much of an expert.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:23:06):**  So I think that there's sort of a couple of different layers of indoor agriculture.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:23:10):**  There's sort of the operations, which are somewhat farms.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:23:13):**  Now, of course, they're very technology-enabled.

**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:23:24):**  retailers.

**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:23:34):**  very close to the consumer.

**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:23:40):**  And getting that all right is very important for e-commerce, which is obviously a massive

**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:30):**  Have we seen it anywhere?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:31):**  And what makes you hopeful that we will, if not?  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:34):**  Yeah, I think if you look back in the last 10 years and focus on sort of North America  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:40):**  and Europe, I end up sort of with the same question, sort of where has this disruption  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:45):**  happened?  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:46):**  Where is farming significantly different than it was 10 years ago?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:49):**  I'd say there's FieldView and a few other apps in the cab now.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:53):**  And those are certainly helpful.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:54):**  And yeah, I think those are those change the way agriculture is done in some ways.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:58):**  I'd say if you want to look for the biggest change, it's not in North America or Europe,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:03):**  but in Asia and with the advent of a drone based spraying of crop protection.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:08):**  And that has really taken off in Asia.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:10):**  I don't have the numbers in front of me or specific growth, but it's in the millions  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:14):**  of acres, I think, when you look at China.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:17):**  And it's in terms of market share, it's very big in Japan with Yamaha's autonomous helicopter  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:22):**  delivered crop protection.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:24):**  And the reason there's twofold, or threefold really, it's probably smaller fields, harder  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:28):**  to access terrain for tractors.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:30):**  And really, they're replacing the jobs of backpacks, right?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:33):**  So going in the field and spraying with a backpack is not a great job to be doing.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:39):**  It's hard, it takes a huge amount of time.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:41):**  And drones, I mean, that's classic disruption, right?  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:44):**  Drones coming in and sort of replacing that kind of job.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:47):**  And that has happened at scale in Asia.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:49):**  So we haven't really seen that in North America.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:52):**  But I think that to me, that just illustrates there is that potential for new, doesn't have  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:57):**  to be drone spraying, could be something else.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:58):**  But that potential definitely exists for something to take off in a relatively short timeframe.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:26:04):**  So that's what we're on the lookout for.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:26:06):**  And I think, you know, if it's not that it could be something else.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:26:09):**  And that's what keeps us, keeps me excited and keeps us going.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:26:12):**  Derek, I really appreciate this.

**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:30:52):**  can we go to more of a hardware as a service or as we call it, everything as a service.

**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:31:41):**  So I started kind of my first days in the true ag tech space with Bayer back in 2006.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:31:46):**  And we were wrestling with that question back then.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:31:49):**  And I think it's still my position, I think is still true today.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:31:54):**  And that is, our goal is to put tools and information in the hand of the agronomist  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:32:00):**  and the farmer to help them make better decisions.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:32:04):**  I don't necessarily see us in the short term and even the midterm to actually take over

**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:32:12):**  But we are going to provide tools that are going to help the agronomist.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:32:16):**  So yeah, I think the agronomist can elevate their game and step up, take on more acre  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:32:21):**  with better information.

**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:40:01):**  We might just start in the U.S. or we might just start in Europe or in Australia or Asia,

**[0:40:27-0:40:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:40:27):**  got that we can add to to complete and make a more robust offering to the customer.

**[0:52:10-0:52:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:10):**  more capital and more entrepreneurs coming to this space.

**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:18):**  I would say it's probably still early days, but yeah, there's places like indoor farming,  
**[0:52:23-0:52:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:23):**  like I mentioned earlier, where you may see some of them take certain positions, but it's  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:27):**  yeah, I don't have to crystal ball to see where exactly how exactly that will play out.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:32):**  But I do think largely speaking, you know, advent of digital technologies and tools,  
**[0:52:36-0:52:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:36):**  just at a high level, those can replace the jobs being done on the field by other products.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:41):**  So I think it's, it wouldn't be surprising to see new entrants in the market.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:46):**  And I agree with with Derek, we certainly I think it's good.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:49):**  I think it's great in terms of that coming in that it's such a woven ag, such a woven  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:57):**  field, that you asked Sarah, do I see a competitor or partner?  
**[0:53:01-0:53:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:53:01):**  And the answer is yes, you know, we see, but you know, certainly they could be competitors.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:53:06):**  But more often than not, I think we see it at least a company like Trimble and I'm sure  
**[0:53:10-0:53:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:53:10):**  Bayer's the same way in the size.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:53:12):**  You know, there's places where you would absolutely partner together and there's other places

**[0:56:11-0:56:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:56:11):**  started to change.

**[0:56:19-0:56:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:56:19):**  And I think of the capital markets as like a series of waterfalls.

**[0:56:26-0:56:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:56:26):**  The funds are all funded.

**[0:56:32-0:56:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:56:32):**  companies that operate and maybe have previously didn't have cash needs, maybe they have cash

**[0:56:43-0:56:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:56:43):**  It all trickles down.

**[0:56:56-0:56:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:56:56):**  And it's hard to quantify that extent.

**[0:58:57-0:59:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:58:57):**  He's saying a lot of startups in the biological space focus on specialty crops initially.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:59:03):**  And he's asking, do you really want to see them go on to more broad acre crops in order

### Agtech - So What?  (2020-55-06)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the Ag Tech Silhouette podcast brought to you by Agthentik.  I'm your host and Agthentik founding partner, Sarah Nolet.  Today we are bringing you another live episode that was recorded at a virtual event I co-hosted  with Tim Hamrich.  Tim is the host of the amazing Future of Agriculture podcast, which I definitely recommend.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:00:25):**  If you haven't checked it out, maybe start with episode 201 where Matthew Pryor, my business  partner, was the guest.  Today's episode is all about corporate investments and acquisitions.  We have two guests, Derek Norman, vice president at LEAPS by Bayer, their corporate venture  capital arm, and Jim Chambers, president and general manager of the worldwide agriculture

We cover different ways that Ag Tech startups can engage with corporates from early stage  direct strategic investments that look like venture capital all the way through to acquisitions  and what it takes to be acquisition ready.  We talk about what Bayer and Trimble are looking for, what spaces are hot and not, and how

This podcast and the event were really experiments in terms of format, and this episode is a  bit longer.  To help you navigate it, the first 30 minutes is Derek and Tim.  The second 30 minutes is Jim and myself, and the third is a Q&A with all four of us and

So you can skip around to those three 30-minute chunks if you'd like.  I'd love to hear your feedback on the live events and the length of this podcast.  Should it have been two episodes?  Did you want more voiceovers to speed things up?  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:01:46):**  Do you love or hate the co-hosted format?  Please please let me know.  We'd love to change things around so that you guys are loving this podcast.  So that's it for me in terms of housekeeping.  We jump into the episode live with Tim introducing Derek.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:02:01):**  Derek joined Bayer in 2019 and leads its venture capital investments in agriculture, Leaps  by Bayer.  As vice president of venture investments, Derek helps Bayer identify and work with new  technologies and businesses that are shaping the next generation of sustainable agriculture.  One cool thing that I was excited that Derek was willing to be on is he has really sat  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:02:21):**  on in a lot of different chairs.  So he's been on boards.  He's been a startup founder himself.  He co-founded Agrometis, which developed natural product-based crop protection solutions.  And of course, on the corporate side, he has a really deep background in corporate venture  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:02:37):**  investing.  And he's been into ventures, which is one of the first, maybe the first, Derek, you'll  have to tell us, corporate VC investors in the ag industry.  Derek, just to get us kicked off here, if you don't mind, one interesting thing about  your role is you're looking at companies through all of the stages.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:02:53):**  So maybe start by talking about what is Leaps by Bayer looking for across all of the stages  of development when it comes to an investment.  Great.  Yep.  No problem, Tim.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:04):**  Thanks for the nice introduction.  In general, what are we looking for?  I think, largely speaking, our venture group, which is called Leaps by Bayer, similar to  many corporate venture groups.  Ultimately, at the end of the day, we're looking for growth opportunities for our parent company.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:19):**  I think the way we look at that at Leaps by Bayer a little bit is to look at new technology  platforms that are future growth opportunities for Bayer.  I'm focused personally on the agricultural space.  So we're looking for growth opportunities, new kinds of product platforms that would  help shift the paradigm in agriculture.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:37):**  The way I look at it personally, Bayer, like Syngenta, like Corteva, and BASF, they're  very good at chemistry, very good at seeds.  That has been a very good and continues to be a great product platform delivering a lot  of value for growers.  I think the high level, what we're looking out for is what's next.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:03:53):**  So what's a new kind of technology platform, whether it be biologicals or some kind of  digital technology that can really be a new kind of value creation platform for growers.  Excellent.  And as a corporate venture arm, are you thinking years down the head, like, okay, this is a  company we ultimately want to acquire, so let's get in early and help them along their  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:04:16):**  development?  Exactly.  Yeah.  So when we're looking at companies, it's both sort of what's the future potential of that  company?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:04:23):**  And then a little bit we're looking at sort of where's Bayer going to be in five years  or seven years when this company is more mature?  Is there going to be some kind of strategic overlap or is there going to be a reason ultimately  that maybe Bayer might want to buy that company?  I think that's always the biggest win for a corporate venture investor.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:04:39):**  You're looking to make investments that ultimately your parent company acquires.  I think that's true probably for 99% of corporate venture investors, whether you're in agriculture  or digital media or anywhere.  That's sort of the big strategic win at the end of the day.  But you're looking at that from the perspective of not really sort of what is my parent company's  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:04:58):**  business and strategy today, but sort of how could that evolve over the future as all these  other technologies emerge and different strategic decisions are made?  You sort of have to look at the future of possibilities for both the potential portfolio  company and the parent company itself.  How do you do that for the early stage companies who are still trying to kind of figure themselves  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:05:19):**  out?  I mean, how do you chart that path to ultimately becoming a strategic fit?  Yes.  Good question.  Probably no simple answer to that, at least in my mind.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:05:29):**  I haven't figured out a simple answer to that in 10 years in corporate venture capital myself.  But I would say it's a lot of the standard tropes probably that you see in venture capital  in general.  If you look at even the past major acquisitions in ag tech over the past 10 years, they all  have great teams.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:05:46):**  So I know that's a little bit of a cliche, but it's true.  You've got to have great teams that can help the companies move through all of the challenges  and make the right decisions in the face of uncertainty.  So that's a must-have, I think, for a good relationship to happen over the 5 to 10-year  timeframe that you are going to be in that business relationship if you're an investor  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:08):**  in a company, especially in a startup company.  So that's one thing.  And then there's, of course, technology and barriers to entry.  I think it helps when you have a unique value proposition, like a unique story, and you're  doing something fairly unique in the space.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:22):**  Once again, looking at the history of the bigger ag tech acquisitions, my own observation  is that it's usually been the first mover or the first company to be mature in a space  that's really been ending up in essentially the most valuable acquisition.  So it's usually that first mover tends to be the big winner, I think, in ag tech, at  least so far.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:44):**  And I think a little bit that's because at that, earlier on, they had unique value propositions  and unique stories.  So I think you're looking for a great team, unique value proposition.  It's got to be defensible, of course, and create a little bit of a barrier to entry  to keep competition at bay.  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:06:58):**  Yeah.  And it makes sense, the first mover advantage and getting rewarded for that.  But I wonder, the ones that come up behind them and still have success, I wonder why  we haven't seen acquisitions of some of those second and third tier movers.  And any ideas there yet, or is it still too early?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:07:16):**  I think, in some sense, it's early.  So I think I'd lean on that a little bit as a potential rationale.  But I think it's, in agriculture, we all know, we're all in this industry.  It takes time.  I mean, it's a massive industry just from a scale perspective.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:07:32):**  If you're a company selling products to growers that go on acres, the scale is inherently  massive.  And it's also very diverse because agriculture is so diverse.  Even looking at it, we have a lot of audience members from Australia comparing Australia  to North American agriculture.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:07:48):**  There are going to be incredibly different crops and practices and mentalities of the  grower and the risk aversion.  So you've got long timelines.  It's a classic.  It's seasonal.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:07:58):**  So really, each product has one shot every year to really prove its value.  So I think that lengthens the timeline.  And I think, at least for our sector in particular, over the last six or seven years, we haven't  been helped by high commodity prices.  I think that just sort of tightens everything, makes it a little bit more difficult for that  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:08:17):**  value to be realized by maybe the ag tech companies and also for the larger companies.  It's a little bit less of a growth period, so it's harder to look at sort of maybe higher  risk growth acquisitions.  I'd say that, but I'd caveat that there have been a reasonable number of acquisitions,  I think in the smaller range.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:08:35):**  It depends where you draw the line.  But sub-100 million, that's actually where you see a considerable uptick in the number  of acquisitions.  When we say strategic fit, for a company like Bayer, does it mean customer?  Does it mean expanding into new business units?  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:08:51):**  It probably can mean multiple things, but generally speaking, how does that usually  shake out?  I think this raises a couple of points.  As I said in the introduction, I think ultimately, we're looking for companies that would provide  new product platforms that could be offered to growers to create value in agriculture.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:09:08):**  That's really ultimately what you're looking for.  So you're looking for companies that would provide those, maybe access to new markets  where we don't have as much strength.  I think, frankly, for a company the size of Bayer Crop Science, it's probably a little  bit harder to find those markets, although they exist.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:09:22):**  Indoor farming being a perfect example.  That's a very nascent but high-growth market.  And currently, we really don't have a product offering for that market.  But ultimately, for me, it comes down to those kinds of products that could be offered by  Bayer in the future.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:09:39):**  There's a set of companies, especially I think at the digital ag space, where they might  be partners for Bayer or for any large agricultural company.  The caution there is I think a good customer does not necessarily make a good investment  for a corporate venture capital group.  So I've seen the tendency sometimes for companies to get caught in the trap of trying to be  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:10:00):**  the biggest customer of, let's say, Bayer or Bayer Crop Science.  And that ultimately shouldn't be the endgame for the company.  We want to be having a great product that could be offered to a much broader market.  That being said, I think it's helpful.  I think that's where corporates can add a lot of value.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:10:17):**  If you are a customer, they can provide good early feedback and be a good way to test the  market for ag tech companies, especially in the digital space.  Sure.  But you sure hope they grow beyond that, ultimately.  Yes.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:10:29):**  Yeah.  I think that's the challenge you see is sometimes there's almost a little bit too much on trying  to meet that particular customer's needs rather than trying to figure out what the broader  market looks like.  I think that's an important point.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:10:39):**  In fact, one of the comments I saw when we put this webinar out there was, well, companies  shouldn't be building just to be these big acquirers, best friend necessarily.  They should be building to create value.  And I agree with that.  And I think that's interesting to hear you say that's what you're looking for.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:10:52):**  Yeah.  No, that makes a lot of sense.  So I don't know how you look at it in terms of if you look at it like, oh, I have one  LP or I have no LPs.  But as far as the people you report to that are saying, here's where we want you to go  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:05):**  fine, are they pretty rigid with a Bayer would never go into X, Y, and Z?  Or are they pretty open like, hey, let's see where these things go?  I would say pretty open.  I mean, I spent nine years at Syngenta before joining Bayer.  And I could probably speak for both, at least maybe I'm a little more dated in my experience  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:23):**  at Syngenta.  But yeah, I think we're very lucky, I should say, in the corporate venture capital group.  We are allowed to push the boundaries a little bit.  And that's a great part of my job.  And one of the reasons I love doing what I do, because you are allowed to test those  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:37):**  hypotheses, even if they're still very hypothetical.  There's really not that much rigidity.  As I said earlier, looking at what does my parent company look like five or 10 years  from now, you've got to be within scope of that.  I think you can envision your parent company becoming completely different, like a social  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:11:55):**  media company over that time period.  So you know the strategic boundaries based on that.  And beyond that, you can actually test the boundaries.  And I think that's one of the rules of a corporate venture capital group, looking at companies  that may have never been envisioned.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:12:09):**  Often when you're developing investment strategy, you might say, OK, we're looking for digital  ad companies and biologicals and maybe new kinds of, let's say, new ways of discovering  chemistry.  As soon as you create those categories, I found, along comes a company in your deal  flow that breaks those boundaries up a little bit.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:12:26):**  And I think that's the job of a corporate venture group, is to help identify those companies.  And then help bring them back and figure out what is the right relationship for those kinds  of companies with my parent company at the end of the day.  Can you give us an example either from Bayer or from your previous job about one that pushed  the boundaries a little bit?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:12:44):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, there's one in our LEAPS portfolio.  And it was made by the Monsanto Growth Ventures team, which was Bayer obviously bought Monsanto  a couple of years ago.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:12:55):**  Both Bayer and Monsanto had corporate venture groups.  And we brought everything under one portfolio.  And it's a company called CoverCress in St. Louis, a really interesting company.  And I think it really does break the boundaries.  They're a company that's trying, they're using breeding and gene editing to convert penny  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:11):**  crests into a cover crop that would be grown between corn and soybean over the winter.  So it improves soil health and would be a source of profit for the growers, a third  crop in a two-year rotation.  And to me, that breaks a little bit the boundaries.  It's not a crop.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:27):**  It's a new crop completely.  So it takes time and capital and patience to develop.  And it's a little bit outside the core focus of a Bayer crop science, which is corn, soybeans,  major row crops.  And I think for me, that's one that's a little bit, that would never be developed internally.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:13:45):**  That would take patience and resources that just aren't present in a bigger company.  And I think it's a perfect example where you can incubate a technology or here it's really  almost a product and a concept externally and give it some time and give it some ability  to take a risk and fail a little bit.  And ultimately, that could be a really interesting, valuable new product that Bayer could offer.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:07):**  Or more importantly, that could be offered to growers in the future.  Right.  You mentioned the merger between Bayer and Monsanto.  How was the merging of the venture arms?  Yeah.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:17):**  So I joined last year about a year and a month ago.  And basically we brought together, on Monsanto, there was a portfolio of about 10 or 12 companies.  And then Bayer has also made, Bayer's got also a pharmaceuticals business and had made  some investments mainly on the pharma side, but a couple of investments in the agricultural  space.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:37):**  So we basically brought them under one team, one umbrella, one approach, largely pretty  smooth.  I would say personally, it just took me some time to get up and running and get to know  everybody.  So once again, if any of those folks are in the audience, I appreciate the patience given  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:14:50):**  as we, as I got up to speed and we built out our team.  But largely speaking, it went pretty smoothly.  And I would say, yeah, I think we tried to bring the best of both worlds to how we approach  making investments now.  So I think Monsanto really, within their ventures team, I think they had a great reputation  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:09):**  internally, great reputation externally, and built up a good portfolio.  Same on the LEAP side.  And so we've really, probably with more of a reputation in the pharmaceutical space.  So we've been able to bring that together in one team now.  Okay.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:21):**  And if I remember correctly, LEAPs by Bayer actually started by kind of incubating new  ventures of their own instead of going out and finding new ones.  So I assume you still do that.  And if so, when do you decide whether, hey, it's time for us just to build this from in-house  from scratch or go out and see what's in the market to try to invest in?  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:39):**  Yep.  So that's how, that was sort of the original approach of LEAPs.  And so we created a company called JoinBio, which is a partnership with Ginkgo to look  at making microbes that are able to fix nitrogen and generally provide benefits for crops.  I would say that wasn't necessarily a unique approach.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:15:55):**  I think once again, if you look at the sort of legacy Monsanto portfolio, we have a great  company called Pairwise Plants.  That is a very similar sort of a company created from scratch to really build the sort of best  in class gene editing capabilities for plants of all types, all the way from berries and  produce to row crops.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:11):**  Ultimately, it comes down to, I think, looking at what are the available technologies and  what do we think the technologies are that are going to be breakthroughs and paradigm  shifting.  So I think stepping back, I mean, looking backwards, it's a little easier to see those.  So you can see gene editing clearly being one of those synthetic biology, which Ginkgo  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:31):**  plays a large part in, is one of those.  On the pharmaceutical side, we have sort of stem cell technologies and gene therapies.  So you're looking at those kinds of sort of paradigm shifting technologies that we don't  have internal capabilities to do very easily.  And then saying, okay, are there companies who are working on this or do we want to sort  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:16:50):**  of create a company to focus on our specific market?  So it's a little bit of a search process and getting to know who's out there.  But I would say that's what I think we really look at both, just to be clear.  I think we're probably biased more towards looking at companies that are sort of in existence.  It's a lot of work to create new companies.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:17:10):**  And there are a lot of great innovators out there and a lot of opportunities to start  new companies out there.  So I would say from a supply and demand, there's plenty of companies out there innovating in  a lot of these spaces.  That being said, I think there are certain cases where it does make sense to start a  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:17:23):**  new company when we can bring something specific to the table potentially.  Sure.  Yeah, there's a lot of those in the audience here fighting the good fight.  Looks like our largest demographic is entrepreneur, 48% of attendees.  And so I'm sure they're wondering, if they were your portfolio company and they knew  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:17:42):**  that they wanted an acquisition, they thought, okay, going public maybe isn't for me, but  we could be a really strategic acquisition for someone out there.  What advice would you give them in terms of positioning there?  I would say, A, get to know the potential, who you think potential acquirers or partners  would be early.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:01):**  I would say another thing that's very helpful is it's getting back to this unique value  proposition.  Become known as the company that does X, right?  And be good about positioning yourself there.  I think when you're positioned in the minds of maybe the senior decision makers of those  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:18):**  companies as the company that does such and such, whatever your company is focused on  doing, that is very effective because it's a great way to get airtime and awareness built.  So I think it's very good and very helpful to build that awareness at that, it's called  the senior decision making level.  And to do that fairly early.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:35):**  I think one of the challenges in agriculture is that there's relatively few partners.  It takes time to test compounds and to test products.  All the big ad companies like to do that before they get too far along in, let's say an M&A  discussion or a big partnership.  And that takes time to do the seasonality.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:18:53):**  So you want to get that set up early and get into slotted into those tests that may need  to be done.  On the other hand, you don't want to do it so early that let's say you don't have the  formulation down or don't have everything quite so worked out.  That's a little bit the balance I think that comes down to the entrepreneur's judgment.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:19:10):**  And of course, get to know the corporate venture investors at each of the companies.  The M&A and the ventures, it's not firmly linked, but I always say, if there's an instinct  that you might want to say on the buy side, hey, this might be a company we might want  to buy someday.  I always say, that's a great, I love hearing that because then I know, well, that means  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:19:32):**  I can sort of check the box strategically.  This might be an interesting company to look at from an investment perspective.  That basically says everything I need to know from a strategic perspective.  So I love to hear that.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:19:44):**  And that narrative, positioning yourself for potential acquirers, is that narrative any  different than how you're going to position yourself to customers?  Do you need to kind of balance two different narratives there?  Yeah, I would segment those into two distinct things.  I think you want to generate growth and customer enthusiasm.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:20:00):**  So I'm thinking customers as growers here, but that might be a little bit fixed.  But I would say that is probably a distinct awareness and relationship that you want to  generate amongst the minds of the future potential acquirers.  And then one thing, maybe in terms of the advice, of course, I work at Bayer, I've been  at Syngenta, so I sort of think of now the big four.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:20:21):**  That's a big problem, I think, for the industry.  It's not so much a problem, it's a challenge.  I'd say all of those companies have been really focused on integration and all of these big  transactions.  I think it's just been hard to get mindshare, strategies have been evolving.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:20:37):**  But I also, just in terms of advice, look at the next set of companies they're acquiring,  they're interested in growth.  I think they see opportunity to have a more, perhaps, a different kind of offering.  FMC for me is always the company that comes to mind.  I know they just set up a corporate venture group that my friend Amar Singh just joined  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:20:57):**  from Wilbur Ellis.  So there's that tier of companies.  They're hungry, they want growth, and they may not be as distracted.  So I think it's worth looking there and getting to know those folks also.  Okay, that's excellent.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:12):**  I'm glad you added that.  And actually, that's a little bit where I was sort of going next here.  You mentioned earlier, there's been a fair amount of exits, maybe on the smaller scale,  that don't make the headlines because maybe they're not venture-backed celebration type  exits.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:25):**  You just answered part, really, this question in a way, or maybe you can expand onto that.  Why haven't we seen more?  Of the exits in general?  Of the bigger exits.  Yeah, of the bigger.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:36):**  I think it comes down, I think, probably it's going to be this industry consolidation, certainly  hasn't helped.  So that's been a headwind.  I mean, that's just taken up mindshare and bandwidth that previously existed.  And I think there's just been uncertainty on strategy.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:21:52):**  So it's been harder to make big bets.  Commodity prices definitely don't help.  I don't think that's been a direct headwind.  But I think those are the main drivers.  But I'd also say on the technology side, there have been not a huge number of companies that  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:06):**  have broken out and gained a lot of traction, let's say, in the digital ag space.  There are certainly a few, but it hasn't been, I think, just it's not a critique necessarily  to companies.  I think it will take time.  I think we just have to have a different timeline.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:21):**  When you look at digital ag, it's really got started in 2013, 2012, maybe a little bit  earlier.  First digital ag investment I made was actually in Australia in a company called Agworld when  I was at Syngenta in Perth.  That was very early in the days.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:34):**  But that was only for me.  That was eight or nine years ago.  I think Agworld had been around probably three years at that time.  So I think it takes time.  And I think we have to be patient.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:43):**  It's hard when you're comparing ourselves to the tech space and how fast things move  there in the more consumer-focused companies.  Right.  Well, you opened the door a little bit, and I can't stop thinking about it since you did  earlier when you said you talked about kind of indoor ag.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:22:56):**  Do you see potential opportunity in indoor ag for some big exits?  So in indoor ag itself, I'm probably not as much of an expert.  So I think that there's sort of a couple of different layers of indoor agriculture.  There's sort of the operations, which are somewhat farms.  Now, of course, they're very technology-enabled.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:23:15):**  I definitely see the opportunity for exits there.  I mean, how they interplay with the major big box retailers or for online e-commerce  retailers.  I think that's, for me, very interesting.  My own view on this is that the indoor farms can produce fresh produce, fresh vegetables  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:23:34):**  very close to the consumer.  I think that's a very important part of the grocery industry.  And getting that all right is very important for e-commerce, which is obviously a massive  industry.  I kind of see indoor farming a little bit as being almost like this keystone or like  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:23:49):**  a little bit of a linchpin for that.  It's maybe a little bit out there, but you wonder if that can be solved that makes grocery  possible, which then sort of creates more of a potential to win in e-commerce, which  is what's sort of my personal view on that space.  So I don't know.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:04):**  I could see that evolving.  OK.  Well, last question, and I'm going to turn it back over to Sarah and Jim here.  It always helps to look forward if we can kind of look backward and see the narrative  play out and then kind of replicate it.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:16):**  You know what I mean?  So when it comes to and also it's a rule, we can't have an ag tech webinar without using  the word disruptive.  So if you look back at the last decade in ag tech, which you've been instrumental in  sort of the ecosystem of the industry, what has disrupted the industry?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:30):**  Have we seen it anywhere?  And what makes you hopeful that we will, if not?  Yeah, I think if you look back in the last 10 years and focus on sort of North America  and Europe, I end up sort of with the same question, sort of where has this disruption  happened?  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:24:46):**  Where is farming significantly different than it was 10 years ago?  I'd say there's FieldView and a few other apps in the cab now.  And those are certainly helpful.  And yeah, I think those are those change the way agriculture is done in some ways.  I'd say if you want to look for the biggest change, it's not in North America or Europe,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:03):**  but in Asia and with the advent of a drone based spraying of crop protection.  And that has really taken off in Asia.  I don't have the numbers in front of me or specific growth, but it's in the millions  of acres, I think, when you look at China.  And it's in terms of market share, it's very big in Japan with Yamaha's autonomous helicopter  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:22):**  delivered crop protection.  And the reason there's twofold, or threefold really, it's probably smaller fields, harder  to access terrain for tractors.  And really, they're replacing the jobs of backpacks, right?  So going in the field and spraying with a backpack is not a great job to be doing.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:39):**  It's hard, it takes a huge amount of time.  And drones, I mean, that's classic disruption, right?  Drones coming in and sort of replacing that kind of job.  And that has happened at scale in Asia.  So we haven't really seen that in North America.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:25:52):**  But I think that to me, that just illustrates there is that potential for new, doesn't have  to be drone spraying, could be something else.  But that potential definitely exists for something to take off in a relatively short timeframe.  So that's what we're on the lookout for.  And I think, you know, if it's not that it could be something else.

Derek, I really appreciate this.  Those of you tuning in, if you're like me, you've got about a dozen more questions for  Derek.  But thank you so much, Derek.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:26:20):**  And I'll turn it back over to you, Sarah.  Awesome.  Thanks, Tim.  So I am thrilled to welcome Jim Chambers.  Jim, you can definitely check out his bio online and I suggest you do it, which I don't  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:26:30):**  say lightly.  It is super impressive.  He is a truly global ag innovation veteran and expert with 30 plus years of experience  across everything from biologicals to weather to soil and crop modeling in something like  100 countries.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:26:44):**  But to give you a quick snapshot, he's had leading roles in both startups and corporates,  which is kind of unique and exciting.  So on the corporate side, Jim led global product and technology management for the irrigation  and specialty crop businesses at Deere.  He was also the U.S. director of marketing at Bayer Crop Science, leading go to market  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:27:02):**  for multiple businesses, including crop protection and biologics.  And then on the startup side, Jim was CEO of Australian ag tech startup Observant, leading  the U.S. expansion and ultimately the acquisition by Jane Irrigation.  And he was also the senior VP and general manager at ITERIS, leading the clear ag business.  Now, Jim, if that wasn't impressive enough, is the president and general manager of the  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:27:25):**  worldwide ag business at Trimble, which we'll of course talk a little bit about right now.  The last thing I'll say is that a lot of corporate ag bios actually would talk a lot about the  dollars and the size of the industries and things like that.  But Jim's bio, I was really pleased to see, talks a lot about farmers and really talks  about how his whole career has focused on helping farmers around the world to optimize  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:27:46):**  yields and quality and profit.  So with that, Jim, thanks so much for joining us.  Thank you.  Thanks for all the kind words.  The only thing that you left out is really, I'm just a simple farm boy from Ohio, but  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:28:00):**  you have to get a plug in there for the Ohio State University where I did my undergrad.  So that's as important as anything that you said there.  Fair enough.  Cool.  Well, thanks, Jim.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:28:11):**  I want to start out maybe with the kind of high level view from the Trimble perspective  in terms of your kind of thesis around, I guess around this space, like what does agriculture  look like in 10 years from Trimble's perspective?  And then we'll get into maybe how acquisitions play a role in that.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:28:29):**  So at Trimble, we're really focused around, our tagline is change the way the world works.  And we're trying to bring together this area between the digital world and the physical  world.  And so when we think about ag tech and as we're looking at it, we're trying to figure  out what can we do, what do we need to do to make it more efficient, more effective  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:28:53):**  to plan whatever work you need to do, and then execute that activity and get that information  back to analyze how effective was it, whatever you did.  So from a Trimble perspective, we're heavily focused looking.  We obviously think there's a lot to happen in autonomy and then activities around the  efficient planning of activity that's going to be more and more important in the autonomy  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:29:19):**  space.  There's a lot going on in agronomy.  There's a ton of stuff obviously going on in genetics and biologics.  And Derek was talking about that.  Those are important for us to watch and understand what's going on because it'll have an impact,  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:29:32):**  but we're really more focused around how can we most efficiently execute the work orders  and the actions that need to occur across any color.  So color agnostic, whether that's red, green, blue, we're trying because we know farmers  very, very few are exclusive one way or the other.  So whatever we do needs to work under multiple platforms.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:29:53):**  Do you see a shift at all?  I think this is a question on many people's minds in terms of the business model that's  characterized equipment in the past, kind of selling large equipment through a channel.  Do you see that changing at all?  We do.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:30:08):**  Well, certainly we talk a lot about it.  I don't know that in the foreseeable future, I don't know that I see massive disruptions  in the channel in terms of equipment being sold.  Obviously, so it's going to be interesting coming out of the whole COVID scenario.  We spent a lot of time talking about e-commerce and we expect more and more to go towards  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:30:30):**  e-commerce, but yet e-commerce as a whole hasn't been overly adopted in agriculture.  Probably not on a broad basis, but I know Bayer has got a lot of effort around e-commerce.  It's a little harder when you start talking about equipment and or technology that needs  to be bolded on equipment.  But the other thing we're looking a lot at, and a lot of people are talking about, how  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:30:52):**  can we go to more of a hardware as a service or as we call it, everything as a service.  So now you're taking that equipment and taking it from a capital expense and moving it to  different parts on the T&L statement.  And I do think we'll see more and more paying for a service as opposed to just an outright  capital expense.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:31:18):**  And you mentioned both the increasing role of agronomy and biologicals a second ago on  the agronomy side in that kind of decision making process.  How do you see, is it a changing role of the advisor?  Is technology taking more of that and the role of the agronomist is changing?  Or how do you see agronomy and the role of the agronomist evolving?  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:31:37):**  Yeah, so I've been a part of this conversation for a long, long time.  So I started kind of my first days in the true ag tech space with Bayer back in 2006.  And we were wrestling with that question back then.  And I think it's still my position, I think is still true today.  And that is, our goal is to put tools and information in the hand of the agronomist  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:32:00):**  and the farmer to help them make better decisions.  I don't necessarily see us in the short term and even the midterm to actually take over  and automatically make those agronomic decisions.  But we are going to provide tools that are going to help the agronomist.  So yeah, I think the agronomist can elevate their game and step up, take on more acre  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:32:21):**  with better information.  But I don't think we're certainly not looking to replace the agronomist or tell the farmer  automatically what to do.  We just want to give them better information to do their job better and more efficiently  than they can do it today.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:32:34):**  And on the biological side, one of the terms we hear when people talk about biological  solutions is that they can often be seen as magical plant whispering juices, that no one  kind of knows how they work and how they're going to scale and what's their shelf life.  How are you seeing that space evolve?  Yeah.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:32:51):**  So the biological world, I'm a huge fan.  Obviously I was part of the early startup of AgRequest.  And then of course, unfortunately I left AgRequest before bare bottom for $500 million.  I should have stayed, but I didn't.  But look, the biologic space is very exciting.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:33:11):**  It's easy to poke fun at.  Sometimes people want to talk about snake oil and other things, but there's a tremendous  place for biologics.  But the thing about biologics is, and so much of what we're doing is you got to look at  it in the entire program.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:33:26):**  People want to evaluate it against the super high power synthetic products and say, show  me point blank, is this better than the synthetic?  But it's really about understanding where does it fit in the program and is it fitting  in the program?  There's a variety of reasons why that fits in.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:33:40):**  And if you can look at it in that program, I think there's a huge, huge place for that.  I also think regenerative agriculture is a hot area and maybe this will be controversial,  but I put it somewhat into a similarity to organics in that, first of all, I believe  farmers are sustainable inherently in nature.  They probably care more and do care more about the land.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:34:05):**  And being a farmer, you want to hand things down to your children and your children's  children and you're naturally going to take care of the land.  So I think it's bred into us to be sustainable.  But so to go to extra levels in regenerative organics, or there's a place for organics.  There are going to be some places that are truly going to be able to capitalize and do  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:34:22):**  more and more in the regenerative agriculture area.  But that doesn't mean everybody's going to be able to do that right away.  So it's getting it in the context of where does it fit?  Where does it go?  But I'm not going to tell somebody, I don't tell everybody, oh, you got to be organic  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:34:36):**  or you absolutely have to be doing certain practices.  I think there's fit for it.  Yeah, sure.  I really like this theme of how does the technology or the innovation or the startup fit into  the whole farming system.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:34:50):**  And I imagine that one of the exciting things about ag tech and the capital coming into  this space is that we're getting entrepreneurs who maybe haven't come from agriculture coming  in.  But one of the challenges is that they might not understand how that whole system works.  So when Trimble is thinking about an acquisition and you've got a startup sitting on the other  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:35:07):**  side of the table, I imagine that's one of the things you're looking for, obviously.  How does their innovation fit in the whole system?  But what else are you looking for when they sit across the table from you?  Yeah.  So, if you're looking at a company, unlike what Derek was talking about, some of the  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:35:21):**  things that he's looking at technologies and maybe they haven't even got a product yet  or they're not quite as far along.  If Trimble is looking at a company, we really are looking for opportunities that are going  to drive revenue to the business pretty quickly.  So, it would be rare for us to buy a company that we need to spend another three or four  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:35:40):**  years' worth of engineering or development work before we have a product.  So, we tend to look at things that are commercial or have great, at least commercial examples.  Maybe it's not been fully scaled, but definitely it's been on farms and it's there.  So, when we look at something, we look at the technology and make sure, kind of a quick  glance to say, does this make sense?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:36:02):**  Does what they're saying make sense?  And then, we tend to assume, in the early stages, we'll validate this later on, but  we tend to assume that the technology, they're right about that.  We think they're pretty good at that.  And I don't worry so much about the technology and does it work.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:36:15):**  I'm just going to assume it does work.  As you're telling me, it'll work.  And then, I'm more interested in the go-to-market.  Now, by the go-to-market, I want to understand, first of all, is this a standalone product  or is this going to be embedded in something we already have at Trimble?  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:36:30):**  Is it going to get bolted onto a solution we've got?  And is it solving an important problem or a critical problem for the farmer?  And the difference meaning, there's lots of stuff that's important.  The critical stuff are those two or three things that you wake up in the middle of the  night on or when you get up in the morning and you're making your notes on your piece  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:36:48):**  of paper what you're going to do.  The critical stuff is what's at the top.  We're most interested and most excited and get most energetic around if it's solving  one of those critical problems.  And so, is there a clear path to monetizing that?  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:37:02):**  What's the revenue stream?  In other words, are you replacing something a farmer is already going to do?  Are we going to save the farmer money?  And these times, that's an easier sale than, oh, we're going to make you more money to  the farmer, but you're going to have to invest a while and you're going to have to trust  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:37:16):**  me and believe me that we're going to increase your yield.  There's exciting stuff there too, but that's harder to sell.  So, I'm trying to look and understand more of the go-to-market piece and how much of  that do you know or what are your theories and theses at least and where does that resonate?  And then, we'll come back to the technology again and make sure to validate it, but I'm  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:37:34):**  not going to get caught up on the technology early on.  Yeah.  I love that.  It's really tempting for someone who's passionate about the thing they've built to talk about  the thing they've built, but talking about the market and the value it creates is obviously  
**[0:37:45-0:37:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:37:45):**  much more important.  Where do you look, Jim, for these companies?  Well, yeah.  So, we don't have a growth ventures arm, but we certainly do participate in a number of  the normal ag tech conferences.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:37:59):**  Trimble has been a serial acquirer.  Our corporate office is in the Silicon Valley.  Even though the ag office and the mensch of our presence now is outside of Denver.  So, the short answer is we look a lot of places.  Sarah, there's a variety of areas you can connect.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:38:17):**  But again, we tend to be looking at things that are in the market and that we're seeing.  So, our dealers will come across things.  And agriculture is not that big.  I'm looking at names that popped up even out here and it's amazing how many people I know  and have crossed paths with and connected.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:38:34):**  So, it's not that hard to really connect in the ag world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a funny one.  I think we all probably are one degree or two degrees of separation from the 200 plus  
**[0:38:45-0:38:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:38:45):**  people on this call all over the world, which is pretty cool.  There's other ways for companies obviously to get involved between kind of early stage  investment and full acquisition.  And you guys have the Trimble Select program, which I think is pretty cool.  Maybe talk a little bit about that as a kind of middle step there to get to know each other  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:39:01):**  a bit.  Yeah.  So, Trimble Select is a thing that we do that I think is really, really cool.  Trimble Select is a chance for us to develop a relationship with an ag tech company that  has a commercialized product.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:39:15):**  And in that scenario, we don't do this with everybody, but the simple concept – and  I'll come back to the simple concept – is we will open up our global dealer channel  and bring a product or technology in under the Trimble Select program, where then we  will sell those products or market those products through our Trimble channel.  And we provide, depending on the company, it depends on how engaged we are and whether  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:39:43):**  we're physically buying and moving the product ourselves to our dealers or whether that works  direct.  There's a number of different avenues to how we pull this off.  But it really gives us a chance to kind of date a company and get to know them, get to  know their technology, let our dealers get comfortable.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:39:59):**  So, we might do it on a geographic basis.  We might just start in the U.S. or we might just start in Europe or in Australia or Asia,  for example, and then expand it to be bigger.  But for us, what we look for in that is we're trying to help solve particular workflow problems  for farmers.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:40:18):**  And so, we'll look at a certain workflow area and say, hey, we've got a certain number of  pieces that work, but maybe there are a few parts that are missing that a startup has  got that we can add to to complete and make a more robust offering to the customer.  Those are perfect places for Trimble Select.  So, in some cases, we'll go out and look for those.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:40:39):**  Sometimes people approach us and say, hey, here's how we think we would fit into your  Trimble world.  And so, we don't really have a limit to how many people we have in a Trimble Select program.  And my experience has been through acquisitions, the vast majority of acquisitions that are  going to occur is that you've already got a relationship with that company that's doing  
**[0:41:00-0:41:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:41:00):**  the acquiring.  It's really, really rare.  If you have no relationship to that company, they're going to fork over at least any significant  amount of money to acquire you.  So, this is one way we have of getting to know those companies.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:41:14):**  Hmm.  I mean, it's similar to early stage investing as well, that you have to build that relationship  first.  I think the myth of I'm going to pitch and then I'm going to get a check like the next  couple of weeks is just not how the world works.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:41:25):**  And obviously, an acquisition is an even bigger decision.  I really like that concept, Jim, of aligning the strengths of the startups with the perhaps  weaknesses or gaps in what a larger company like Trimble can do.  And so, for the startups out there thinking about how your strengths solve or complement  or augment their weaknesses is really powerful.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:41:45):**  One thing you mentioned before, Jim, around coronavirus and COVID-19 and how things are  changing, is that changing your view of the market at all?  Well, yes, both short-term and long-term.  So, short-term, it's having a big impact right now.  And what are we thinking?  
**[0:42:04-0:42:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:42:04):**  How are we doing?  The big question we're trying to ask ourselves right now, is the recovery going to be a V,  a W, or a U, meaning, is the economy going to bounce back pretty quick?  We're right now preparing as if it's going to be more of a U-shape.  We're going to be down and see a recession for a bit of time.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:42:24):**  I hope we're wrong, but we're putting spending activities and investments that are very limited  right now because of that, with the goal to come out of this stronger than we entered  in.  So, there are certainly short-term activities, but longer-term, I definitely think changes  – obviously, I think this kind of thing is going to be norm.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:42:48):**  We're already expecting travel zero right now, and I think travel is going to change  dramatically.  We've actually pulled out of all trade and industry shows through the first half of 2021  right now.  And part of that is the safety of our employees, but part of that is to see how the industry  
**[0:43:05-0:43:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:43:05):**  is evolving.  We did something really cool last Friday.  We did our first virtual trade show put on by Trimble in Brazil.  It was purely pure Trimble, where we had 11 different rooms that people could come into.  We just advertised it on Facebook, WhatsApp, and social media.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:43:22):**  In 10 hours, we had 3,500 people come through.  Fourteen hundred of them actually signed up and gave us all their contact information  and wanted follow-ups.  We had people from tractors and pickup trucks calling in and saying, you know, hey, we've  not even been able to go to trade shows before.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:43:37):**  We love this.  And so, for those of you that are involved in shows and know that you get 3,500 people  come through, it costs us $1,500 to pull this off technologically, plus our people's time.  That was it.  So, to me, that totally changes how we're going to think about engaging the market going  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:43:54):**  forward.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So fascinating and super exciting.  I really hope that we continue to have the global connectivity we do.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:44:02):**  And even though we can travel again, we'll still connect internationally with the community.  One, I guess another kind of lens on the coronavirus crisis is that you've been through this before,  Jim.  So, you've been through a couple downfalls.  And on the startup side as well, what advice would you have for startups navigating the  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:44:19):**  uncertainty and downturn they're facing right now?  Well, the first thing I think would be make sure you're getting yourself in a position  to be in it for the long haul.  This could last a while.  And so, it depends on your funding situation, but now is probably not the time to go crazy  
**[0:44:42-0:44:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:44:42):**  and spend.  It's a chance to figure out what's really core to your business and focus in on absolutely  what's core.  A lot of times when I'm involved with startups, the biggest challenge is they're working on  really, really cool stuff, but they're working on too many really, really cool things and  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:45:01):**  you've got to narrow that down.  And so, I would say now is a really good chance to pressure test that even more and figure  out what is that most important thing and focus there and maybe let up on some others  so that you can ride this out.  Because I know companies like Trimble and others, as excited as we are and as interested  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:45:19):**  as we are to engage, we're just not going to be in a position to be making acquisitions  and investments in the near term.  I hope that lifts quickly, but I don't know how long that's going to be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:45:31):**  The advice that we often give, and I think I probably stole this from someone along the  way is if you're a startup, list out all the things that can kill you.  And there are many of them, probably double digits plus.  Prioritize them and then only pay attention to the top two, maybe three because everything  else is going to be irrelevant.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:45:45):**  And I think that's exactly what you're saying.  And the big guys are going to be around through this if you can kind of hang on and continue  to add value.  Jim, one thing that's maybe not talked about as much around the hype of acquisition is  what happens when you actually start to get acquired?  
**[0:45:59-0:46:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:45:59):**  What happens after that?  Are you, you know, there's the kind of, you stay with the company, there's, you hand it  over and you're gone.  Aqua hires, like any kind of lessons or pitfalls for what actually happens once you've been  acquired.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:46:11):**  Yeah.  Well, there's, we could, we could talk a long, long time about that.  There's a lot of different angles to go down.  It's just a couple of points I would make is, you know, first the dating process that  you're going through the acquisition is going to take some time.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:46:25):**  And so really think about and be aware of where's your, how's your company going to  fit into whoever's acquiring you?  If it's a technology that they're acquiring and then that technology is just going to  get embedded into their, their, their product lines, then once you get the technology handed  over and the know how handed over, you may, you may separate and pull back out.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:46:46):**  If it's actually more of a, more, more of a product that's going to fit into the product  line, I, you know, there, there's, it may that your ability to extract might look a  little bit different, but you have to realize that you're going to be, when you get acquired,  you need to play the company's game, not your own game.  And I'll, I'll explain that a little bit.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:47:05):**  I coach a lot of times, I coach our, our younger executives coming in and, and you know, they're  super, they're the hypo people that we're climbing the want to be the next CEO quickly.  And I always put business in the context of a game and said, you know, the way you, you  know, one of the things you have to be aware of is are you trying to learn how to play  the company game and play it better than anybody else's playing it so that you can be the most  
**[0:47:28-0:47:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:47:28):**  effective or are you trying to change the game, the company's game?  I said, if you're trying to change the company's game, that usually happens at the board and  that's a C suite.  And you can offer your opinions to somebody, but then you need to move on, learn how to  play the game better than anybody else.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:47:43):**  And I said, same thing applies to anybody that's being acquired.  You're going to have to learn how to play that, the company's game and figure out how  to navigate that and how to play that.  Don't resist it, play it because otherwise, look, you're going to miss targets.  You know, you're, you know, you, you, you pitched your business to the company, you  
**[0:48:01-0:48:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:48:01):**  know, you went out and you said, everything's possible and all of a sudden you get acquired  and now you got to answer to all those, those benchmarks that you, you, you set out there  and you're probably not going to make all of them.  And so learning how to navigate that is, is really, really, really important.  How about for any folks listening who are corporates, is Trimble like you've been quite  
**[0:48:22-0:48:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:48:22):**  acquisitive or are you guys a good acquirer?  What lessons do you have on the corporate side for how to be, you know, how to make  those integrations work, how to help those startups play, play the game as you acquire  them?  Yeah, well, so first of all, I've only been at Trimble since January, so I, but I, I'll  
**[0:48:37-0:48:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:48:37):**  offer my little bit, very extended, it bear a little bit longer, but you know, same, same  thing.  I can talk to other companies, maybe better.  You know, we're, we're probably like others.  Trimble has done a ton of acquisitions and I like to think we're pretty good at it, but  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:48:52):**  you know, we certainly have made, we certainly have made some mistakes and, and, and, and  have, you know, have, have some challenges.  You know, I think any corporation that's, that's making an acquisition, you too need  to recognize the amount of change that the company you're bringing in can tolerate, can  take it and having a, you know, having a clear plan and being just being transparent and,  
**[0:49:14-0:49:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:49:14):**  and you can't communicate enough.  The people being acquired are nervous.  They're trying to figure out what's going on.  They don't know they most of the time they want to be successful, but you know, maybe,  you know, the people, the company you acquired isn't on the inner circle.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:49:26):**  And so, you know, I, I think, you know, my advice really to anyone is communication,  but in the corporate world, you really, it's your job to be, be proactive and really engage  and pull that company in and, and, and listen, you know, talk to them, but then really listen  and understand what's going on.  So many of the squishy qualitative elements coming out.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:49:47):**  I think when people talk about startups and ag tech, it's like dollars and tech and turns  out it's actually relationships and humans and time.  And so I'm actually gonna put Derek on the spot as we kind of open it back up here into  more of a panel and some questions you were nodding along there, Derek, about the kind  of how to be a good acquirer and how to integrate startups maybe into, into larger companies.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:50:08):**  The squishy part is important, right?  The relationships form and the trust and yeah, that's probably at least the experience I've  seen by far the most important part.  I mean, it's not transactional.  There's people on the buy side that are really staking a lot of risk on, on advocating for  
**[0:50:25-0:50:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:50:25):**  it, right?  It's a big, usually a lot of resources going into it, but not just money, but team and  time and prioritization.  And so there's, you know, the nervousness on their side, but it also is sincere earnestness  to make everything work and same on the, same on the company that's going to be acquired,  
**[0:50:41-0:50:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:50:41):**  right?  Do you see that play out?  And it's, it's nice to see, I mean, all these relationships form and people figure out their  ways of working and it, but that is, that is incredibly important.  So as I, I often forget about that.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:50:52):**  It's probably, I probably need to, to remember to think about those kinds of things more,  but it's, that is one of the biggest parts of the formula.  It's true in venture capital too, right?  You're making these longer term investments and you've, you've really got to build that  relationship with the company.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:51:06):**  And I often find just one more point, so to go on and on, but pent up all these thoughts,  thoughts in my head in the last half hour, but it's often those discussions, you reach  these difficult points.  And I always say it's, it's just natural to have a difficult point in negotiation.  I mean, you sort of see how each other reacts longer term.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:51:22):**  I think that always helps with the trust building.  Cause if you can work through that, then you sort of set a better stage for a good working  relationship.  Yeah, totally.  It's not until you get into the trenches and go through hard stuff that you can really  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:51:34):**  see the relationship when we're all on podcasts and panels together.  We're friends, but you have to get really into it to figure out if the longterm can  work together.  Tim definitely jump in, but I might, I might ask one of the questions from the audience  that I'm really curious to hear the answer to and curious for both of you.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:51:49):**  So there's a bunch of non traditional players entering the ag space, you know, Google, Amazon.  Do you guys see that as positive or competitive?  How are you working with them?  Maybe, maybe Derek, you want to start and then Jim?  Sure.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:04):**  Personally, I see it as a net benefit, right?  I mean, it's potential acquirer, it drives innovation, you know, that could help seed  more capital and more entrepreneurs coming to this space.  So yeah, that's a holistically, I see that certainly as a net benefit.  I would say it's probably still early days, but yeah, there's places like indoor farming,  
**[0:52:23-0:52:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:23):**  like I mentioned earlier, where you may see some of them take certain positions, but it's  yeah, I don't have to crystal ball to see where exactly how exactly that will play out.  But I do think largely speaking, you know, advent of digital technologies and tools,  just at a high level, those can replace the jobs being done on the field by other products.  So I think it's, it wouldn't be surprising to see new entrants in the market.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:52:46):**  And I agree with with Derek, we certainly I think it's good.  I think it's great in terms of that coming in that it's such a woven ag, such a woven  field, that you asked Sarah, do I see a competitor or partner?  And the answer is yes, you know, we see, but you know, certainly they could be competitors.  But more often than not, I think we see it at least a company like Trimble and I'm sure

You know, there's places where you would absolutely partner together and there's other places  where it could compete.  But I think we need more people coming into agriculture, not less.  We have a question from Lee Adams Haley about some of the recent acquisitions that we've  
**[0:53:27-0:53:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:53:27):**  seen in the less than hundred million dollar range.  Maybe are you guys see seeing that as a trend that there'll be more kind of buy them earlier  quicker but maybe for a bit less money or how are you seeing that that space play out?  I would agree.  I mean, I think that has been an actual trend and sort of the M&A space.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:53:45):**  I think one of the challenges has been a lot of in the venture space, the company is raising  money from venture investors.  You know, valuations have been pretty high.  That's not just true of ag tech.  It's just that's hit the whole venture capital space for the past seven to nine years, I  
**[0:53:59-0:54:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:53:59):**  would say.  And I think frankly, that's probably priced a lot of acquirers out of the market.  It's just really hard to look at acquisitions when there's investors investing at valuations  that are, they're not necessarily unwarranted.  They just will generate, you know, it's a much harder question to look at potential  
**[0:54:16-0:54:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:54:16):**  M&A at much higher valuations.  I think it's just been easier to look at some of those opportunities, I think, that are  maybe smaller value.  Maybe companies that have bootstrapped haven't raised a lot of money, so they're not sort  of tied to having to get a large valuation.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:54:29):**  The high valuations of the venture space are a little bit coming back to haunt certain  companies now because it's harder to raise money when you've got a high valuation expectations.  You've sort of limited the supply of investors who might be willing to invest at those valuations.  So it's just hard.  It locks you in a little bit and you're a little more sort of in some sense leveraged.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:54:48):**  So I think that's a little bit why you've seen this, more this trend to M&A at maybe  a little bit earlier stage.  Yeah.  Anything to add, Jim?  Yeah, I agree.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:54:57):**  When we look out there, we certainly made some very large investments or acquisitions,  not so much in the ag space as maybe some of the other spaces that Trimble plays in.  But when I'm looking at the commercial companies and the products that we're looking for, it's  hard to find a company that truly has the scale yet that warrants that those kind of  $100 million valuations.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:55:18):**  I can find a lot more in the sub-50 range and it just seems like it's a little easier,  less risky acquisition because we get north of $100 million.  It's a big deal.  And for somebody like us that's looking for commercial, you're going to have to have been  in the business for a while.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:55:40):**  And this gets back to a question we had from Friedrich, which is, how have valuations changed  in light of everything that's going on?  Friedrich asks, how do you see this COVID-19 impacting investing in ag food, ag tech?  But I'm just curious from a valuation standpoint, since we're on the topic, have we seen valuations  change?  
**[0:55:56-0:56:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:55:56):**  Do we anticipate seeing them change?  I can jump in first, unless you want to go, Jim.  No, go ahead, Gary.  It's been probably just too soon now.  I mean, it's been, I think, as like mid-March is the period when everything, people's perceptions  
**[0:56:11-0:56:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:56:11):**  started to change.  That was when we, the S, we were traveling up the S curve there.  So I wouldn't say it's changed, but I would expect it to.  And I think of the capital markets as like a series of waterfalls.  And it's not that the venture capital investors, I mean, they have just as much money as before.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:56:26):**  The funds are all funded.  But at the very, what I would call the top of the market, private equity funds that have  companies that operate and maybe have previously didn't have cash needs, maybe they have cash  needs now.  So those funds are sort of more reserving cash and capital for those companies.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:56:43):**  It all trickles down.  And I think it will impact ultimate sort of the supply of capital in the venture capital  space.  So I would say it hasn't happened yet, but I would expect it to, to an extent.  And it's hard to quantify that extent.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:56:59):**  So that's sort of a, that's one effect.  And then there's of course the sort of the primary effect of how the world will change  after this, which could impact growth rates of companies and sort of the expected multiples  ways.  Yeah, we could only begin to speculate here, but there's that more direct effect of sort  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:57:14):**  of how does the world change, which obviously could create some opportunities also.  There's a question from, from Christopher in the audience that I'm actually really curious  about around the role of advisors and investment bankers in making introductions or helping  with these transactions.  I know in our, in our venture fund, we're, we're a pretty firm no on, on advisors.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:57:32):**  We want to work with the founders.  We really believe in, in speaking directly with those founders, but I'm curious how,  especially in those later stages, Jim, you see it and Derek, do you see a kind of good  role for those advisors there?  Are they adding value and helpful?  
**[0:57:45-0:57:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:57:45):**  I would say, you know, we prefer to work with the founders, but the reality is many times  there are advisors and brokers that are involved and make those introductions.  And many times there is a lot of value there because the founder may not be, you know,  have the, the, the background of the position to truly put the pieces together, but in a  form that, that, that, that we need.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:58:07):**  So it can, they absolutely can add value to the deal.  But if, if we're aware of the company and we, we, we know them, you know, our preference  would be just to just work directly with the company.  Yeah, I would say so, especially in venture investing.  So when you're making just the investment in a company, that's then you don't want an  
**[0:58:26-0:58:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:58:26):**  intermediary, right?  You want to, you want to work, build those relationships.  So I completely agree.  I think it does, advisors, I want to be clear, are very helpful, I think, for positioning  M&A strategy and in the negotiation and structuring, I think, more complex, larger deals that can  
**[0:58:42-0:58:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:58:42):**  often be outside the expertise of the entrepreneurs.  That being said, a lot of venture firms can help offer that also.  I've seen venture firms that have people sort of that are dedicated that, that can help  lend that expertise.  Switching gears a little bit in the chat here, another question from Luis Hernandez.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:58:57):**  He's saying a lot of startups in the biological space focus on specialty crops initially.  And he's asking, do you really want to see them go on to more broad acre crops in order  to get the traction they need to be of interest?  No, I mean, maybe this is a simpler answer.  I would say no, I think, I mean, the market really is good for biologicals and specialty  
**[0:59:19-0:59:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:59:19):**  crops.  So if that's, I think that would, that is more than enough to, to sort of look at.  And I think there's commercial interest around biologicals for specialty crops.  So that's, that's an easy answer.  It is, I think, as Jim was litigating, he's got much more experience than I do in this  
**[0:59:33-0:59:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:59:33):**  space, but it's, it is a harder, it's a harder ask, I think, for row crops.  So it's, you know, it's harder to find the value proposition for a lot of biologicals  in the row crop space.  But to be clear, the specialty crops are enough.  I mean, I think that's, it's, it's a classic sort of disruptive innovation, but that's  
**[0:59:48-0:59:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=0:59:48):**  where they can, they can prove their value in a higher value market, or maybe the traditional  chemistry is not as, may have more liabilities.  I want to build on that, not about biologics, but I agree with all of that.  But I think that's true for any, any technology.  Sometimes the specialty crop market is a great place to test new technologies because the  
**[1:00:10-1:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:00:10):**  value of that crop is, is so much higher in the, in the ability to pay maybe a little  bit more.  You know, if you're looking at a, you know, a acre of corn is worth what, $700, $800,  acre of strawberries worth $40,000.  So the difference, so from a Trimble perspective, we look at technology, you know, if you've  
**[1:00:29-1:00:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:00:29):**  tested it and proven it out on a micro crop someplace, but it's proven out in the field,  that's all that matters to us.  I don't need you to have proven it out on corn or broad acre.  If you've done it, that's great, but it's not, it's, it's not crucial.  I don't think it's so much about the crop that you've fruited.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:00:44):**  It's it's, we can make those connections from one crop to another.  It's just that it, you know, that you've been able to show value at the farm level.  I'll connect two questions here, one from Mike Zimmerman and one from, from Carl Lippert.  Mike was sort of asking, how far along are we in, in digital ag?  And you know, some of the narratives at these conferences we get are, we got to feed the  
**[1:01:05-1:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:01:05):**  world and agriculture is the least digitized industry.  And I think we all sort of roll our eyes now at that.  So what are some of the big problems to be solved?  And I guess to Carl's point, maybe more interestingly, what are you sick of?  Like what's boring, what's broken?  
**[1:01:19-1:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:01:19):**  What do you not want to hear another company pitching you?  Who wants to go first on that one?  Yeah, you can go Jim.  I'll say a couple of things and then I'll let, let, let, let, let Barry go.  I think the long term fundamentals for ag are very exciting.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:01:39):**  And it's one of the things that, that, you know, I get tired of, or that I get passionate  about is what can we do, or what are we doing to truly help farmers right now today?  And you know, if it's okay to talk the longer, longer story, but it's back to my important  versus critical, you know, and the critical stuff or the things that are impacting today.  And sometimes I even, even a tremble where we talk about connecting, connecting all of  
**[1:02:04-1:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:02:04):**  the equipment and getting all the data to flow into the cloud so that we can do all  this really cool analysis of what's happening in the field.  And yeah, that's great.  And a lot of people subscribe to that.  That's a nice vision, but what specific problem is the farmer facing today?  
**[1:02:19-1:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:02:19):**  In what key two pieces of the equipment do I need connected and data flowing so that  I can solve a specific problem?  Is it, you know, planting faster or better or the timing right or something relative  to spray.  So I think, you know, this is where the farm boy comes at me.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:02:34):**  Roll up our sleeves, just get really practical with the farmer and take care of what they  need, right?  Those critical issues they've got right now today and we can continue to work on some  of the bigger things over time.  I'll try to combine two questions here again, one from John Stewart and one from Kylie Frazier.  
**[1:02:51-1:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:02:51):**  How much do you guys work with the internal, like the other corporate divisions, whether  that's, you know, R and D corporate development to kind of make sure that you are fitting  in with the broader strategy and one of the challenges can be for startups.  If you do have an investment from a strategic, there's maybe a market perception that you  have to get acquired by them and others won't come in.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:03:14):**  So if you did see an early stage investment from another corporate, how does that play  out?  You know, if they're deeply integrated with one corporate strategy, maybe that puts the  startup at risk, but maybe it positions them more strategically down the line.  How do you guys think about that challenge?  
**[1:03:29-1:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:03:29):**  So I think in terms of how do we sort of work with other functions in the company, I mean,  it is more at the high, I would say sort of at a high level, sort of the strategic level.  I would say, as I said, we're not looking to sort of meet, fill the needs of Bayer today,  but looking sort of over that longer time period.  So it's a little bit looking in the crystal ball, trying to figure out how things evolve  
**[1:03:49-1:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:03:49):**  strategically.  We're trying to align at a high level priorities and agendas, but not, not probably more on  the tactics.  I think our group is, we sort of see ourselves as sort of very complimentary to the crop  science business.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:04:02):**  So if it's sort of, you know, look a little bit into the future and invest in companies  that could be a part of it in the future or a key part of agriculture.  So that being said, then you raise the competitor question.  And I think, you know, I speak from an investor perspective.  I think it's, it's generally, it's, it behooves the, the CBC groups or the corporate venture  
**[1:04:20-1:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:04:20):**  groups to set themselves up in a way and to operate in a way that does allow for other  strategics to come in, whether they're direct competitors or, or strategics from another  industry.  I think you'll see more opportunities that way.  It's a, yeah, I think it's better for the entrepreneurs and founders.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:04:36):**  And I think ultimately it's better for all, for all of the corporate parents to be comfortable  with that.  Yeah, I would just only, I agree with that.  I would just offer up from a Trimble perspective.  We're in a wide variety of industries all across the globe.  
**[1:04:51-1:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:04:51):**  If we've got a technology, it's going to be led by generally the opportunity would be  led by one of the business units, ag or construction or geospatial or wherever it would maybe it's  going to be the sponsor, but we would quickly involve the other business units and that  they would be part of the analysis and deal.  We thought there was technology to cross.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:05:12):**  I like this question here from Andrew Smith.  Is there a case for startups to engage in some sort of consolidation activity to position  themselves for an exit?  If maybe they're not getting a lot of interest, should they look at combining forces and making  themselves more attractive?  
**[1:05:28-1:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:05:28):**  I'll take a stab at first and say, well, yes, if there's, if there's clear value add, but  you know, I think if you're not getting, you know, as a startup, if you're not getting  the, getting traction, you have to really understand why aren't you getting, you're  getting traction.  And, and, and, and two companies are struggling to get traction just because you put them  
**[1:05:47-1:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:05:47):**  together doesn't mean that you're magically going to now get traction.  But if, if it's a matter of you've got a point solution and somebody else has got a point  solution, you can put those two point solutions together and get more of a complete solution  that gets closer to that critical need for the farmer than instead of just an important  need, then yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:06:04-1:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:06:04):**  That could, that could be, it could be interesting, but integrations are hard.  They're always more complicated and difficult than you think.  And so I would say yes, there's a possibility, but I tend to be a little more skeptical than  positive on just really being able to pull that off.  I would echo that.

And just getting everything to work out.  It's it's often something that looks like a good idea on paper and sort of, you'd love  to see happen in certain cases, but it's, it rarely, yeah, they're, they're actually  
**[1:06:40-1:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:06:40):**  surprisingly uncommon.  I was actually trying to think of some examples, but I've not many come to mind.  We have had a portfolio company, Plant Response, which is a biologicals company, really sort  of combine assets with Koch biologicals.  So, you know, Koch had acquired Mendel and sort of built up a biologicals business.  
**[1:06:56-1:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:06:56):**  That's one, one I'm very close to and aware of, but it's sort of, it's fairly unique,  I think, in our, in our industry.  You don't see those kinds of things every day.  Yeah, we, we've played around with like a mini private equity for early stage and like,  you know, there's a ton of models you could, you could look at there.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:07:11):**  I'm going to have one final go at a question here that maybe I would disagree on.  I've been trying to think of a question where you might, you might disagree, but, but I  think you guys are well aligned.  What's the role of the farmer in, in all this, um, in terms of, we've seen some interest  in, in farmers, you know, paying more attention to startups, working directly with them, maybe  
**[1:07:29-1:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:07:29):**  taking equity stakes, which was a question from, from Nico Lyons in the audience.  You know, should farmers be coming on webinars and podcasts like this to learn about what  the corporates are thinking in terms of acquisitions?  Should they be investing in startups?  Should they be investing in funds?  
**[1:07:42-1:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:07:42):**  Um, what, what's the role of the farmer in this ag tech acquisition space?  Yeah, no, that's a good, it's a good question.  I mean, there's sort of a multi, multi-prong there, right?  Should they be investors or maybe how involved in sort of maybe advising, right?  I mean, every company has advisory boards, but you don't often have sort of customer  
**[1:08:00-1:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:08:00):**  like, yeah, but sometimes there are companies that have sort of, uh, sort of their, their  alpha customers or partners, but it's not, it's maybe more the exception rather than  the rule.  That being said, right, a lot of technologies take time to develop.  So you want to sort of keep that close and keep that maybe with a trusted set of farmers  
**[1:08:17-1:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:08:17):**  or potential users to get the feedback and evolve the product.  Cause you know, you don't want to damage the trust and show something off too early before  it's ready.  But I think it's a good point.  I mean, maybe the idea of sort of this, this, you know, customer advisors or grower advisors  
**[1:08:31-1:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:08:31):**  for, for technologies, I think that's a key to, to have, you know, having customers that  can actually try the technologies.  Well, I know I, I agree with that.  I was going to say from a farmer perspective, I know, I think investing in those in technology  companies, you have to look at that as just, it's a, from a pure investment thesis.  
**[1:08:51-1:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:08:51):**  If you think it's a good, you know, it's a good financial investment or not.  But I do think I would advise farmers to, you know, to the extent that they can create  a friendly open environment that allow that that's friendly to technology companies.  You're going to see the early stage stuff.  You're going to have access to information.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:09:11):**  You're going to learn from people that you've never, you know, in a way you haven't been  able to do before.  And I've seen some, some companies, some large farming operations that have done this incredibly  effectively, you know, and they've always got the coolest, the newest stuff coming out.  Yeah.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:09:26):**  There's some growing pains.  There's some challenges, you know, give and take, but the learnings you get in the, the,  the diversity of thought that you get is incredibly powerful.  So it's great for the startup.  I'm speaking from a farmer perspective.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:09:38):**  I think you're, you're well suited to be, to be open and create that kind of a, that  kind of a relationship.  Awesome.  I love it.  We might wrap up there.  
**[1:09:48-1:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/5/6/ep-66-jim-chambers-trimble-and-derek-norman-bayer-on-agtech-acquisitions#t=1:09:48):**  I know just from my perspective, I want to say a big thank you to Derek and Jim.

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentic.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:06):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:08):**  We're on a bit of a streak here with episodes recorded live at recent events.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:13):**  I'd love your feedback.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:14):**  Are you liking the live events or do you want more interviews?  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:18):**  Reach out on Twitter or on our website and let us know.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:21):**  Today's episode is a panel discussion that happened back at the Evoke Ag conference in  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:26):**  February.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:27):**  I'm joined by three farmers, Sue Middleton, Brad Jones, and Mark Mortimer, who longtime  
**[0:00:32-0:00:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:32):**  listeners will have heard back on episode 28.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:35):**  Our chat covers the different techs they're using in their businesses today and their  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:40):**  technology wish lists for the future.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:42):**  What's driving adoption and what's preventing it, where the best AgTech solutions are coming  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:47):**  from, and how farmers like these guys are getting involved as more than customers of  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:52):**  AgTech.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:54):**  To have a bit of fun on the panel, we went with nicknames.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:56):**  Sue, aka Chilla, is up first giving an overview of her farm and the latest bits of tech they're  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:02):**  using.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:03):**  Hi, I'm Sue Middleton.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:06):**  I'm a director of a number of farming businesses in Western Australia.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:10):**  We have a broadacre farm.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:12):**  About 20 years ago, we looked at the climate change projections for Western Australia and  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:17):**  went hell, that is going to be pretty serious if that happens.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:21):**  Oddly enough, the thing that's been the most interesting is that it's already happened  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:25):**  and how well we've adapted.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:27):**  We decided to start a citrus orchard.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:29):**  As a result of that, we wanted an irrigated project.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:32):**  We wanted to diversify our risk.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:33):**  As a result of that, we've become citrus farmers.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:36):**  Then getting to my favorite bit of new technology, we have built a pack house with our partners  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:43):**  in the citrus business.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:46):**  We have this amazing technology that looks at every piece of orange that we pack 20 times.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:52):**  Then it goes out to whatever its grading is.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:56):**  Because we have that piece of technology, it's such a labor-saving device, but it also  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:00):**  enables us to grade our fruit really well.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:03):**  It's been a massive step up in the standard and how we're able to pack in Western Australia,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:09):**  which has also then enabled us to get into China.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:12):**  We're exporting into China.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:13):**  That's all been, just for us, a really big step up in technology.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:19):**  Next up is Mark Mortimer, nickname, Mort.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:22):**  I'm a sheep farmer, sheep breeder.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:26):**  I'm part of a family farming operation that's a mixed farm, so broad-acre cropping.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:32):**  My job in that business is mainly to focus on sheep breeding and the genetics side of  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:37):**  that.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:38):**  It involves a lot of data, a lot of data capture.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:41):**  Then we've got to turn that data into useful decision-making tools.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:45):**  That's where I spend most of my time and space and thinking, obviously there's lots of aspects  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:52):**  of that where we use technology to gather the data.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:55):**  If we're looking at my favorite ones, I guess they're the ones I'm currently working on.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:59):**  We're working on ideas that make the management of our sheep easier and tell me things about  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:05):**  the sheep while they're in the paddock.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:06):**  We've just put up a LoRaWAN gateway that's going to enable us to get sensors around the  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:10):**  farm and get live information back in.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:13):**  I've also just put in an automated feeding system for the sheep, which has made life  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:16):**  a lot easier.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:17):**  Finally, our third panelist is Brad Jones, aka Jonesy, also farming out in Western Australia.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:24):**  I farm about two hours east of Perth.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:29):**  Basically, the latest innovations that we've got introduced is we've got an on-farm Wi-Fi  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:33):**  system with networks.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:36):**  All of our weather data now is done spatially, so we have spatial rainfall maps, Holofarm.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:43):**  Temperature maps, Holofarm, subterranean moisture probes with our soil sites, which have been  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:51):**  mapped through EM and GAMA.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:53):**  We're trying to create now subterranean soil spatial maps as well.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:58):**  My favorite piece of innovation and tech is actually still sitting downstairs behind us.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:04):**  We've got a spawn bot hopefully we'll be turning up in the next few months.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:07):**  I can't wait to start using that.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:10):**  The connectivity system Jonesy mentioned is called Orego.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:13):**  It and all the other technologies mentioned in this episode are linked in the show notes.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:18):**  When we think about ag tech adoption and being a user of technology, what moves the needle  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:24):**  for you?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:25):**  How do you decide whether you're going to use a product or not?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:27):**  I guess in particular, where are tech companies doing well and where are they maybe failing?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:31):**  If I'm looking at tech that gets me excited that I'm interested in using, obviously it's  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:37):**  about my core business.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:38):**  It's about sheep.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:39):**  It's really easy to sell me tech that's going to make what I already do easier to do.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:44):**  It's really hard to sell me tech that you've got to get me to do another job to make it  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:48):**  work.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:49):**  Unfortunately, the livestock game has historically been here's some tech, here's some electronic  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:55):**  tags, here's an auto drafter.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:56):**  But in order to get a value proposition out of that, I actually have to do work I didn't  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:00):**  do before.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:02):**  That's a really big thing that I'm focusing on at the moment is to find tech that means  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:07):**  the data that I need to capture becomes a byproduct of management.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:11):**  That's where I want to move to.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:12):**  I think, say you brought in your cropping guys, that's already there.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:16):**  If you harvest your crop, if you're selling your crop, you can gather a lot of data whilst  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:20):**  you're doing the management jobs that you have to do.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:23):**  People are really keen to adopt that.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:25):**  Certainly in my space, that's where if you can find me tech that gets sheep data as a  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:29):**  byproduct of management, I'm going to be very keen to listen.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:33):**  If you want to do the hard sell and say, look Mark, if you do all this extra work, we can  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:37):**  make you more money.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:40):**  Not that interested.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:41):**  Yeah, that's a fine one to balance in, especially with really early companies who do need help  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:45):**  from producers, but also need to make sure they're adding value along the way and having  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:49):**  a strong value proposition.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:51):**  Chilla, how do you think about adopting tech?  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:52):**  Yeah, so for me the plan has to come first.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:55):**  I think the tech should be second.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:57):**  I think it's really important that you do your planning well first, otherwise you really  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:02):**  don't know how to assess all of the different possible options.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:05):**  From our perspective in Western Australia, we've spent a fair bit of time, and this is  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:10):**  how basic it is in terms of at the beginning, we've done a course called Paperless through  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:15):**  a group called Rural Edge.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:16):**  They're a not-for-profit farmer group.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:19):**  We've had an extraordinary take-up of this course, because you think people know how  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:23):**  to do everything digitally, but actually what you have to do first is get the farm office  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:27):**  online, and then after you get the farm office online, then you can get the farm online.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:32):**  And the drivers for it are actually the women in the business, because they want to have  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:36):**  a more efficient, they don't want to be sitting in an office, they want to be doing the stuff  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:41):**  that they love doing.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:42):**  They want more time with their family, or more time in the community, or more time drinking  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:46):**  wine with their friends, whatever it is.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:48):**  So it's also giving them the capacity to have an office they can carry with them as well.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:54):**  And techie people in the room would think, oh my god, that sounds like 20 years ago,  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:00):**  for many farm offices, they come along to the workshops, and people are still using  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:04):**  checks.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:05):**  So, you know, like, it is about helping and enabling people where they're at.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:09):**  So for me, it's the plan first.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:11):**  Morit, you were nodding when Chella was talking about the woman making the decisions and running  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:16):**  some of that office.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:17):**  Do you have anything you want to comment on there?  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:19):**  Any stories?  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:20):**  Oh no, she just described our farm model.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:22):**  The boys are outside, and the girls do the office work, and we are all digital, at least  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:26):**  in the office.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:27):**  And the second step is getting the farm online.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:29):**  So that's where we're working now.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:32):**  Another factor in technology adoption is confidence.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:35):**  And a big part of helping farmers be more confident is through the support that agtech  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:40):**  companies can provide.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:42):**  One of the biggest stumbling blocks for agtech adoption in the farming community is the confidence  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:47):**  of what we're trying to achieve.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:49):**  For the startups out there, it's about being able to give the customer the confidence that  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:56):**  what you're doing will be well supported.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:59):**  Nowadays we can support a lot of things remotely, but as farmers, we like to touch things and  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:07):**  pull things apart and rub up against them.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:10):**  And having feet under the desk is actually a really important part of it.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:14):**  So it's about building that confidence into the consumer market, which is us as farmers  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:19):**  as the consumer, and us as the farmers.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:21):**  It's about having confidence with the piece of tech that we're going to get.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:25):**  And as Chilla has already said, it's about having that plan that you can bolt it onto.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:31):**  So on the support question, how do you, when a startup or a tech company comes to you,  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:36):**  how do you assess if the support's going to be good before you actually start using the  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:40):**  product?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:41):**  My answer to that would be I talk to other farmers, and that's the most important recommendation.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:47):**  Trusted intermediaries are critical.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:49):**  So a person, like a startup just approaching you, that conversation, I mean we'd welcome  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:53):**  conversations from startups.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:55):**  We've been involved in the mentoring program in AgriStart program in Western Australia,  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:00):**  and that's what I'd call a good intermediary, because you get to sit in the room and you  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:05):**  get to hear the pictures and you get to know the person and you know what you're backing  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:08):**  then.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:09):**  And there is a real opportunity for farmers to be investors and to not be passive around  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:13):**  ag tech, and I think that's one of the critical things that Evoke has really created as a  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:18):**  conversation is farmers as investors, because that's what we've traditionally been.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:23):**  We've been the drivers of farm innovation, because for years and years and years, the  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:27):**  stuff that we get on our farm, that is the innovations, have been designed by partnerships  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:32):**  between farmers and another business.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:35):**  So it's not new, this is not new, it's kind of just like capitalising on that idea of  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:40):**  creating some kind of space where you can meet people and meet the startups and then  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:44):**  work with them.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:45):**  Yeah, I love that.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:46):**  I mean it's a really big thing that I'm passionate about farmers as more than just customers  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:49):**  actually get involved in other ways, and it might not be an investor, that might not be  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:53):**  something that every farmer can or wants to do, but it might be investing some time as  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:57):**  maybe an advisor or giving advice and tips.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:00):**  I think you've done, well you've both done a bit of that, but Mort you've done some of  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:03):**  that with a few different products.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:04):**  Yeah, I certainly have been involved with a few.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:08):**  In the early days I used to judge how good a startup was by how desperate I was for their  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:13):**  potential product, and that certainly in the early days, I had hardware at home that was  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:18):**  bought that the companies don't exist anymore, they don't support it, so it becomes a bit  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:22):**  expensive.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:23):**  So now I show strong interest and then I'll wait for them to finish coming to me, and  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:28):**  I try and make some kind of assessment about where they might go.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:33):**  And the ones that come back, then we go forward and we offer the support right through to  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:37):**  being the really early adopter and working on prototypes and having their software engineers  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:43):**  come to the farm and work through issues and actually get them, because they're quite often  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:48):**  people that have never been on a farm, in our case never seen a sheep, never given a  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:52):**  medication, and they get to do that for the first time and then go home and it's really  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:57):**  quite groundbreaking for them to then work through their code from a practical application.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:03):**  This is one of the really exciting things about AgTech.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:06):**  It's attracting new talent, new perspectives and new skill sets into the agriculture industry.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:11):**  This can of course be a challenge, but it's also an opportunity for farmers to get involved  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:16):**  earlier in the development process and in new ways, like as investors and as advisors.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:22):**  Jonesy has done a bit of both and has learned a few lessons along the way.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:26):**  I'm involved in AgTech both from an investment point of view and from a user's point of view,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:32):**  and I guess the motivation by being an investor in AgTech is your exposure to really quite  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:38):**  good equipment that's coming on stream, which helps us with our system and it's all about  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:43):**  de-risking ourselves.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:44):**  That's our primary objective.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:46):**  I've had good and bad experiences.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:49):**  Another one of the startups who's down at Startup Lane down there is in the crowd now,  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:53):**  so I'll give him a bit of a plug.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:55):**  I guess when we were sitting there discussing what we wanted to do and we're talking about  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:01):**  support, he said some of it's going to be online so we can do some of it remotely and  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:04):**  some of it's going to be face to face.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:07):**  Being a relatively new product, you're always going to have a few little glitches on the  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:11):**  way through, but it's been well supported both remotely and from people traveling out.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:18):**  And obviously now with distances and the cost of getting there, it's really hard to support  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:24):**  it by travel.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:26):**  So as much as what we can do remotely is better for everyone.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:30):**  The bad experiences, I guess with any new piece of tech that you're going to introduce,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:35):**  you're going to lose a bit of skin from time to time and you just have to understand that,  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:39):**  get up and keep moving and just keep walking towards what your objective was.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:45):**  Do you have an example of losing some skin?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:48):**  Well, we've only got another 22 minutes, otherwise we could be here for an hour or so.  
**[0:12:53-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:53):**  We through a friend of mine developed the first time precision planning bar in the world.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:01):**  And like when you say you're the first in the world, it kind of sounds really sexy,  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:06):**  but it's not.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:07):**  Because when there's issues, you've got nowhere to turn.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:10):**  You got to try to figure it out for yourself.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:13):**  And then there was some other issues that sort of came into play and it's just been  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:18):**  a really slow burn.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:22):**  The heat is intense, but then we've had good stories and really good ones as well.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:28):**  Like I'm talking about the aeration system that we've got now.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:31):**  That's an absolute success.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:33):**  Where it's created now, so we've got our solar system is a one man operation and you  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:38):**  can even do most of that remotely, which is good.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:40):**  I could do it here now.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:42):**  Mort, how about you?  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:43):**  You've played in this space?  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:44):**  Yeah, well that's, I'll tell a story about unintended consequences maybe.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:49):**  So spent a lot of time trying to make it easy for our customers to select rams.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:54):**  So historically you've got an animal and then we'd present them with page after page  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:58):**  of data on it, which is difficult.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:00):**  You had to explain what it was.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:02):**  So I actually read this book about the visual representation of quantitative statistics.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:08):**  It's a really good read.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:10):**  I can see some doubters out there.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:12):**  And it talks about ink to information ratios.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:15):**  So it's about getting as much information on a page with the least amount of ink.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:20):**  And it makes our brains easier to break it down and understand it.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:24):**  So I got the sale team ready and I spent a lot of time printing out these lovely sheets  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:29):**  for every single ram that was for sale and the fellow that sells our rams, after he's  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:34):**  made the deal, could give each one of these sheets out like a certificate or, you know,  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:38):**  it was a high end product.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:39):**  I wanted something to go with it.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:41):**  And the first customer he had came in, he explained how the sheets worked.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:45):**  The guy selected his rams and he just flicked through them with his thumb because it was  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:48):**  that easy to see good and bad parts of an animal.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:51):**  He goes, oh, oh, I didn't realise that.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:54):**  Oh, I didn't realise this.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:56):**  Next you know they're back down the yards.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:57):**  And the guy is re-looking for his perfect animal.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:01):**  And the guy that sells the rams was very, very polite, but he chucked that folder under  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:05):**  the bottom of the desk and he never bought it out again.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:07):**  And he said that was a great idea, Mark, and I think it's a good tool for us, but it made  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:11):**  it too easy for the customers to see each animal's weakness.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:15):**  So I changed the way our customers look at rams by changing how I display data.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:20):**  And it turned out that they all wanted a good average looking animal, not the most profitable,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:26):**  because I displayed it in that way.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:28):**  And it turns out it's actually a psychological impact.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:30):**  So the fear of loss is greater than the expectation of gain.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:35):**  So when they looked at that graph and they saw something that was negative, that negative  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:39):**  override all the beneficial economic things.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:42):**  So they're actually wanting animals that made them less money.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:45):**  So we had to go home and reassess, because I didn't want to abandon the idea.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:50):**  I didn't want to go back to the old way of keeping them in the dark and then just, this  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:55):**  is a good ram, mate.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:56):**  You'll be right.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:57):**  I love it.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:58):**  And sometimes the skin that you lose is time, is actual money.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:01):**  There's a lot of ways to invest in this space and lots of ways you can make mistakes.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:05):**  The other example that I'll maybe have you tell is around the voice tech that you used  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:09):**  and how you thought that would work one way and it didn't.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:11):**  Yeah, so when I was playing around with coding and stuff and gathering data, I thought it  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:16):**  would be really cool if we were in the sheep yards that we just speak all the information  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:21):**  to the computer and it records it for us.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:23):**  And I spent quite a while developing it and getting it to work and then practiced it and  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:28):**  rolled it out the yards and the old fella had a bit of a go at it and mumbled and said  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:32):**  a few words under his breath, went away.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:34):**  And then I started doing it.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:35):**  It turns out that if you're going to sit and talk for eight hours in the sheep yards and  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:39):**  the dust and the flies, it's terrible.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:43):**  It's actually quicker and easier with a mobile keypad and just a type.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:48):**  So you know, I spent ages trying to develop that and it just, and I was the user and the  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:52):**  developer and I still couldn't see that it wasn't going to work until we actually rolled  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:56):**  it out.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:57):**  So you know, I can see how startups can have what they see as an amazing idea and don't  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:02):**  just spend a few hours or weeks developing something but lots and lots of money and then  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:06):**  get to a user and they can make, that's no good mate, it doesn't help.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:10):**  I love that story also because we tell startups in all these innovation programs, you know,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:14):**  go talk to your customers and ask them what their problems are.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:17):**  And it's funny, right, because I think sometimes if they said what their problem was, you'd  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:20):**  actually potentially go down a path that's maybe not solving that problem.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:24):**  And so it's really about that relationship that you can build together and keep trying  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:28):**  things and keep having a go, which of course does take time but it is, you know, not just  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:32):**  one silver bullet or one problem, you can just say right away.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:36):**  I want to ask Chilla, where do you look for new innovations and in this world of ag tech  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:40):**  and new products, are you looking in different places than you've looked in the past for  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:45):**  potential things that can add value on farm?  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:47):**  Yeah, so we're big fans of travelling and looking and just meeting people and one of  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:53):**  the things that we're quite famous for is we go on these family holidays, which is supposed  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:57):**  to be holidays, and then we go, oh, what's that over there in that paddock?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:01):**  And then we drive in, we meet the farmer and then we end up staying there and then you  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:05):**  end up having dinner with their family and then you end up getting so many great ideas.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:09):**  So we're just big fans of wandering and being curious.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:14):**  And that for me, I mean, like I've got to say, I really love Evoke and what Evoke is  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:18):**  doing in terms of creating a community because it's hard for the creative people to find  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:23):**  each other and sometimes people are talking about something that's an entirely different  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:27):**  sector, but you go, oh, that's really interesting and because you can then kind of put it back  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:32):**  through your lens and then figure out how you can make that work in your business and  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:36):**  you just need people pushing you all the time because status quos the problem, like status  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:41):**  quos the enemy in ag.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:42):**  If we're going to grow ag to 100 billion, we've got to really actually find ways of  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:46):**  bringing new capital into ag and that means other people with other energies and other  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:52):**  ideas and I think it's really critical that we don't just stand still.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:56):**  That would be the worst thing we could do.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:59):**  Given this was a live panel, we also had some audience questions.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:02):**  This first one came from author and reporter Gabby Chen.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:06):**  I report on rural politics and every election I talk to farmers who say they are increasingly  
**[0:19:14-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:14):**  squeezed between the inputs and the food price and so I just want to know, is it right that  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:22):**  you've got to be kind of young, financially comfortable and have enough mental space to  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:30):**  bring about new ideas and change?  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:33):**  As the oldest person on this panel, yeah you can be old but you have to be hungry.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:40):**  That's my answer.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:43):**  Definitely the use of tech is about creating a better margin and that's just how economics  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:50):**  works and unfortunately in ag, the consolidation of farms shall continue just because as farms  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:57):**  grow your access to capital, your access to purchase ag tech, your bandwidth to be able  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:04):**  to handle the ag tech because you'll have structures in place, management structures  
**[0:20:08-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:08):**  in place, your ability to procure inputs cheaper than someone smaller than you just brings  
**[0:20:17-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:17):**  your unit cost lower and that's just economies of scale and that's just an everlasting type  
**[0:20:26-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:26):**  model in ag and from WA alone, in the last 20 years I've gone from 10,000 to 4,000 grain  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:35):**  producers and most of that's just been absorbed into other farms and that is just through  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:41):**  economies of scale and that will continue and I don't think we'll ever turn that around.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:47):**  It's actually an interesting one as well, this kind of consolidation and family farms  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:51):**  going from family farms to bigger family farms, there's a real opportunity for solutions that  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:56):**  have both the agility of a family farm but enough professionalism of what becomes a larger  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:02):**  family farm with more staff and more needs, more operational complexity and so that's  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:07):**  something that's maybe not as well served in the market and I don't know what you guys  
**[0:21:11-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:11):**  are seeing.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:12):**  Yeah and so when we bring that into context like our farms are all getting bigger so we're  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:15):**  going to have to start managing them virtually like the opening address yesterday was about  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:19):**  the fourth stage of this is the digital era.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:22):**  Well digital and virtual are hand in hand and we have to start managing our farm virtually  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:29):**  and obviously our access to labour is getting harder and more expensive which leads more  
**[0:21:35-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:35):**  down the automation road and then it's a vicious circle because our small towns are shrinking  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:43):**  and I'd like it to be really great to bring ag tech space out.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:47):**  There was a great article in the Finn Review about the Bates' up there in central Queensland,  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:52):**  what they have done and that would be great if all our little regional areas had a start  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:58):**  up that could pop up like that and bring skills and people back into the regional areas but  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:05):**  yeah, how do we promote that?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:06):**  I don't know.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:08):**  My view is that one of the most difficult things in farming is that by the time you  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:13):**  finish farming, so you have say 50 seasons, you're good at it and that's the problem  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:19):**  in farming.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:21):**  What ag tech does is it gives you the data and the information to become good at farming  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:26):**  in a lot less time.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:28):**  So my view on this is that this is actually the breakthrough, that this is the important  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:33):**  investment that will enable other people to come into agriculture and to invest in agriculture  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:37):**  and that's actually what we need and this is the platform.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:41):**  So the idea of getting 50 years of knowledge down to 5 years of knowledge, once you can  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:47):**  do that, you can really shake up the model of how we do agriculture and that's the  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:52):**  critical point because no one's got a lifetime to learn how to become a good farmer anymore.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:59):**  I'm really interested in the kind of balance and I don't know, Morten, if you have any  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:01):**  thoughts on if you're a fourth, fifth, sixth generation farmer, you have all this experience  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:06):**  of the land and understanding of what's been there and kind of intuition about what  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:09):**  it needs, balancing that with all these new data sources and new pieces of information  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:14):**  that you can ramp up quickly on a new farm or think differently about the current farm,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:19):**  how do you balance those two sources of information or two ways of using information?  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:24):**  I'm not sure it is a balance but I think both the points you guys have just made are  
**[0:23:29-0:23:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:29):**  really very valid and I hope people see them as opportunities as opposed to threats.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:37):**  Things of competition but essentially I'm getting to the point where I am trying to  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:41):**  digitally replace the 30 years of experience I've got at looking at sheep so there's  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:47):**  things that I can walk into a panic that every staff member I've ever had just cannot see.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:51):**  How do I replace that with valuable information that they can use instantly and I think you're  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:58):**  talking about turning that 50 years into 5 and it's a really valid point because essentially  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:02):**  you're without thinking about that but that's what I'm making, that's what I want  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:06):**  to try and do because it's very frustrating for me to walk past something and how can  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:10):**  that be not obvious and it's just a lifetime of experience and I now know what the old  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:14):**  man went through for the first 15 years of my farming life.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:18):**  I understand what all his grunts and groans meant now.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:23):**  What is your guys' tech wish list?  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:26):**  What are you not seeing that you wish existed?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:30):**  Funnily enough I was having a yarn to a mate of mine yesterday afternoon.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:33):**  He's in the cotton up in Gundawindi and he said like years ago when he was doing his  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:40):**  PhD all these things that we're talking about today were there but now they can actually  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:46):**  talk to each other.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:47):**  Back then it was all little silos of technology and data sources where now they're all interconnected  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:54):**  and that's how I think if we just continue down this road where everything is interconnected  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:01):**  we're on the right path, it's just refining that.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:05):**  So mine is really basic, it's connectivity.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:09):**  So we have to get to enterprise grade broadband in farming areas and if we don't do that,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:17):**  if we don't have the back all to enable us to do the adoption it is still just all going  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:22):**  to be talk.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:24):**  So we have to solve that, we do not have a solution that has ever emerged out of any  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:30):**  of the models so farmers are going to have to do it themselves?  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:34):**  So I have an immediate wish list of tech things that I want to get in and working but I think  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:40):**  if I go a bit further down, once I've got all those little pieces like we said we need  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:45):**  them all to work but I would like them to work smarter.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:49):**  So I already use fancy algorithms to help make decisions with sheep.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:53):**  There's a program out there called Ask Bill which is a tool that you put data in and it  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:58):**  helps you make decisions so I want all these sensors and data gathering things to have  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:04):**  a bit of machine learning for them that actually help me make decisions.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:07):**  Great question.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:09):**  Chill you were talking about collaboration.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:13):**  Very interested to know when you are wanting to try and solve a pain point in farming do  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:19):**  you naturally think of the local ecosystem trying to reach out domestically or is internationally  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:26):**  is it important to think about the international aspect as well in that?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:31):**  Yeah it's definitely both for us so the technology in our orchard, our water efficiency technology  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:37):**  was inspired by I'm going to say because we adopted some Israeli technology and then adapted  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:43):**  it for our own conditions.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:45):**  The software system that helps with this sorting and then tells us the price of every orange  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:49):**  that we sell, that's French technology.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:52):**  The sorting system comes from Spain so yeah I think for the most part actually when we're  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:58):**  going out there to look at the next incremental jump, the transformation in our business,  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:03):**  we're not getting it from Australia.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:06):**  And I actually think I learnt the reason this morning.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:08):**  I sat there and I listened to the conversations about how much we're spending, what our investment  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:13):**  is.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:14):**  It's just really clear to me that we're actually going to have to fund these ecosystems a lot  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:18):**  more and we're going to have to really kind of ramp up that investment if we are going  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:22):**  to catch up as well so that I will then in 10 years time be telling you all of those  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:27):**  great technologies in my life come from Australia.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:33):**  So as we head into the last couple minutes I would love to hear from each of you.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:37):**  So you guys are clearly leaders in this space.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:41):**  You're ahead on the adoption curve and really thinking deeply about this stuff.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:44):**  For anyone in the audience who's either in a similar spot or maybe not quite out as far  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:48):**  on the leading edge or the bleeding edge as it can be called, what would you say as tips  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:54):**  for any of the producers in the room to get more involved with or get more value out of  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:58):**  technology?  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:00):**  Okay, so as Chilla mentioned earlier, definitely have a plan.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:06):**  You've got to start with an objective and then you can just reverse engineer it back  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:09):**  out of there.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:11):**  Have the courage to change.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:14):**  It's not the easiest to do.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:16):**  Realise that there will be two steps forward, one step back, a couple of sideways.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:20):**  But yeah, as long as you keep your objective in mind and yeah, keep an open mind, you'll  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:25):**  be okay.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:26):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:27):**  You've got to have your plan.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:28):**  But I find once you've got your plan and you've got your goal, make the decision that I am  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:33):**  going to do that, even though you don't know what any of the steps are to get there.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:37):**  So it's very easy not to make the decision because you don't know how it's done.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:41):**  So you just think, I can't do that.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:43):**  So you make your goal and you say, right, I'm going to do that.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:46):**  And then start small steps and don't be afraid to ring people and seek help and to look for  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:51):**  it.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:52):**  And just keep moving along.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:53):**  And it doesn't matter how many branches or dead ends you get, eventually you'll find  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:56):**  one that gets to your goal if you want to spend enough time.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:00):**  And mine is that failure is learning.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:02):**  So people think that failure is a bad thing.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:05):**  It's not.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:06):**  It's just a real opportunity to figure out, oh, that didn't work.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:10):**  Okay, I'm going to tweak it and I'm going to go this way.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:13):**  And the other thing for me is just to say, wherever you're at, whatever stage you're  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:18):**  at, it's fine.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:20):**  Everyone thinks that you have to be really tech savvy.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:22):**  I'm not.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:23):**  I'm actually called the techno gnome in my family because Lizzie's sitting here laughing.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:28):**  I know so little about technology, it's not funny.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:31):**  I call everything a thing-a-me-bob.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:33):**  And I seriously don't know how stuff works, but it doesn't stop me from adopting and finding  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:39):**  the best.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:40):**  Yeah, I know.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:41):**  She's laughing because I really am absolutely technologically completely this big.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:46):**  So wherever you're at, that's a great place to be.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:50):**  And it doesn't mean that you can't find the best people to work with and just work with  
**[0:29:55-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:55):**  the best people you can find.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:56):**  Amazing.

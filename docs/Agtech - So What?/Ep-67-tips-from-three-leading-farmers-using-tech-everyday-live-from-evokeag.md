### Agtech - So What?  (2020-01-20)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentic.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  We're on a bit of a streak here with episodes recorded live at recent events.  I'd love your feedback.  Are you liking the live events or do you want more interviews?  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:18):**  Reach out on Twitter or on our website and let us know.  Today's episode is a panel discussion that happened back at the Evoke Ag conference in  February.  I'm joined by three farmers, Sue Middleton, Brad Jones, and Mark Mortimer, who longtime  listeners will have heard back on episode 28.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:35):**  Our chat covers the different techs they're using in their businesses today and their  technology wish lists for the future.  What's driving adoption and what's preventing it, where the best AgTech solutions are coming  from, and how farmers like these guys are getting involved as more than customers of  AgTech.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:00:54):**  To have a bit of fun on the panel, we went with nicknames.  Sue, aka Chilla, is up first giving an overview of her farm and the latest bits of tech they're  using.  Hi, I'm Sue Middleton.  I'm a director of a number of farming businesses in Western Australia.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:10):**  We have a broadacre farm.  About 20 years ago, we looked at the climate change projections for Western Australia and  went hell, that is going to be pretty serious if that happens.  Oddly enough, the thing that's been the most interesting is that it's already happened  and how well we've adapted.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:27):**  We decided to start a citrus orchard.  As a result of that, we wanted an irrigated project.  We wanted to diversify our risk.  As a result of that, we've become citrus farmers.  Then getting to my favorite bit of new technology, we have built a pack house with our partners  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:01:43):**  in the citrus business.  We have this amazing technology that looks at every piece of orange that we pack 20 times.  Then it goes out to whatever its grading is.  Because we have that piece of technology, it's such a labor-saving device, but it also  enables us to grade our fruit really well.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:03):**  It's been a massive step up in the standard and how we're able to pack in Western Australia,  which has also then enabled us to get into China.  We're exporting into China.  That's all been, just for us, a really big step up in technology.  Next up is Mark Mortimer, nickname, Mort.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:22):**  I'm a sheep farmer, sheep breeder.  I'm part of a family farming operation that's a mixed farm, so broad-acre cropping.  My job in that business is mainly to focus on sheep breeding and the genetics side of  that.  It involves a lot of data, a lot of data capture.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:02:41):**  Then we've got to turn that data into useful decision-making tools.  That's where I spend most of my time and space and thinking, obviously there's lots of aspects  of that where we use technology to gather the data.  If we're looking at my favorite ones, I guess they're the ones I'm currently working on.  We're working on ideas that make the management of our sheep easier and tell me things about  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:05):**  the sheep while they're in the paddock.  We've just put up a LoRaWAN gateway that's going to enable us to get sensors around the  farm and get live information back in.  I've also just put in an automated feeding system for the sheep, which has made life  a lot easier.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:17):**  Finally, our third panelist is Brad Jones, aka Jonesy, also farming out in Western Australia.  I farm about two hours east of Perth.  Basically, the latest innovations that we've got introduced is we've got an on-farm Wi-Fi  system with networks.  All of our weather data now is done spatially, so we have spatial rainfall maps, Holofarm.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:03:43):**  Temperature maps, Holofarm, subterranean moisture probes with our soil sites, which have been  mapped through EM and GAMA.  We're trying to create now subterranean soil spatial maps as well.  My favorite piece of innovation and tech is actually still sitting downstairs behind us.  We've got a spawn bot hopefully we'll be turning up in the next few months.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:07):**  I can't wait to start using that.  The connectivity system Jonesy mentioned is called Orego.  It and all the other technologies mentioned in this episode are linked in the show notes.  When we think about ag tech adoption and being a user of technology, what moves the needle  for you?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:25):**  How do you decide whether you're going to use a product or not?  I guess in particular, where are tech companies doing well and where are they maybe failing?  If I'm looking at tech that gets me excited that I'm interested in using, obviously it's  about my core business.  It's about sheep.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:39):**  It's really easy to sell me tech that's going to make what I already do easier to do.  It's really hard to sell me tech that you've got to get me to do another job to make it  work.  Unfortunately, the livestock game has historically been here's some tech, here's some electronic  tags, here's an auto drafter.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:04:56):**  But in order to get a value proposition out of that, I actually have to do work I didn't  do before.  That's a really big thing that I'm focusing on at the moment is to find tech that means  the data that I need to capture becomes a byproduct of management.  That's where I want to move to.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:12):**  I think, say you brought in your cropping guys, that's already there.  If you harvest your crop, if you're selling your crop, you can gather a lot of data whilst  you're doing the management jobs that you have to do.  People are really keen to adopt that.  Certainly in my space, that's where if you can find me tech that gets sheep data as a  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:29):**  byproduct of management, I'm going to be very keen to listen.  If you want to do the hard sell and say, look Mark, if you do all this extra work, we can  make you more money.  Not that interested.  Yeah, that's a fine one to balance in, especially with really early companies who do need help  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:45):**  from producers, but also need to make sure they're adding value along the way and having  a strong value proposition.  Chilla, how do you think about adopting tech?  Yeah, so for me the plan has to come first.  I think the tech should be second.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:05:57):**  I think it's really important that you do your planning well first, otherwise you really  don't know how to assess all of the different possible options.  From our perspective in Western Australia, we've spent a fair bit of time, and this is  how basic it is in terms of at the beginning, we've done a course called Paperless through  a group called Rural Edge.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:16):**  They're a not-for-profit farmer group.  We've had an extraordinary take-up of this course, because you think people know how  to do everything digitally, but actually what you have to do first is get the farm office  online, and then after you get the farm office online, then you can get the farm online.  And the drivers for it are actually the women in the business, because they want to have  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:36):**  a more efficient, they don't want to be sitting in an office, they want to be doing the stuff  that they love doing.  They want more time with their family, or more time in the community, or more time drinking  wine with their friends, whatever it is.  So it's also giving them the capacity to have an office they can carry with them as well.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:06:54):**  And techie people in the room would think, oh my god, that sounds like 20 years ago,  for many farm offices, they come along to the workshops, and people are still using  checks.  So, you know, like, it is about helping and enabling people where they're at.  So for me, it's the plan first.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:11):**  Morit, you were nodding when Chella was talking about the woman making the decisions and running  some of that office.  Do you have anything you want to comment on there?  Any stories?  Oh no, she just described our farm model.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:22):**  The boys are outside, and the girls do the office work, and we are all digital, at least  in the office.  And the second step is getting the farm online.  So that's where we're working now.  Another factor in technology adoption is confidence.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:35):**  And a big part of helping farmers be more confident is through the support that agtech  companies can provide.  One of the biggest stumbling blocks for agtech adoption in the farming community is the confidence  of what we're trying to achieve.  For the startups out there, it's about being able to give the customer the confidence that  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:07:56):**  what you're doing will be well supported.  Nowadays we can support a lot of things remotely, but as farmers, we like to touch things and  pull things apart and rub up against them.  And having feet under the desk is actually a really important part of it.  So it's about building that confidence into the consumer market, which is us as farmers  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:19):**  as the consumer, and us as the farmers.  It's about having confidence with the piece of tech that we're going to get.  And as Chilla has already said, it's about having that plan that you can bolt it onto.  So on the support question, how do you, when a startup or a tech company comes to you,  how do you assess if the support's going to be good before you actually start using the  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:40):**  product?  My answer to that would be I talk to other farmers, and that's the most important recommendation.  Trusted intermediaries are critical.  So a person, like a startup just approaching you, that conversation, I mean we'd welcome  conversations from startups.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:08:55):**  We've been involved in the mentoring program in AgriStart program in Western Australia,  and that's what I'd call a good intermediary, because you get to sit in the room and you  get to hear the pictures and you get to know the person and you know what you're backing  then.  And there is a real opportunity for farmers to be investors and to not be passive around  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:13):**  ag tech, and I think that's one of the critical things that Evoke has really created as a  conversation is farmers as investors, because that's what we've traditionally been.  We've been the drivers of farm innovation, because for years and years and years, the  stuff that we get on our farm, that is the innovations, have been designed by partnerships  between farmers and another business.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:35):**  So it's not new, this is not new, it's kind of just like capitalising on that idea of  creating some kind of space where you can meet people and meet the startups and then  work with them.  Yeah, I love that.  I mean it's a really big thing that I'm passionate about farmers as more than just customers  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:09:49):**  actually get involved in other ways, and it might not be an investor, that might not be  something that every farmer can or wants to do, but it might be investing some time as  maybe an advisor or giving advice and tips.  I think you've done, well you've both done a bit of that, but Mort you've done some of  that with a few different products.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:04):**  Yeah, I certainly have been involved with a few.  In the early days I used to judge how good a startup was by how desperate I was for their  potential product, and that certainly in the early days, I had hardware at home that was  bought that the companies don't exist anymore, they don't support it, so it becomes a bit  expensive.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:23):**  So now I show strong interest and then I'll wait for them to finish coming to me, and  I try and make some kind of assessment about where they might go.  And the ones that come back, then we go forward and we offer the support right through to  being the really early adopter and working on prototypes and having their software engineers  come to the farm and work through issues and actually get them, because they're quite often  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:10:48):**  people that have never been on a farm, in our case never seen a sheep, never given a  medication, and they get to do that for the first time and then go home and it's really  quite groundbreaking for them to then work through their code from a practical application.  This is one of the really exciting things about AgTech.  It's attracting new talent, new perspectives and new skill sets into the agriculture industry.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:11):**  This can of course be a challenge, but it's also an opportunity for farmers to get involved  earlier in the development process and in new ways, like as investors and as advisors.  Jonesy has done a bit of both and has learned a few lessons along the way.  I'm involved in AgTech both from an investment point of view and from a user's point of view,  and I guess the motivation by being an investor in AgTech is your exposure to really quite  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:38):**  good equipment that's coming on stream, which helps us with our system and it's all about  de-risking ourselves.  That's our primary objective.  I've had good and bad experiences.  Another one of the startups who's down at Startup Lane down there is in the crowd now,  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:11:53):**  so I'll give him a bit of a plug.  I guess when we were sitting there discussing what we wanted to do and we're talking about  support, he said some of it's going to be online so we can do some of it remotely and  some of it's going to be face to face.  Being a relatively new product, you're always going to have a few little glitches on the  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:11):**  way through, but it's been well supported both remotely and from people traveling out.  And obviously now with distances and the cost of getting there, it's really hard to support  it by travel.  So as much as what we can do remotely is better for everyone.  The bad experiences, I guess with any new piece of tech that you're going to introduce,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:12:35):**  you're going to lose a bit of skin from time to time and you just have to understand that,  get up and keep moving and just keep walking towards what your objective was.  Do you have an example of losing some skin?  Well, we've only got another 22 minutes, otherwise we could be here for an hour or so.  We through a friend of mine developed the first time precision planning bar in the world.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:01):**  And like when you say you're the first in the world, it kind of sounds really sexy,  but it's not.  Because when there's issues, you've got nowhere to turn.  You got to try to figure it out for yourself.  And then there was some other issues that sort of came into play and it's just been  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:18):**  a really slow burn.  The heat is intense, but then we've had good stories and really good ones as well.  Like I'm talking about the aeration system that we've got now.  That's an absolute success.  Where it's created now, so we've got our solar system is a one man operation and you  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:38):**  can even do most of that remotely, which is good.  I could do it here now.  Mort, how about you?  You've played in this space?  Yeah, well that's, I'll tell a story about unintended consequences maybe.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:13:49):**  So spent a lot of time trying to make it easy for our customers to select rams.  So historically you've got an animal and then we'd present them with page after page  of data on it, which is difficult.  You had to explain what it was.  So I actually read this book about the visual representation of quantitative statistics.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:08):**  It's a really good read.  I can see some doubters out there.  And it talks about ink to information ratios.  So it's about getting as much information on a page with the least amount of ink.  And it makes our brains easier to break it down and understand it.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:24):**  So I got the sale team ready and I spent a lot of time printing out these lovely sheets  for every single ram that was for sale and the fellow that sells our rams, after he's  made the deal, could give each one of these sheets out like a certificate or, you know,  it was a high end product.  I wanted something to go with it.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:41):**  And the first customer he had came in, he explained how the sheets worked.  The guy selected his rams and he just flicked through them with his thumb because it was  that easy to see good and bad parts of an animal.  He goes, oh, oh, I didn't realise that.  Oh, I didn't realise this.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:14:56):**  Next you know they're back down the yards.  And the guy is re-looking for his perfect animal.  And the guy that sells the rams was very, very polite, but he chucked that folder under  the bottom of the desk and he never bought it out again.  And he said that was a great idea, Mark, and I think it's a good tool for us, but it made  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:11):**  it too easy for the customers to see each animal's weakness.  So I changed the way our customers look at rams by changing how I display data.  And it turned out that they all wanted a good average looking animal, not the most profitable,  because I displayed it in that way.  And it turns out it's actually a psychological impact.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:30):**  So the fear of loss is greater than the expectation of gain.  So when they looked at that graph and they saw something that was negative, that negative  override all the beneficial economic things.  So they're actually wanting animals that made them less money.  So we had to go home and reassess, because I didn't want to abandon the idea.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:15:50):**  I didn't want to go back to the old way of keeping them in the dark and then just, this  is a good ram, mate.  You'll be right.  I love it.  And sometimes the skin that you lose is time, is actual money.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:01):**  There's a lot of ways to invest in this space and lots of ways you can make mistakes.  The other example that I'll maybe have you tell is around the voice tech that you used  and how you thought that would work one way and it didn't.  Yeah, so when I was playing around with coding and stuff and gathering data, I thought it  would be really cool if we were in the sheep yards that we just speak all the information  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:21):**  to the computer and it records it for us.  And I spent quite a while developing it and getting it to work and then practiced it and  rolled it out the yards and the old fella had a bit of a go at it and mumbled and said  a few words under his breath, went away.  And then I started doing it.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:35):**  It turns out that if you're going to sit and talk for eight hours in the sheep yards and  the dust and the flies, it's terrible.  It's actually quicker and easier with a mobile keypad and just a type.  So you know, I spent ages trying to develop that and it just, and I was the user and the  developer and I still couldn't see that it wasn't going to work until we actually rolled  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:16:56):**  it out.  So you know, I can see how startups can have what they see as an amazing idea and don't  just spend a few hours or weeks developing something but lots and lots of money and then  get to a user and they can make, that's no good mate, it doesn't help.  I love that story also because we tell startups in all these innovation programs, you know,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:14):**  go talk to your customers and ask them what their problems are.  And it's funny, right, because I think sometimes if they said what their problem was, you'd  actually potentially go down a path that's maybe not solving that problem.  And so it's really about that relationship that you can build together and keep trying  things and keep having a go, which of course does take time but it is, you know, not just  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:32):**  one silver bullet or one problem, you can just say right away.  I want to ask Chilla, where do you look for new innovations and in this world of ag tech  and new products, are you looking in different places than you've looked in the past for  potential things that can add value on farm?  Yeah, so we're big fans of travelling and looking and just meeting people and one of  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:17:53):**  the things that we're quite famous for is we go on these family holidays, which is supposed  to be holidays, and then we go, oh, what's that over there in that paddock?  And then we drive in, we meet the farmer and then we end up staying there and then you  end up having dinner with their family and then you end up getting so many great ideas.  So we're just big fans of wandering and being curious.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:14):**  And that for me, I mean, like I've got to say, I really love Evoke and what Evoke is  doing in terms of creating a community because it's hard for the creative people to find  each other and sometimes people are talking about something that's an entirely different  sector, but you go, oh, that's really interesting and because you can then kind of put it back  through your lens and then figure out how you can make that work in your business and  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:36):**  you just need people pushing you all the time because status quos the problem, like status  quos the enemy in ag.  If we're going to grow ag to 100 billion, we've got to really actually find ways of  bringing new capital into ag and that means other people with other energies and other  ideas and I think it's really critical that we don't just stand still.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:18:56):**  That would be the worst thing we could do.  Given this was a live panel, we also had some audience questions.  This first one came from author and reporter Gabby Chen.  I report on rural politics and every election I talk to farmers who say they are increasingly  squeezed between the inputs and the food price and so I just want to know, is it right that  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:22):**  you've got to be kind of young, financially comfortable and have enough mental space to  bring about new ideas and change?  As the oldest person on this panel, yeah you can be old but you have to be hungry.  That's my answer.  Definitely the use of tech is about creating a better margin and that's just how economics  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:19:50):**  works and unfortunately in ag, the consolidation of farms shall continue just because as farms  grow your access to capital, your access to purchase ag tech, your bandwidth to be able  to handle the ag tech because you'll have structures in place, management structures  in place, your ability to procure inputs cheaper than someone smaller than you just brings  your unit cost lower and that's just economies of scale and that's just an everlasting type  
**[0:20:26-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:26):**  model in ag and from WA alone, in the last 20 years I've gone from 10,000 to 4,000 grain  producers and most of that's just been absorbed into other farms and that is just through  economies of scale and that will continue and I don't think we'll ever turn that around.  It's actually an interesting one as well, this kind of consolidation and family farms  going from family farms to bigger family farms, there's a real opportunity for solutions that  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:20:56):**  have both the agility of a family farm but enough professionalism of what becomes a larger  family farm with more staff and more needs, more operational complexity and so that's  something that's maybe not as well served in the market and I don't know what you guys  are seeing.  Yeah and so when we bring that into context like our farms are all getting bigger so we're  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:15):**  going to have to start managing them virtually like the opening address yesterday was about  the fourth stage of this is the digital era.  Well digital and virtual are hand in hand and we have to start managing our farm virtually  and obviously our access to labour is getting harder and more expensive which leads more  down the automation road and then it's a vicious circle because our small towns are shrinking  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:21:43):**  and I'd like it to be really great to bring ag tech space out.  There was a great article in the Finn Review about the Bates' up there in central Queensland,  what they have done and that would be great if all our little regional areas had a start  up that could pop up like that and bring skills and people back into the regional areas but  yeah, how do we promote that?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:06):**  I don't know.  My view is that one of the most difficult things in farming is that by the time you  finish farming, so you have say 50 seasons, you're good at it and that's the problem  in farming.  What ag tech does is it gives you the data and the information to become good at farming  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:26):**  in a lot less time.  So my view on this is that this is actually the breakthrough, that this is the important  investment that will enable other people to come into agriculture and to invest in agriculture  and that's actually what we need and this is the platform.  So the idea of getting 50 years of knowledge down to 5 years of knowledge, once you can  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:22:47):**  do that, you can really shake up the model of how we do agriculture and that's the  critical point because no one's got a lifetime to learn how to become a good farmer anymore.  I'm really interested in the kind of balance and I don't know, Morten, if you have any  thoughts on if you're a fourth, fifth, sixth generation farmer, you have all this experience  of the land and understanding of what's been there and kind of intuition about what  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:09):**  it needs, balancing that with all these new data sources and new pieces of information  that you can ramp up quickly on a new farm or think differently about the current farm,  how do you balance those two sources of information or two ways of using information?  I'm not sure it is a balance but I think both the points you guys have just made are  really very valid and I hope people see them as opportunities as opposed to threats.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:23:37):**  Things of competition but essentially I'm getting to the point where I am trying to  digitally replace the 30 years of experience I've got at looking at sheep so there's  things that I can walk into a panic that every staff member I've ever had just cannot see.  How do I replace that with valuable information that they can use instantly and I think you're  talking about turning that 50 years into 5 and it's a really valid point because essentially  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:02):**  you're without thinking about that but that's what I'm making, that's what I want  to try and do because it's very frustrating for me to walk past something and how can  that be not obvious and it's just a lifetime of experience and I now know what the old  man went through for the first 15 years of my farming life.  I understand what all his grunts and groans meant now.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:23):**  What is your guys' tech wish list?  What are you not seeing that you wish existed?  Funnily enough I was having a yarn to a mate of mine yesterday afternoon.  He's in the cotton up in Gundawindi and he said like years ago when he was doing his  PhD all these things that we're talking about today were there but now they can actually  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:24:46):**  talk to each other.  Back then it was all little silos of technology and data sources where now they're all interconnected  and that's how I think if we just continue down this road where everything is interconnected  we're on the right path, it's just refining that.  So mine is really basic, it's connectivity.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:09):**  So we have to get to enterprise grade broadband in farming areas and if we don't do that,  if we don't have the back all to enable us to do the adoption it is still just all going  to be talk.  So we have to solve that, we do not have a solution that has ever emerged out of any  of the models so farmers are going to have to do it themselves?  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:34):**  So I have an immediate wish list of tech things that I want to get in and working but I think  if I go a bit further down, once I've got all those little pieces like we said we need  them all to work but I would like them to work smarter.  So I already use fancy algorithms to help make decisions with sheep.  There's a program out there called Ask Bill which is a tool that you put data in and it  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:25:58):**  helps you make decisions so I want all these sensors and data gathering things to have  a bit of machine learning for them that actually help me make decisions.  Great question.  Chill you were talking about collaboration.  Very interested to know when you are wanting to try and solve a pain point in farming do  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:19):**  you naturally think of the local ecosystem trying to reach out domestically or is internationally  is it important to think about the international aspect as well in that?  Yeah it's definitely both for us so the technology in our orchard, our water efficiency technology  was inspired by I'm going to say because we adopted some Israeli technology and then adapted  it for our own conditions.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:26:45):**  The software system that helps with this sorting and then tells us the price of every orange  that we sell, that's French technology.  The sorting system comes from Spain so yeah I think for the most part actually when we're  going out there to look at the next incremental jump, the transformation in our business,  we're not getting it from Australia.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:06):**  And I actually think I learnt the reason this morning.  I sat there and I listened to the conversations about how much we're spending, what our investment  is.  It's just really clear to me that we're actually going to have to fund these ecosystems a lot  more and we're going to have to really kind of ramp up that investment if we are going  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:22):**  to catch up as well so that I will then in 10 years time be telling you all of those  great technologies in my life come from Australia.  So as we head into the last couple minutes I would love to hear from each of you.  So you guys are clearly leaders in this space.  You're ahead on the adoption curve and really thinking deeply about this stuff.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:27:44):**  For anyone in the audience who's either in a similar spot or maybe not quite out as far  on the leading edge or the bleeding edge as it can be called, what would you say as tips  for any of the producers in the room to get more involved with or get more value out of  technology?  Okay, so as Chilla mentioned earlier, definitely have a plan.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:06):**  You've got to start with an objective and then you can just reverse engineer it back  out of there.  Have the courage to change.  It's not the easiest to do.  Realise that there will be two steps forward, one step back, a couple of sideways.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:20):**  But yeah, as long as you keep your objective in mind and yeah, keep an open mind, you'll  be okay.  Absolutely.  You've got to have your plan.  But I find once you've got your plan and you've got your goal, make the decision that I am  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:33):**  going to do that, even though you don't know what any of the steps are to get there.  So it's very easy not to make the decision because you don't know how it's done.  So you just think, I can't do that.  So you make your goal and you say, right, I'm going to do that.  And then start small steps and don't be afraid to ring people and seek help and to look for  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:28:51):**  it.  And just keep moving along.  And it doesn't matter how many branches or dead ends you get, eventually you'll find  one that gets to your goal if you want to spend enough time.  And mine is that failure is learning.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:02):**  So people think that failure is a bad thing.  It's not.  It's just a real opportunity to figure out, oh, that didn't work.  Okay, I'm going to tweak it and I'm going to go this way.  And the other thing for me is just to say, wherever you're at, whatever stage you're  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:18):**  at, it's fine.  Everyone thinks that you have to be really tech savvy.  I'm not.  I'm actually called the techno gnome in my family because Lizzie's sitting here laughing.  I know so little about technology, it's not funny.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:31):**  I call everything a thing-a-me-bob.  And I seriously don't know how stuff works, but it doesn't stop me from adopting and finding  the best.  Yeah, I know.  She's laughing because I really am absolutely technologically completely this big.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:46):**  So wherever you're at, that's a great place to be.  And it doesn't mean that you can't find the best people to work with and just work with  the best people you can find.  Amazing.  Thank you guys.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/tips-from-leading-producers#t=0:29:58):**  Hopefully for the producers in the room, you found something useful and maybe some inspiration  to get started.  And for those thinking about building solutions or investing in them, you've heard a bit  from producers on what they really need.  So please join me in thanking Chilla, Mort and Jonesy.

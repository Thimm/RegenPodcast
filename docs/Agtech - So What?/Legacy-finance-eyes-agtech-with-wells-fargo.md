### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 05 Oct 2022 19:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by Tenacious Ventures.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:06):**  I'm Sarah Nolette.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:07):**  A quick note, if you're excited to hear how fun2 fundraising is going, make sure you sit  
**[0:00:11-0:00:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:11):**  tight through to the end of the show.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:13):**  If you do, you'll get to hear a bunch of juicy insights that Matthew and I have landed on  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:16):**  while raising over the past few weeks.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:19):**  And if you're still hungry for more after that, make sure you check in with us on socials  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:22):**  and visit the website in the show notes for more info.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:27):**  Pretty much wherever you are in the world right now, there is a good amount of uncertainty  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:31):**  in the finance sector.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:33):**  And though Ag Tech tends to play in the venture world rather than the debt space, rising interest  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:37):**  rates had us thinking about how our colleagues in the banking world are thinking about Ag  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:41):**  and climate investments.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:43):**  When I look at sustainability, all it is is just the transition from the legacy economy  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:48):**  to the sustainable economy.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:50):**  And it's going to be through innovation and technology and investment.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:54):**  And the bank realizes that because we're helping our existing clients by doing that as well.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:00:59):**  That's Rami Basra, senior VP and national sustainable tech practice leader at Wells  
**[0:01:04-0:01:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:04):**  Fargo.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:05):**  Today, he joined his colleague, Carol R. Flynn, food and agribusiness industries advisor,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:10):**  to chat about the bank's current Ag Tech vision and investment focuses.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:14):**  Rami cut his teeth in renewable energy, whereas Carol has a more conventional ag background.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:19):**  Today, they work with both new and legacy food and ag clients at Wells Fargo.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:24):**  Now, we don't spend a ton of time talking to banks here on the podcast, but given where  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:28):**  we sit in the Ag Tech ecosystem, we thought it would be interesting to compare notes with  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:32):**  folks who sit in somewhat similar seats at a very different institution.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:37):**  I'll drop you in where Rami is explaining more about the team's role.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:40):**  So we were actually one of the first, I think the first large money center bank to have  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:45):**  a, we used to be called the clean tech group back in the day when I first started 10 years  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:48):**  ago.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:49):**  And that's probably, I think primarily because we're based here in San Francisco where the  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:53):**  BC community has spawned.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:55):**  And so there's a lot of investor activity around sustainability here.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:01:59):**  Like the solar industry started here, the battery industry, a lot of innovation started  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:03):**  here as an extension of, of Silicon Valley.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:06):**  So being here in San Francisco, I think that's was the impetus for this investing.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:10):**  We were pretty early into it at that time.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:13):**  It was just Wells Fargo and a few other small tech banks that were covering sustainability.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:17):**  And this is well before you saw a lot of IPOs and that was clean tech 1.0, which wasn't  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:22):**  necessarily kind to investors, but it's something that we're really close to and have invested  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:27):**  in.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:28):**  Do you see parallels between clean tech and ag tech?  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:31):**  And I guess what, what lessons can ag tech take from clean tech in terms of avoiding  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:36):**  some of those perils?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:37):**  I'd say yes.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:39):**  It's not very uncommon where we're typically working with series a to large publicly traded  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:43):**  mid-corp type companies and folks within that ecosystem we see moving around.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:49):**  So you'll see somebody who was the chief general counsel for a solar developer.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:54):**  That's now working at a general counsel at a CEA, a controlled environmental ag company.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:02:59):**  So you see a lot of that cross pollination of talent and they're bringing some of those  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:03):**  experiences that they developed and garnered in solar over into controlled environmental  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:08):**  ag, for example.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:09):**  And I think that's awesome because there's a lot of lessons learned in solar that parallel  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:14):**  this.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:15):**  I spent a lot of time in electric vehicles and the EV transportation sector, a lot of  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:19):**  lessons learned because it's heavy cap backs initially, longer innovation times, a lot  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:24):**  of R and D investing.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:26):**  Maybe the way you structure contracts to your offtakes or to your customers, garnering customer  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:32):**  adoption, accessing financing capital, debt capital.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:36):**  You know, as you transition from equity funding to debt funding.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:39):**  So there's a lot of parallels there that you see.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:41):**  And that's why I think you see that intellectual capital moving amongst these sectors as well.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:47):**  It's very, very common.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:48):**  Yeah, that makes a ton of sense to me, Romy, given what you said about the kind of unique  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:52):**  dynamics of financing some of these heavier capex investments that we need in ag tech.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:03:58):**  Like we can't eat software, so we need physical things and stuff that moves physical things.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:02):**  And yet from a venture perspective, it's been tough in some cases originally in clean tech  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:07):**  and in early ag tech to think about getting these businesses to scale.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:11):**  Where would you point to to gain that confidence?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:13):**  Is it talent?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:14):**  Like you said, is it there's more project finance out there or debt terms are different  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:18):**  or what would you point to as some of the kind of unlock codes that maybe didn't exist  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:22):**  in the early clean tech world?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:23):**  I think it definitely talent people who know how to run a cash burning company and be efficient  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:30):**  and make sure that they can scale.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:32):**  Because that's the biggest challenge is scaling.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:34):**  Because many times in these sectors, there is adoption, there's customer adoption, but  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:38):**  how do you run a successful company?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:40):**  That's the hardest part.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:41):**  And that's the non-sexy part of it.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:43):**  So people who've been through the trenches there and know how to manage that, I think  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:47):**  that's key, how to get talent, those types of things, but how to also position your company  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:52):**  for debt capital.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:54):**  Because that's what any company, once you start scaling or successful, how can you get  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:04:58):**  away from that dilutive, more expensive equity capital and get that repeatable, scalable,  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:03):**  lower cost of capital to scale your business is really important.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:07):**  So just people who've been through all of that, it's a big differentiator.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:10):**  I know in the VC community, you look at the management team, in the debts community as  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:15):**  well, and we do equity as well, but on the debt side, that's a really important piece  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:18):**  of the puzzle.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:19):**  So maybe we'll flip the tables.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:20):**  We get asked this all the time, so I'll ask you how you'd answer it.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:23):**  If you're a startup or I'm a startup, I come to you, I say, look, I'm thinking about raising  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:27):**  money.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:28):**  I'm a series A stage company.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:29):**  Romy, should I raise equity?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:31):**  Should I raise debt?  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:32):**  And should I raise it from you as a bank versus the venture community?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:35):**  How would you answer that question?  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:37):**  So if it's a series A company, candidly, it's going to be tough for them to access debt  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:42):**  initially, because typically a series A, just the stage that they're in, they might not  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:47):**  even be regenerating revenues yet.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:49):**  They're definitely burning cash and they should be because they're growing, they're getting  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:52):**  market share.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:53):**  So that's typically equity risk.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:05:55):**  So with that type of risk profile, equity is better suited for you because they're more  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:00):**  patient, the more flexible terms, it's dilutive, but you've got that kind of runway.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:05):**  And then you're also able to tap into that equity investors talent, that guidance that  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:10):**  you did investors provide is super critical, that hands-on guidance.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:14):**  Sometimes that's a little bit more challenging for a debt provider at that stage.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:19):**  So I would say being honest and candid and realizing you're going to be equity funded.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:23):**  There's other sources of capital.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:25):**  So say we can provide capital Wells Fargo at that stage for those reasons I mentioned  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:30):**  cashflow burn, et cetera.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:32):**  There's partners we work with that might be an equipment leasing company.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:35):**  That's really familiar with the sector.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:37):**  So there are other sources or pockets or buckets of capital out there.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:41):**  And that's where we would guide them to is where you can get that and then try to provide  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:45):**  them insights where you need to be to get our debt capital to provide that guidance.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:51):**  And then they should be thinking of those thresholds to meet.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:53):**  And as they grow their business.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:55):**  Got it.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:06:56):**  So then zoom forward, I come back to you in, in say two years, I've grown a ton or 18 months  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:00):**  or nine months in the last couple of years, I've grown a ton and, and I'm ready, I think  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:04):**  for a round that's going to include equity and debt.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:06):**  I've got a cashflow is not quite cash positive but something that's consistent and repeatable.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:11):**  There's maybe a line of sight to what the future will look like.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:14):**  I'm ready for debt.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:15):**  Why would I choose Wells Fargo or how would I think about a debt generally and be Wells  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:20):**  Fargo in particular?  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:22):**  So the first part is like what, like the types of debt.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:26):**  So you've got like equipment financing.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:28):**  We do that.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:29):**  Then there's venture debt where we look at the runway liquidity runway, who your investors  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:33):**  are and their level of support.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:35):**  Then there's asset based lending where we're lending against your accounts receivable.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:39):**  You might be in a cash burn position growing very quickly, but you've got some great AR  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:43):**  you've got some inventory we can lend again.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:45):**  So those kinds of basic metrics or parameters are things that we look at.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:49):**  And then why Wells Fargo?  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:51):**  So we're the largest food and ag lender in the country.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:53):**  We've been doing it over for a hundred years.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:07:55):**  So we've got these massive legacy relationships, which when you think about it as a company,  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:00):**  who do I work with?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:01):**  It's not just capital.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:03):**  That's obviously huge.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:04):**  But who can provide that connectivity who can provide introductions who could provide  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:08):**  introductions to JV partners to help me do a manufacturing facility that takes a lot  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:13):**  of catbacks.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:15):**  Do you find that on the traditional ag side, like you're talking to folks in the existing  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:19):**  industry, I know my experience has been being in a room of livestock producers and talking  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:23):**  about alternative protein and you get a couple of light bulbs going on, but maybe a couple  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:27):**  of shoes thrown at you as well.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:29):**  And how do you have that conversation sort of challenging and exploring what the future  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:33):**  might look like, even though sometimes those conversations are difficult?  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:36):**  When I think of this sector and I think of technology and legacy companies, I think of  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:42):**  innovation and disruption.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:45):**  And I think many times, and this applies to all of sustainability, sustainable tech companies  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:51):**  are only the very few select ones who are very vision oriented and forward thinking,  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:08:57):**  get it early, but most are apprehensive or you're skeptical about what these companies  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:03):**  are going to do.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:04):**  And that's fair because innovation is super hard.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:05):**  It takes a long time, especially like leapfrog innovation.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:09):**  So I think some of these legacy companies tend to be pretty skeptical.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:12):**  In some of the meetings I've been to where I've joined some of our legacy bankers on  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:16):**  calls, there's always like one person on the group of five who's like super championing  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:21):**  innovation and let's get into these areas.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:23):**  And then there's some folks, maybe the majority of them who are very skeptical.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:28):**  So it takes a while for them to get comfortable with these sectors and why they should JV  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:32):**  why should they invest those types of things.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:35):**  I think it's very typical with all of tech.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:37):**  Really.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:38):**  We see that across the board.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:39):**  You mentioned the indoor ag space that as I understand it is an area you guys have invested  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:44):**  in.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:45):**  Is that right?  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:46):**  We have a Wells Fargo innovation incubator program, and I actually just joined the board  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:49):**  on recently, but we've been at it for seven years now.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:53):**  And so that's where we're investing in early stage pre-series A companies by way of grants.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:09:59):**  And so that's where we've been putting capital out at the very early stage.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:02):**  So it's a holistic approach there.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:04):**  But the most recent cohort we did was focused on egg tech and it was focused on CEA.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:10):**  So our indoor lighting companies robotics plant genomics, that kind of stuff.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:15):**  So that's where we've deployed capital or at the earliest stage through our VC arm,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:19):**  we've invested in some alternative protein areas and in the e-grocery ugly foods category,  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:25):**  those areas and food tech.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:27):**  So that's where we've invested in.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:28):**  And then my team, we're really focused more on providing debt capital and banking services.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:32):**  So we have banking relationships and we're continually looking at in terms of the indoor  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:37):**  farming space providing project level farm debt.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:40):**  And that's what we're working on right now.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:42):**  So my sense of the indoor farming industry, how we've thought about it for a long time  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:46):**  is you've got the businesses that are selling farms.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:50):**  You've got businesses that are selling produce and you've got businesses that are selling  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:53):**  sort of picks and shovels, whether that's lighting technologies, seeds, genetics, robots,  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:58):**  whatever it might be.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:10:59):**  Can you talk about roughly how you guys have broken down the category and are there types  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:03):**  of business models that you are finding more or less well-suited to debt and to scalability  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:08):**  as well?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:10):**  So I would say where we've seen the most scale is actually the CEA players themselves, the  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:15):**  growers.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:16):**  They're the ones who seem to be attracting the most investor capital and the ones who  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:19):**  are going from farm number one to five to some of them are got 12 now and they've all  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:24):**  got big growth plans and growing and they're sold out of product.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:27):**  So that's where we've been having the most dialogue and seeing the most scale.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:30):**  The ones who make the picks and shovels and the ones who are doing robotics or software,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:36):**  we haven't seen the scale yet, candidly, but that's happening, but just not to the scale  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:40):**  that we're seeing in the growers themselves.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:43):**  And the pushback on the indoor farming space in terms of the growers that we've thought  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:47):**  a lot about is a sort of energy costs and getting to unit economics that make sense.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:52):**  So I'd love comments on that.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:53):**  And then market size.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:54):**  I heard someone from a consulting firm the other day say they had done a deep dive and  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:11:58):**  that there's more venture dollars that have gone into CEA than the total size of the lettuce  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:03):**  market that the CEA growers are growing for.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:05):**  So a bit of skepticism there.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:06):**  How would you respond?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:07):**  Well, that's an interesting stat.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:10):**  I thought the lettuce market was massive.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:11):**  They're talking like billions.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:13):**  I don't think there's that much has gone into indoor farming yet.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:16):**  And there is a lot of skepticism around this right now.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:18):**  Now, like I said earlier, all of the growers that we've talked to, the indoor CEA players,  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:24):**  they're sold out of product.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:25):**  So it's not a demand issue.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:27):**  It's just a margin issue.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:29):**  And that typically comes just like with solar, just like we see in the electric vehicle space.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:33):**  It's a scale game.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:35):**  So it's a little bit of a land grab right now who can raise enough equity capital to  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:39):**  continue scaling.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:40):**  So that's what we're seeing.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:41):**  In order to get those costs down, the equipment costs are still too high.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:46):**  Development costs are still too high.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:48):**  And so that's what everybody's going to be working on and everybody is working on.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:51):**  And there's different models within CEA, right, as well.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:12:55):**  The greenhouse model versus a truly warehouse vertical farm and the economics there.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:00):**  And some are taking much more tech risk with pure robotics focus, and then some are more  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:04):**  traditional labor.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:06):**  So I think that the jury is out, you know, how this is going to all happen and scale.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:10):**  But there still needs to be more tech innovation.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:12):**  We need to get that cost structure down.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:14):**  I think that's the key part of it.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:16):**  But what I'd like to see is more incentives, like in the solar industry.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:20):**  Like there should be an investment tax credit for the CEA space.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:23):**  Because here in California, we're in droughts, there's so much, I mean, you go all over the  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:27):**  world, there's drought, and there's water issues.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:29):**  And in California, I got fined a couple of years ago for watering my lawn too much.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:33):**  This is an ongoing thing we've been dealing with.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:36):**  So when you think about climate, this is a great solution to that.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:39):**  But there needs to be more policy around it to get more capital and to lower the cost  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:44):**  of capital down.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:45):**  Because most of these farms are still being financed with equity.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:48):**  We've seen a little bit of debt capital come in, not enough to bring the cost of capital  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:52):**  down.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:53):**  So that's a factor in it as well.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:54):**  So we just need innovation on all pieces of this puzzle.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:13:57):**  And that's only going to come with time and scale, just like we saw with solar.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:02):**  So there's all these lessons learned that are going to be applicable to the CEA space.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:07):**  That's happening in real time.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:08):**  And one other point around that, when you think about the CEA players, they've just  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:12):**  been using their own balance sheet and their own investor capital.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:15):**  Ideally, it'd be great if they're partnering with, let's say, the REITs out there who see  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:20):**  this secular asset class theme.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:21):**  We're the largest real estate lender in the country.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:23):**  So we see a lot of interest from the REITs who say, we'll help you build this 300,000  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:29):**  square foot facility.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:30):**  We know how to do that.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:31):**  We did it with data centers.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:32):**  We did it in other sectors.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:34):**  We can do it here.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:35):**  We'll provide that capital, that expertise.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:37):**  So it doesn't take you a year to do the permitting and build out a farm.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:40):**  We can do it in three months or whatever that timeframe is.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:43):**  And then we can provide you all the TI's, the tenant improvements.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:46):**  So that'll bring your cost to capital down and your execution time down dramatically.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:51):**  So they should be partnering with that and just focusing on their core business of the  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:54):**  farm.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:55):**  And I think you'll start seeing more of that.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:56):**  I'd like to make a couple of comments about market share really quickly.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:14:59):**  That question is of real interest to me as well.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:02):**  And I don't think at this point, the products coming out of vertical farming or indoor farming  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:07):**  are being labeled enough so that the consumer understands what they're purchasing.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:11):**  Because there's two elements to spending your dollar.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:13):**  One is purpose and the second is performance quality.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:16):**  Is it a true substitute?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:18):**  Is there some perceived improvement that I'll pay a premium for?  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:22):**  And when I dove into some of that analysis today and some Nielsen data, I was not able  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:27):**  to pull enough of that out for me to get a good answer.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:30):**  So I think we're going to get better at that.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:32):**  I think there are some consumers out there that want to purchase the purpose, want to  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:38):**  purchase potentially the local aspect, the water issues.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:43):**  And for the conventional players, there's a seasonality aspect.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:47):**  So when we have drought, when we have windows of opportunity in our conventional growing  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:53):**  year, those indoor farms are going to be able to provide during those windows in ways we  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:15:58):**  couldn't do before.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:00):**  So we're going to segment the market and I'm going to be interested in that as that comes  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:04):**  about because some of the consumers are going to buy frankly on price and substitution.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:11):**  Consumers will buy with a premium attached to either organic or vertically farmed or  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:17):**  some purpose statement from the brand.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:19):**  So there's going to be a lot that sorts itself out as the market develops.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:24):**  And I'm thinking we'll know a lot more in three years and I'm really having a hard time  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:29):**  reconciling the numbers that I'm hearing from the indoor farming folks to the bigger market.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:34):**  It doesn't mean that there's not real revenues.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:36):**  It's obviously getting traction.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:39):**  But as soon as us analysts can get a better feel and some more confidence in those numbers,  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:44):**  I think that'll help everybody in the space.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:46):**  And one of the potential value propositions or touted value propositions is really that  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:50):**  sustainability aspect for these indoor farms, which my understanding is that depends on  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:16:56):**  running these factories based on renewable energy, which my understanding is also that  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:01):**  is not currently the case.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:02):**  So I'd be curious how you guys are seeing those sustainability conversations and proof  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:07):**  points play out.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:08):**  In my conversations with the CEA players, initially they're not focused on deploying  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:12):**  renewable energy in their facility and they're being smart, right?  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:15):**  Because the renewable energy is expensive.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:16):**  So if you're in Texas or someplace and your local energy source might be cheaper than  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:22):**  renewable energy or if you're in Kentucky, let's say.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:24):**  So we haven't seen that, but now we are.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:26):**  Now we're seeing, okay, on their third farm or their fourth farm, they're starting to  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:30):**  deploy renewable energy with solar plus storage.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:33):**  So initially they just had to be really careful with their investor capital and use it to  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:38):**  just build out the farm and prove it out and get some product out there.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:41):**  And now they're going to start going to those next stages of, again, part of that whole  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:44):**  cost puzzle, bringing energy costs down, right?  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:47):**  Because these facilities use a tremendous amount of energy as you know.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:51):**  And today sitting here in August, 2022, we've got a decently challenging interest rate environment.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:17:57):**  How does that impact your kind of conviction around these companies getting to scale?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:01):**  So it hasn't been a big issue yet because like I said, most of them are, they're equity  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:05):**  funded.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:06):**  They're not using debt yet.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:07):**  So it hasn't been a big issue in tech.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:09):**  I think where it's heard tech is valuations and it's seen it today in the stock market,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:13):**  but it hasn't really factored, I think, into the debt build out for farms.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:17):**  I guess I can imagine if there's a business plan that includes debt down the line, the  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:22):**  economics of what that might look like are changing.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:24):**  Does that kind of cascade down?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:25):**  I think you could overlay that with potential incentives, like you said, and whether that's  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:29):**  on the cost capital side or probably more likely on the sustainability incentive side,  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:34):**  like with solar.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:35):**  I think that's a fair point.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:36):**  Biologically, right, it will affect your business plan, but if you look at where rates are now  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:41):**  versus historically, they're still pretty low.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:43):**  We're just so used to being in zero interest rate environment, we're spoiled.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:47):**  I think that's totally a fair point.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:49):**  When you guys think about the value proposition of Wells Fargo, both in advising the existing  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:18:54):**  legacy, quote unquote, client base, or talking to these more innovative kind of ag tech companies  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:00):**  working in the venture landscape, how do you guys think about your competition and value  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:05):**  proposition?  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:06):**  I think you've got a lot of different pinnacles here and a lot of value, but big company,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:11):**  how well can you defend the, we really get the early stage space and on the early stage  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:15):**  side, how well can you defend the we're really agile and a great person to work with?  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:18):**  I think what we like to say is we have a holistic approach to this sectors.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:23):**  So we don't come in and out of markets.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:25):**  We have a market, we invest in it, we take a long-term approach.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:30):**  And that's because when we think about ag and food, we've been at it for so long.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:34):**  We're not going anywhere.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:35):**  This is just one piece of the puzzle.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:37):**  So that's the kind of way to think about it.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:39):**  And all those other things we mentioned up front in terms of connectivity and those things  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:43):**  too.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:44):**  I think that's how we think about it.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:45):**  And we understand innovation is hard in my team in technology banking.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:49):**  We understand let's be candid.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:51):**  A lot of companies don't make it at the early stage.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:53):**  It's just the nature of the beast.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:19:55):**  And so you have to be patient and have a holistic approach and still try to provide value, whether  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:00):**  it's even if you can't provide debt, you're providing banking services.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:03):**  Every company needs that.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:04):**  So we take that holistic approach.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:07):**  When we started this conversation, we talked about your role, especially Romian, with the  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:11):**  kind of sustainability title.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:13):**  When we zoom out and look at a task force or climate disclosure and SEC regulations  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:18):**  and ESG pressures, how are you seeing that impact this landscape?  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:23):**  Is that a driver for the bank?  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:24):**  And what are some of the threads you think will be pulling on into the future of the  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:28):**  ag tech space as there's more pressure on ESG and climate reporting?  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:32):**  It's a huge driver for us.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:34):**  We announced a few years ago, a $500 billion sustainable finance commitment to deploy that  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:40):**  much capital by 2030.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:42):**  And we're well on our way there.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:44):**  And so it's a huge commitment and focus by the bank.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:47):**  We're hiring a ton of new people around this initiative.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:50):**  We're building out teams around it.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:52):**  It's top of mind at the C-suite.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:20:55):**  And so when I look at sustainability, all it is just the transition from the legacy  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:00):**  economy to the sustainable economy.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:02):**  And it's going to be through innovation and technology and investment.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:07):**  And the bank realizes that because we're helping our existing clients by doing that as well.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:11):**  Not only are my tech clients and folks we talk to, but our legacy businesses as well.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:17):**  Can I ask you the question, Sarah?  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:19):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:20):**  So as an investor, how are you thinking about valuations now and what's been going on in  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:25):**  the world?  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:26):**  So, I mean, I think the kind of common wisdom is decently true that private markets lag  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:30):**  public markets.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:31):**  And so we're seeing that kind of impact now as we get into Q3.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:34):**  And I think there'll still be some rounds that were launched in Q1 closing now.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:38):**  And so the data will kind of lag.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:39):**  We sit at the seed stage.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:41):**  And so I think initially decent amount of insulation exceeds stage pricing because you're  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:45):**  not tending to look at those public market multiples.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:48):**  That said, as the deals that kind of B and C look less appealing are some of the bigger  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:53):**  firms coming down into the earlier stages and is that pushing seed stage pricing up?  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:58):**  We haven't seen that yet.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:21:59):**  And I think especially in ag tech where it's decently complex and requires that kind of  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:03):**  sector specific insight, we would argue for obvious reasons.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:07):**  We haven't seen as much of that, but that's what other VCs are certainly talking about  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:10):**  in the space that there's now shifting to be a bit of pressure on seed stage valuations.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:14):**  We'll see though.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:15):**  And I think in those early stages, if it's going to be a massive company, it's about  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:18):**  finding the right partner to work with both for the founder and for the venture side.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:22):**  So we're still like really bullish.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:23):**  We think it's a great time to invest.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:25):**  And frankly, like the climate can't wait.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:27):**  So we can talk about markets and prices all day long, but we've got a way bigger problem  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:32):**  on our doorstep.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:33):**  And that's the big opportunity that we're focused on is unlocking some of this transition  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:38):**  into a future that's ecologically sustainable and carbon positive and livable and all those  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:44):**  kinds of things.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:45):**  So we're trying to be really disciplined in the markets, but also look at the bigger opportunity  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:49):**  here and bigger challenge because that's really what it's all about.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:52):**  This kind of conversation for us and hopefully for you offers some valuable insight into  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:22:56):**  how a more legacy finance player in the ag sector is thinking about innovation.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:01):**  First, it was interesting to hear the perspective of an investor from the cleantech space and  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:06):**  what he brings to ag tech.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:07):**  This path is a well-trod one actually.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:10):**  And I think in the wake of some large scale crashing and burning in cleantech in the mid  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:13):**  to late 2000s, a lot of folks made their way to agriculture.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:17):**  I agree with Rami that there are certainly lessons to be adopted from those experiences  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:21):**  and that the market has changed so we can avoid some of the pitfalls.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:24):**  From our perspective, I think there are even more valuable lessons coming from the ag tech  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:29):**  1.0 companies, not least because in ag tech, like other tech spaces, time moves fast and  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:34):**  the ag tech and finance worlds have experienced dramatic changes in the last two years alone,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:39):**  let alone the last five or 15.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:41):**  Next, I was interested to hear that what Rami thinks is needed in the controlled environment  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:45):**  and ag space is both more tech advancement to reduce inputs like energy costs and more  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:51):**  policy.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:52):**  The first is a barrier that is going to be super hard to overcome, not least because  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:56):**  sunlight is free and electricity is not.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:23:59):**  Maybe policy, to Rami's point, could cause electricity for CEA to be free or nearly free,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:05):**  but it seems like a dangerous game on the investment side to make a bet with the hope  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:08):**  that policymakers in the US or anywhere else will take specific action in a reasonable  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:13):**  time period.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:14):**  Finally, I appreciated that on the question of what the market potential of, say, growing  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:18):**  lettuce in controlled environment agriculture actually is, there seemed to be some sunlight  
**[0:24:23-0:24:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:23):**  between Rami and Carol's positions.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:25):**  I think Rami, perhaps because he's a bit more of a tech optimist, sees much more of  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:29):**  the upside potential in indoor ag, while Carol is holding out for more data to be convinced  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:34):**  that controlled environment produce has staying power and scale potential in the market.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:38):**  In our research, we've come down a little closer to Carol's side, especially for things  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:43):**  like vertical farming, though Rami's optimism about the power of scale is understandable.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:48):**  We found at least a few examples where focusing on both costs and higher value markets can  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:53):**  alter the economics significantly.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:55):**  Overall, I think Rami and Carol were great sports in today's discussion, and though  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:24:59):**  they weren't able to share more specific stories about investments they've made or  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:02):**  passed on, we'll be keeping an eye on the movements of groups like Wells Fargo going  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:06):**  forward.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:07):**  Before we say goodbye, as promised, we wanted to share some snippets of our fundraising  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:11):**  journey in the past couple weeks.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:13):**  Matthew and I sat down to talk about what's working and what's hard, and perhaps unsurprisingly,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:17):**  we found ourselves thinking about the advice that we give to our portfolio companies.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:21):**  Have a listen.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:22):**  On one hand, it's like some sort of angst about not having enough names in the top of  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:26):**  the funnel and progressing them through.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:28):**  But on the other hand, I feel certain that I would say to a founder, unless it's a warm  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:34):**  intro, you're wasting your time.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:35):**  And I find that to be a conflict because there's some kind of reflecting back, the founder  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:42):**  of Contrarian was talking back to his original journey and just the whole idea of hustling  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:47):**  to set up a fund.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:49):**  Like he hadn't done time in an existing VC and hadn't been a successful angel investor  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:54):**  and just literally had an idea and wanted to pursue it.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:25:57):**  And I felt that resonated pretty strongly with where we came from first time around.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:02):**  So it feels like on one hand, yeah, there's gotta be just a lot of hustle, a lot of being  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:07):**  prepared to find ways to get to people.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:10):**  But I think, yeah, for sure this time around the being able to tell a story about how we  
**[0:26:15-0:26:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:15):**  are delivering impact and how it feels increasingly important to scale that up now, not later.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:24):**  The journey is up and down.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:26):**  Like you get punched in the face all the time and there's some element of just like, pick  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:31):**  yourself up, go onto the next one, move on.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:33):**  That is just part of the deal.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:35):**  But there's also, I think an underlying emotional toll that fundraising takes of how much of  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:41):**  a threat to your self-worth or confidence is it.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:44):**  And I had someone say the other day, Oh, I hate fundraising because it's like the no's  
**[0:26:47-0:26:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:47):**  are so personal.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:49):**  Whereas like for a founder, you can be about their product or their market or whatever.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:52):**  And in some ways where we came from as advisors, when we were selling advisory services, a  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:56):**  no was like, no, we don't want to work with you and Matthew.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:26:59):**  Like it was so personal or when it was just me, it was just like, Nope, you're not smart  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:02):**  enough or you can't help us.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:03):**  And so with fun one, it was awesome.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:05):**  Cause it was like, this is a product, it's a thing, it's a model.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:07):**  And so there was a little bit of distance there, but somehow for fun too, it feels personal  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:11):**  again, like you don't believe in us or our model or our impact or our portfolio and finding  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:16):**  the right balance of distance from that, that it's not a.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:19):**  Criticism of who we are as humans or what we're doing.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:23):**  Sometimes it's just not a fit.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:24):**  It's not a match.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:25):**  And yet also finding ways to build up that bank of confidence to draw down on when you  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:28):**  need it and sure there's get more sleep and work out and that kind of run a marathon,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:34):**  not a sprint.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:35):**  But another one was just like coming back to the, why, why do we do this?  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:39):**  What is important about this?  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:40):**  And I know for me getting out and seeing swarm farm and spending time with farmers who are  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:45):**  using their robots that didn't and wouldn't have their robots.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:48):**  If we hadn't invested in, been on this journey with them, not because we've built the robots,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:51):**  not because it's our company, but just like we played this catalytic role in creating  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:55):**  it and that's having this tangible impact that you could see.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:27:59):**  It was like, all right, when it gets tough or someone says no, I can draw on that to  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:28:04):**  come back to and not everyone's going to believe it or see it, but there's a bit of a deeper  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:28:08):**  pool.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:28:09):**  Thanks again for going along on this fundraising journey with us.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:28:12):**  And if you'd like to learn more about our work and how to get involved in fun too, please

**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/legacy-finance-eyes-agtech-with-wells-fargo#t=0:28:17):**  So that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

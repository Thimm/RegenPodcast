### Agtech - So What?  (2019-09-11)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:21-0:00:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:21):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest is Dr. Rachel Hay, a researcher  
**[0:00:47-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:47):**  at James Cook University. When Rachel's not writing or researching though, she is a pig  farmer. About five years ago, Rachel did her PhD on the adoption of ag tech, and her particular  focus was on the role of women. Though this work is a bit old, her findings apply today.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:05):**  Things like just how important it is to build relationships and establish trust if you're  trying to sell technology into agriculture, and how farming is often a partnership where  surprisingly or not surprisingly, women have a lot of input into decisions. Rachel starts with  
**[0:01:21-0:01:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:21):**  some overall insights about the role of women in tech adoption. Women play a large role in  the decisions about buying technology. They are computer literate. They are eager to learn more  than men. They're very happy to have a go on a computer or on technology where men were sort of  
**[0:01:36-0:01:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:36):**  a bit standoffish. And so we really found that women on the large scale, women were the decision  makers and the developers were marketing towards men. So for any ag tech companies out there,  listen up. You just might be marketing your products in the wrong places or to the wrong  
**[0:01:52-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:52):**  people. When I was collecting my data, I went to one of the technology producers and I said to him,  there was two there, I went to both of them. And I said to the first one, you know, I just interviewed  60 people face to face and out of all of them, one man was using a mobile phone and had used  
**[0:02:09-0:02:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:09):**  technology and a computer at home. Who are you marketing to? And they told me that they were  using men's magazines, parts manuals, a newspaper that had them hire male readership and a few other  things. And I said, you know, you should be marketing to women. And they said, don't be  
**[0:02:22-0:02:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:22):**  ridiculous. You don't know what you're talking about. So I went to the other developer and I said  to him the same story. I found this, you know, interviewed 60 people, rata rata. And he said,  wow, right. I'm changing my marketing strategy today. And he increased his sales of 800% over a  
**[0:02:37-0:02:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:37):**  month. So right from the get go, before I'd even written anything, you had two opposing sides,  one that was on board, ready to go ready to run. And the other one who thought I was a complete  idiot. So what did Rachel do for her PhD? Well, she interviewed farmers, women and men, with a  
**[0:02:53-0:03:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:53):**  focus on the cattle industry in Queensland. But as I know, from firsthand experience, reaching out to  farmers can be challenging, especially when you don't have a local link into the community. Rachel  overcame this challenge by running a PR campaign, using the power of content to build trust, even  
**[0:03:11-0:03:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:11):**  with people that she didn't yet know. Traditionally, people in the cattle industry, and I haven't  interviewed other farmers, so I don't know about them, but they're really shy. They really don't  like to talk to you. They don't want to tell you about what they're doing. They certainly don't  
**[0:03:25-0:03:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:25):**  want Big Brother looking over their shoulder. And so I really felt like I needed to form a  relationship with these people before I went and collected my data. So I wrote a couple of feature  articles. I had them published in the local papers to the regions that I was collecting data in.  
**[0:03:42-0:04:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:42):**  And I also went to a large agricultural show, and they have a magazine that goes with that. So I got  a feature article published in that as well. And I did something like 130 radio and newspaper  interviews leading up to my research and post research. So I really put a big effort into this  
**[0:04:01-0:04:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:01):**  media campaign. And what I really wanted to do was form that relationship with people. I wanted them  to know me before I got there. And that worked because one of the ladies came running up to me  and she said, Rachel, I'm so glad you're here. I can't wait to talk to you. I'm next. Do me next.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:15):**  And so then she basically told everybody else in the area, and they were all, as soon as I heard  who I was, they were like, yeah, we've been waiting to talk to you. This is fantastic. How can we help?  And so already they were on the front foot to be able to answer the questions that I wanted answered  
**[0:04:31-0:04:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:31):**  from a very shy and inward facing group of people. Some interesting insights for the ag tech or  developer community in terms of how to build relationships as well. Like I imagine it's just  as important doing research as it is in talking about a product or a solution or getting that  
**[0:04:46-0:05:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:46):**  kind of data collection around problems and things like that. Yeah, absolutely. I think that the  biggest barrier is that relationship to get someone to trust you and to trust what you're saying.  So trust is such a common theme that comes up in around technology adoption in agriculture.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:00):**  How does that interplay with women? Are women like more likely to be trusting of the technology  or how does the kind of intersection of women and trust and adoption happen?  I think women are more, they're busy. Okay. So they're invisible farmers. They have this,  
**[0:05:17-0:05:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:17):**  you know, insurmountable amount of work to do. They're raising families, they're doing books,  they're communicating with neighbors, they're communicating with authority, so the government,  their bank loans, all that sort of stuff. And they're helping out on the farm. So most,  
**[0:05:31-0:05:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:31):**  nine times out of 10, they're helping in the, and my data showed this, they're helping out on the  farm during the day and they're doing their book work at night. And so they're looking for a way to  make their lives easier. And in doing that, they're happy to investigate things and they are more,  
**[0:05:49-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:49):**  even more happy if they're talking face to face to someone. So they may read something in a  newspaper and then they might go and investigate it online. But if they can then go to an ag show  and talk to that person who was there, there's that triangulation of trust. I've seen it,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:02):**  I've heard it, I've read about it, now I'm meeting it. I think that's not that they're trusting.  I just think that they're actually really good researchers.  Over the course of her research, Rachel collected three rounds of data over three years.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:14):**  She noticed that for many women, the first piece of digital technology they took on was accounting  software, things to make the paperwork a little bit easier. This technology acted a bit like a  gateway drug, even though it had its challenges, after seeing the value of software and gaining  
**[0:06:30-0:06:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:30):**  confidence in the digital space, many of these women started actively searching out other  technologies, tech that could help in the farm, as well as the back office.  Using a computer for accounting was very passive. It was something that just had to be done. It was  
**[0:06:44-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:44):**  part of life and it was still painful because it was time consuming, but at least they had a  computer to do it and they kind of set and forget it and away they went. But what they were really  interested in now was walkover weighing systems and NLIS tags, so National Livestock Identification  
**[0:07:00-0:07:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:00):**  System tags, which allowed them to throw a cow over a weighing system that went beep and put a  number into a computer for them. And then all they had to do was take that data sheet and download it  to their computer at home. So they could do that in the paddocks that are outside, they had their  
**[0:07:15-0:07:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:15):**  laptops or their tablets or whatever they were using at the time. And that transfer of knowledge  from doing accounting went into that. They knew how to set it up like they'd seen a Windows screen.  You know, all of that experience that they had before had now fed into using these new  
**[0:07:32-0:07:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:32):**  technologies. So when the census came in later with computer screens and mobile phones,  that was still very, very foreign to men, but women really super embraced it.  What Rachel also found was that even though men may be using the technologies, they weren't the  
**[0:07:48-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:48):**  ones seeking it out. It was the women driving the whole process from researching solutions  through to setting it up in the business. One of the ladies, she said to me, my husband's got a  phone and I'm really wondering what he's doing with it. You know, he hides in his shed and I  
**[0:08:04-0:08:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:04):**  can't go near him and he gets cranky and really angry every time I go near him. And I really  started to wonder what he was using his phone for because they have access to the internet. And  anyway, one day his daughter snuck up on him and it turned out that he was actually looking at  
**[0:08:20-0:08:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:20):**  instructions on how to use his phone because he was too embarrassed to ask the women in his life  to teach him. And so he was really cranky that they'd caught him out trying to learn something  new. And so that was quite funny. And then the other story is John was a sheep farmer  
**[0:08:36-0:08:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:36):**  in South Australia and he had come to Rockhampton, which is quite a way away from each other,  to go to the beef week cattle show. And he was telling me it was the first time he'd ever gotten  off his property and in the 30 years he'd been a farmer. And he brought his phone over to me and  
**[0:08:52-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:52):**  he had it in his hand and he was pointing at the screen and he's saying, look at that. I know that  last night I lost 50,000 litres of water while I was away. Now, if I had not had my phone, I  wouldn't have known to be able to ring my neighbour. And then he went over and he fixed it.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:08):**  It's all fixed now. Something got stuck under the float and it's fine. And I said, well, what are  you showing me there, John? I was trying to work out. Can he show me like, what does he, does he  know what he's using? I was trying to get him to see if he could tell me if it's an app or not.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:20):**  And he said, I don't know. I just pressed this button and it all comes up. And he was showing  me pictures of his sheep drinking at their water stations and graphs and all sorts of wonderful  things. And I said, it's an app. Do you know what an app is? And he said, no. He said, it's just a  
**[0:09:33-0:09:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:33):**  button on my phone. I said, did you put that app on your phone? And he said, no, Kate did. Now,  Kate's his wife. And I said, ah, Kate did it. And he said, yeah. And I said, did you set up your  phone? He said, no, Kate did it. He said, did you buy your phone? He said, no, no, Kate did it.  
**[0:09:48-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:48):**  He said, no, no, Kate did that. So even though he was using that technology, he was still absolutely  relying on Kate to buy it, you know, decide on what sort of, which phone was going to suit him  because they're out in the back of never never. And so they had to have special phones with special  
**[0:10:05-0:10:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:05):**  aerials and, you know, made sure that it was with their connectivity and all of that sort of stuff.  So I went over and talked to Kate and she said, yes, absolutely. I do everything. And he just  plays with it. The dynamic between them is, you know, from in the very first round of data  
**[0:10:21-0:10:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:21):**  collection, one, the only fellow that had a mobile phone or a smartphone back then was 76 years old.  And I asked him what he did with it. And he said, my wife rings me. Now it was a smartphone. He  could have looked at the internet. He could have checked the weather. He could have sent a text.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:36):**  No, I've only got it so my wife can ring me. While Rachel was conducting her research,  smartphones hit the market and became mainstream. And Rachel was able to see a number of ways that  this technology was being used on farms. When I first started collecting, no one had a mobile  
**[0:10:51-0:11:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:51):**  phone, no one had a smartphone. So now in that third year of data, every single person had one.  The first thing that was on it was the weather. They mostly use it for the weather, but for fires  as well. So when it's rain, when there's a fire, they like to check their market prices on it,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:05):**  and they use it to find spare parts. So I think if we did the round of data collection again now,  I think you'd see a more social side of things. I know that they would be heavy Facebook users,  but not necessarily to keep up with the gossip, but to look at buy, swap, and sell pages,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:22):**  to talk to their neighbors, keep in contact with their family, that sort of thing. So  still a tool rather than a social life, if that makes sense.  Yeah. I wanted to ask how you imagine things are changing, like in some ways,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:34):**  mobile phones and even smartphones are kind of like, they're not specific to agriculture in any  way. And so I wonder now that that's really well diffused, like most people have a mobile phone and  even tablets and home computers and things like that. Do you imagine the same dynamics,  
**[0:11:50-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:50):**  like the same kind of really influential role of women will continue to be true around more  advanced analytics and robotics and the kind of next wave of technology and agriculture?  In the cattle industry, you will always find that the women are your forefront. And I think that  
**[0:12:05-0:12:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:05):**  while men are starting to understand things like using the technology, like having the phone and  how to get their apps and using the sensor technology, they're still on that very technical  side of things. So the women will go and research it. They'll look it up. They'll still talk to  
**[0:12:20-0:12:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:20):**  their partner. In fact, in the first round of data, the women were making the majority of  decisions about what to buy. And in the third round of data, it was becoming a more joint  decision. So while the women were still doing the research, they were talking to their husbands who  
**[0:12:35-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:35):**  had a better understanding of what they wanted from the technology. And so then they would draw  into that conversation about what to find. And then the women would still make the purchase,  decide on the budget, that side of things. And then the men will do the install and the onsite  
**[0:12:51-0:13:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:51):**  maintenance of it. But if you're feeding back to a computer and something went wrong, that would  come back to the women. So it's more of a partnership and women are getting more recognition  in that partnership through being marketed to now. So women are starting to receive that  
**[0:13:08-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:08):**  information about technology rather than just the men. They're starting to become more considered in  that process. But there's still those two roles, I feel, because I haven't done any research on  that. But I feel intuitively that's what it is. And I speak to farmers all the time and they tell  
**[0:13:24-0:13:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:24):**  me this, but I obviously haven't collected the data on it. There are many implications of Rachel's  research, both for ag tech developers and for government departments and extension officers.  One key is the importance of storytelling. Farmers are the original storytellers. And so they really  
**[0:13:44-0:14:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:44):**  want to hear what's going on in a story like way. They don't want to read a report. They don't want  to have an extension officer come and tell them. Another study that I've done, one of the largest  findings in that was farmers do not want to be told what to do by government agents or young  
**[0:14:00-0:14:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:00):**  people who've just come out of university. But if you've got a story that you can tell through  social media or through a newsletter or something along those lines, then that would be much better  received by a farmer than a report or an instruction. And so I guess out of several  
**[0:14:17-0:14:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:17):**  pieces of research that I'm doing at the moment is that there is a big barrier there between how  to adopt. So if a farmer wants to adopt something and a salesperson, for example, is telling them,  so a marketer or a developer is doing their own marketing, their first instinct is that someone's  
**[0:14:33-0:14:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:33):**  trying to take money off me. Someone's having a go at me. I don't know how to make that decision  because it's a marketing ploy and no matter what, they want me to buy their product. But if a farmer  is starting to look at something and will use sensor technology because it's easy, a sensor  
**[0:14:47-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:47):**  technology that they want, that they can use on their farm, that they have connectivity to,  and the extension officer is telling a story about that based on research, then that's an  increase that increases the trustworthiness of that information. And so again, there's that  
**[0:15:04-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:04):**  triangulation of information that is building trust between the farmer and the extension officer  and the farmer and the product. Out of across all of the research that I'm doing, not just out of my  PhD at the moment, there is that need to develop relationships between women and technology,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:19):**  which is happening, men and technology, which is happening via women, and then that hierarchy of  information from extension. One idea that Rachel and I tossed around was that tech itself can help  to improve these relationships, helping to build trust between farmers, technology, and even  
**[0:15:36-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:36):**  extension. We're already seeing this on social media, as well as dedicated forums and websites  that focus on ag tech and connecting farmers with new solutions. So what are Rachel's overall  takeaways from her research? Are we making progress to include and recognize the role that women play  
**[0:15:53-0:16:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:53):**  in ag tech and adoption? And how is that role changing as technology advances? Rachel gives a  bit of a summary. I guess that the biggest thing that came out of my research was that women are  often not noticed in farming. And you know, there's this terminology that's running around called  
**[0:16:08-0:16:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:08):**  invisible farmers. It's a bit of a cliche, but it's true. You know, they do a lot of work that's  not recognized. And my research, along with a lot of other things that were happening at the time,  was able to open this up and start developing the recognition of women in agriculture. So if you  
**[0:16:22-0:16:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:22):**  look at the trends before my research and other research that came after mine and during mine,  women were seen as, they were talked about in a passive way. So they were there, but they weren't  really focused on. There's a whole study I read on women in decision making in farming. And they  
**[0:16:38-0:16:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:38):**  actually interviewed men about the decisions that women made. And then they based all of these  decisions on that research that interviewed zero women about women's decisions. So from a research  point of view, my research and others around me opened that up. And there's a lot more research  
**[0:16:53-0:17:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:53):**  coming into that, which is feeding into how those decisions are being made now at more of a  partnership level. So men and women together rather than men being seen. And so that's bringing  a level of interest and respect towards women and partnerships making decisions in farming.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:11):**  And as those partnerships get strengthened through those decision making, more technology is adopted,  more production is being had and more profits, hopefully in the long run, are being made. But  at the moment, you know, they're investing in technology, which is not, you know, it's an outward  
**[0:17:28-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:28):**  spend at the moment. So, you know, it's happening and I can see it happening. More of the cattle  farmers that I know now are using that technology to develop their way of life. They're spending  more time working in either closer to home farm stuff or their families than running around the  
**[0:17:45-0:18:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:45):**  property looking at bore pumps or waters or whatever. And also it's given them a little  bit more freedom over their working staff. So for example, a lot of the farmers that I know at the  moment have got rollover activation devices on all of their quad bikes and their cars and things.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:18:00):**  So from a health and safety point of view, they're allowing their staff members to do a little  bit more of the work, which is freeing them up to be a little bit more of their family. You know,  so there's lots and lots of implications from that adoption of technology. I think that's a great  
**[0:18:15-0:18:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:18:15):**  way to end and a hopeful view of the future and the role of not only this research, but like of  women in ag more broadly and how it can kind of unlock the potential and the benefits of ag tech.  Thank you very much for having me.

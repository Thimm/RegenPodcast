### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 20:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:11-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:11):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:17):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:21):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:27):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:30-0:00:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:30):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest is Dr. Rachel Hay, a researcher  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:47):**  at James Cook University. When Rachel's not writing or researching though, she is a pig  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:52):**  farmer. About five years ago, Rachel did her PhD on the adoption of ag tech, and her particular  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:00:58):**  focus was on the role of women. Though this work is a bit old, her findings apply today.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:05):**  Things like just how important it is to build relationships and establish trust if you're  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:09):**  trying to sell technology into agriculture, and how farming is often a partnership where  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:15):**  surprisingly or not surprisingly, women have a lot of input into decisions. Rachel starts with  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:21):**  some overall insights about the role of women in tech adoption. Women play a large role in  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:26):**  the decisions about buying technology. They are computer literate. They are eager to learn more  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:31):**  than men. They're very happy to have a go on a computer or on technology where men were sort of  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:36):**  a bit standoffish. And so we really found that women on the large scale, women were the decision  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:42):**  makers and the developers were marketing towards men. So for any ag tech companies out there,  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:48):**  listen up. You just might be marketing your products in the wrong places or to the wrong  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:52):**  people. When I was collecting my data, I went to one of the technology producers and I said to him,  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:01:58):**  there was two there, I went to both of them. And I said to the first one, you know, I just interviewed  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:03):**  60 people face to face and out of all of them, one man was using a mobile phone and had used  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:09):**  technology and a computer at home. Who are you marketing to? And they told me that they were  
**[0:02:13-0:02:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:13):**  using men's magazines, parts manuals, a newspaper that had them hire male readership and a few other  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:20):**  things. And I said, you know, you should be marketing to women. And they said, don't be  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:22):**  ridiculous. You don't know what you're talking about. So I went to the other developer and I said  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:27):**  to him the same story. I found this, you know, interviewed 60 people, rata rata. And he said,  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:31):**  wow, right. I'm changing my marketing strategy today. And he increased his sales of 800% over a  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:37):**  month. So right from the get go, before I'd even written anything, you had two opposing sides,  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:43):**  one that was on board, ready to go ready to run. And the other one who thought I was a complete  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:47):**  idiot. So what did Rachel do for her PhD? Well, she interviewed farmers, women and men, with a  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:53):**  focus on the cattle industry in Queensland. But as I know, from firsthand experience, reaching out to  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:02:59):**  farmers can be challenging, especially when you don't have a local link into the community. Rachel  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:05):**  overcame this challenge by running a PR campaign, using the power of content to build trust, even  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:11):**  with people that she didn't yet know. Traditionally, people in the cattle industry, and I haven't  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:16):**  interviewed other farmers, so I don't know about them, but they're really shy. They really don't  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:21):**  like to talk to you. They don't want to tell you about what they're doing. They certainly don't  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:25):**  want Big Brother looking over their shoulder. And so I really felt like I needed to form a  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:29):**  relationship with these people before I went and collected my data. So I wrote a couple of feature  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:36):**  articles. I had them published in the local papers to the regions that I was collecting data in.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:42):**  And I also went to a large agricultural show, and they have a magazine that goes with that. So I got  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:48):**  a feature article published in that as well. And I did something like 130 radio and newspaper  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:03:55):**  interviews leading up to my research and post research. So I really put a big effort into this  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:01):**  media campaign. And what I really wanted to do was form that relationship with people. I wanted them  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:05):**  to know me before I got there. And that worked because one of the ladies came running up to me  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:10):**  and she said, Rachel, I'm so glad you're here. I can't wait to talk to you. I'm next. Do me next.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:15):**  And so then she basically told everybody else in the area, and they were all, as soon as I heard  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:20):**  who I was, they were like, yeah, we've been waiting to talk to you. This is fantastic. How can we help?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:25):**  And so already they were on the front foot to be able to answer the questions that I wanted answered  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:31):**  from a very shy and inward facing group of people. Some interesting insights for the ag tech or  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:37):**  developer community in terms of how to build relationships as well. Like I imagine it's just  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:41):**  as important doing research as it is in talking about a product or a solution or getting that  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:46):**  kind of data collection around problems and things like that. Yeah, absolutely. I think that the  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:51):**  biggest barrier is that relationship to get someone to trust you and to trust what you're saying.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:04:55):**  So trust is such a common theme that comes up in around technology adoption in agriculture.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:00):**  How does that interplay with women? Are women like more likely to be trusting of the technology  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:06):**  or how does the kind of intersection of women and trust and adoption happen?  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:10):**  I think women are more, they're busy. Okay. So they're invisible farmers. They have this,  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:17):**  you know, insurmountable amount of work to do. They're raising families, they're doing books,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:23):**  they're communicating with neighbors, they're communicating with authority, so the government,  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:27):**  their bank loans, all that sort of stuff. And they're helping out on the farm. So most,  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:31):**  nine times out of 10, they're helping in the, and my data showed this, they're helping out on the  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:36):**  farm during the day and they're doing their book work at night. And so they're looking for a way to  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:41):**  make their lives easier. And in doing that, they're happy to investigate things and they are more,  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:49):**  even more happy if they're talking face to face to someone. So they may read something in a  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:53):**  newspaper and then they might go and investigate it online. But if they can then go to an ag show  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:05:58):**  and talk to that person who was there, there's that triangulation of trust. I've seen it,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:02):**  I've heard it, I've read about it, now I'm meeting it. I think that's not that they're trusting.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:07):**  I just think that they're actually really good researchers.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:10):**  Over the course of her research, Rachel collected three rounds of data over three years.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:14):**  She noticed that for many women, the first piece of digital technology they took on was accounting  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:19):**  software, things to make the paperwork a little bit easier. This technology acted a bit like a  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:25):**  gateway drug, even though it had its challenges, after seeing the value of software and gaining  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:30):**  confidence in the digital space, many of these women started actively searching out other  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:35):**  technologies, tech that could help in the farm, as well as the back office.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:39):**  Using a computer for accounting was very passive. It was something that just had to be done. It was  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:44):**  part of life and it was still painful because it was time consuming, but at least they had a  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:49):**  computer to do it and they kind of set and forget it and away they went. But what they were really  
**[0:06:53-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:06:53):**  interested in now was walkover weighing systems and NLIS tags, so National Livestock Identification  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:00):**  System tags, which allowed them to throw a cow over a weighing system that went beep and put a  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:06):**  number into a computer for them. And then all they had to do was take that data sheet and download it  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:11):**  to their computer at home. So they could do that in the paddocks that are outside, they had their  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:15):**  laptops or their tablets or whatever they were using at the time. And that transfer of knowledge  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:21):**  from doing accounting went into that. They knew how to set it up like they'd seen a Windows screen.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:27):**  You know, all of that experience that they had before had now fed into using these new  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:32):**  technologies. So when the census came in later with computer screens and mobile phones,  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:39):**  that was still very, very foreign to men, but women really super embraced it.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:44):**  What Rachel also found was that even though men may be using the technologies, they weren't the  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:48):**  ones seeking it out. It was the women driving the whole process from researching solutions  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:54):**  through to setting it up in the business. One of the ladies, she said to me, my husband's got a  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:07:59):**  phone and I'm really wondering what he's doing with it. You know, he hides in his shed and I  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:04):**  can't go near him and he gets cranky and really angry every time I go near him. And I really  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:10):**  started to wonder what he was using his phone for because they have access to the internet. And  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:15):**  anyway, one day his daughter snuck up on him and it turned out that he was actually looking at  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:20):**  instructions on how to use his phone because he was too embarrassed to ask the women in his life  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:26):**  to teach him. And so he was really cranky that they'd caught him out trying to learn something  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:31):**  new. And so that was quite funny. And then the other story is John was a sheep farmer  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:36):**  in South Australia and he had come to Rockhampton, which is quite a way away from each other,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:42):**  to go to the beef week cattle show. And he was telling me it was the first time he'd ever gotten  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:47):**  off his property and in the 30 years he'd been a farmer. And he brought his phone over to me and  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:52):**  he had it in his hand and he was pointing at the screen and he's saying, look at that. I know that  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:08:57):**  last night I lost 50,000 litres of water while I was away. Now, if I had not had my phone, I  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:04):**  wouldn't have known to be able to ring my neighbour. And then he went over and he fixed it.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:08):**  It's all fixed now. Something got stuck under the float and it's fine. And I said, well, what are  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:12):**  you showing me there, John? I was trying to work out. Can he show me like, what does he, does he  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:16):**  know what he's using? I was trying to get him to see if he could tell me if it's an app or not.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:20):**  And he said, I don't know. I just pressed this button and it all comes up. And he was showing  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:24):**  me pictures of his sheep drinking at their water stations and graphs and all sorts of wonderful  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:29):**  things. And I said, it's an app. Do you know what an app is? And he said, no. He said, it's just a  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:33):**  button on my phone. I said, did you put that app on your phone? And he said, no, Kate did. Now,  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:38):**  Kate's his wife. And I said, ah, Kate did it. And he said, yeah. And I said, did you set up your  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:44):**  phone? He said, no, Kate did it. He said, did you buy your phone? He said, no, no, Kate did it.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:48):**  He said, no, no, Kate did that. So even though he was using that technology, he was still absolutely  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:09:55):**  relying on Kate to buy it, you know, decide on what sort of, which phone was going to suit him  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:00):**  because they're out in the back of never never. And so they had to have special phones with special  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:05):**  aerials and, you know, made sure that it was with their connectivity and all of that sort of stuff.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:09):**  So I went over and talked to Kate and she said, yes, absolutely. I do everything. And he just  
**[0:10:13-0:10:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:13):**  plays with it. The dynamic between them is, you know, from in the very first round of data  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:21):**  collection, one, the only fellow that had a mobile phone or a smartphone back then was 76 years old.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:27):**  And I asked him what he did with it. And he said, my wife rings me. Now it was a smartphone. He  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:32):**  could have looked at the internet. He could have checked the weather. He could have sent a text.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:36):**  No, I've only got it so my wife can ring me. While Rachel was conducting her research,  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:41):**  smartphones hit the market and became mainstream. And Rachel was able to see a number of ways that  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:47):**  this technology was being used on farms. When I first started collecting, no one had a mobile  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:51):**  phone, no one had a smartphone. So now in that third year of data, every single person had one.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:10:56):**  The first thing that was on it was the weather. They mostly use it for the weather, but for fires  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:00):**  as well. So when it's rain, when there's a fire, they like to check their market prices on it,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:05):**  and they use it to find spare parts. So I think if we did the round of data collection again now,  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:11):**  I think you'd see a more social side of things. I know that they would be heavy Facebook users,  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:16):**  but not necessarily to keep up with the gossip, but to look at buy, swap, and sell pages,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:22):**  to talk to their neighbors, keep in contact with their family, that sort of thing. So  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:26):**  still a tool rather than a social life, if that makes sense.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:30):**  Yeah. I wanted to ask how you imagine things are changing, like in some ways,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:34):**  mobile phones and even smartphones are kind of like, they're not specific to agriculture in any  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:40):**  way. And so I wonder now that that's really well diffused, like most people have a mobile phone and  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:45):**  even tablets and home computers and things like that. Do you imagine the same dynamics,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:50):**  like the same kind of really influential role of women will continue to be true around more  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:11:54):**  advanced analytics and robotics and the kind of next wave of technology and agriculture?  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:00):**  In the cattle industry, you will always find that the women are your forefront. And I think that  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:05):**  while men are starting to understand things like using the technology, like having the phone and  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:11):**  how to get their apps and using the sensor technology, they're still on that very technical  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:16):**  side of things. So the women will go and research it. They'll look it up. They'll still talk to  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:20):**  their partner. In fact, in the first round of data, the women were making the majority of  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:25):**  decisions about what to buy. And in the third round of data, it was becoming a more joint  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:30):**  decision. So while the women were still doing the research, they were talking to their husbands who  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:35):**  had a better understanding of what they wanted from the technology. And so then they would draw  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:40):**  into that conversation about what to find. And then the women would still make the purchase,  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:45):**  decide on the budget, that side of things. And then the men will do the install and the onsite  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:51):**  maintenance of it. But if you're feeding back to a computer and something went wrong, that would  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:12:56):**  come back to the women. So it's more of a partnership and women are getting more recognition  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:02):**  in that partnership through being marketed to now. So women are starting to receive that  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:08):**  information about technology rather than just the men. They're starting to become more considered in  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:14):**  that process. But there's still those two roles, I feel, because I haven't done any research on  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:20):**  that. But I feel intuitively that's what it is. And I speak to farmers all the time and they tell  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:24):**  me this, but I obviously haven't collected the data on it. There are many implications of Rachel's  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:29):**  research, both for ag tech developers and for government departments and extension officers.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:35):**  One key is the importance of storytelling. Farmers are the original storytellers. And so they really  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:44):**  want to hear what's going on in a story like way. They don't want to read a report. They don't want  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:50):**  to have an extension officer come and tell them. Another study that I've done, one of the largest  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:13:56):**  findings in that was farmers do not want to be told what to do by government agents or young  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:00):**  people who've just come out of university. But if you've got a story that you can tell through  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:05):**  social media or through a newsletter or something along those lines, then that would be much better  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:11):**  received by a farmer than a report or an instruction. And so I guess out of several  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:17):**  pieces of research that I'm doing at the moment is that there is a big barrier there between how  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:21):**  to adopt. So if a farmer wants to adopt something and a salesperson, for example, is telling them,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:27):**  so a marketer or a developer is doing their own marketing, their first instinct is that someone's  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:33):**  trying to take money off me. Someone's having a go at me. I don't know how to make that decision  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:37):**  because it's a marketing ploy and no matter what, they want me to buy their product. But if a farmer  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:43):**  is starting to look at something and will use sensor technology because it's easy, a sensor  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:47):**  technology that they want, that they can use on their farm, that they have connectivity to,  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:51):**  and the extension officer is telling a story about that based on research, then that's an  
**[0:14:57-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:14:57):**  increase that increases the trustworthiness of that information. And so again, there's that  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:04):**  triangulation of information that is building trust between the farmer and the extension officer  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:08):**  and the farmer and the product. Out of across all of the research that I'm doing, not just out of my  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:13):**  PhD at the moment, there is that need to develop relationships between women and technology,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:19):**  which is happening, men and technology, which is happening via women, and then that hierarchy of  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:25):**  information from extension. One idea that Rachel and I tossed around was that tech itself can help  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:31):**  to improve these relationships, helping to build trust between farmers, technology, and even  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:36):**  extension. We're already seeing this on social media, as well as dedicated forums and websites  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:42):**  that focus on ag tech and connecting farmers with new solutions. So what are Rachel's overall  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:47):**  takeaways from her research? Are we making progress to include and recognize the role that women play  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:53):**  in ag tech and adoption? And how is that role changing as technology advances? Rachel gives a  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:15:58):**  bit of a summary. I guess that the biggest thing that came out of my research was that women are  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:03):**  often not noticed in farming. And you know, there's this terminology that's running around called  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:08):**  invisible farmers. It's a bit of a cliche, but it's true. You know, they do a lot of work that's  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:12):**  not recognized. And my research, along with a lot of other things that were happening at the time,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:17):**  was able to open this up and start developing the recognition of women in agriculture. So if you  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:22):**  look at the trends before my research and other research that came after mine and during mine,  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:28):**  women were seen as, they were talked about in a passive way. So they were there, but they weren't  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:31):**  really focused on. There's a whole study I read on women in decision making in farming. And they  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:38):**  actually interviewed men about the decisions that women made. And then they based all of these  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:43):**  decisions on that research that interviewed zero women about women's decisions. So from a research  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:49):**  point of view, my research and others around me opened that up. And there's a lot more research  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:53):**  coming into that, which is feeding into how those decisions are being made now at more of a  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:16:59):**  partnership level. So men and women together rather than men being seen. And so that's bringing  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:04):**  a level of interest and respect towards women and partnerships making decisions in farming.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:11):**  And as those partnerships get strengthened through those decision making, more technology is adopted,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:17):**  more production is being had and more profits, hopefully in the long run, are being made. But  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:24):**  at the moment, you know, they're investing in technology, which is not, you know, it's an outward  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:28):**  spend at the moment. So, you know, it's happening and I can see it happening. More of the cattle  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:33):**  farmers that I know now are using that technology to develop their way of life. They're spending  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:38):**  more time working in either closer to home farm stuff or their families than running around the  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:45):**  property looking at bore pumps or waters or whatever. And also it's given them a little  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:50):**  bit more freedom over their working staff. So for example, a lot of the farmers that I know at the  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:17:55):**  moment have got rollover activation devices on all of their quad bikes and their cars and things.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:18:00):**  So from a health and safety point of view, they're allowing their staff members to do a little  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:18:05):**  bit more of the work, which is freeing them up to be a little bit more of their family. You know,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:18:10):**  so there's lots and lots of implications from that adoption of technology. I think that's a great  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:18:15):**  way to end and a hopeful view of the future and the role of not only this research, but like of  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=424225#t=0:18:19):**  women in ag more broadly and how it can kind of unlock the potential and the benefits of ag tech.

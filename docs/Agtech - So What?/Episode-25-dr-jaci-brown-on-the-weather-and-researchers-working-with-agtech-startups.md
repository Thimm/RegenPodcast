### Agtech - So What?  (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 18:30:18)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:00):**  Hi everyone, you're listening to BushTech, an agtech podcast that gets to the so what  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:04):**  of agtech. We'll bring you interesting things from interesting people and I'm one of your  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:09):**  co-hosts Simon Mathewson. And I'm your other co-host Sarah Nolette. On this podcast we  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:15):**  will bring in leading speakers in technology, entrepreneurship, investment, agriculture,  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:20):**  science and anything else you can think of and we can find in the world of agtech. We'll  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:24):**  look to demystify it so that we're getting to the so what. What does it really mean for  
**[0:00:28-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:28):**  farmers and for the broader agricultural industry?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:42):**  So Jackie Brown, welcome to the BushTech podcast. Thanks so much for joining me.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:46):**  Thank you. Always love a chance to talk about the weather.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:48):**  Yes, and we will be talking about that today. I will just give our listeners a caveat. We  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:52):**  are sitting outside the Australian Farm Institute Conference and so we've tried to find the  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:00:57):**  quietest space possible but apologies in advance for any interruptions or loud noises. So please  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:02):**  forgive this but I wanted to catch Jackie while she's in town because she is such an  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:06):**  expert on this space and has recently had some pretty interesting interactions with  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:10):**  the agtech and startup community that I wanted to talk about today. But first, Jackie, you  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:16):**  are a senior research scientist and the team leader for weather and climate decisions team  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:21):**  and the co-coordinator of digital ag at CSIRO. Hopefully I got that right. But tell me a  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:26):**  bit about your background and how you ended up in the role you are in today.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:29):**  Sure. So I loved mathematics as a kid. Maths was just the most beautiful thing in the world  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:36):**  to me. It just worked perfectly and I knew that that's what I wanted a career in. So  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:41):**  I went off to university to just study maths and hope for the best really and I stumbled  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:45):**  across climate and oceanography and couldn't believe that I could do something I loved  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:51):**  and actually make a difference to the world. So I was really passionate. I went on to do  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:01:56):**  a PhD with the CSIRO and became a climate scientist studying things like El Nino Southern  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:01):**  Oscillation and drought in Australia. And then a couple of years ago, instead of just  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:06):**  being a theoretical climate scientist, which was fun for a while, I wanted to move more  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:10):**  into agriculture and start to make a difference and deliver some of this research where it  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:15):**  would really matter and change the way people can make decisions and become more productive.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:21):**  So did you have a background in ag at all or you just saw ag as an impact area and wanted  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:25):**  to dig into it more? It's been a huge learning curve for me when it comes to agriculture.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:30):**  I know lots about climate, so I feel like I'm useful. But figuring out what that means  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:35):**  is really challenging, whether that's for wheat, for cattle, for cherries, for cauliflowers,  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:40):**  they all need climate in a slightly different way. And I need to get my head across all  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:45):**  those different spaces. Yep, that is definitely one of the things I found about ag that even  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:49):**  if you think you're an expert in one thing, there's so many different sectors and you  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:53):**  can't possibly be an expert in all of them, maybe in a particular area, like you can be  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:02:57):**  a weather expert in all of them. So I think that's an interesting thing about agriculture  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:01):**  that people often miss. I think that's why I find it so much fun because I can't be the  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:06):**  expert in everything. I really love teamwork and collaboration. So I'll be in the room  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:11):**  with a team of experts in so many different other things, whether that's wheat or soil  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:15):**  or the technology. And we work together to build something, but I have a contribution  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:20):**  to make. Yes, awesome. I saw you in action doing that a bit a few weeks ago when we were  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:25):**  in a room and some of your team was there and you were like number one hustler, like  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:29):**  bringing your team around and saying, guys, we got to do this, guys, we got to go do that  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:32):**  and meet these people. So that was awesome to see. I always get overexcited about everything.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:36):**  I want to do everything all at once. That's my biggest flaw. No, or your biggest asset  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:40):**  maybe. So one of the things that gets talked about and it was touched on at the conference  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:44):**  here today is around commercialization of research and how CSIRO has the ON program  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:49):**  and other initiatives to think more about end users and think more about how this deep  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:53):**  science and research can be used in the real world. So I'm curious what your experience  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:03:58):**  has been with that and how you think about your research and how it can be used or is  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:02):**  being used in agriculture. So in years past when I was a more traditional scientist, my  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:09):**  goal was to write a paper, to find some research money, write a paper, maybe 10 people in the  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:14):**  world would read it and that's a hit for me. And now I've learned to think a lot more differently.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:20):**  So who needs this and figuring out whether it's worth studying something before you do  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:26):**  it has been a big lesson. So my team went off to look at horticulture apps for a while.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:32):**  We thought this is the next best thing. We'd love to make this app for people growing cauliflowers  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:36):**  or lettuce, whatever. We can solve their problems. So instead of going off and finding half a  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:43):**  million dollars and spending two years building this, we thought we'll spend two days in like  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:47):**  a little incubator, really looking at the customer, throwing around some ideas, got  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:51):**  a diverse group of people to talk with us from different fields. And at the end of the  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:04:56):**  two days we decided this is a really bad idea. This is not the way to go. It's not our expertise.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:03):**  We shouldn't be in this space. And that was the best two days ever. And we used the learnings  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:08):**  from that in so many other ways to figure out how to operate.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:12):**  And so how did you know to do that? Because like you said, that's not the traditional  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:16):**  research approach to go in an incubator and get diverse perspectives and think about,  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:19):**  I mean, maybe it is, but how did you even know that that was a process that you should  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:23):**  try to do?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:26):**  One of the new CSIRO initiatives over the last few years has been the ON program. So  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:30):**  they do launch camps, which is the two day version and the longer acceleration programs.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:36):**  And they've been changing the way scientists are thinking, challenging us to think about  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:41):**  business and commercialization and users and actually pick up the phone and talk to the  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:46):**  customer. And that's a really bizarre thing to do as a scientist. Often, you know, you're  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:50):**  the expert and you sit there and you study something and you're a bit intimidated to  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:05:54):**  just pick up the phone until you've got it perfect. We obsess about things being perfect.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:00):**  So I can't talk to you till I know everything about my topic and all the information. And  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:05):**  then when I've got it polished, I'll ask you about it. Instead, I pick it up, you know,  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:10):**  I've just got this idea and I was wondering what your problems were and how I can help.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:14):**  And rather than coming to you with a solution, come to you and ask questions. And that's  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:21):**  opened up so many opportunities of problems I didn't know were out there.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:25):**  And so how does that in practice actually work? Like has CSIRO and have your team been  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:30):**  open to, right, okay, we're going to go visit a bunch of farms or do you have like networks  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:33):**  of farmers that you call and is CSIRO happy for you to go on a road trip and talk to them  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:37):**  like kind of in practice? What does that actually look like?  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:40):**  We love road trips. I can't get enough of road trips. I love going out there. And, you  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:44):**  know, if you sit down with a farmer and say, tell me about the weather, they love to talk  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:48):**  to you. We went to Burchep and they helped us organize, the Burchep cropping group helped  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:53):**  us organize a series of interviews. I think we spent two days, eight hours nonstop for  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:06:59):**  the two days talking to farmers at the kitchen table for an hour long each. We just sat down  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:05):**  and say, tell us what you're thinking. Tell us what last year was like. Tell us if you  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:10):**  could have a crystal ball to know anything about the weather, what would it be? Because  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:13):**  often they don't think about things because they don't think we can do it. So finding  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:17):**  out what they would like if they could have anything in the world is really interesting  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:21):**  and some things we can't do, but some we can start to do. And some of it's just about repackaging  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:28):**  the way we have the information in the way they want it and learning how they think.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:32):**  And so is there, from that trip or others, is there an example of something that was  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:36):**  like counterintuitive or something that you thought they'd want this but they actually  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:39):**  wanted that or they wanted it this way and you actually needed to, you know, figure out  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:43):**  how to get it to them in a different way than you thought?  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:45):**  Oh, so many. And you laugh at yourself as a scientist because it's always obvious after  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:49):**  the fact. You go in there with such a set idea of how things work. So I knew that farmers  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:07:55):**  had maybe four or five weather apps on their phone and I thought, oh, this must be a real  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:00):**  problem for them. They've got to look at five different places to know what the weather  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:03):**  is and I'd like to make the best app. So if I can go and talk to them and find out which  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:08):**  bit of each they're looking at and put that all into one place, that will save them a  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:12):**  lot of time and they'll have the superior product. So that's what we went out to talk  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:16):**  to and we asked them to tell us about their apps. And what was really surprising was it  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:22):**  wasn't that they all had something different. The way they had confidence in the weather  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:27):**  forecast was each of those four apps agreed, then they knew what was going to happen. And  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:31):**  if they disagreed, then they were uncertain about what the weather would do. Now that  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:36):**  was interesting because to my mind, that's not how it works because often those all apps  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:40):**  all source a very similar model. And when the forecast is in that app, it actually comes  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:47):**  with a confidence rating anyway. So I didn't understand why you'd need to look elsewhere,  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:51):**  but that's the way I think, not the way the users are thinking. So the challenge now is  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:08:56):**  not to make the app to end all apps, but to think better about how we can communicate  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:02):**  uncertainty in the weather forecast in a way people can actually use it and understand  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:06):**  it.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:07):**  And that's really interesting. There's a whole field around user centered design and user  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:12):**  interfaces and communicating information. Is that now a skill set that you or your team  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:16):**  have to go learn about or is that something that you partner with others to do? It's a  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:22):**  whole different discipline or is it something that you guys can figure out and build capacity  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:26):**  for doing that internally and working with users? How do you solve that problem?  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:30):**  For us, it's been a lot of fun learning how to do these sort of approaches and interview  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:34):**  people and understand, but we don't do it all ourselves. One of the advantages of being  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:39):**  somewhere like CSIRO is a huge number of disciplines that we can draw on. We've got social scientists  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:45):**  and user experience people, but we also draw from outside. We use Square V Design when  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:50):**  we go and work with a birch of cropping group and they bring us along a journey and say,  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:09:55):**  come on scientists, look at this. And we also help them, I think, because we've got that  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:00):**  deep domain knowledge. So sitting at the kitchen table with the farmer, they want to talk to  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:05):**  the scientists. They like the scientists. They're really enjoying having a chat with  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:09):**  us and discussing us, but we've also got that user experience or social scientists looking  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:14):**  at how we communicate and how to interpret what's being said and what we can take away  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:18):**  from that discussion. Yeah, interesting. And so even more like cross  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:23):**  sector across skill collaborations needed, I think that's one of the insights that I've  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:27):**  had in ag is that there's all these other skills that exist in other industries, whether  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:31):**  it's user experience design or science or whatever need to kind of come into ag. And  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:36):**  there often needs to be these translators, like people who can sort of speak different  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:40):**  languages that can understand and empathize with what the farmer's going through, but  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:44):**  maybe also knows science or also knows how to build technology. You need these kind of  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:48):**  translator functions. But I imagine that's not like you sound like you have fun doing  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:53):**  this. I imagine it's not super comfortable for lots of researchers or is it something  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:10:57):**  that everyone likes to go do? Do some people want to just stay and do the science and not  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:00):**  worry about that? I think we all love getting out and realizing  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:04):**  that what we do might be important. I don't think anyone says, I just want to stay in  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:09):**  my little box. There's a lot of value in seeing how you make a difference. And I've talked  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:14):**  to other researchers that were almost in tears realizing, wow, you're that thing I write  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:19):**  that I don't think much about. That's someone's livelihood. And it makes a real difference  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:23):**  to the way you go to work each day. Yeah, I think that's something that is special  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:28):**  also about agriculture. Absolutely. Because these things just matter so much to people's  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:32):**  livelihoods and regional communities. And yeah, it's actually so tangible.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:38):**  Even when I do interviews, I've been warned to be very careful if I'm getting on there  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:43):**  being all excited because the hugest El Nino might happen. For me in a scientific perspective,  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:49):**  wow, that's great. I can write lots of great papers about this massive El Nino, but that's  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:54):**  had huge impacts on drought and livelihood of Australia.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:11:57):**  Yeah. So I wanted to ask about, I guess the other piece of this. So one is the end users  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:01):**  if researchers are working with end users, farmers directly, but there's also startups  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:06):**  and ag tech coming into this world and the event where we were working together a few  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:11):**  weeks ago at the greenhouse event that CSIRO ran and we had 40 researchers and your team  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:15):**  was there and 14 ag tech startups. I'm curious what your experience was at that event and  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:21):**  just generally working with startups. Do you see that as a potential collaboration partner  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:26):**  or pathway for your group and for CSIRO? Yes, because both have a different set of  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:32):**  skills to bring to the table. So we might have the time and patience to sit there and  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:36):**  look at things deeply and the startups have got that ability to go out there and talk  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:41):**  to the end users and be quick and agile and trial things. So together I think we can be  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:46):**  really powerful. There is a challenge because those things don't always match together.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:51):**  So we need to learn how to talk to each other and not worry about setting up contracts and  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:12:55):**  spending months fighting over IP or figuring out all the details, but let's just have a  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:00):**  go at it. And I think the new challenge is to figure out that play space together.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:05):**  So recently we were approached by a startup company to just get some advice on how to  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:10):**  access some weather and climate information to make some graphics. And I said, you know  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:14):**  what, I could just make those for you if you like. And they said, brilliant. We can get  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:18):**  a feed from you of those graphics month by month would be fantastic. I said, sure. When  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:24):**  do you need them by? Thinking, you know, it'll take a couple of months to write up the contract,  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:28):**  figure out the IP, the processes. And he said, can you have a prototype by next week? I was  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:33):**  like, really? Actually I kept that to myself. I just said, sure I can do that. No problem.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:39):**  And I went back to my team and said, drop everything we need to deliver on this prototype,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:44):**  which is not something we usually do. Everything's usually structured for the whole next 12 months  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:48):**  ahead. So we did that and we started making up these prototypes and some of the people  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:53):**  in my team were like, Oh, but this data is not accurate. It's not the right data. We're  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:13:57):**  using them on one. We have to go get this. We'll never have it done in time. So do you  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:01):**  know what? It doesn't matter what the data is. They just want to see the picture. They  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:05):**  won't know that it's a different town. It doesn't even matter. What we're selling is  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:09):**  the concept of what we can do. Don't worry about the decimal places. So let's just get  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:15):**  it looking right. So we made up a PowerPoint demonstrating our capability and right at  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:21):**  the start of it, we thought we'll just throw in some really simple graphics just to set  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:24):**  the scene of what we can do. Some nice background pictures. So we started showing them this  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:29):**  PowerPoint and we got to the first slide and they said, we love it. We want that. And we  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:34):**  just all looked at each other. It's like, you know, that that's not even what we're  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:39):**  offering. That was just the pretty picture. And I think as scientists we forget, we're  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:43):**  so far immersed into it that some of the basic stuff is still really important to deliver  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:48):**  first. So most of the rest of our talk wasn't used because it was way too complex because  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:53):**  we just were not thinking where the consumer was thinking. That's so interesting. And it's  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:14:58):**  actually a parallel to something we heard today and yesterday around startups thinking  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:03):**  sometimes they have to build a whole solution for farmers. But sometimes there's like a  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:08):**  really simple problem that if they just solve some simple thing first, that can be really  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:11):**  helpful. So again, it's all this kind of know your user, know your customer. I'm curious  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:16):**  why you were able to even like think like that, like that you said yes to that project.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:22):**  Cause I can imagine a lot of other researchers would say like once they said next week, it  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:27):**  was just like a no, right? Like we, it'll take us six months and a contract. So what  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:30):**  was it that let you say yes to that or why did you think you could just have a go? I  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:35):**  think CSIRO, like I was saying the last few years has done a lot of work to enable its  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:40):**  staff to be more innovative, to be more agile, to think a bit outside the box. Not everything's  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:45):**  the old school science now that has to be written into a paper. Before you might count  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:50):**  up the number of papers you'd written in a year to see if you are up for promotion. That's  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:55):**  not the only metric anymore. It's about how innovative and agile and different you can  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:15:59):**  be and what impact you can make. A lot of it's about impact. So now I feel like, Oh,  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:04):**  there's so much I can do. Yeah. Has that been a quick change? Cause I guess from the outside  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:09):**  it seems like, you know, the on-programme started and now like the culture shifting,  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:13):**  but I think I imagine from the inside it seems like a much more gradual, slow and probably  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:17):**  sometimes painful change. Yeah, because it involves some trust that I can stop focusing  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:24):**  on writing papers and they do actually value this new way of thinking and that it's okay  
**[0:16:29-0:16:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:29):**  to fail and it's okay to change. So recently I had a project funded that's about to start  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:36):**  in a few weeks and I had a very clear idea of what that project was and it's all been  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:40):**  approved and we're going to build an app to do this, this and this. Fabulous. And then  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:45):**  we went to the workshop you spoke of a couple of weeks ago where we met with a whole lot  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:48):**  of startups for two days. In that two days I completely changed that project. We scrapped  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:54):**  that idea and we've got a whole new plan because I realised what I was first designing was  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:16:59):**  not what they were ready for. They actually want something else. But Syro gives me that  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:04):**  freedom to be agile and change things. You know, it's not a freedom to do whatever I  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:08):**  want within certain bounds, but that flexibility to respond to the market as it changes. Yeah,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:14):**  I think that's really valuable. We certainly heard from the startups coming out of that  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:18):**  that they were excited and it was interesting. There was a bit of a, wow, there's all these  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:22):**  capabilities that CSIRO actually can do way more than maybe they even need. Like you said,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:28):**  need some of the pretty pictures or basic modelling, maybe not all of the super statistically  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:33):**  significant depth versions. So it's a bit of a, I wonder if that feels like, have we  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:38):**  done hard work for nothing or is that fine? You're happy to give just the top layer and  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:43):**  hope that you get to go deeper later? Yeah, because there's so many ways we deliver.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:48):**  Startups is one way to deliver, but we do very deep impact studies and developing the  
**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:51):**  science that has bigger implications and impacts on a global scale. I think as a scientist  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:17:58):**  in this era, it's about being able to deliver on all those different levels. I mean, ideally  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:04):**  if you can situate yourself where you're doing some underpinning fundamental research and  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:09):**  then also engaging with users and also delivering and doing some impact, then you're best placed.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:15):**  And I think that's the most fun way to work. It sounds like you're having fun. Like you  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:19):**  can just hear the passion in your voice. And I know like, again, at that event, when you  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:22):**  got up to pitch what you were doing, it was like you were selling it. Like you were really  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:26):**  selling the vision and passion for the data you have and the science you've done. And  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:31):**  I think that's really cool to see that it isn't just numbers. Like you are living this,  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:37):**  like it really matters to you. Yeah. I love weather and climate and often particularly  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:41):**  my family fall into the trap of just saying some off the cuff comment about the weather  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:46):**  to me. I go, well, actually, by the way, no, Jackie, we didn't really want to know. We  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:50):**  were just commenting that the sunshine was nice. That's hilarious. So I do want to ask  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:18:55):**  about weather. So we do have a few quite a few farmer listeners to the podcast. So what  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:01):**  do you want them to know about sort of what you do with the weather? Maybe what is the  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:04):**  future of science around weather and climate? Where are things headed? Well, obviously I  
**[0:19:09-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:09):**  think it's quite an exciting time to be weather and climate. There's quite a change in technology  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:17):**  at the moment. So back in the 80s, you didn't really look at the weather forecast for more  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:22):**  than a few days ahead, because that's the only skill we have. But now we look at it  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:26):**  seven days ahead and we look at it hourly. And now we're getting technologies to look  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:30):**  at what's going to happen for the rest of the year and possibly even next year. And  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:35):**  it's starting to get skillful enough that we can use it. So on the farm, you might at  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:40):**  the moment look at past years and what sort of patterns they've been and what an El Nino  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:44):**  might typically look like to understand what's going to happen this year. But now with this  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:49):**  forecasting technology, we can narrow that down and give you a better idea of how things  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:53):**  will eventuate and different patterns. And that becomes even more important under climate  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:19:58):**  change. So as the climate changes, it's no longer relevant to look at the past as the  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:04):**  perfect indicator of what the future might be, because we know we're moving into a hotter  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:08):**  regime, possibly drier in some regions. So it's more and more important to get this forecasting  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:14):**  technology out there and being used.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:17):**  One of the stories I heard the other day was about a farmer in WA, I think, who had done  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:22):**  a ton of work to have a data scientist come in and do a bunch of analysis of previous  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:27):**  weather on his property and what was happening and what did that mean. And I don't know how  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:32):**  rigorous it was around predictive modeling or what technologies he used, but one of the  
**[0:20:35-0:20:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:35):**  benefits that he talked about was just the bit of confidence in having done something,  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:42):**  like in having gotten a bit of control over this thing that's so uncertain, was almost  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:47):**  as much more important than the actual this or that, that it was just taking a little  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:52):**  bit of control back of something that's so uncertain. I just thought that was really  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:20:57):**  interesting about weather and how much it matters, but then it's not about precision.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:00):**  It's kind of a feeling thing too.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:02):**  Yeah, I think with any sort of relationship, whether it's on farm or your marriage or your  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:08):**  children, when it's uncertain, the more control you can have and the more understanding of  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:13):**  what you're dealing with, the better prepared you can be, the better you can respond. If  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:17):**  you know you get three good years out of 10, then you can plan for that. And if you know  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:23):**  those years are dropping off because of climate change, you can plan for that. The more you  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:28):**  can understand and the more you can understand how that information helps you control different  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:33):**  levers about crop types or nitrogen application, the better off you can be.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:38):**  I agree. And I think it's super exciting. I mean, we heard that today at the conference,  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:42):**  like how much data is coming and how the ability to collect more data is just giving us like  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:48):**  all of these different possibilities in the future that we didn't have before. So I think  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:51):**  it's really exciting. There's so many more technologies now and data we can collect and  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:21:55):**  analyses we can do. I'm curious what you think the future of climate science and weather  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:00):**  is and kind of what that means for farmers. Like what can they be looking for and looking  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:04):**  forward to?  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:05):**  I think it's a really exciting time right now, obviously. If you remember 20 years ago,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:10):**  we all watched the evening news to find out the weather forecast for the next few days.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:14):**  And we'd only believe it a couple of days out. Whereas now we're on our phones looking  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:18):**  at the forecast for the next seven days and it's actually quite accurate. We're now getting  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:22):**  the skills to look not just at the next seven days, but the next six months and having skill  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:27):**  at understanding different patterns in rainfall looking forward. So I think that's going to  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:31):**  be the future expanding into that space. So CSIRO is working closely with the Bureau of  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:37):**  Meteorology to partner on how to deliver these new technologies and the new model coming  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:43):**  out of the Bureau of Meteorology, shaping that for the needs of agriculture to deliver  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:48):**  actually on the questions that you need to ask and also incorporating all the data. So  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:53):**  weather doesn't exist just by itself. Weather and climate information is best if it's partnered  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:22:58):**  into yield forecasts and nitrogen application decisions or stocking rates or irrigation  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:23:04):**  decisions. So putting all that big data together, I think is going to be the future and I can't  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:23:08):**  wait to see how it unfolds.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:23:10):**  Awesome. Well, if you had anything for our listeners to look up about you or read any  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:23:14):**  papers or look at any flashy PowerPoints, what should they look at or where should they  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:23:18):**  find you if you have anything you want to share?  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:23:21):**  My favorite app that we've made is YieldProfit Lite, which you can get off the App Store  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:23:26):**  and that gives you a seasonal climate forecast. So you can have a look at that one or you  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:23:30):**  can email me, Jackie, jaki.brown at csiro.au.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357337#t=0:23:35):**  Awesome. Jackie, thank you so much for joining me today.

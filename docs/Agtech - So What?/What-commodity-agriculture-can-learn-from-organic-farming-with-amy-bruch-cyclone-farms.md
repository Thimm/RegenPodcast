### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 24 Aug 2022 20:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Ag Tech So What. I'm Sarah Nolet. An update for you here at the  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:06):**  top of the show. The Agfentik Group has been acquired. Well, sort of. We're still the same  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:11):**  team on the same mission, to partner with Ag Tech operators who are unlocking world  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:15):**  changing impact at the intersection of digitally native agriculture and climate solutions.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:20):**  But now under one brand, Tenacious Ventures. For all our podcast episodes and insights,  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:25):**  the companies we invest in and more, check out our new home at tenacious.ventures. It's  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:30):**  not easy to say goodbye to Agfentik, but we're pumped about our new home and know that to  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:34):**  achieve big things in the world, you have to be focused. And for us, that means finally  
**[0:00:39-0:00:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:39):**  having just one brand and just one website. Okay, on to today's episode.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:47):**  At the moment, commodity grain prices are looking favorable due to a shortage in global  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:51):**  supply driven by a myriad of factors. But for future focused producers with an eye on  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:00:56):**  world markets, banking on success in the commodity casino is simply getting too risky.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:02):**  With us being in Brazil and understanding how many acres that that country that are not in  
**[0:01:06-0:01:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:06):**  the Amazon have to bring on board for production acres, over 200 million additional acres are  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:13):**  potentially waiting in the wings depending on pricing. It looked like something that we'd  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:18):**  want to insulate ourselves a little bit better to just be more in the specialty category  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:23):**  as well. That's Amy Brooke of Cyclone Farms, an operation  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:27):**  rooted in eastern Nebraska. Though Amy represents the sixth generation of her family farming  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:32):**  operation, she's had a diverse career so far with time spent in industry as well as farming  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:37):**  and working to balance acidic soils in Brazil. It all started for Amy with earning an Ag  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:43):**  Engineering degree from Iowa State, after which she took a detour farther up the value  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:48):**  chain. My role out of college is a systems engineer  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:52):**  with General Mills. And so that was really exciting to me to just get immersed into high  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:01:58):**  speed manufacturing and turning ingredients of what we grew on the farm into products  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:03):**  that people love. And then just working with a lot of the mechanics actually were prior  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:08):**  farmers in their previous life. And it's just a good work environment and just troubleshooting  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:14):**  and solving problems and trying to make the whole system more efficient. And that's my  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:18):**  philosophy of just how I've approached everything in life, just finding what's broken and try  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:23):**  to fix it, what the root cause is and put solutions in place, whether in the systems  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:29):**  engineering realm within food manufacturing or now currently on my own family farm.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:34):**  What was a day in life like at General Mills? Like you mentioned some actual physical engineering  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:38):**  work. Walk me through what a day was like there.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:41):**  Oh, goodness. You know, actually life in manufacturing is pretty similar to a farm. You have your  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:47):**  plan A starting out and then the alphabet has 26 letters because you're probably, you  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:52):**  know, D or E as the midpoint of the day rolls on and then something else comes up that you're  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:02:57):**  not expecting. So in manufacturing where I was, we were a 24-7 facility with three shifts.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:04):**  So my responsibility was to see how reliable the equipment would run over the course of  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:10):**  the whole 24-hour period. And there's predictive failure and then there's the reactive failure  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:16):**  that happens when things go wrong. And we tried to have most of what would go wrong  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:20):**  into something we were planning on. There's just equipment can just surprise you at times.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:26):**  So our manufacturing lines, they had robotics and different things like that. It's probably  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:31):**  pretty much daily. That's something that happened as planned. But I really valued the team effort  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:37):**  that everybody has a different perspective and what they bring to the table. So as an  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:42):**  engineer, I'd always circle the wagons with the operators that ran the equipment and the  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:47):**  maintenance folks that adjusted the equipment. And we'd always drive solutions with just  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:52):**  basically several mines into the equation instead of just one thought. And that's another  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:03:59):**  valuable lesson that I bring back to the farm every day because it's just diversity of thought  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:04):**  is really important to drive efficiency going forward.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:07):**  Tell me more about the farm now. What was the vision and tell me about the last couple  
**[0:04:12-0:04:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:12):**  years and where things are headed for the farm.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:14):**  Well, that was another kind of plan D-E-F. I always thought that my husband and I, we'd  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:20):**  work with my father and my mom trying to drive the family farm into the next generation.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:25):**  And unfortunately, my dad, he passed away suddenly and my husband and I were farming  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:31):**  internationally in Brazil at the time. So we made plans to come back and farm in his  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:37):**  honor. So in 2012, and that was a high of commodities, kind of similar to today, but  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:42):**  there was a downturn in the commodity markets shortly after that. So we tried to make our  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:49):**  farm a little bit more insulated. We converted to organic production. It was a slow at first  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:53):**  because it was a different realm. And we had a lot of experience just balancing soils and  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:04:58):**  high productivity. And some of those philosophies held true with converting farms to organic  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:04):**  as well.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:05):**  Tell me more about your time in Brazil. Tell me about what it was like being there.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:10):**  That was wonderful. I traveled a lot prior to moving full-time to Brazil. So I had a  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:15):**  little bit of what I was going to get into moving there, but yeah, the town that I lived  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:21):**  in, it was pretty remote and rural, but it was a boom town just because of agriculture.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:26):**  So it was a really cool spot to be in. It didn't have a movie theater. We were about  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:31):**  five hours away from airport or really a lot of resources. So it was pretty much just an  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:38):**  ag town that developed overnight. It was 700 people, I think about 15 years prior to me  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:44):**  getting there. And it was, yeah, like I said, about 50,000 people when I got there. So it's  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:49):**  just crazy. The bus would come in, everybody'd get off and nobody'd leave town. And again,  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:54):**  it was just due to ag. So that was really neat to see the power of agriculture and how  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:05:59):**  it could transform communities. This area wasn't farmed in the past because it was deemed  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:05):**  really a wasteland just because it had high acidic soils. And so again, that soil balance  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:12):**  came into play. How do you convert wasteland soils that really couldn't support any tree  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:17):**  growth or any grass growth, essentially? How do you convert them into productive soils?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:22):**  And that happens over time when you can understand just the keys to balancing soil. And it did,  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:27):**  it was a slow process, but again, it can happen and it really did transform that area. So  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:32):**  being a part of that was really interesting. There were no street lights or stop signs  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:37):**  in the town that we lived in. And for 50,000 people, it was a little bit chaotic. None  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:43):**  of the modern conveniences that we have here. That's fine. It just teaches you to be creative.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:49):**  And I don't, there was hardly any English spoken in that town and I didn't have the  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:53):**  experience with learning Portuguese prior to getting there. So it was a lot of muscling  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:06:59):**  through every field trip was like an educational class going to the grocery store even because  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:05):**  you just learn so many things and so many ways to communicate. You did realize like  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:10):**  details matter. That one word that you'd miss in a sentence could totally change what the  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:17):**  conversation was about. It was a good, again, humbling experience. I think agriculture and  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:22):**  living abroad in a rural environment with few resources is also a humbling experience  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:29):**  as well.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:30):**  Were the other Americans there? Were there other women there? Or were you pretty unique  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:35):**  in what otherwise sounds a bit like a kind of wild west experience?  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:38):**  Yeah, it was a boom town. So there were a handful of Americans there. There were folks  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:44):**  from Germany, folks from the Netherlands, folks from China, just all doing the same  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:49):**  thing, seeing opportunity and being able to be on the ground level of transitioning this  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:07:56):**  year of Brazil into an agricultural area. So everybody's pretty familiar with, I think  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:03):**  Mato Grosso that had been developed maybe 20 years prior to this area. I think the thought  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:09):**  in the trajectory of where this area could transform was known. It just took a lot more  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:15):**  hard work, I think, to get it to the level that Mato Grosso had established itself as.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:21):**  But yeah, I think it was a big melting pot. They always say the US is a melting pot, but  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:26):**  I would say we experienced that firsthand down in Brazil.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:29):**  Ben, you mentioned before the kind of realization about soil and how important that was going  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:34):**  to be to the success of the project and of the area. How did you come to that realization?  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:40):**  Did you have a background in thinking about soil or tell me more about that?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:45):**  So I'm really passionate with ag and soils just based on my background and growing up,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:52):**  but it was awesome to see farming in another zip code, I always say, and this zip code  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:08:58):**  happened to be an international zip code because there's things that you could relate to. And  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:02):**  then there's principles that you just learn because they're indicative to a certain area.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:08):**  So it was good to compare and contrast because it's farming is not a direct template depending  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:12):**  on your spot in the US or your spot in the world. But there are some, the process to  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:18):**  farm, I'd say is pretty similar. So understanding that process and finding your weak points  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:24):**  and getting those saw, they think you can move mountains in our industry.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:28):**  I love the way you talk about that. And my sense is that's because you have experience  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:33):**  in a few different areas, not just in the US and Brazil, because you moved into consulting  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:38):**  internationally. Tell me about that.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:40):**  Yeah. My husband and I are working with the Kinsey Albrecht Soil Practices and basically  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:46):**  the same soil and a lot of our coursework is done in wine grape country in California  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:52):**  because the best soil to grow the best grapes for wines in the world is the same soil that  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:09:57):**  we need to grow corn on our farms, the same soil that folks in Brazil on the sugarcane  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:02):**  land need as well. So once you know that equation and can balance the soil, looking at calcium  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:07):**  magnesium first, it really lets you work in a variety of different areas. You get that  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:12):**  balance set and then it takes different effort to get that balance in the different regions,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:19):**  depending on if you're starting from a basic soil or acidic soil, but boiling it down to  
**[0:10:24-0:10:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:24):**  an equation really can unlock some doors and potential there. So that balance, again, it's  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:31):**  really for different geographic regions and different crops, so wide scale crops. So it's  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:36):**  allowed for us to really get into some fun situations and understanding because in the  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:41):**  Midwest we can only grow successfully, you know, a handful of crops. So we got exposure  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:46):**  to coffee and citrus and sugarcane, papaya, different crops that we don't have necessarily  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:52):**  here in the Midwest and got to learn the ins and outs of those. But really the delivery  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:56):**  mechanism was that original soil balance.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:10:59):**  And how did you think about breaking into the organic space?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:02):**  Essentially kind of the same reason. It was a little bit of an evolution because if you're  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:08):**  thinking of your body and if you're weak generally, and we can maybe potentially relate to this  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:14):**  with the pandemic that everybody faced, you're a little bit more susceptible to potentially  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:19):**  getting really sick from COVID. It's the same thing with our soils. If you don't have the  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:24):**  balance right, then you're potentially could get attacked more with disease and insects  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:29):**  if you have weak crops due to weak soil. So once you kind of solve some of your soil balances,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:35):**  you realize you maybe don't need some of the assistant mechanisms, meaning some of the  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:40):**  foliar applications of fungicide and insecticide. So we started realizing that we were needing  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:46):**  some of those types of products and our yields were really doing pretty well. That was the  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:53):**  evolution that, hey, maybe we can take it one step further and protect our yields, protect  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:11:58):**  our crops, just because we're having that soil balance that we don't necessarily need  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:03):**  some of the products that you can purchase on the shelf. And so it just evolved from  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:08):**  there and then it got really interesting and challenging in a way. And there's opportunities  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:13):**  from a business and marketing standpoint for the crops that you grow. And then also just  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:19):**  with our understanding of trying to be a little bit more niche and specialty with us being  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:26):**  in Brazil and understanding how many acres that that country that are not in the Amazon  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:31):**  have to bring on board for production acres, over 200 million additional acres are potentially  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:37):**  waiting in the wings, depending on pricing. Like right now, you could see in 2012 how  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:43):**  the evolution of Eastern Europe and South America really gained an acre to contribute  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:48):**  to commodity-based crops. It looked like something that we'd want to insulate ourselves a little  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:54):**  bit better to just be more in the specialty category as well.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:12:59):**  So what was that process like? Did you do due diligence? Did you write out a business  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:13:04):**  case? Did you talk to different people to get advice on it? What was the journey for  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:13:09):**  you specifically in making some of those decisions?  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:13:13):**  A little bit of all the above. I think the main driver in my mind was just being able  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:13:20):**  to see examples, professional examples that we could relate to. Because our farm, when  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:13:26):**  you have precision technology and kind of the latest and greatest tools, when you're  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:13:32):**  conventionally farming, you want to make sure that you can translate some of those technology  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:13:37):**  tools to the organic industry as well. How I wanted to think of it as moving our operation  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:13:42):**  forward in that regard. We did it in our network, have a few folks that were farming and so  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:13:48):**  going onto their fields and understanding their challenges and the ways they could deliver  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:13:54):**  to their farm plan was really critical. Because once you feel like it's possible, I think  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:00):**  you're more apt to execute a little bit. That's how I was. So yeah, you have the numbers on  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:07):**  your spreadsheet saying one thing, you have the philosophy with soil balance and a minimalist  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:13):**  on trying to use certain products is another component of it. And then just being able  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:20):**  to deliver that professionalism, that was a third component.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:23):**  What you said there about technology, I really like, and sometimes I think there can be a  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:28):**  perception that for organic, you maybe don't have as much technology when I think the reality  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:33):**  is you actually have to look at practices and technology pretty closely to be able to  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:38):**  farm organically. Maybe tell me a little bit about some of the insights you had or some  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:43):**  examples of different practices or technologies that you've found you need to use and get  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:48):**  benefit from.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:49):**  Yeah, absolutely. I know, I think that is a general thought that maybe it is a little  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:14:55):**  less technology driven, but I think that there's just a diversity of ways to farm organically.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:01):**  And the pathway we've chosen is to implement a lot of technology into the equation, both  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:07):**  on the soil land and embarrassing our soils to deliver precision nutrients in the right  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:12):**  spot. Those micro nutrients, I call them micro elements, micronutrients that are naturally  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:18):**  mined that are approved in the organic space helps to drive that good soil balance and  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:24):**  delivering them in the right spot based on your soil samples and approval from the certifier  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:30):**  is one component of technology. But another would be just some of the equipment that we  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:35):**  get access to and implement on our farms, just like a conventional mindset is using  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:40):**  multiple modes of action to handle some of your challenges, whether it be insects or  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:46):**  weeds. We do the same thing, that mentality of multiple modes of action, but we're delivering  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:51):**  things like propane flamers or which propane flamers are driven through the field. We partner  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:15:57):**  with the university on some of their prototypes to help us manage weeds more effectively,  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:02):**  especially during rainstorms. We can get out there a lot sooner on our fields and it helps  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:06):**  us minimally till our soil because there's no tillage involved in implementing that type  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:11):**  of equipment. There's weed zappers available that we've trialed and tested as well that  
**[0:16:16-0:16:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:16):**  send 14,000 volts through a copper bar above the canopy on a soybean field to electrocute  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:23):**  some of these weeds. So those are a couple of good examples. In the pipeline right now,  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:28):**  we're not testing one, but hopefully in the near future, we will be there. There's actual  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:32):**  lasers, equipment that lasers are targeting weeds with 80% success. That technology is  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:39):**  coming out. There's a lot of robotic technology coming out, just being discussed, maybe not  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:43):**  implemented on a commercial level yet. So those are some of the equipment that we're  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:48):**  working on or looking at working with. And some of our minimal soil disturbance tools  
**[0:16:54-0:17:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:16:54):**  are some of what we've looked at in Europe, some of our tying meters and things like that  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:02):**  to just disturb the soil enough to disrupt weeds from forming. So those, I mean, are  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:07):**  some of the actual getting the equipment and going. You do control traffic patterns too.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:12):**  We need precision, just the RTK system. So we're always going in the same tracks every  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:17):**  time to minimize just compaction and different things like that. We're trying to draw and  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:22):**  pull from a lot of different ways. We have sophisticated water management systems that  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:25):**  we're partnering with the Natural Resources Conservation Service to implement on our fields.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:30):**  So really looking at the whole gamut in terms of conservation, in terms of technology, but  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:36):**  just deploying these systems to really reduce our footprint, our impact to our natural resources,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:43):**  and then trying to deliver results and lasting results on our farms as well.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:47):**  Wow. That sounds like a lot of fun getting to explore all of those different tools and  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:53):**  technologies.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:17:54):**  Yeah, it absolutely is. I love, yeah, just lifelong learning. And so it's nice. We're  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:01):**  definitely not repeating the same game plan every year. And I know a lot of farmers don't  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:07):**  because your conditions and your weather is totally different. But I feel like just because  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:13):**  we do have some hurdles to overcome in organic farming, it's definitely very challenging  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:19):**  that there are some resources that are maybe unconventional that are being looked at. And  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:25):**  since you only get in the Midwest one season to farm here, there's quite a network of organic  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:30):**  producers sharing their learnings. Everybody's kind of cheering everybody on from the background.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:35):**  And so that's been really positive as well, whether it's social media based or just because  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:41):**  usually there's not an organic farmer in your county. So you're going 100 miles away to  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:45):**  find somebody that maybe has some kind of notes to just compare and relate to. So it's  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:51):**  a nice support network.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:18:54):**  Do you think about conventional versus organic production as fundamentally different? You  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:01):**  mentioned before the mentality of you want different tools in the toolkit in conventional  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:05):**  and organic and they're just different tools. But do you think about them as fundamentally  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:08):**  different?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:09):**  That's a good question. I actually wish when I was conventionally farming that I would  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:13):**  have had access to some of these tools because I think there could have been even more variety  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:18):**  in our farm plans if we would have implemented a few of these techniques. I can see them  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:23):**  as cross functional, actually. But yeah, now there's just a more of a reliance on, I would  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:30):**  say technology in terms of weed management in organic production because we don't have  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:35):**  access to the more conventional methods of weed mitigation. But I just know from a conventional  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:42):**  standpoint there are challenges with weeds just because of the herbicide resistance.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:48):**  So I think there can be benefit actually from farmers not categorizing one tool as an organic  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:19:55):**  tool only that it can be viewed as cross-functional.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:00):**  Is there an example of something that maybe hasn't gone right in your work on the farm?  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:04):**  Something that you tried that kind of didn't pan out?  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:07):**  Oh, goodness. Yeah, that's where all the learnings, I think, come from. Absolutely. I just feel  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:12):**  like you learn a lot more from your mistakes versus your successes in a way, or that's  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:17):**  how I try to work on stuff. But yeah, I mean, our first year organically farming, I think  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:23):**  the thought conventionally farming is still want to hurt or injure any plant. And that's  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:29):**  the whole paradigm shift with organic farming. You're actually going to have, you call it  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:34):**  almost like casualties. You plant a higher population because if you're not aggressive  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:39):**  enough, the weeds are going to take over your field. So that conversion is almost a tough  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:45):**  mindset conversion probably more than anything because we just are. Yeah, we were pretty  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:52):**  gentle, I would say our first year doing our weed management routine. And yeah, you get  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:20:58):**  behind and it's weeds in our area are no joke. So yeah, it can get expensive pretty fast  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:04):**  and then trying to mitigate those manually with walkers and everything gets really expensive.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:10):**  So that's the motivation on our end with our farm that was just let's use the money instead  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:16):**  of in walkers. Let's use that in terms of technology and equipment to get the right  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:20):**  stuff at the right time and not feel if you rain, you get behind that there's another  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:25):**  tool like I was mentioning the zapper, the flamer that you can leverage so you don't  
**[0:21:30-0:21:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:30):**  get behind. But it's a pretty humbling experience when you feel helpless and we felt helpless  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:38):**  a lot. How did you manage through that first year? And also tell me what a walker is because  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:43):**  I don't know. Oh, yeah, sorry. No, good. Why just manually going out and removing? Oh,  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:50):**  my gosh. Yeah, and it can be pretty extreme. So that that's the motivation on the other  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:54):**  end. How do you get the right tools and technology probably with anything? How do you set yourself  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:21:59):**  up with success and be able to get to the other side without too many pitfalls? So it's  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:05):**  tough. And I think that's why developing the network is really important. And probably  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:10):**  with whatever you do, it's important. I found through our first year, reaching out to people  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:16):**  because again, they're not necessarily in your own county, they're people that you haven't  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:21):**  met, but then you're instantly connected. Once you do get connected because you have  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:25):**  these challenging experiences that pretty much everybody's experienced going through  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:31):**  this. But that's why we set up a consulting network just to help producers not have that  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:37):**  first moment that some of us that went transitioned maybe 10 years ago experience. I don't consider  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:44):**  myself a pioneer in this industry because that there's some of my call my mentors that  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:48):**  have been organically farming for 25 years. So they've just had a lot more experience  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:53):**  than I. You have a couple seasons and it can provide better insight to those that haven't  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:22:59):**  had any seasons. And so we developed just a program to help folks with the certification,  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:04):**  all the paperwork that goes along with organic farming to get your farms inspected and certified  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:09):**  and qualified for the USDA seal. And then yeah, all these trials and tribulations on  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:15):**  the farm for weed mitigation and crop insurance and marketing because it is definitely a different  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:21):**  ballgame than what the traditional methods are.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:24):**  Well, and it's not easy to ask for help, whether it's in a farming or any other kind of business.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:30):**  Do you think the experiences you've had and being in some pretty unconventional places  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:34):**  and situations has shaped how you've been able to ask for help and then ultimately set  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:38):**  up those networks for others to do the same?  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:41):**  Absolutely. I think farming is a pretty common language, but I think it is hard at times  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:46):**  to ask for help. But once you start that process in the right direction, then it becomes easy  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:51):**  because you realize that more people either have the same question as you or they have  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:23:56):**  that synergistic effect when you do reach out to people. Maybe your initial thought  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:00):**  process or theirs is one direction and then you come together and you think of something  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:05):**  totally different. I think that's the case in conventional farming as well.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:09):**  How do you think about planning for the future? Do you have a five-year plan or a 10-year  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:14):**  plan?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:15):**  Absolutely, because a lot of that longer term success in organic farming is those long-term  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:22):**  crop rotation and then your marketing plans, because that's another tool in order to mitigate  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:29):**  some of the weed challenges or your disease challenges is coming up with that long-term  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:33):**  rotation. So production-wise, we absolutely have long-term production plans and that drives  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:39):**  into the marketing where a lot of the organic marketing is relationship based. You have  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:44):**  spaces and names with your buyers and where your products are going. Ours are all food  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:48):**  grade type organic products going into make tortillas for our corn products, our white  
**[0:24:52-0:25:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:24:52):**  and blue corn and tofu for our soybeans. So it is good to have those long-term plans and  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:00):**  we definitely have them.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:02):**  What do you think the farm will look like in, call it 20 years?  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:05):**  Yeah, production-wise, we have those plans. We have a lot of aspirations on where we can  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:09):**  transform and take our farm. It's going to be an interesting equation with the food security  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:15):**  situation. I think the whole world is facing right now with the challenges in the Ukraine  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:20):**  for actual production and exports and imports and maybe the higher commodity prices and  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:26):**  turning on more acres in South America, like what we saw happen in 2012. It's interesting.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:32):**  I think you definitely got to be on your toes in this game because the way our grandfathers  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:37):**  and other generations farmed, I don't know had as much long-term uncertainty as what  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:42):**  maybe there is now. So I think it's just trying to make sure that you're as efficient as possible,  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:48):**  being able to be nimble as well. Satisfying, especially in niche markets, I think will  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:54):**  be one realm that we're always going to be a part of and trying to be as self-supported,  
**[0:25:59-0:26:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:25:59):**  I guess, not as reliant on external inputs. I think is going to be important to our farm  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:06):**  as well because you're even seeing that now with some of the fertilizer and conventional  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:12):**  herbicide products this year. It's just that mindset of, I think, trying to be a little  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:17):**  bit more self-reliant is going to be hopefully more successful than depending on the supply  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:22):**  chain to drive your solutions. So that'll be the trajectory we're going to try to take.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:29):**  Who knows if that's the right one? You mentioned the word nimble. How do you think about being  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:35):**  nimble in a world where you've got one season per year and is it more about the practices  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:40):**  or the crops or more about your mindset?  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:43):**  You know, agriculture is really unique and interesting because a portion of what we do  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:48):**  is based on tradition and a portion of what we do is based on innovation. So I think it's  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:53):**  just always keeping those two buckets in check and always validating your plans and being  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:26:59):**  open to new changes that come down the pipeline for sure.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:03):**  Do you think that your mindset sets you apart from other farmers and the experiences that  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:09):**  you've had in pretty unconventional areas, whether it's engineering or Brazil?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:13):**  I've been really blessed to be able to see ag from many different sides. So I'm really  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:18):**  thankful for that. And I just know there's always stuff that can happen and just trying  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:23):**  to weigh in what we can control and what we can't. So I try to be pretty grounded. It's  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:29):**  good to be that way, I think, in our industry, because, again, there's just so many variables,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:34):**  whether you're organically farming or conventionally farming or farming in a foreign country, there's  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:39):**  just so many variables you can't control. And just know that the sun will come up tomorrow.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:44):**  That's what my dad always say. And just have a clear head. If you get mad, you forget to  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:48):**  think. So it's just trying to be grounded and level and process the information you're  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:52):**  given and make a plan according to what you have at the time. And it's really hard in  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:27:58):**  our game to be a Monday morning quarterback because you never have what you need at that  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:03):**  moment. You just have to act on what you have and go forward.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:07):**  It does sound like that thinking is part of your competitive advantage. Do you think about  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:10):**  cultivating or how do you think about having that mindset on your team, like helping the  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:15):**  rest of your team be nimble and think differently?  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:19):**  My husband and I love building out teams and love our team on our farm. It's a lot like  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:24):**  family. But again, it goes back to like there's 26 letters in the alphabet and there's always  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:28):**  something you can do. It might not be what you were originally thinking you can do, but  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:31):**  there's always a window or a way through a situation. You just got to find it. So I developed  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:38):**  this actually in basketball in high school. The coach said you can always play defense.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:44):**  Maybe your offensive game isn't there, but you can always take care of business. So I  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:48):**  think we're pretty level team and dynamic is probably a good term for it. Just open  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:53):**  to change, open to new things, but holding true to the family roots and good grounding  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:28:59):**  morals to chart our course.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:01):**  Is there an element of, and I know I've experienced this when you want people to really take in  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:05):**  that new information and think for themselves, but that does lead to mistakes and I guess  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:09):**  you have to be accepting that there's going to be mistakes and that's sort of part of  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:13):**  the journey or you're going to get things wrong and have to have a bunch of people go  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:16):**  out and pull leads because that's part of the journey too?  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:19):**  Absolutely. You know, that's just life and you're only on this planet for so long. And  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:24):**  again, I think we learn a lot better with our mistakes than our successes. And we were  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:30):**  paying for an education. We'd have several letters behind her name after this point is  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:34):**  from all the tuition, quote unquote, that we've paid from some of the mistakes we made.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:39):**  And that's a part of life, but that's a part of the conversation. I think that's really  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:42):**  crucial for both conventional farming and organic farming is that network. So you can  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:47):**  live through other people's experiences too and collectively get further ahead in the  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:52):**  process because one season a year, it is tough to really get all those earnings, capture  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:29:58):**  those earnings and then apply them for the next year. So it's good to pull several seasons  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:01):**  of different people involved. In Brazil, we had two seasons of farming depending on the  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:06):**  crop and the geographic location. In Florida, where we farmed for a period of time, we had  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:11):**  two seasons to learn. So having a couple of seasons was great. My dad didn't get that  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:16):**  in the Midwest, but he had his greenhouse that he developed and grew plants there in  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:20):**  the off season to try to see how we could stress them to be able to yield more or yield  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:26):**  less and you learn that way too. So yeah, I think there's a different variety of ways  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:30):**  you can accelerate the practical knowledge and get it implemented the next season, even  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:36):**  outside of mistakes too.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:38):**  How do you think about the organic landscape among other kind of sustainable ag ideas,  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:43):**  whether carbon markets and nature-based solutions and regenerative agriculture and do you see  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:48):**  that changing?  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:50):**  I'm actually on the National Organic Standards Board. And so the organic program is really  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:55):**  important to me. And there's a term right now that's being thrown around or discussed,  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:30:59):**  I should say called climate smart agriculture. And I would say organic farming, the structure  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:04):**  and the framework has been around for decades now. So it's ready to try to be that original  
**[0:31:09-0:31:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:09):**  solution that some of these programs are saying to be. So I'm real supportive of what's happening  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:17):**  in the organic space. And I think that's being able to tell the story a little better because  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:22):**  we are a systems-based approach. We're not just a practice-based approach. So I think  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:28):**  putting that all together, there's a good story to tell there that some of these programs  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:32):**  are working to fill up a way that maybe doesn't exist.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:38):**  Going to farmers is truly one of the coolest parts of this job. And Amy did not disappoint.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:42):**  I was left chewing on a few of her points long after our conversation ended. First of  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:47):**  all, I admire Amy's drive to find a niche, a competitive advantage, even in what seemed  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:51):**  to be an inevitably commoditized business. Amy's unique life experience obviously contributed  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:31:56):**  to her ability to do this. But it seemed to me that the most impactful lesson Amy learned  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:01):**  while farming in another zip code was a fundamental appreciation for the risk of playing in an  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:06):**  undifferentiated commodity space when, at any moment, circumstances well beyond her  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:11):**  control could upend prices, inputs, or markets for years. Seeing some of those 200 million  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:17):**  Brazilian acres firsthand seems to have been a powerful motivator to differentiate and  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:22):**  to create a business that couldn't be so easily reproduced around the world. I also  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:26):**  appreciated the lessons that Amy shared about soil health and how balancing soils can lead  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:31):**  not only to carbon sequestration, but to meaningful crop benefits. Amy discussed her experience  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:36):**  with increased pest and disease resilience and improved crop development, which is pretty  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:40):**  impressive to achieve on tropical soils previously described as wasteland. This resonates with  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:45):**  our understanding of the opportunities around nature-based solutions in particular. Finally,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:49):**  I really enjoyed Amy's thoughts on the organic sector. From debunking the myth that organic  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:55):**  means no technology to her argument that the existing organic standards in the US offer  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:32:59):**  a meaningful on-ramp to more so-called climate-smart farming. I think Amy added a lot to a discussion  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:33:05):**  that has been heating up lately with the entrance of trendy but usually less defined ideas like  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:33:09):**  quote, regenerative and quote, sustainable. It'll be interesting to see what the future  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:33:14):**  holds for all of these schools of thought and whether technology can help us shift from  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:33:19):**  prescriptive practices to achieved outcomes. So that's it for another episode of Ag Tech  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:33:24):**  So What. Thanks to our guest, Amy Brooke of Cyclone Farms, and thanks to Carrie-Anne Coker  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities#t=0:33:29):**  from Vitale for recommending her. And of course, thank you for listening. For more information

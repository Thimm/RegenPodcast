**[0:00:07-0:00:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:07):**  Making investments in agriculture is hard.

**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:19):**  or anything else, especially as climate change makes the future of their businesses less  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:24):**  and less predictable.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:26):**  We've been thinking about how farmers think about investing in their businesses for a  
**[0:00:29-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:29):**  long time.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:30):**  So when we stumbled upon Hallie a few weeks ago, we were pretty pumped.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:34):**  I'm one of those people that I have these massive spreadsheets and I'm really very interested  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:37):**  in numbers.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:38):**  So we sat down and we did these strategic plans and we've been adjusting as we've gone,  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:44):**  especially now that the improvements are up.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:46):**  Hallie Schaufner is a sixth generation row crop farmer in the Mississippi Delta region  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:50):**  of Arkansas in the U.S., where she grows soybeans, corn, rice and wheat with a twist.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:00:56):**  The Hallie's farm, SFR seed, is not your average commodity operation.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:01):**  So my mom actually has her master's degree from UC Davis in plant physiology.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:07):**  And she met and married my dad and they decided they would open a research farm, which is  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:12):**  back in the day you would contract with chemical companies, BASF being a major chemical company  
**[0:01:18-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:18):**  that we think of.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:19):**  And they would basically do these EPA regulated trials on pesticides and herbicides that had  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:26):**  just come onto the market.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:28):**  Extremely regulated, very regimented, very scientific approach.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:32):**  And that is what I, actually I had to work on the farm every summer.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:35):**  I was not given an option, which was fine.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:38):**  I really enjoyed it.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:39):**  So when I was 10, they actually stuck me on a mower and they were like, go mow everything,  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:43):**  which was like five acres.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:44):**  So I'd mow everything and in three days and then I'd have to turn around and mow it again.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:49):**  But after I got older, I would help my mom load up these chemicals and she would put  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:01:55):**  on this, it looked like the hazmat soup, but it wasn't exactly a hazmat soup.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:00):**  And this backpack full of chemicals and the spray boom.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:02):**  And she and I would walk thousands and thousands of little bitty trials of soybeans and rice  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:08):**  doing different tests of residues.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:12):**  So we'd do an application of a herbicide or pesticide at say, Emergens, when the soybeans  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:18):**  had just come up.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:19):**  And then again, right before the reproductive stage, again, thousands and thousands and  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:24):**  thousands of times.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:25):**  So that is what the farm did.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:27):**  The pesticides and herbicides, of course, are still very much a thing, but really it's  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:31):**  genetics and traits that have taken over the market.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:34):**  You think of Roundup Ready, you think of Extend Flex, we're talking about soybeans.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:39):**  And we moved into doing production of pre-commercial varieties.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:45):**  So contracting with companies on varieties that were somewhere in between having been  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:51):**  bred in a greenhouse and actually going to be sold to a farmer who would then grow it  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:57):**  and go to a granary with it.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:02:59):**  So we do a lot of yield trials, a lot of disease ratings.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:03):**  We'll just go out in the field and we'll say, we'll compare varieties and say, this one  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:07):**  is doing really well, this one is not.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:09):**  What are you seeing change in that landscape?  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:11):**  Like one of my observations is that given the increasing extremeness and frequency of  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:18):**  extreme weather events, the risk management dynamics are changing a little bit.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:23):**  And so there might be new trade-offs that we're willing to make.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:27):**  Like I want to get this crop off faster, even if that has a little bit of a yield impact,  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:31):**  but it gives me a little bit of more certainty on the risk side.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:35):**  Are those the kind of trade-offs you're seeing?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:37):**  Any examples?  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:39):**  That's really what's going on right now in genetics.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:43):**  It's all about first the trait that you have.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:45):**  So whatever herbicide it's resistant to, whether it's a two, four year round up, but then it's  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:50):**  also the maturity.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:51):**  How quickly can you get it in the ground, which means how quickly you can get it out.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:03:55):**  Farmers can plant earlier and earlier now with these younger and younger maturity.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:00):**  The other thing is things like drought resistance.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:03):**  And we have seen quite a...  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:05):**  We've tested a lot on our farm.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:08):**  Drought is not our problem.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:10):**  Our problem is we're way too wet, but that I think is going to be a game changer.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:15):**  And that's really where the market is going is these varieties that are really hardy and  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:20):**  can withstand a lot of stress and still yield fairly well.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:25):**  Have you seen willingness to make that trade-off?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:27):**  We've heard sort of, oh, well, it could have maybe a little bit lower yield, but it's worth  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:32):**  it for these other traits or is it still has to be both because we're not going to compromise  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:35):**  on the yield side?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:36):**  No, I think that farmers are becoming very savvy when it comes to balancing their options  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:42):**  in terms of genetics and picking a wide range of things.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:45):**  Our neighbors are really good at this and they'll not only do it by the hardiness or  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:50):**  the different genetic attributes of a variety, but also different maturities so that they  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:04:56):**  can stagger their soybean harvest so that they're not rushing to get it all out at the  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:05:01):**  same time, which of course, if you get behind, it could affect quality.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:05:05):**  Or they're picking things that would do better on different soil types, because that is also  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:05:09):**  something that's going on in terms of genetics.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:05:12):**  How well does this perform on heavy clay versus a sort of a sandy silt loam?

**[0:05:27-0:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:05:27):**  So when I took over, having watched my parents, of course, for years, I knew the strategy  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:05:35):**  behind farming in terms of finances.

**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:05:56):**  have previously.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:05:57):**  I'm not saying there are more bad years than good years, but the proportion is much larger.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:02):**  And that makes that calculation, that mitigation of risk harder.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:07):**  So when I sat down with my team and we were talking about this and we said, look, we have  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:13):**  to make two decisions.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:14):**  A, we have to address our own environmental impact and B, we have to make more money in  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:24):**  the good years to offset what's happening.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:27):**  And we've decided that we have to become more profitable by using the very techniques that  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:34):**  will make us more environmentally friendly, which is the conservation techniques.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:39):**  And in so doing, increase our yields and reduce our inputs.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:44):**  And there are quite a few things that we're doing.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:46):**  I'm one of those people that I have these massive spreadsheets and I'm really very interested  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:50):**  in numbers.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:51):**  So we sat down and we did these strategic plans and we've been adjusting as we've gone,  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:06:56):**  especially now the inputs are up, but the biggest thing that we've done is we have a  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:02):**  three year plan for chicken litter application.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:05):**  We would like to reduce the amount of synthetic fertilizer we use, especially now that it's  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:10):**  extremely expensive.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:13):**  And so we said, all right, we're going to do full chicken litter application, two years  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:19):**  pre-plant, just let's put it on.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:23):**  So originally I thought it was going to be a lot less of an investment than it has been  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:28):**  because chicken litter went up, but we are two years into our three year application  
**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:34):**  of litter.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:35):**  We've made $115,000 investment and so far with a yield bump in just one year, a yield  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:41):**  bump and our reduction of synthetic fertilizer use, we've saved 91,000.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:48):**  So the ROI will be next year.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:53):**  We've also paired that with grid sampling.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:07:56):**  So that is essentially, instead of doing random spots in an 80 acre field, you do a much more  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:02):**  strategic approach in the form of a grid.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:05):**  And we've been able to assess then how the chicken litter is doing in the field.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:10):**  And then we're able to say, okay, now when we're ready to apply fertilizer, we will have  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:18):**  to eventually do so.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:20):**  We can actually plug it into a computer system and apply it where we need it, as opposed  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:26):**  to just this blanket application, which is wasteful and it does have a harmful environmental  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:33):**  impact to use too much synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:36):**  So the other thing that I'm really excited about, and I hope we do a lot more of it,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:42):**  we've decided to try to reduce our tillage.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:44):**  So I think that's a big hot button issue right now.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:48):**  People are talking about it, this no till.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:51):**  And no till works really well in many situations.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:54):**  It's harder, I think in our area, there aren't as many farmers who are interested in doing  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:08:58):**  it just because of how hard it is and the fact that you will see the yield reduction.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:03):**  You just inevitably around here, if you plant, you don't till, especially if you don't till  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:10):**  and then plant a cover crop, you will see a yield drop initially.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:15):**  However, around here, you are working your ground four to five times before you're planting.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:22):**  You're tilling a couple of times, you're land planting, you're bedding, and then of course  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:28):**  you're doing whatever your burn down is, right?  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:31):**  And every pass costs you a lot of money.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:34):**  Every time you put a piece of equipment across an acre, that's money that you've spent on  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:40):**  diesel, labor, wear and tear on your machinery.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:43):**  If you can save some of those passes, you can save money.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:48):**  So what we've done is we bought a permanent better, it was about a $25,000 investment.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:09:53):**  And we said, we're going to reduce our tillage by 39% in three years.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:00):**  We haven't quite gotten there yet, we're working on it, but I figured that we've saved about  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:04):**  $72,000.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:08):**  And that's labor, fuel, equipment, wear and tear.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:13):**  That's insane.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:15):**  That number of passes in a field, it's insane how quickly all that adds up, especially with  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:19):**  diesel.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:20):**  So it's not no till, it's minimum till, and we hope to use it more and more.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:25):**  Did you calculate that ROI versus any impacts on yield for the tillage example?  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:30):**  Do you know that $75,000 saved on equipment passes and diesel and things?  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:34):**  Do you have it on the yield side, did it stack up?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:38):**  So it's hard to do on the yield side because what we did was we said, okay, we want to  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:44):**  make sure that we're not tilling the sandier ground that we have, because that is where  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:48):**  you're going to lose a lot of ground, a lot of topsoil.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:52):**  So we said, okay, we won't till that as much, so we won't lose as much of that topsoil.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:10:56):**  But that's also where we've been focusing our grid sampling and our strategic chicken  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:00):**  litter applications.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:01):**  So we've got a yield bump there anyway, so I can't say whether or not, I don't know,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:07):**  maybe, maybe it's a yield bump.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:09):**  I really doubt it, but I hope to know more.

**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:22):**  Where did these ideas come from?  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:24):**  So my chief operating officer, who's amazing, Cy Williams, I basically asked him, I was  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:29):**  like, if we had all of the money in the world, what would you do?  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:33):**  And we just went through all the things that we'd like to do, which are minimum till cover  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:38):**  crops, run cattle.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:39):**  We'd love to run cattle.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:40):**  And then we were like, okay, we can't do A, B, and C, we can do D and E, and maybe someday  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:49):**  we'll do F. And it really came down to how much money we had and the infrastructure that  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:54):**  would be required.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:56):**  So the minimal till was the first thing we did.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:11:59):**  And the chicken litter was the next thing we did.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:02):**  Did you take that list of ideas from the team and then do some like ROI calculations and  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:07):**  say, okay, these ones stack up and that's how you picked?  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:11):**  We had the conversations.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:12):**  I said, all right, here's how much a permanent better would cost.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:14):**  Here's what we're talking in terms of chicken litter versus fertilizer.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:17):**  And then I would go into my massive spreadsheets and I'd look at our revenue and I'd look at  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:21):**  our cost per acre.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:23):**  And I like to compare our cost per acre against the counties.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:27):**  The extension service always puts out a cost per acre.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:29):**  So I compare ours just because what we do is a little different when our labor expenses  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:33):**  are higher.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:34):**  I spend a lot of time in front of the computer.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:37):**  We just got a new software called LandDB.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:40):**  It's a Syngenta product that we're going to try to use to better evaluate our herbicide  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:47):**  use and see how much we're actually spending per acre based on the herbicide that we're  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:54):**  using.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:55):**  And then we'll actually input all of our herbicides individually and how much they cost per gallon  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:12:59):**  and then put in the rate and it will tell us exactly how much money we spent using,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:04):**  say this Roundup or this 240.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:06):**  I'm excited about that.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:07):**  Yeah, interesting.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:09):**  And do your customers, are they a driver as well here?  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:11):**  Are you getting, are there kind of external factors you mentioned climate, but do you  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:14):**  think this will deliver more value for your customers?  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:19):**  And does that weigh into the calculation?  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:21):**  It absolutely will because obviously the more money we can save, the less our costs will  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:26):**  have to go up and the less we'll have to charge our customers for the services we provide  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:31):**  and then yield.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:32):**  The point of what we do is to get a good yield.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:35):**  And that's hard when you're doing seed production because seed production in order to get a  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:39):**  good germination, as opposed to say, I'm taking my soybeans to a greenery.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:43):**  Well, who cares whether or not germs the next year, it just needs to be good quality, right?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:48):**  We have to make sure that whatever we grow has a good enough germination.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:53):**  If someone puts it in the ground, the next year comes up and you have to plant that a  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:13:58):**  little later, which means you're going to have a slightly lower yield.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:02):**  So anything we can do to bump our yield up is going to be helpful.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:08):**  So one of the projects you mentioned was a row rice.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:11):**  Tell me about where did that originate from?  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:13):**  How did you come up with the idea and yeah, what is it?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:16):**  No, I don't actually remember how we came up with the idea.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:21):**  I'm sure it was, Sai said, let's try row rice.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:24):**  I know there wasn't a ton of row rice happening in our area.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:28):**  So the University of Arkansas has been doing research on irrigation.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:33):**  And so there's been some research done on whether or not you can significantly save  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:37):**  water in row rice versus flood.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:40):**  So when you plant on a row, you're using a better, you create your furrows and your  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:46):**  veg, and you plant on top of a row.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:49):**  And that's how we do soybeans and corn.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:52):**  For rice, you have a drill and you drill into flat ground.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:56):**  You pull your levees and then you flood it.  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:58):**  And that's how you water it.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:14:59):**  And so you're, especially if you're not zero grade, like we aren't, if you have some slopes  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:07):**  to your field, then it's really not the most efficient way to water.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:12):**  You're using a lot of water and of course a lot of fuel if you're pumping with a diesel.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:16):**  So the idea is if you have row rice, you're better able to control exactly how much water  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:23):**  your rice is getting.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:24):**  The question is, are you saving enough money to actually offset any possible yield loss?  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:32):**  We have not experienced any yield loss and we have experienced more efficient use of  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:36):**  water.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:38):**  So we're excited about that.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:40):**  We did 30 acres two years ago and I think another 30 acres last year.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:46):**  And so we're going to do 65 acres this year.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:50):**  So we'll see how that goes.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:52):**  How big is your team?  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:55):**  So there are nine of us year round.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:15:58):**  And do you ever have the experience of going off to talk on zoom calls and like getting  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:16:02):**  ideas through the advocacy work and then coming back with, we should try this and we should  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:16:06):**  try this.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:16:07):**  And then like, how do you maintain the rigor of, all right, we got to put it through the  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:16:11):**  ROI calculations.

**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:16:31):**  And then he'll say, I know what this would cost.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:16:33):**  Can you do the calculations for this?

**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:17:30):**  Also pumping power and also money that you don't have to spend on diesel to have an electric  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:17:36):**  well over a diesel well.

**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:17:40):**  We needed to convert all 12 of our wells from diesel to electric.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:17:43):**  So we're halfway there.

**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:17:53):**  to do that to do it skyrockets.

**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:18:01):**  we need to order your stuff now.

**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:18:14):**  And then I get, of course I get the bill for it and I'm just like, oh my God, this better  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:18:18):**  pay off this better.

**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:21:35):**  of them.

**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:21:42):**  nature-based solutions, this idea of selling credits or getting premiums and insetting

**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:21:52):**  I am peripherally.

**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:14):**  For Farmers Business Network, and this is not them specifically, this is the program  
**[0:22:19-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:19):**  in general, it ties up your land in some cases forever and in terms of the kinds of practices  
**[0:22:27-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:27):**  you have to use, and we rent a large portion of land that should we stop doing business  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:35):**  or whatever, and it goes to somebody else, we can't guarantee that it would continue  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:40):**  in those practices.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:42):**  That made us kind of gun shy.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:43):**  And then I had this funny interaction with my cousin.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:46):**  He said, and I don't remember what company it was, but he was like, yeah, I don't know  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:50):**  about this carbon market thing because this guy showed up to talk about it and he was  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:55):**  wearing a three piece suit.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:56):**  And it's kind of like that, what are you trying to sell me?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:22:59):**  Like, you don't know me.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:00):**  You don't know what I go through.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:01):**  What are you trying to sell me?  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:05):**  And then I have heard the argument that why should we do all the work for other companies  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:12):**  to pollute, to use the carbon market, to use those credits to pollute as much as they like.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:19):**  I don't necessarily agree with that stance, but I have heard it often enough to mention  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:26):**  it.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:27):**  Yeah, those are four of the common pushbacks that we hear and actually are, you're speaking  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:31):**  the same language in terms of what's frustrating to us about how these markets have been designed.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:35):**  Like why would we treat it like this permanent asset when it's cyclical and more of a service  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:40):**  that farmers are providing?  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:42):**  And to your last point, the additionality one is interesting too.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:46):**  Just because you're farming rice, you're already doing these other practices.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:48):**  How do we think about that as a system?  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:50):**  And then the last one, if these markets are just enabling more bad, then that obviously  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:54):**  doesn't make sense.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:23:55):**  If they're creating incentives for overall more good, then obviously that's the way we  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:00):**  want to move.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:01):**  But yeah, those are pretty common.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:02):**  When you think of your operation and some of the projects on that list, what's a big  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:07):**  or the biggest, if you can share a pain point where you think that there's a tech solution  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:12):**  that might be the unlock code.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:14):**  Gosh, so much of our barrier is money funding.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:18):**  Tech wise, I can't really think of anything that technology wise would really help.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:24):**  Precision farming is a key part of what we want to do.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:29):**  And to be honest, our equipment is older and not equipped.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:35):**  And we would like to make that investment, but it's not as high on the priority list  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:40):**  because we can hire custom applicators who do have that equipment.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:44):**  But precision agriculture is key.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:46):**  I mean, the grid sampling, being able to apply fertilizer or spray with precision so that  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:53):**  you aren't wasting or overlapping or anything like that.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:55):**  I think that's really important.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:24:57):**  I think it's always a tough question to be like, wave a magic wand and invent some new  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:02):**  technology.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:03):**  If I knew what that was, I'd probably just go do that.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:04):**  So I appreciate it.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:05):**  It's a tough question.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:06):**  What's your take on the way that ag tech is being marketed right now to farmers like you?  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:11):**  So I'm involved in an organization called Ag Launch in Tennessee.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:16):**  And I know the guy who runs it.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:18):**  And I went to school actually with one of their team members and it's hard.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:25):**  I get it.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:26):**  It's really hard to market to farmers.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:28):**  There's a lot of trust building that has to happen first.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:32):**  And I think that in terms of the Ag Launch is working on a network of potential angel  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:38):**  investors in some of these startup companies.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:41):**  And so I've been looking at, well, if you were to invest in a company, an ag tech company,  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:46):**  specifically, what would you look for?  
**[0:25:47-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:25:47):**  And so we've been looking at these sample business plans and I would invest in a company

**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:26:24):**  You feel like there's a risk that the second criteria I absolutely agree with.

**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:26:51):**  I guess it's the who moved my cheese sort of situation, right?

**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:27:14):**  before you can think about changing it, which is definitely something we believe.

**[0:27:37-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:27:37):**  Every farmer uptick in yield.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:27:39):**  Yes.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:27:40):**  Decrease in inputs.

**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:27:43):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:27:44):**  Yes.

**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:27:47):**  Now as to whether or not you can actually do that.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:27:50):**  That's the marketing approach to the XtendFlex brand.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:27:54):**  The marketing that was done for the XtendFlex brand was fantastic.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:27:59):**  They just blew it out of the water in terms of the ads that you could find online or in  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:04):**  farm journals or magazines.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:05):**  And it was always two bushels plus, three bushels plus yield.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:09):**  They just knocked it out of the park.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:11):**  Of course they had a lot of brand recognition that helped.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:14):**  I think that the best practice is still around A, someone who doesn't show up in the three  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:18):**  piece suit, they'll speak the same language you're speaking, which makes sense.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:22):**  And then B is more about the upside, not the reduction in downside.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:25):**  I think of a spending app, you'd much rather be told how to get a bit more income than  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:29):**  how to curb your spending.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:32):**  People just don't really want to do that as much.

**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:38):**  quantitative.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:39):**  What do you think that your farm will look like in the next, I don't know, 20 years or  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:43):**  in 20 years?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:44):**  What might be different than it is today?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:47):**  Ad changes so much all the time.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:49):**  So five years ago, when I started working for the company, we actually had two companies.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:54):**  It was our research farm and we had seed company.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:28:57):**  We sold starting seed company products and we hired, we contracted with the growers to  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:03):**  grow these commercial varieties.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:05):**  We took them into a seed conditioning plant.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:07):**  We cleaned them, packaged them, and then shipped them off to customers who then grew them to  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:14):**  go to a granary.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:16):**  We did all that.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:17):**  And then we also had a retail business too.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:18):**  So we sold the seed as well.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:20):**  And that was a big moneymaker until all of a sudden it wasn't.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:23):**  And that had to do with just the change in the way that that seed is sold in the market  
**[0:29:28-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:28):**  now.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:30):**  But just based on changes in that business market, we had to pivot really quick.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:36):**  And we were thankfully able to do that because as that change happened, all these genetics  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:42):**  came in on the market.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:43):**  A lot of genetics were stewarded by, could not be exported and they were all of a sudden  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:47):**  approved by the EU and the Philippines and they could then be exported.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:52):**  So it was like, gosh, that's the door, opens the window.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:55):**  So now we are exclusively a seed production farm.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:29:59):**  However, this year we have the opportunity to grow another portion of our business, which

**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:30:07):**  It is for companies that specialize in rice varieties that are very, very difficult to  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:30:13):**  grow, but they are delicious and they are consumed mostly wholesale by restaurants on  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:30:18):**  the East and West coast, but they do some retail business too.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:30:22):**  And we do essentially the purification program.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:30:26):**  We make sure that any seed stock that shipped to farmers who then grow it to mill, it is  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:30:32):**  pure and that business doubled overnight.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:30:37):**  So I would like to grow the company.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:30:39):**  I would like to farm at least double what we're farming, maybe not in the next five  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/17/hallie-shoffner-farmer-agtech-early-adopter#t=0:30:45):**  years, but maybe the next 10 and encompass more of that rice work because that is super

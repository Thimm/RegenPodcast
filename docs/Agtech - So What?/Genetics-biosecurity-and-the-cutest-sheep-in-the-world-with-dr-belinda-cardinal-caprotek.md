### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 26 Jan 2022 19:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agnetic Group.  
**[0:00:05-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:05):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:07):**  Our next guest has enjoyed the benefits of some good press and endured some pretty rough  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:12):**  media attention too.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:13):**  And all the fuss was over very small, very cute sheep called the Valet Black Nose.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:20):**  But because we were unknown, I think people were concerned that perhaps we were cowboys  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:25):**  or something and we just went and did it all on our own.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:29):**  But of course you can't, it's not possible to do that.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:32):**  You have to go through the correct channels and do all the right things.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:36):**  That's Dr. Belinda Cardinal, who successfully imported the first Valet Black Nose sheep  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:40):**  into Australia last year.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:42):**  It was no easy task.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:44):**  If you've ever experienced Australia's biosecurity checks at the airport, then you have a small  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:48):**  window into just how strict the country's laws are, especially if it has anything to  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:52):**  do with agriculture.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:54):**  Importing semen for livestock breeding is also extremely hard.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:00:57):**  And when Belinda first wanted to import the genetics, she copped some flak from those  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:01):**  who claimed it would put commercial livestock farming in Australia at risk and who questioned  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:06):**  whether importing cute sheep was actually commercially viable at all.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:10):**  Now Belinda has a long waiting list of people who want to buy these sheep from her farm  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:15):**  in southwest Victoria, even at a price tag of up to $25,000 each.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:21):**  But Belinda's genetics and breeding business, called Capra Tech, goes far beyond just one  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:25):**  breed of sheep.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:27):**  And as you'll hear, her work has been guided by a passion for animals, which all began  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:31):**  when she was a child.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:34):**  My mother and my godmother had a small herd of cashmere goats.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:40):**  And it was sort of a small venture that they started off and did it together.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:46):**  And it was a lot of fun.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:48):**  And I really loved the kids and I loved the goats.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:51):**  So my aunt had one that used to come inside and be milked on the Moran leather couch.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:01:57):**  So sort of have had bits and pieces of goat experience through my childhood.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:02):**  But then I kind of got waylaid into horses and breeding horses and other things and then  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:09):**  came back full circle to finally getting the dairy goat that I always wanted when I discovered  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:14):**  that I was, and my daughter, are both allergic to cow's milk.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:19):**  So that's where the dairy goats finally came to the fore.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:24):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:25):**  And when was that?  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:26):**  That was a bit later, a few years later, you mentioned?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:29):**  So that was only about 10 years ago.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:31):**  So we got our first dairy goat because of the cow's milk allergy.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:40):**  So we wanted just something that we could have to milk for the house and make cheese.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:47):**  So she used to give us quite a lot of milk and so we'd make cheese and yogurt and ice  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:50):**  cream and everything else from her milk.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:53):**  And it was so much fun making cheese and everything.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:56):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:57):**  I love that how you said that.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:02:59):**  Like most people would realize they have the allergy and then buy goat's milk, not a goat  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:04):**  and start milking.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:05):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:06):**  Well, that actually was the plan.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:08):**  I had a pretty hectic job.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:11):**  And so the plan was that I would just buy goat's milk from a supermarket and easy, right?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:16):**  But at the time, the only goat's milk I could get was UHT goat's milk.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:22):**  I really wanted to drink it, but it smelled really bad and I couldn't stomach the smell.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:29):**  But friends of ours had a goat and my aunt when I was a child had had goat's milk and  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:34):**  it never smelled like that.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:35):**  So we went and tried and I took my daughter to try the milk and everything and she loved  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:39):**  it.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:40):**  So we decided, well, the only way we were going to get fresh goat's milk was to have  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:43):**  a goat, but the goat sort of gave us so much milk that it sort of became a job keeping  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:49):**  up with using it because I couldn't bear to throw it away if we had too much.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:53):**  And so just in the process of making all the cheeses and everything, I really discovered  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:03:57):**  that I quite enjoyed doing that and it was so much fun.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:01):**  I thought it would be excellent as a job.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:05):**  Turns out that's a lot of work as a job as well.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:07):**  Yeah, I ran a goat dairy, or at least worked on one in Chile when I was backpacking over  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:13):**  there.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:14):**  They had about 60 goats and I was, I mean, it was a lot of work and I knew nothing about  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:19):**  how to do anything.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:21):**  So I ended up chasing them down the highway because there weren't fences and it was a  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:25):**  total mess.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:26):**  But even I think if it was done properly, it's a good amount of work.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:30):**  Well, and it was for us too.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:32):**  It was a massive learning curve.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:34):**  I didn't know anything about goats.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:37):**  Especially from what I had as a child, which the adults did all of the technical stuff  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:42):**  and I just played with the baby.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:43):**  So I really didn't have any understanding of exactly the husbandry for goats and everything  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:49):**  else.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:50):**  So I did learn a lot over the first few years and I ended up milking around 35 and selling  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:56):**  cheeses and milk and everything.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:04:58):**  So it worked out quite well.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:01):**  What was that like going from, I think you were in, you had more of an academic career  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:05):**  in genetics and when you made that switch, tell me a little bit more about your career  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:09):**  and what it was like deciding to make the switch to have a go with the dairy.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:14):**  Yeah, well, as a child, I was always really interested in science and had quite a science  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:20):**  brain.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:21):**  So my career was a fairly straightforward scientific career where I did my degree and  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:27):**  got my PhD and then got a job working at the university as a teaching and research academic.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:33):**  So I was doing research and supervising students and PhD students.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:40):**  What kind of research were you doing?  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:42):**  My original research was all in native populations of wildlife, specifically in bats.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:48):**  But then as I progressed through my career, I started working on the genetics of livestock.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:56):**  So specifically at the time it was alpacas.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:05:59):**  There wasn't a lot done on alpacas at the time and so we developed the genome sequence  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:05):**  for alpacas and all the tools to do the genetic research that we needed to do.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:09):**  I had PhD students working on that stuff.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:11):**  We were basically looking for commercially important traits or the genes that underlie  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:17):**  those commercially important traits.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:18):**  So we did quite a lot of work on those and lots of papers and everything.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:23):**  But that sort of career is long hours and hard work and I had two young children at  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:30):**  the time.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:31):**  So that was fine and I sort of had thought that I would always be an academic all the  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:37):**  way through to the end of my career.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:38):**  But the thing that changed my mind was my brother got very sick and he had bowel cancer  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:46):**  and he needed support and my parents needed some support.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:50):**  And I started to think that there was more to life than killing yourself at an ADL or  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:06:56):**  a weak job that perhaps there was something more.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:01):**  And my brother sort of just made me think about my priorities a bit more.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:06):**  And so I ended up making the decision to step back from that academic life.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:14):**  And I had always, always wanted to do something with the land that we had and I never knew  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:18):**  what it was.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:19):**  So I got the milking goat because I was home a bit more.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:23):**  I discovered that that's what I wanted to use the land for.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:25):**  So then I get up into the goat dairy and cheese making and all of that stuff.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:33):**  I'm really sorry to hear about your brother.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:36):**  That sounds like some good came out of that in terms of a shift for you.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:41):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:43):**  And tell me about how it went with turning the goat dairy into a business.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:47):**  What was hard about that and what did you love?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:50):**  Well, the whole thing was difficult and expensive because I had to learn about all the regulatory  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:07:57):**  requirements for running a goat dairy.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:00):**  So there's a license for being a dairy and then there's a license for being a cheese  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:04):**  manufacturer and all of the hoops and things you have to jump through to get approved.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:09):**  But then there's the ongoing red tape as well.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:12):**  So there's all the record keeping and the testing of the products and all of that to  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:18):**  make sure that everything's safe.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:20):**  So that was a big learning curve, just even that side of things.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:23):**  But then there was also the larger scale husbandry side of things.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:27):**  So in the end, you're sort of running around 70 animals.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:30):**  If you're milking 35, you've got some bucks and you've got some young stock as well.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:35):**  And so managing all of that was also a learning curve for me.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:39):**  And then we also had the added learning curve of also marketing and selling.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:45):**  So there were some parts of it that I was okay with.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:49):**  The record keeping and that was all science sort of related and that was all fine and  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:53):**  fairly easy straightforward thing for me to do.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:08:56):**  But marketing, like I'm a scientist, marketing is not my forte in any way.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:03):**  So marketing a cheese product and getting out and selling and doing it all at the same  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:10):**  time, you sort of feel like you're juggling 10 balls at once and making sure the animals  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:17):**  are well.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:18):**  And just the day to day husbandry, feeding, milking and all of that can't stop while you  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:24):**  try and figure out what you're doing with your marketing plan and your other things.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:27):**  So you do feel like you've got a few balls in the air.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:30):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:31):**  Yeah, we work with a lot of startup companies developing technology in agriculture and it  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:37):**  always strikes me the parallels between farming businesses and startup businesses with all  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:41):**  these balls in the air.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:42):**  And you really can't let any of them drop because on the startup side you might run  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:47):**  out of money or your competitors get to market faster and there's technology and sales and  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:52):**  often entrepreneurs are learning much of that for the first time.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:09:56):**  And it's similar to starting a new farming business in many ways.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:00):**  Same, it's essentially the same.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:02):**  Sounds very familiar.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:03):**  It's quite a process and you have to be fairly passionate about what you're doing to push  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:10):**  through all of that to get out the other side and actually have it work.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:14):**  And were there times where you were like, now this is too hard, like it's not worth  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:17):**  it, let's go back to academia?  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:19):**  No, because I really enjoyed it.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:24):**  Most of the time I really enjoyed everything.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:25):**  There's always going to be something in a job that you don't enjoy, it doesn't matter  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:28):**  what job you do and even if you love it to bits, there'll always be something.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:32):**  But for me, I think the animals were the thing that kept me going because they're just so  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:38):**  charismatic and I really enjoy working with animals anyway.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:42):**  I've always done something with animals, whether it's riding horses or whatever.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:46):**  So being able to work a job where you get to deal with animals is mostly a good thing.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:54):**  There are days where you think you could get rid of the whole lot because you're just starting  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:10:59):**  to get the first lactation dose up on the stand and they do not want to help.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:04):**  Those days are not good, but mostly they're fine.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:07):**  So it's good.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:09):**  I love how goats have such a personality.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:11):**  Like it totally struck me that the one that went first always went first and the one that  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:14):**  went last always went last and the one that did this always tapped her whatever here.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:19):**  They truly are like individual creatures, which I was really surprised by.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:23):**  Yeah, they all do have their own personalities very much so and we do have a similar system  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:29):**  here.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:30):**  They all know the order in which they come in and it's not one that we've imposed on  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:33):**  them.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:34):**  That's just the bossy ones go first and the quieter ones go last.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:38):**  But they all have their own particular personalities.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:41):**  We've got a couple of real classics here.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:43):**  There's a doe here that knows how to use tools.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:47):**  So she uses sticks to scratch herself.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:50):**  They've all got their funny little quirks that we know them all by name.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:55):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:11:56):**  What did you kind of learn either about yourself or about business in kind of making this transition  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:03):**  from being an academic to being a business owner?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:06):**  Well, I learned that we are generally more capable than we give ourselves credit for.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:14):**  So at the time when I shifted over, I think you do have that self-doubt.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:20):**  You're not sure whether it's actually going to work out and it was a bit scary, the whole  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:24):**  process.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:25):**  And at the time, my husband, he wasn't as sure about it.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:30):**  I was pretty sure.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:32):**  I did all the sums and practically and in my head, it all made sense.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:36):**  But I don't know whether that was sort of clouded by my desire to want to do it and  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:42):**  my passion for it rather than actual common sense and real correct numbers.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:48):**  But I did do the numbers and thought it would be workable and everything, but it did work  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:54):**  out.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:55):**  So I was sort of pleasantly surprised in a way that something that I'd planned had  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:12:59):**  worked out as well as it did.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:01):**  And it sort of gave me a lot of more confidence in trying other things, which was really fortunate  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:07):**  because it's led on to further projects that I don't know if I would have done them  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:12):**  in the past.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:14):**  But having done this step, it was sort of like this was a little stepping stone from  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:18):**  academia to a little business.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:20):**  And then we've stepped on from that.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:23):**  So that was just sort of...  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:27):**  I love that.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:28):**  And it's advice that I have been given and often give, like the view is always different  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:31):**  once you climb the first hill and you'd never climb the second hill or the third mountain  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:36):**  if you didn't climb the first one, but the view is always different.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:38):**  So that really resonates.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:39):**  I love that.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:40):**  And one of the other things I know you guys expanded to was a semen importing and exporting  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:44):**  business.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:45):**  Was that kind of the next step and how did that come about?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:49):**  So because of my genetics background and I have bred horses in the past, I was really  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:53):**  quite keen on genetics and quite keen on improving the herd.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:13:58):**  And I really loved the dairy goats in the USA.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:02):**  So I'd been importing dairy goat genetics from the USA and that wasn't an easy feat  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:07):**  either.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:08):**  I was the guy that had done it before me in the last 100 years, but it was still quite  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:14):**  a new proposal.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:16):**  So we worked our way through.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:18):**  So I just have to interrupt you because you're like, Oh, one person has done this in a hundred  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:22):**  years.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:23):**  It's like, well, that's pretty impressive that you decided to do it too.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:27):**  Well, dairy goats really haven't been imported into Australia since the first imports.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:31):**  There was some done quite a number of years.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:33):**  I'm not sure exactly how long ago, maybe 80 years ago or something.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:37):**  And there was quite a lot of genetics brought in.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:39):**  And then from that people have just bred what we have.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:42):**  And the importing laws changed in around the 1950s because of an outbreak of, we actually  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:47):**  had an outbreak of scrapie, I think, and a couple of other things had come into the country  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:51):**  with some live animals that had come in.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:14:54):**  And so they kind of really clamped down on the restrictions and really it made it seemingly  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:01):**  virtually impossible to do.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:03):**  And so there had been a guy that in the past, probably about, I don't know, 12 years ago  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:09):**  or something, he had had a go and brought in semen from a few bucks.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:12):**  You're not allowed to bring in any live animals anymore.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:14):**  So having seen that that could be done, a friend of mine and I decided that we really  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:20):**  love the toggenburgs that are in America and having bred horses where if you want to improve  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:26):**  your horses, you go to the best stallion in the world and you can get it from anywhere.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:30):**  I just figured you'd just go and get the best bucks from America.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:34):**  But it turns out that the restrictions and the requirements for importing are so strict  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:38):**  that that's a really, really difficult thing to do.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:41):**  So it probably took two or three years to get our first import here.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:46):**  And we brought in a few semen from a few toggenburg bucks from some of the top herds over in  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:51):**  America and they've made a massive difference to the herd here now.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:15:57):**  And I'm really proud of the herd that we've developed here.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:00):**  But that process, I sort of did that just for myself because I really love the goats  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:05):**  over there and I just wanted to have some of my own.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:09):**  And it sort of assisted the dairy business because we were getting better production  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:14):**  and basically better goats.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:16):**  And I was able to sell stud bucks to people because we had something that was a bit different  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:22):**  to what was here already.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:24):**  Belinda plays it down, but it's really been her ability to handle the red tape and engage  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:29):**  in the diplomacy needed to import livestock genetics that have been key to her success.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:34):**  And there's good reason for such strict biosecurity laws in Australia.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:37):**  As an island nation, Australia has been able to avoid many of the diseases that wreak havoc  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:42):**  in other countries.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:43):**  For example, Australia doesn't have scrappy, a fatal disease affecting the nervous system  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:48):**  of sheep and goats.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:50):**  And so there's very, very strict requirements.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:53):**  And what that has done for Australia is it's protected us and all of our industries from  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:16:59):**  those diseases and losses caused by those diseases.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:03):**  So it's really important to keep our herds clean.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:08):**  And I definitely don't ever want to be the person that forever remembered as the one  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:12):**  that brought in some horrible disease.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:15):**  So it's something that we're really careful about and really careful about how we select  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:19):**  animals.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:20):**  But the actual ability to import semen and embryos from other countries is also really  
**[0:17:26-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:26):**  vital because as you can imagine, when you have an isolated population of goats in Australia,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:37):**  there's only so long that you can continue to breed within that small gene pool without  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:44):**  causing yourself some issues.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:45):**  I mean, Australia is a very big place, but all of the bloodlines sort of stemmed back  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:51):**  to something that was quite close genetically speaking.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:55):**  So they were sort of starting to think that this could be a problem.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:17:59):**  And so I just figured, well, why don't you just import something?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:03):**  But the way that we have to import things means it's really, really difficult.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:07):**  So the requirements for Australia are more strict for sheep and goats than they are for  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:13):**  any other livestock species.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:15):**  Oh, except for pigs, which you can't just can't import anything at all.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:19):**  So for cattle, you can import semen from a bull from America and you can just bring it  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:26):**  over and use it in your cows and that's fine.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:29):**  Does it just come in the mail?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:31):**  No, it has to come in a liquid nitrogen tank.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:36):**  So it's a dangerous goods, often a dangerous goods shipment, which has to be carefully  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:41):**  treated, and you hope that it's carefully treated because if it's tipped over, the entire  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:46):**  contents will be lost.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:48):**  And we've had that happen as well.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:50):**  But it has to come through the quarantine centre.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:54):**  So they check that what's on the paperwork is what's in the tank.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:18:58):**  And we have to go up and meet them and go through the tank with them and prove that  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:02):**  everything that's coming in is all perfect.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:06):**  For goats and sheep, it's even more stringent than that.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:11):**  So for goats and sheep, the animals come into the centre, they need to be tested on their  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:16):**  own home farm first, they come into the centre and they get tested again.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:21):**  They do 30 days isolation in the centre, and then you can start collecting semen.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:27):**  And at the end of the process, more tests are carried out to make sure the buck is completely  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:31):**  healthy.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:32):**  And one of those post tests requires that the animal is euthanised to do the final test.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:38):**  So we can never go back and get more semen from that buck.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:43):**  Whereas someone importing cattle semen can go back and get more of that bull if they  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:47):**  want to.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:49):**  So it makes our importing a really, really difficult thing.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:53):**  And so we don't do it unless we really, really think that that buck is really going to make  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:19:59):**  a difference here.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:01):**  And we don't do it unless we get a lot of straws from that buck, because we know we'll  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:05):**  never be able to do it again.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:08):**  So it's quite a quite a stringent process.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:11):**  And a lot of people don't understand the extent to which we have to go to make sure that we  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:16):**  keep our country safe of diseases.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:18):**  But it is a really important process to go through that.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:23):**  The tricky semen importations Belinda had done in the past, however, were nothing compared  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:27):**  with the process of bringing the valet Black Nose to Australia from the UK.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:32):**  Belinda had first seen the animals on a UK TV program with their shaggy coats and black  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:36):**  markings on their face and feet.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:38):**  The valet have been described as looking kind of like Disney characters.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:43):**  They're very much a native hill sheep.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:45):**  And so they hadn't really been changed that much over many centuries, probably.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:52):**  So they'd sort of been in Switzerland originally for a long, long time.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:20:56):**  And no one sort of knew they were there until, except obviously the Swiss.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:00):**  But then people started to recognize them as being quite a iconic looking, cute sheep.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:06):**  And so they've kind of made their way around the world and they're sort of found now in  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:12):**  the UK, it's got a large population.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:14):**  They're all sort of through Europe, also New Zealand and the USA has got some as well.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:20):**  And so in Australia, we had a lot of people that were interested in them and lots of people  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:25):**  had said, how wouldn't it be amazing if they could come here and, you know, that they were  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:30):**  interested in them bringing it.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:31):**  I just kept hearing it over and over and over again.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:33):**  And so I did that whole thing where I went, well, why doesn't someone just import them?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:37):**  And I thought, oh, well, maybe we will try and do it.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:40):**  So we went through the process again to do that.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:43):**  And that was, it took four years from the start to getting it approved to come in and  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:48):**  then actually getting them here.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:50):**  And again, the same process is required for importing sheep into Australia.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:21:56):**  So, and I should say too, that for importing sheep and goats into Australia, there are  
**[0:22:00-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:00):**  literally only two places that we can get them from.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:03):**  It's either Europe or USA.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:07):**  There are no other countries that we're allowed to import sheep or goats from because of diseases  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:12):**  around the world.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:14):**  So there's quite a limited opportunities for importing.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:19):**  And the other difficult thing about importing sheep and goats, especially sheep into Australia  
**[0:22:24-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:24):**  is that the disease I mentioned before, scrapie, sheep do have differing susceptibility to  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:32):**  scrapie.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:33):**  There are sheep that have a resistance gene and there's sheep that have a susceptibility  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:38):**  gene.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:39):**  And the Australian government only wants us to import animals that are susceptible to  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:46):**  scrapie.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:48):**  And the reason that they want that is because if the animal is susceptible to scrapie, and  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:53):**  one of the other requirements for us is that the animal is over five years of age, if they  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:22:58):**  are susceptible and they're over five years of age, they should show signs of the disease  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:02):**  by that time.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:04):**  And so if they don't show any signs, we know that they're susceptible, they're over five  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:08):**  years of age and they don't show any signs, then they probably are clear of the disease.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:13):**  And so we're still required to test for it at the end, but we can be more confident that  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:18):**  that animal will pass the test at the end.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:22):**  The difficulty for most people that are importing is that all around the world, everywhere else  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:27):**  is breeding resistant animals.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:31):**  And they are actually culling all of the susceptible animals.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:36):**  And so the vast majority of sheep breeds in the UK literally no longer have any susceptible  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:44):**  animals left in the population because they had a big scrapie eradication program where  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:49):**  they basically paid farmers to cull all the susceptible animals so that there's only resistant  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:23:55):**  animals in the UK, which means that it's quite difficult to find an animal that's actually  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:01):**  eligible to be brought to Australia.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:03):**  Wow, that must have been challenging to overcome all of that.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:08):**  And even some of the articles that I saw were sort of not controversial, but maybe you got  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:13):**  a bit of flack for even thinking about doing this.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:15):**  People were worried perhaps about that safety aspect.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:18):**  Oh yes, absolutely.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:20):**  There'll be a lot of people that weren't very happy about the process is basically because  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:27):**  they don't understand the process and they don't understand the extent to which the Australian  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:32):**  government requires us to test animals in order to be absolutely sure that they're free  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:37):**  of the diseases.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:38):**  Like I said, nobody wants to be the person that brings in a terrible disease into a country  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:44):**  that doesn't have it.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:45):**  And so, you know, we only do it according to exactly to the rules, of course.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:52):**  And we want to make sure that we don't bring it in.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:54):**  I don't want that disease in my animals and I don't want to bring it in for anyone else.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:24:58):**  So the way that the Australian government goes about it, it's, you know, they're very  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:04):**  sure that everything is fine.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:06):**  Unfortunately, I think a lot of the people that have been worried about it don't understand  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:11):**  it.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:12):**  And particularly there was one person that did say a few things in an interview and said  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:17):**  how terrible it was going to be for the industry and everything.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:20):**  But in actual fact, this is something that the Australian industry needs.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:25):**  They need to be able to import new genetics to improve herds and to advance breeding in  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:32):**  Australia.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:33):**  It's very difficult to do it.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:35):**  And in, for some breeds, it's physically impossible at this time because of that resistance and  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:40):**  susceptibility issue.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:42):**  But really, I think we start to lag behind the rest of the world if we don't look at  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:47):**  importing new bloodlines and new improved genetics.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:53):**  Do you think there's also pushback because of like a bit of, well, I can imagine two  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:58):**  other pushback.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:25:59):**  One, like kind of tall poppy, you know, just the you're having a go and other people don't  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:04):**  always love that or maybe feel threatened.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:06):**  And then another one, sort of, they're not maybe as commercial from like a production,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:11):**  you know, large scale farming operation perspective.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:14):**  Do you think either of those kinds of pushback played out at all?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:17):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:18):**  I think there is a tall poppy thing.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:20):**  And especially since I'm not somebody that is well known in the sheep industry.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:24):**  So because it's really interesting to note that there was an import of sheep around 15  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:29):**  years ago.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:30):**  They didn't even make the papers.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:32):**  They imported some genetics of a few breeds that came in.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:36):**  Charolaise was one and there was a couple of other breeds that came in around the same  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:41):**  time.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:42):**  And, you know, it really didn't make any news whatsoever.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:47):**  And it was probably because the people that did it were people that were known in the  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:51):**  sheep industry and they were accepted as, you know, that was okay.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:26:56):**  But because we were unknown, I think people were concerned that perhaps we were cowboys  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:01):**  or something and we just, you know, went and did it all on our own.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:05):**  But of course you can't, it's not possible to do that.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:08):**  You have to go through the correct channels and do all the right things.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:11):**  And in addition, like I've been importing dairy goat genetics for the past 10 years  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:16):**  and that's never made the papers or any news or anything.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:20):**  The only reason that this breed did make the papers is because there's really cute photos  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:25):**  to go along with the story.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:27):**  So it makes for a really nice headline, you know, when you've got a nice photo to go along  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:32):**  with it.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:33):**  And so, but really, I mean, there's a bit of that pushback about them not being commercial.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:40):**  However, they're probably more commercial than your average normal commercial sheep  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:46):**  in terms of their value at the current time.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:49):**  But just because they are not commercial doesn't mean that all importing should be banned.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:27:56):**  You know, just because one person doesn't value a breed doesn't mean that that breed  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:02):**  doesn't have a value to other people.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:04):**  So I think to sort of try and control what other people do based on whether you think  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:11):**  it's commercial or not is sort of an odd way of thinking to my understanding.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:16):**  Yeah, I love, I was talking about sort of parallels to entrepreneurs in the technology  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:23):**  world and it strikes me that that's something that they face as well, where you're sort  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:28):**  of pushing the envelope, maybe challenging the status quo.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:31):**  People are trying to cut you down, but when you find that specific niche where you really  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:36):**  have customers that you're adding value to them, even if it's not how other people have  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:40):**  added value to their customers, like that's how you build a business.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:44):**  Even if people, you know, it's not how they've done it before.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:47):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:48):**  And the response to them coming in has been literally overwhelming.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:53):**  I cannot make enough valet blacknose sheep to satisfy the market and I don't think I  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:28:58):**  will for another 10 or 20 years.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:03):**  It's like completely overwhelming.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:05):**  So you know, for someone to say that they're not commercial, they might not be, but you  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:10):**  know, in terms of selling their fleece or their meat, but you know, they'd be pretty  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:16):**  expensive chops right about now, so I don't think we'll be looking at that as an option  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:20):**  for some time to come.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:22):**  Although interestingly, if people were brave enough to open their minds to new breeds,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:29):**  we have had one breeder who started up with a breeding up program and what they've done  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:34):**  is they've taken the semen straws and they've inseminated their composite shape, which they  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:39):**  grow normally for meat.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:43):**  And they're trying to start a little boutique breeding up program alongside their commercial  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:49):**  production and they've got children and they wanted the kids to become involved in the  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:54):**  breeding and so they've got these valet blacknose sheep to get them started.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:29:59):**  So that's all fun and they did it, you know, about 40 or 50 years to get going and the  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:07):**  husband rang me the other day and was chatting about the sheep and how well the lambs were  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:11):**  growing and he said he cannot believe how fast these lambs grow.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:17):**  And he said if people were looking at something that they wanted down the track in the future,  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:23):**  that these would actually be fantastic for production because they can't believe the  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:28):**  speed at which they grow compared to his normal composite lambs.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:32):**  So although they're very cute sheep, you know, they were bred as a dual purpose breed for  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:37):**  a long time in Switzerland and maybe there was a reason why.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:40):**  Really interesting.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:42):**  Just jumping back to when you first brought the genetics in, how did you actually bring  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:46):**  the sheep to life?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:47):**  Was there an initial birth?  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:49):**  Like how did that happen and what was that like?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:52):**  Okay, so we took the frozen embryos and we synchronised the ewes and implanted the embryos  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:30:58):**  into a surrogate mother basically.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:00):**  And then those embryos, if we were lucky, they took in the mother and grew into lambs  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:07):**  and we had our first purebred valet, black-nosed lambs born here in April of this year.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:13):**  So that was an exciting time.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:16):**  Yeah, what was that like?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:18):**  Well, it's taken four years to get them here and the first ones on the ground, it was amazing  
**[0:31:23-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:23):**  of feeling of elation but also of relief that we finally got something on the ground because  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:31):**  the cost to get them here has been astronomical.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:34):**  We have had experience with goat embryos in the past that hasn't been as wildly successful  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:40):**  as the sheep embryos were.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:42):**  So we were kind of really worried that we just wouldn't get anything out of it, that  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:45):**  we just, the embryos wouldn't work and frozen embryos are a bit tricky to make them work.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:51):**  But we were lucky and we've probably averaged about a 60% success rate with the embryos,  
**[0:31:56-0:31:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:56):**  which is really good.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:31:58):**  And so it was kind of a feeling of relief more than anything that it worked and we actually  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:05):**  finally got there.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:06):**  So now we've got the lambs on the ground, that's fantastic, it's so exciting.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:09):**  But now it's a slight of overwhelming feeling of responsibility that you now have to keep  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:15):**  that lamb safe and you have to nurture it through till it can breed.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:20):**  And it's sort of this ongoing process, it's sort of excitement and then practically thinking  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:26):**  you've still got a lot of work ahead of you.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:28):**  Yeah, I love that.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:30):**  Again, similar to many startup entrepreneurs, which I wasn't sort of planning to draw these  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:36):**  parallels but it just strikes me that persistence element of four years, astronomical costs  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:41):**  and then finally you realize that result and then sometimes that's still when the real  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:44):**  work starts.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:45):**  You've built your technology, you've brought it to life from the science and then you got  
**[0:32:49-0:32:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:49):**  to still sell it and build the business.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:51):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:52):**  It never ends.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:53):**  No, that's right.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:54):**  And we, you know, we had, I think we ended up with 26 lambs born on the, like actually  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:32:59):**  live lambs on the ground and we were lucky because every single pregnancy that held and  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:06):**  made it through to the end of the pregnancy was, we actually got every single lamb out  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:10):**  alive.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:11):**  So we were really proud of that record.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:15):**  I think we put in 45 embryos in total and we ended up with 26 lambs, which was fantastic.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:21):**  Now it's the next part of the process.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:22):**  So now we have to develop the breed.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:25):**  We will need to keep importing new bloodlines because we brought in genetics from three  
**[0:33:31-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:31):**  rams, but obviously that's not going to build a breed here.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:34):**  So we do have more rams being collected at the moment to continue the breed on.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:38):**  So it's sort of now a responsibility to nurture the breed and let it become established here  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:44):**  in Australia.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:45):**  And are people mostly buying them as pets?  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:48):**  Oh yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:49):**  We had a few rams that were born that I didn't think were good enough to be breeding rams.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:54):**  And so we weathered them and we sold them as pets.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:33:57):**  So the people that have them are absolutely over the moon and think they're the luckiest  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:01):**  people in the world.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:02):**  So we have also people that are doing the breeding up program that have 50% weathered  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:10):**  and they are also being sold as pets and people are ecstatic.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:14):**  Can you tell me roughly what they cost just to get a sense of price?  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:18):**  Well, we sold the purebred weathers for $7,000 each.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:24):**  The first cross weathers are being sold for anywhere between $500 and $2,500 depending  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:31):**  on their markings and their confirmation and things like that.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:36):**  We've sold a few, a handful, about four purebred breeding stock and we've sold them for $25,000  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:43):**  each.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:44):**  My gosh.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:45):**  Well, there you go.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:47):**  People saying it's not commercial can have a look at that.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:51):**  I love that.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:52):**  One of the things I noticed, I don't know if you're on Twitter Belinda, but there's  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:34:55):**  the annual sheep poll that happens on Twitter and the valley took out the Merino in the  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:00):**  first round.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:01):**  Were you following that?  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:02):**  Well, I didn't know about it actually until it was too late.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:05):**  We actually got told about it right at the end and the Suffolk people do a lot of work  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:10):**  using Sean the sheep as their mascot for suffix and yeah, valet black nose did okay.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:16):**  But I think we might do better next year when people are a bit more aware that they're actually  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:21):**  here in the country.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:22):**  So we might have to work on that one.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:25):**  That's right.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:26):**  And it was close to the Suffolk.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:27):**  I think it was only one vote and I mean, that's controversial.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:30):**  Maybe we need a recount.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:31):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:32):**  I think we should.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:33):**  I think we should.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:34):**  So the more they're sort of well known here, I think the more popular they'll become because  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:40):**  it's not only, a lot of people don't realise, but it's not only how they look, but they  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:45):**  also have a very much different personality than your average sheep.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:50):**  A lot of people don't realise, but they are very much more like a dog.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:35:56):**  We've got one lady that bought one of the weathers and she's trained him to do his advanced  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:00):**  trick title already.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:01):**  And he's not even a year old yet.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:04):**  What does that mean?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:05):**  Like he can fetch or something or he can?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:06):**  Yeah, he can do all sorts of tricks.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:08):**  He can sit and he can go backwards and it's amazing what he can do.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:12):**  She goes sideways and she's taught him to go under things and do the weaving that the  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:16):**  dogs do and all of that.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:18):**  He's like, she can't believe how quickly she said he's learned more quickly than anything  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:22):**  else she's ever trained.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:24):**  And she's trained all sorts of stuff.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:26):**  So every breed has their pros and cons and advantages and disadvantages.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:32):**  And I think these guys have got a lot going for them and there seems to be a lot of interest.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:36):**  So I think that they'll be here for a long time to come.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:40):**  That's so cool, Belinda.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:41):**  So I guess last question for you, you mentioned some learnings initially from the goat dairy  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:45):**  and that experience.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:46):**  What have you learned from this one?  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:48):**  Any reflections on running a business or personally as well?  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:53):**  I think this one really took the cake for persistence and drive to get it right through  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:36:59):**  to the end.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:01):**  But in terms of my learning, it's probably opened my eyes to this sort of situation of  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:09):**  what other people can do to your business.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:12):**  So what the views of someone else can do and what a news story can give you as an advantage  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:17):**  and also what it can do as a disadvantage.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:20):**  And it's amazing how those outside forces that you might not have expected can play  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:26):**  into your business.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:28):**  Those first few articles that came up, there was an article that was written early on when  
**[0:37:35-0:37:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:35):**  the semen and embryos first arrived in Australia and I was disappointed in the article.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:42):**  But it actually gave us a lot of publicity.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:45):**  So it actually really kind of worked well in the end and I was disappointed by it at  
**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:51):**  the start.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:52):**  But then I kind of figured that it hadn't stopped the interest.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:37:56):**  It didn't stop people from contacting us to find out more about the breed and to get hold  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:38:02):**  of what they wanted.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:38:03):**  So although I thought it was a bad thing at the start, it actually turned out to be fine.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:38:09):**  So one of the things I've learned is just to sort of roll with the punches.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:38:13):**  So things hit you that you don't expect, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's the end of  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:38:19):**  everything and I thought that would have really impacted our business, but it really has made  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:38:24):**  no difference whatsoever, which is great.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:38:30):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/2022/1/27/belinda-cardinal-livestock-genetics#t=0:38:33):**  Thank you to our guest, Dr. Belinda Cardinal, founder of Capra Tech.

### Agtech - So What?  (2022-08-03)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to another special bonus episode of AgTech So What brought to you by  the Agfentik Group.  I'm Sarah Nalet and joining me today is my co-founder, co-host and today's guy in the  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:13):**  hot seat, Matthew Pryor.  Hi Sarah, how's it going?  Good.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:18):**  So as you probably remember, a few episodes ago, we published an experimental bonus episode  called the Three Fears of Farm Data, where Shane Thomas joined us to discuss your theory.  about the legitimate and not so legitimate fears that farmers have around farm data.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:34):**  At the end of the episode, we asked for listener thoughts and reactions.  Did you expect that we'd get any?  Oh, well, sure.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:43):**  I mean, I think I was worried that we might get too many.  The process that we went through where we kind of recorded stuff and then made an episode  out of it had me feeling a little nervous that some of the stuff I said or that we said  
**[0:00:56-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:56):**  might upset people a little bit.  I mean, we had decent opinions in a couple of areas.  I was a bit worried about getting canceled, but in the end it turned out well.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:04):**  And actually there was fantastic conversations.  My fears weren't justified like many farmer data fears and it was an awesome audience  response.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:12):**  Yeah, exactly.  In the end, we actually got a ton of reaction from across the industry, including a lot  of critiques, but also a lot of good points from our audience.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:21):**  And I figured that we might want to have you back, Matthew, to get into some of those comments  and have you respond to them.  Are you up for that?  
**[0:01:28-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:28):**  Sounds like fun.  All right.  So we're going to start by giving voice to the folks at the heart of Matthew's theory.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:36):**  So our first response came from farmer and longtime listener of the show and feedback  provider, Bernie Burns.  Hi, Matt.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:43):**  It's Bernie here.  I've just got a question in regards to the episode on the three fears of farm data.  I think early on you made a comment along the lines that you didn't understand why farmers  
**[0:01:54-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:54):**  were protective of their data because technology companies can find out most of the data through  remote sensing and other means.  I was just wondering if that's the case, then why is anyone chasing farmers' physical data,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:07):**  whether it be yield or quality or management practices at all, if they had faith in the  output of this remote sensing technology?  Bernie added his contention that farmers' data seems to be the most verifiable.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:22):**  He went on to say that though farmers might not be finding many practical private uses  for their data currently, if a business wants it, then it has value and thus shouldn't be  parted with for free.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:32):**  So Bernie here is raising, I think, two points.  One is a difference between remotely sensed data and directly sensed data that someone  actually has to decide to provide.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:44):**  And then I guess separately, the value that data has for someone that is requesting it  and inherently wanting it.  And are those the two kind of points that you drew from his feedback or what was your  
**[0:02:54-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:54):**  reaction?  Yeah, I mean, there was a decent amount of conversation around that first point around  the can you really conflate locally sourced with remotely sourced information.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:08):**  And I feel like our position is there's no absolute truth in that comparison.  And it's objectively true that data that's sourced directly will be more localised, likely  more accurate.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:26):**  But that point of accuracy is actually where the commercial element comes into it.  And that is that what am I prepared to pay for that accuracy?  And is there any real commercial benefit in a level of accuracy that's only available  
**[0:03:41-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:41):**  if you directly source or locally source and or for the things that you can't reasonably  remotely source today, is that kind of economic benefit enough to justify the additional cost?  So I guess I don't disagree with the observation that there are things today that you can get  
**[0:04:00-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:00):**  locally and there's a significant difference in accuracy in some kinds of data, certainly  between locally sourced and remotely sensed.  But beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:13):**  And that's the other point we're trying to make, which is that whilst that is true, the  only part of it that matters is when you do get to the bit about what's it worth.  And what's it worth is what does it cost to get in the first place?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:27):**  And then secondarily, what economic advantage can you convert it into?  And I think that's the part where increasingly we see the difference being less material  because if you find the economics first, then you can work backwards to the right balance.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:43):**  I think most of the time we have this idea of I've got the data, I want to get paid for  the data, but it's not at all clear why someone would pay because we don't know what the solution  is or the economic advantage they're capturing with that data.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:58):**  I think that's what kind of the core of the response here is.  It's like, well, if someone wants it, it must be valuable and they should pay me for it.  What's your response to that?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:08):**  I think that's what ends, that is what keeps us in this loop that we never get out of.  And it's based on that premise that it's mine and I shouldn't give it up until I get paid  for it.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:19):**  And there's an interesting link here between this conversation and the insurance conversation.  There is a fundamental principle in insurance which has a Latin name that I'm sure I'm going  to butcher, but basically Uberimafidis is this concept of ultimate goodness.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:38):**  And it's a fundamental principle to insurance that insurance system will not work unless  both the policy holder and the insurance side share the information in best faith.  And so when you take that view, it's like the idea that it's mine and I won't give it  
**[0:05:56-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:56):**  to anybody until they can tell me why I should.  It's like why you should is because the system will work better and more fairly for all with  the greatest level of good faith data sharing.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:08):**  And I think that's the way to get out of this kind of loop of I won't give it to you until  you give me something in return.  What you get in return is a system that works better.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:17):**  I was talking to an autonomous vehicle company the other day and they were wondering about  sharing the data they get around obstacle detection and paddock and fields, different  train data and things like that, which the intention there was like, it just makes the  
**[0:06:32-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:32):**  algorithm better.  Like GPS companies collect that data to make the GPS work better.  And the hypothesis was like, oh, farmers won't be concerned at all about sharing that data  
**[0:06:41-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:41):**  because it's not agronomic data, it's not production data.  It's just about, and it's just about making the systems work better.  So it'll work better for them.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:49):**  And I was like, that's fascinating because the psychology would like, why wouldn't that  be the same?  And then we make our yield predictions better and then we make all these other things better,  
**[0:06:58-0:07:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:58):**  but it doesn't seem to translate somehow when it crosses over this line to it's about things  that will make me money, I think is where it gets challenging maybe.  Yeah.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:08):**  And I think that's the, that is the challenge, right?  It is now a human psychology challenge, which is we have framed the conversation permanently  in terms of fear.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:18):**  And so the payment is the hurdle, which will get me over my fear.  And I think we've just, whilst ever we frame the conversation that way, we're not going  to make the progress and it doesn't get us to those other benefits of systems working  
**[0:07:34-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:34):**  better.  And I think when you talk about this digitally native, I mean, this huge initiatives around  that in autonomous vehicles in transport, like everything that a company learns navigating  
**[0:07:46-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:46):**  the streets of any given city is going to make every autonomous vehicle safer.  And surely that's better.  And as you pointed out, it equally applies vehicle autonomy on farms.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:56):**  Why wouldn't it equally apply with all of the models that will be used to provide insurance  and other kind of risk transfer products, which might, is going to make agriculture  better, is going to provide better economics.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:08:08):**  And in the face of significant climate challenges, we need those other parts to be, to work as  well as they can possibly can.  Eric Taipala from Sentara also touched on the Google kind of analogy, which I think  
**[0:08:21-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:08:21):**  is one that comes up often in this data conversation, given we all have Google in our pocket.  Here's what he said.  Hey guys, my name is Eric Taipala and I am one of the founders of Sentara.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:08:31):**  My company has the privilege of serving multiple CPG customers and ag retailers with direct  agronomic insights, but also some reporting for sustainability, ESG and MRV applications.  And I want to suggest that data trust concerns are legitimate.  
**[0:08:48-0:09:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:08:48):**  By way of analogy on the satellite example, we're all sort of comfortable now that Google  can drive by our houses and apartments and take pictures.  And we know that perhaps they will learn something about our lives in doing this.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:09:00):**  We all must support this to some degree, since there's no real effort to stop it, but there  likely would be much less comfort if Google was digging through our kitchen drawers and  reading our mail.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:09:11):**  Daily satellite imagery is like Google street view, but a fully integrated agronomic platform  is like reading the mail because it contains a mountain of other finer grain sources of  data.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:09:23):**  These data are needed to generate a lot of useful insights, but they also contain all  the information necessary to reverse engineer cost of production, as well as decode a bunch  of other behaviors.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:09:34):**  I know this can be used against the grower because I've seen it used against the grower.  Without appropriate transparency and governance, the distrust is actually very well-founded.  Not all uses are nefarious, but some are, and they impair progress for the rest of us.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:09:49):**  I am a digital native and a huge believer in the net positive benefits digital brings  to the food and ag system.  But I think that not owning up to the legitimate concern and challenge doesn't really serve  
**[0:09:59-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:09:59):**  the ecosystem.  Matthew, I feel like this goes right to the core of what you've been saying.  What's your response to Eric?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:09):**  Well, my first response is to really be grateful for that awesome input.  It's really thoughtful and I want to first acknowledge how much we appreciate people  who contribute in such a thoughtful way.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:22):**  I think so first off is we're not saying that there isn't risk and harm here, but we're  saying ultimately that there isn't a meaningful difference between the kind of benefits and  harms that can come from sharing locally sourced data compared to what can be done with remote.  
**[0:10:44-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:44):**  And so in that frame, Eric's example is an exact example of what is already possible.  And so whilst it is true, he's picked a case there of a harm that comes to a producer and  without appropriate disclosure and all kind of stuff that wasn't actually the point we  
**[0:11:03-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:03):**  were trying to make.  We were trying to say that because that is true, then if we focus more on benefits, more  benefits will flow than harms will flow.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:15):**  And because there is a difference in fidelity between locally sourced data and remotely  sourced data, farmers will be better off if they share more of their locally sourced data  because it will prevent inaccurate decisions being made where that cost accuracy equation  
**[0:11:33-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:33):**  is different in someone else's mind.  So I think that's the first.  If I were being more ornery, I might point out that if someone was using the free version  
**[0:11:41-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:41):**  of Gmail as their mail reader, then Google absolutely is reading their mail and absolutely  is using the information that they get from reading the person's mail to put products  in front of them and to guide their searching experience through the internet.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:59):**  It's an important point, but I think that as users of the internet, of Facebook, of  whatever, we already have signed up to having an awful lot of our life surveilled.  But the benefit of me having a pretty awesome mail system for nothing clearly outweighs  
**[0:12:17-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:17):**  almost everybody.  It happens as a result of my using that free milestones.  It's interesting because one of the things I think you said in the last episode when  
**[0:12:29-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:29):**  we chatted about it was like this whole value proposition ROI conversion is, I guess I thought  you said maybe a frustrating one, but that's what I'm hearing from you now is like the  point is that this directly sensed data, the possible value we can create and by sharing  
**[0:12:46-0:12:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:46):**  it we enable us to create is just going to be beneficial.  And so that goes back to your principle of benefit of the doubt is let's share it.  Let's build these products.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:54):**  Let's deliver this value.  But I thought you pushed back against the value proposition argument in the previous  episode.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:00):**  I think I'm fascinated by human psychology and I've been doing a lot of reading around  unconscious bias and bad thinking.  And one of the examples of bad thinking was people thinking that they're misunderstood,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:12):**  that people don't understand what they're trying to say.  And the reality is that they're not communicating properly.  So I'll own up to suffering from that fallacy in this case.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:22):**  I think that it is a challenge because you can't say specifically, okay, the benefit  that's going to flow.  But I actually think that insurance example is a good concrete example of why a system  
**[0:13:34-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:34):**  will work better and more fairly and actually provide really significant benefit to the  entire stakeholder group when people are prepared to share.  And they do, right?  
**[0:13:46-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:46):**  When you look at the kinds of information that a lot of crop insurance is based on,  the US federal government, for example, does manually collect very large amounts of very  specific data and farmers understand why that's necessary.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:00):**  I guess they probably also believe that the USDA or whoever isn't going to then use it  for nefarious means, but they're doing it to get the benefit.  They're doing it to get an insurance system that works and works in very important ways.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:15):**  So I think that's a big example of the kind of principle working and in a specific case,  but it is very hard to say every exact reason why it's going to be better for a farmer to  share more of their locally sourced data.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:30):**  Yeah.  I guess the argument that we often hear is that sharp farmers would share it if the value  proposition was stronger.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:36):**  And you're saying we should share it with good governance and transparency because that  is what will make the value proposition stronger over time.  We also have some feedback from Dan Schulze who writes a great agtech marketing newsletter.  
**[0:14:51-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:51):**  And we talked about marketing on the last episode in terms of what agtech companies  are or are not yet willing to tell their customers.  Hey guys, this is Dan.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:00):**  I just wanted to reach out and say thanks so much for your last episode talking about  farm data.  I really appreciated that conversation.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:07):**  I also wanted to add to that conversation if I could and say that I see the issue of  sharing farm data specifically as a marketing problem.  While the challenge is multifaceted, one of the things I've been considering recently  
**[0:15:19-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:19):**  is the idea that the industry has failed to properly communicate a meaningful point of  view on the value of data and provide tangible benefits for end users inside of that data.  As a result, the majority of the marketing in this industry is gutless right now.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:36):**  And as a result of that, most companies in agtech are chasing the benefit of a virtuous  cycle or a platform without anchoring the purpose of that platform into the internal  narrative of the customer they wish to serve.  
**[0:15:49-0:16:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:49):**  With no point of view, you have no way to describe what problems you solve and no way  to establish a new category that seeks to overcome that set of problems.  With no category, you have no way to stand out and capture the 76% of the market cap  
**[0:16:03-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:03):**  for your space.  And suddenly we end up in the situation we are in today with hundreds of companies feeding  the world without a meaningful market differentiation and an anemic customer list.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:16):**  Big shout out to Dan too.  I loved when he sent this through and reading it.  Like it just completely resonated with me.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:23):**  So I think following on from what we just talked about in terms of trying to be specific,  that's what I take away from this.  Dan is basically saying there are category creation opportunities here when you can be  
**[0:16:34-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:34):**  really specific about the benefits that are going to flow and why your specific offering  is going to be better or to the point why your product is only possible.  These benefits are actually only available when you're prepared to sort of participate  
**[0:16:50-0:17:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:50):**  in a new kind of economy or this new kind of collective or whatever it might be.  So I think this is where we get into the specific advice to kind of founders or solution providers,  like do the hard work.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:03):**  And in classic lumpers style, I'm going to lump this together with some of our conversations  around insurance, which is we talk about the idea that disruption and dis- ideation only  becomes possible when you think about a digitally native way that this data kind of flows and  
**[0:17:22-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:22):**  specific to insurance in those conversations.  But I think that is a good example of this kind of category creation.  A lot of people have written about that embedded or default insurance.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:32):**  And I think that's a very good example of category creation, that it's only possible  once a series of kind of technological things are possible and like, why would I not want  that?  
**[0:17:44-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:44):**  And so I think that kind of value discovery category creation is what is the kind of thoughts  that I get in reading Dan's input.  Yeah, Nigel from the Queensland Cotton Corporation actually also built on this with his comments  
**[0:17:58-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:58):**  around other possible uses and what we get as we move more into collaborations between  organizations.  I thought the point mentioned regarding collaboration between organizations to end up with a virtual  
**[0:18:11-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:11):**  platform that covered across supply chain needs was very interesting.  Very much of a mindset that we need to get outside our restrictive proprietary applications  and approaches to unlock greater potential than organizations acting individually can  
**[0:18:29-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:29):**  achieve.  His comments here are going on our mission of cura- cura- in the previous episode.  I'm wondering, Matthew, are there examples that you're seeing today of this starting  
**[0:18:38-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:38):**  to play out, either a strong value proposition around a more kind of connected supply chain  or like organizations working together in a ecosystem with shared data where they're  able to create more benefits for the growers?  
**[0:18:52-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:52):**  Yeah, I mean, that is a challenge.  My thoughts here in Nigel's comments were how this conversation commonly plays out is  where do you find the balance between industry good and is the industry good the catalyst  
**[0:19:05-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:05):**  for that sort of cura- or cooperative sort of structure?  And we've done work in this area in the past, say in the wine industry, where there are  benefits that will flow to a supply chain.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:18):**  So in the example of a winemaker, it's very much in their interest to have detailed information  about yield and quality from the large number of contract growers, because the problem they  end up with is under capacity or over capacity production.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:34):**  And that's either means fruit gets wasted, or it means that they have containers and  vessels that are underutilized and kind of ruins their economics.  The question then becomes, do they do that privately?  
**[0:19:46-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:46):**  Do they try and build a platform or catalyze a couple of vendors together to say, hey,  we need a yield estimation thing and weed management kind of advice thing, and we want  to extend that as part of our contract to growers?  
**[0:20:00-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:00):**  Or does the industry come in, and I think this is probably the angle that Nigel's coming  from, does the kind of industry come in and say there's benefits?  So Integrity Systems Company with the Australian Red Meat Industry would be a kind of example  
**[0:20:13-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:13):**  of that where because of the need for biosecurity was so high of such significant economic value,  it made sense for the industry to step in and say, we are going to manage all of this  biosecurity information relating to individual animal identity and properties.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:29):**  I think our view there is it's still nascent infrastructure.  And whilst it's heavily used, there are still plenty of ways where ISC as an Australian  example, you could imagine a parallel universe where that was much bigger and much more significant  
**[0:20:46-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:46):**  technical infrastructure than it is maybe as two ways of exploring that thought.  Yeah, I think the interesting points to tease out there are like finding the use case where  it makes sense for industry to step in because the incentives for any individual player aren't  
**[0:20:59-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:59):**  sufficient to create that collaboration or build that kind of cross system either data  sharing or platform or whatever it ends up being.  The second is as the entity that wants to intervene in that system, do you build, do  
**[0:21:10-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:10):**  you buy or what are the other options that you could choose to use to get something to  exist?  And we've seen a lot of people choosing to try to build things and our experience was  
**[0:21:20-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:20):**  probably industry bodies who are like not often digitally native and not great at building  software or even commissioning software to get built often by consultants is where this  leads to a lot of challenge because existing vendors are already playing in the system.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:34):**  There's already people collecting yield data.  There's already people monitoring quality.  There's already people doing this.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:38):**  And so instead a role that industry can uniquely play is finding ways to align incentives where  they don't otherwise exist for those vendors to collaborate.  So whether that's funding a project that kind of connects the last mile of the pipes or  
**[0:21:52-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:52):**  creating a network of growers who are putting up their hand to say, we will become customers  of this and maybe subsidizing the initial implementation or initial data set that can  catalyze that.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:03):**  I think that's where we get into interesting examples of interventions in the system that  enable stuff to exist that otherwise that otherwise wouldn't have because of the incentives  that exist without it.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:14):**  Yeah.  And in other commentary we had the socials people did make observations about things  like the Ausfarm data exchange, which is an Australian initiative, private industry led  
**[0:22:26-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:26):**  effort around creating a significant amount of digital infrastructure to support much  higher levels of sharing of farm data and the kind of governance and transparency that  you might want to be there.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:37):**  So there are plenty other examples, but I think perhaps the reasons for lack of adoption  sometimes those sorts of things is they're always built with a particular commercial  outcome in mind or if they're not, they get that the risk is that they end up being technical  
**[0:22:52-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:52):**  infrastructure without a economic driver.  Pip Grant also offered a view of an alternative future, one that she describes as the Spotify  model for farm data.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:02):**  Imagine if a farmer could look through their data sharing preferences on their farm management  software and select the data points that they're comfortable in sharing.  And then at some point they get a notification saying that someone's used their data and  
**[0:23:15-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:15):**  they've been paid a small dividend, say $10 in return.  Or instead they could get a notification saying your data has just been used in a project  that has made your seasonal forecast 20% more accurate or your data has just been used to  
**[0:23:29-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:29):**  respond to a biosecurity threat in your area.  It's then the farmers would start to see the real value in sharing some of their data,  whether it's better decision making, reducing risks, taking advantage of new opportunities.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:42):**  The real value of sharing farm data could and will be significant and seen in a farm's  bottom line.  Pip offered a follow up on these comments as well with some ideas of companies that  
**[0:23:52-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:52):**  are addressing farm data concerns in interesting ways.  While analyzing specific companies is a bit beyond the scope of this episode, Matthew  took a look at the list.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:01):**  It seems like the companies that Pip has referenced fall roughly into two camps where there's  one, which is a lot more about how data is actually sourced and where like the physical  means of acquisition as opposed to infrastructure that much more recognizes that there's heterogeneous  
**[0:24:23-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:23):**  sources out there and that the real work actually is in cleansing and standardizing and integrating  and making it useful rather than solving the collection problem.  Yeah, that's definitely been one of my, I guess one of our evolving observations about  
**[0:24:39-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:39):**  the kinds of companies we look at as investors.  Like do we think that it will be venture scale to back companies that are doing data collection  and doing it in unique ways if they've got ways to modify the light, to be able to have  
**[0:24:51-0:25:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:51):**  better imagery that you can build data sets against, or if they've got unique sensors  that they've developed to do things more precisely.  If you want to be in the data collection business, increasingly it makes sense to be in the analytics  
**[0:25:04-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:04):**  businesses and to have the ability to get unique insights, but then what data sources  are you pulling from?  And I guess as more effort comes into this landscape, the different kinds of business  
**[0:25:15-0:25:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:15):**  models and partnerships and way the pipes get hooked up are evolving.  What's your, yeah, how would you describe, Matthew, what what are the exciting parts  of those categories or which of those categories are increasingly exciting?  
**[0:25:27-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:27):**  Well my mind went the other way in terms of, I think we're the ones that have challenges  certainly are, yeah, maybe the way to think about it is do your economics benefit from  the inexorable cycle of technological improvement?  
**[0:25:44-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:44):**  And I think that's always been the challenge with anything that's got a presence in the  field that with hardware you're making concrete choices, picking the best of what's available  at that time, but once it's in the field it's hard not for it to be a sunk cost in a lot  
**[0:26:04-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:04):**  of ways.  It's specific about the way it measures, about the way it communicates, about the capacity  of its batteries and all those sorts of things.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:13):**  And so I think the challenge is there in a business economics sense is to overcome that  total ownership.  And whilst it is true, and again some of the input was like, oh but satellites can only  
**[0:26:25-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:25):**  do this and 10 meters and that kind of thing, for sure that's true today, but dollars to  donuts that it's 10x better than that in less than 10 years.  And so if that is true and we're talking about business models more than specific technology  
**[0:26:45-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:45):**  innovation, then I think the ones that are where that cycle is a tailwind rather than  a headwind are the ones that I'm more excited about.  And do you think that there's a venture scale opportunity for, again not that venture scale  
**[0:26:58-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:58):**  is the only good kind of opportunity, but for some of the kind of connective tissue  or infrastructure type plays that Pip is talking about here?  She gives the example of a Spotify for farm data.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:10):**  What do you think about that?  Well, I mean, yes, we have imagined in fact that we have made investments based on the  idea that a value chain is increasingly a digital artifact or a digital asset and that

So I think that's a pretty appealing idea when we talk to people deeply involved in  these parts of the value chain, like there's so much knowledge that is built up with individuals.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:44):**  And that's why sometimes certainly why the case that particular midstream participants  do what they do really well.  But that idea of a higher level of agility, we see this in kind of general business or  
**[0:27:57-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:57):**  say e-commerce would be a good example of where the sort of low code ability to put  really sophisticated campaigns together and to get the user kind of all the way to actually  paying for their basket of goods.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:28:11):**  Yeah, I think it's pretty easy to imagine agri-food value chains that want to be built  on top of infrastructure that understands the asset class a lot better, that understands  what the characteristics of the asset are, but doesn't require me to jump in there and  
**[0:28:25-0:28:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:28:25):**  write Ruby or no code to mine the value that we really can see is there.  Our final listener comment came from another longtime friend of the show and industry thought  leader who shared these comments.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:28:40):**  Hi, I'm Rishi Pate, author of the newsletter Software is Feeding the World.  In the recent issue I wrote, if you can provide value to your customers, they'll be much more  likely to share the data with you and worry much less about privacy.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:28:54):**  There's immense talk about privacy and Facebook, but still billions of people continue to use  it because of the value provided by Facebook.  Rather than the farmer's fears of their data being locked into a particular solution due  
**[0:29:07-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:29:07):**  to lack of interoperability, the lack of interoperability has been primarily driven by two reasons.  Number one, zero-sum game mentality.  If I allow sharing of data and make it easy to do so, I will lose while my partner competitor  
**[0:29:22-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:29:22):**  will win.  Number two, ad tech solution providers are not able to recognize the value of data sharing  and collaboration and so have allocated resources to their own solution rather than making it  
**[0:29:34-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:29:34):**  easy to share data with between two systems.  So my thesis is that privacy is important to protect farmers' interests and if ad tech  companies can provide enough value, then the issues with privacy will go down.  
**[0:29:48-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:29:48):**  Interoperability is an elusive goal with a murky definition and creates resource prioritization  and allocation challenges.  The factory has no roof will be more true in the future, but we'll still need to be  
**[0:30:00-0:30:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:00):**  augmented with field level data.  Rishi really hits on this idea around interoperability and what's needed to unlock or what is preventing  the unlock of interoperability.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:11):**  What do you think of the two reasons that he gives?  Yeah, like the kind of zero-sum thread to pull on and to some extent like that, probably  there is that same principle with the kind of good faith insurance example, like to have  
**[0:30:28-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:28):**  that zero-sum mentality ignores the idea that in actual fact, we can only create these new  solutions when things work better together.  And to some extent, I guess, goes to the sort of Keiretsu principle.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:44):**  Those are unfounded fears from a vendor point of view, but I think Rishi's point there is  if that's what you're worried about, you don't have a proper value proposition, which I think  is something that we're super comfortable with as well.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:57):**  And probably also goes to Dan's point, which is if you're genuinely in the category of  creation business here, then you should be confident about being open and being part  of an open system because you've actually identified where the value is and you're confident  
**[0:31:12-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:12):**  in delivering it.  Yeah, it got me thinking a little bit, not so much around interoperability, but around  what companies in the architect space have been really confident and bullish in their  
**[0:31:21-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:21):**  marketing around like we do this and just owning what they do.  And actually farmer's business network came to mind and we had Charles on the podcast  recently, but just that they were unapologetically a farmer first in some ways that maybe was  
**[0:31:36-0:31:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:36):**  grading others, but was really I think bold around what they do, who they're for and why  they do it and the things they're not going to do.  It was interesting actually, even thinking about how we coach or think about supporting  
**[0:31:47-0:32:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:47):**  our founders in our portfolio to have that kind of bold positioning.  The presentation from swarm farm the other day, they've gone from, there's been a series  of revolutions in the industry and now there'll be this other one, which is like a yes.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:00):**  And in some ways marketing is better if it's like you're wrong, this is broken.  We're doing it differently.  And so the positioning they've been playing with a little more recently is we've been  
**[0:32:08-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:08):**  promised this precision agro revolution and it just hasn't been delivered.  Like we're not getting the value from this because all of this talk around this data  that we can collect in the mountains of it is just not working for farmers.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:22):**  And so this whole narrative is broken.  Instead, what we need is actual equipment and tools that use the data to do useful things  for farmers.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:30):**  And so starting to get at a bit more of a positioning around like the data for data  sake is not useful.  It needs to have a value proposition for the grower on the ground to actually do stuff.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:40):**  Yeah, I think that is a good example.  I was having a conversation with a bunch of pretty active producers yesterday and I think  that exact example came up is once you experienced what it's like to have fully autonomous selective  
**[0:32:52-0:33:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:52):**  fallow weed management, like you're never going to go back to whatever it is you used  to do before that because it just makes so much sense.  The sort of combination of those factors now, absolutely you can't do that without a high  
**[0:33:05-0:33:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:05):**  degree of data sharing and ideally that would be supported by a platform.  Autonomy is only workable and it's only good because large amounts of data sharing are  happening and there's significant amounts of infrastructure.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:19):**  So I think those are good examples of in the end, the application wins, right?  Like where there's compelling economics is where you should focus.  And if you're going around in a loop, having trouble explaining to farmers why they should  
**[0:33:33-0:33:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:33):**  share their data, I don't think that's the actual problem.  I think the actual problem is that you haven't discovered an economically meaningful solution  or your solution is not to an economically meaningful problem.  
**[0:33:45-0:34:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:45):**  With that, I think we will call this another experimental episode of AgTech So What.

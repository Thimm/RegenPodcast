### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 03 Aug 2022 20:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to another special bonus episode of AgTech So What brought to you by  
**[0:00:07-0:00:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:07):**  the Agfentik Group.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:08):**  I'm Sarah Nalet and joining me today is my co-founder, co-host and today's guy in the  
**[0:00:13-0:00:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:13):**  hot seat, Matthew Pryor.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:15):**  Hi Sarah, how's it going?  
**[0:00:17-0:00:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:17):**  Good.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:18):**  So as you probably remember, a few episodes ago, we published an experimental bonus episode  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:23):**  called the Three Fears of Farm Data, where Shane Thomas joined us to discuss your theory.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:29):**  about the legitimate and not so legitimate fears that farmers have around farm data.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:34):**  At the end of the episode, we asked for listener thoughts and reactions.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:38):**  Did you expect that we'd get any?  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:40):**  Oh, well, sure.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:43):**  I mean, I think I was worried that we might get too many.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:46):**  The process that we went through where we kind of recorded stuff and then made an episode  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:51):**  out of it had me feeling a little nervous that some of the stuff I said or that we said  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:56):**  might upset people a little bit.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:00:58):**  I mean, we had decent opinions in a couple of areas.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:01):**  I was a bit worried about getting canceled, but in the end it turned out well.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:04):**  And actually there was fantastic conversations.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:07):**  My fears weren't justified like many farmer data fears and it was an awesome audience  
**[0:01:11-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:11):**  response.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:12):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:13):**  In the end, we actually got a ton of reaction from across the industry, including a lot  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:17):**  of critiques, but also a lot of good points from our audience.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:21):**  And I figured that we might want to have you back, Matthew, to get into some of those comments  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:25):**  and have you respond to them.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:27):**  Are you up for that?  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:28):**  Sounds like fun.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:29):**  All right.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:30):**  So we're going to start by giving voice to the folks at the heart of Matthew's theory.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:36):**  So our first response came from farmer and longtime listener of the show and feedback  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:40):**  provider, Bernie Burns.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:42):**  Hi, Matt.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:43):**  It's Bernie here.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:44):**  I've just got a question in regards to the episode on the three fears of farm data.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:48):**  I think early on you made a comment along the lines that you didn't understand why farmers  
**[0:01:54-0:02:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:01:54):**  were protective of their data because technology companies can find out most of the data through  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:01):**  remote sensing and other means.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:02):**  I was just wondering if that's the case, then why is anyone chasing farmers' physical data,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:07):**  whether it be yield or quality or management practices at all, if they had faith in the  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:14):**  output of this remote sensing technology?  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:18):**  Bernie added his contention that farmers' data seems to be the most verifiable.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:22):**  He went on to say that though farmers might not be finding many practical private uses  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:26):**  for their data currently, if a business wants it, then it has value and thus shouldn't be  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:30):**  parted with for free.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:32):**  So Bernie here is raising, I think, two points.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:35):**  One is a difference between remotely sensed data and directly sensed data that someone  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:41):**  actually has to decide to provide.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:44):**  And then I guess separately, the value that data has for someone that is requesting it  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:49):**  and inherently wanting it.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:51):**  And are those the two kind of points that you drew from his feedback or what was your  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:54):**  reaction?  
**[0:02:55-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:02:55):**  Yeah, I mean, there was a decent amount of conversation around that first point around  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:02):**  the can you really conflate locally sourced with remotely sourced information.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:08):**  And I feel like our position is there's no absolute truth in that comparison.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:16):**  And it's objectively true that data that's sourced directly will be more localised, likely  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:25):**  more accurate.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:26):**  But that point of accuracy is actually where the commercial element comes into it.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:29):**  And that is that what am I prepared to pay for that accuracy?  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:35):**  And is there any real commercial benefit in a level of accuracy that's only available  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:41):**  if you directly source or locally source and or for the things that you can't reasonably  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:46):**  remotely source today, is that kind of economic benefit enough to justify the additional cost?  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:03:53):**  So I guess I don't disagree with the observation that there are things today that you can get  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:00):**  locally and there's a significant difference in accuracy in some kinds of data, certainly  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:06):**  between locally sourced and remotely sensed.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:11):**  But beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:13):**  And that's the other point we're trying to make, which is that whilst that is true, the  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:18):**  only part of it that matters is when you do get to the bit about what's it worth.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:22):**  And what's it worth is what does it cost to get in the first place?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:27):**  And then secondarily, what economic advantage can you convert it into?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:31):**  And I think that's the part where increasingly we see the difference being less material  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:37):**  because if you find the economics first, then you can work backwards to the right balance.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:43):**  I think most of the time we have this idea of I've got the data, I want to get paid for  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:47):**  the data, but it's not at all clear why someone would pay because we don't know what the solution  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:52):**  is or the economic advantage they're capturing with that data.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:04:58):**  I think that's what kind of the core of the response here is.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:02):**  It's like, well, if someone wants it, it must be valuable and they should pay me for it.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:06):**  What's your response to that?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:08):**  I think that's what ends, that is what keeps us in this loop that we never get out of.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:13):**  And it's based on that premise that it's mine and I shouldn't give it up until I get paid  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:18):**  for it.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:19):**  And there's an interesting link here between this conversation and the insurance conversation.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:25):**  There is a fundamental principle in insurance which has a Latin name that I'm sure I'm going  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:31):**  to butcher, but basically Uberimafidis is this concept of ultimate goodness.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:38):**  And it's a fundamental principle to insurance that insurance system will not work unless  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:44):**  both the policy holder and the insurance side share the information in best faith.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:52):**  And so when you take that view, it's like the idea that it's mine and I won't give it  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:56):**  to anybody until they can tell me why I should.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:05:59):**  It's like why you should is because the system will work better and more fairly for all with

**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:08):**  And I think that's the way to get out of this kind of loop of I won't give it to you until  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:13):**  you give me something in return.

**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:17):**  I was talking to an autonomous vehicle company the other day and they were wondering about  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:23):**  sharing the data they get around obstacle detection and paddock and fields, different  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:29):**  train data and things like that, which the intention there was like, it just makes the  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:32):**  algorithm better.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:33):**  Like GPS companies collect that data to make the GPS work better.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:37):**  And the hypothesis was like, oh, farmers won't be concerned at all about sharing that data  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:41):**  because it's not agronomic data, it's not production data.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:45):**  It's just about, and it's just about making the systems work better.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:47):**  So it'll work better for them.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:49):**  And I was like, that's fascinating because the psychology would like, why wouldn't that  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:54):**  be the same?

**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:06:58):**  but it doesn't seem to translate somehow when it crosses over this line to it's about things  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:03):**  that will make me money, I think is where it gets challenging maybe.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:08):**  And I think that's the, that is the challenge, right?  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:11):**  It is now a human psychology challenge, which is we have framed the conversation permanently  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:16):**  in terms of fear.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:18):**  And so the payment is the hurdle, which will get me over my fear.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:26):**  And I think we've just, whilst ever we frame the conversation that way, we're not going  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:29):**  to make the progress and it doesn't get us to those other benefits of systems working  
**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:34):**  better.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:35):**  And I think when you talk about this digitally native, I mean, this huge initiatives around  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:40):**  that in autonomous vehicles in transport, like everything that a company learns navigating  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:46):**  the streets of any given city is going to make every autonomous vehicle safer.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:51):**  And surely that's better.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:52):**  And as you pointed out, it equally applies vehicle autonomy on farms.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:07:56):**  Why wouldn't it equally apply with all of the models that will be used to provide insurance  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:08:02):**  and other kind of risk transfer products, which might, is going to make agriculture  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:08:06):**  better, is going to provide better economics.

**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:08:16):**  Eric Taipala from Sentara also touched on the Google kind of analogy, which I think  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:08:21):**  is one that comes up often in this data conversation, given we all have Google in our pocket.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:08:26):**  Here's what he said.

**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:08:48):**  By way of analogy on the satellite example, we're all sort of comfortable now that Google

**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:09:00):**  We all must support this to some degree, since there's no real effort to stop it, but there

**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:07):**  What's your response to Eric?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:09):**  Well, my first response is to really be grateful for that awesome input.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:14):**  It's really thoughtful and I want to first acknowledge how much we appreciate people  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:19):**  who contribute in such a thoughtful way.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:22):**  I think so first off is we're not saying that there isn't risk and harm here, but we're  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:30):**  saying ultimately that there isn't a meaningful difference between the kind of benefits and  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:37):**  harms that can come from sharing locally sourced data compared to what can be done with remote.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:44):**  And so in that frame, Eric's example is an exact example of what is already possible.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:50):**  And so whilst it is true, he's picked a case there of a harm that comes to a producer and  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:10:57):**  without appropriate disclosure and all kind of stuff that wasn't actually the point we  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:03):**  were trying to make.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:04):**  We were trying to say that because that is true, then if we focus more on benefits, more  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:12):**  benefits will flow than harms will flow.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:15):**  And because there is a difference in fidelity between locally sourced data and remotely  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:19):**  sourced data, farmers will be better off if they share more of their locally sourced data  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:26):**  because it will prevent inaccurate decisions being made where that cost accuracy equation  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:33):**  is different in someone else's mind.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:34):**  So I think that's the first.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:35):**  If I were being more ornery, I might point out that if someone was using the free version

**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:46):**  is using the information that they get from reading the person's mail to put products  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:52):**  in front of them and to guide their searching experience through the internet.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:11:59):**  It's an important point, but I think that as users of the internet, of Facebook, of  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:04):**  whatever, we already have signed up to having an awful lot of our life surveilled.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:11):**  But the benefit of me having a pretty awesome mail system for nothing clearly outweighs  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:17):**  almost everybody.

**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:25):**  It's interesting because one of the things I think you said in the last episode when  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:29):**  we chatted about it was like this whole value proposition ROI conversion is, I guess I thought  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:35):**  you said maybe a frustrating one, but that's what I'm hearing from you now is like the  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:39):**  point is that this directly sensed data, the possible value we can create and by sharing  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:46):**  it we enable us to create is just going to be beneficial.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:50):**  And so that goes back to your principle of benefit of the doubt is let's share it.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:53):**  Let's build these products.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:54):**  Let's deliver this value.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:55):**  But I thought you pushed back against the value proposition argument in the previous  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:12:59):**  episode.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:00):**  I think I'm fascinated by human psychology and I've been doing a lot of reading around  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:03):**  unconscious bias and bad thinking.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:07):**  And one of the examples of bad thinking was people thinking that they're misunderstood,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:12):**  that people don't understand what they're trying to say.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:14):**  And the reality is that they're not communicating properly.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:16):**  So I'll own up to suffering from that fallacy in this case.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:22):**  I think that it is a challenge because you can't say specifically, okay, the benefit  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:27):**  that's going to flow.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:28):**  But I actually think that insurance example is a good concrete example of why a system  
**[0:13:34-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:34):**  will work better and more fairly and actually provide really significant benefit to the  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:41):**  entire stakeholder group when people are prepared to share.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:45):**  And they do, right?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:46):**  When you look at the kinds of information that a lot of crop insurance is based on,  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:51):**  the US federal government, for example, does manually collect very large amounts of very  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:13:57):**  specific data and farmers understand why that's necessary.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:00):**  I guess they probably also believe that the USDA or whoever isn't going to then use it  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:06):**  for nefarious means, but they're doing it to get the benefit.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:09):**  They're doing it to get an insurance system that works and works in very important ways.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:15):**  So I think that's a big example of the kind of principle working and in a specific case,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:21):**  but it is very hard to say every exact reason why it's going to be better for a farmer to  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:28):**  share more of their locally sourced data.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:31):**  I guess the argument that we often hear is that sharp farmers would share it if the value  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:35):**  proposition was stronger.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:36):**  And you're saying we should share it with good governance and transparency because that  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:42):**  is what will make the value proposition stronger over time.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:45):**  We also have some feedback from Dan Schulze who writes a great agtech marketing newsletter.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:51):**  And we talked about marketing on the last episode in terms of what agtech companies  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:55):**  are or are not yet willing to tell their customers.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:14:58):**  Hey guys, this is Dan.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:00):**  I just wanted to reach out and say thanks so much for your last episode talking about  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:04):**  farm data.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:05):**  I really appreciated that conversation.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:07):**  I also wanted to add to that conversation if I could and say that I see the issue of  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:11):**  sharing farm data specifically as a marketing problem.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:15):**  While the challenge is multifaceted, one of the things I've been considering recently  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:19):**  is the idea that the industry has failed to properly communicate a meaningful point of  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:24):**  view on the value of data and provide tangible benefits for end users inside of that data.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:32):**  As a result, the majority of the marketing in this industry is gutless right now.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:36):**  And as a result of that, most companies in agtech are chasing the benefit of a virtuous  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:40):**  cycle or a platform without anchoring the purpose of that platform into the internal  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:46):**  narrative of the customer they wish to serve.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:49):**  With no point of view, you have no way to describe what problems you solve and no way  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:54):**  to establish a new category that seeks to overcome that set of problems.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:15:59):**  With no category, you have no way to stand out and capture the 76% of the market cap  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:03):**  for your space.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:05):**  And suddenly we end up in the situation we are in today with hundreds of companies feeding  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:10):**  the world without a meaningful market differentiation and an anemic customer list.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:16):**  Big shout out to Dan too.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:17):**  I loved when he sent this through and reading it.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:19):**  Like it just completely resonated with me.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:23):**  So I think following on from what we just talked about in terms of trying to be specific,  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:28):**  that's what I take away from this.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:29):**  Dan is basically saying there are category creation opportunities here when you can be  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:34):**  really specific about the benefits that are going to flow and why your specific offering  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:39):**  is going to be better or to the point why your product is only possible.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:45):**  These benefits are actually only available when you're prepared to sort of participate  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:50):**  in a new kind of economy or this new kind of collective or whatever it might be.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:16:55):**  So I think this is where we get into the specific advice to kind of founders or solution providers,  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:01):**  like do the hard work.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:03):**  And in classic lumpers style, I'm going to lump this together with some of our conversations  
**[0:17:08-0:17:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:08):**  around insurance, which is we talk about the idea that disruption and dis- ideation only  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:16):**  becomes possible when you think about a digitally native way that this data kind of flows and  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:22):**  specific to insurance in those conversations.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:24):**  But I think that is a good example of this kind of category creation.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:27):**  A lot of people have written about that embedded or default insurance.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:32):**  And I think that's a very good example of category creation, that it's only possible  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:37):**  once a series of kind of technological things are possible and like, why would I not want  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:43):**  that?  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:44):**  And so I think that kind of value discovery category creation is what is the kind of thoughts  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:49):**  that I get in reading Dan's input.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:52):**  Yeah, Nigel from the Queensland Cotton Corporation actually also built on this with his comments  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:17:58):**  around other possible uses and what we get as we move more into collaborations between  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:03):**  organizations.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:04):**  I thought the point mentioned regarding collaboration between organizations to end up with a virtual  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:11):**  platform that covered across supply chain needs was very interesting.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:17):**  Very much of a mindset that we need to get outside our restrictive proprietary applications  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:23):**  and approaches to unlock greater potential than organizations acting individually can  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:29):**  achieve.

**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:34):**  I'm wondering, Matthew, are there examples that you're seeing today of this starting  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:38):**  to play out, either a strong value proposition around a more kind of connected supply chain  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:44):**  or like organizations working together in a ecosystem with shared data where they're  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:49):**  able to create more benefits for the growers?  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:52):**  Yeah, I mean, that is a challenge.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:18:54):**  My thoughts here in Nigel's comments were how this conversation commonly plays out is  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:00):**  where do you find the balance between industry good and is the industry good the catalyst  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:05):**  for that sort of cura- or cooperative sort of structure?  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:10):**  And we've done work in this area in the past, say in the wine industry, where there are  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:15):**  benefits that will flow to a supply chain.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:18):**  So in the example of a winemaker, it's very much in their interest to have detailed information  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:24):**  about yield and quality from the large number of contract growers, because the problem they  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:30):**  end up with is under capacity or over capacity production.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:34):**  And that's either means fruit gets wasted, or it means that they have containers and  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:39):**  vessels that are underutilized and kind of ruins their economics.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:43):**  The question then becomes, do they do that privately?  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:46):**  Do they try and build a platform or catalyze a couple of vendors together to say, hey,  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:52):**  we need a yield estimation thing and weed management kind of advice thing, and we want  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:19:57):**  to extend that as part of our contract to growers?  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:00):**  Or does the industry come in, and I think this is probably the angle that Nigel's coming  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:04):**  from, does the kind of industry come in and say there's benefits?  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:08):**  So Integrity Systems Company with the Australian Red Meat Industry would be a kind of example  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:13):**  of that where because of the need for biosecurity was so high of such significant economic value,  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:20):**  it made sense for the industry to step in and say, we are going to manage all of this  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:25):**  biosecurity information relating to individual animal identity and properties.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:29):**  I think our view there is it's still nascent infrastructure.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:33):**  And whilst it's heavily used, there are still plenty of ways where ISC as an Australian  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:39):**  example, you could imagine a parallel universe where that was much bigger and much more significant  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:46):**  technical infrastructure than it is maybe as two ways of exploring that thought.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:50):**  Yeah, I think the interesting points to tease out there are like finding the use case where  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:55):**  it makes sense for industry to step in because the incentives for any individual player aren't  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:20:59):**  sufficient to create that collaboration or build that kind of cross system either data  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:04):**  sharing or platform or whatever it ends up being.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:06):**  The second is as the entity that wants to intervene in that system, do you build, do  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:10):**  you buy or what are the other options that you could choose to use to get something to  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:15):**  exist?  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:16):**  And we've seen a lot of people choosing to try to build things and our experience was  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:20):**  probably industry bodies who are like not often digitally native and not great at building  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:26):**  software or even commissioning software to get built often by consultants is where this  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:29):**  leads to a lot of challenge because existing vendors are already playing in the system.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:34):**  There's already people collecting yield data.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:35):**  There's already people monitoring quality.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:37):**  There's already people doing this.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:38):**  And so instead a role that industry can uniquely play is finding ways to align incentives where  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:44):**  they don't otherwise exist for those vendors to collaborate.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:47):**  So whether that's funding a project that kind of connects the last mile of the pipes or  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:52):**  creating a network of growers who are putting up their hand to say, we will become customers  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:21:58):**  of this and maybe subsidizing the initial implementation or initial data set that can  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:02):**  catalyze that.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:03):**  I think that's where we get into interesting examples of interventions in the system that  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:08):**  enable stuff to exist that otherwise that otherwise wouldn't have because of the incentives  
**[0:22:13-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:13):**  that exist without it.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:15):**  And in other commentary we had the socials people did make observations about things  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:20):**  like the Ausfarm data exchange, which is an Australian initiative, private industry led  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:26):**  effort around creating a significant amount of digital infrastructure to support much  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:30):**  higher levels of sharing of farm data and the kind of governance and transparency that  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:35):**  you might want to be there.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:37):**  So there are plenty other examples, but I think perhaps the reasons for lack of adoption  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:42):**  sometimes those sorts of things is they're always built with a particular commercial  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:47):**  outcome in mind or if they're not, they get that the risk is that they end up being technical  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:52):**  infrastructure without a economic driver.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:22:56):**  Pip Grant also offered a view of an alternative future, one that she describes as the Spotify  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:00):**  model for farm data.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:02):**  Imagine if a farmer could look through their data sharing preferences on their farm management  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:06):**  software and select the data points that they're comfortable in sharing.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:10):**  And then at some point they get a notification saying that someone's used their data and  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:15):**  they've been paid a small dividend, say $10 in return.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:19):**  Or instead they could get a notification saying your data has just been used in a project  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:24):**  that has made your seasonal forecast 20% more accurate or your data has just been used to  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:29):**  respond to a biosecurity threat in your area.

**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:37):**  whether it's better decision making, reducing risks, taking advantage of new opportunities.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:42):**  The real value of sharing farm data could and will be significant and seen in a farm's  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:48):**  bottom line.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:49):**  Pip offered a follow up on these comments as well with some ideas of companies that  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:52):**  are addressing farm data concerns in interesting ways.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:23:55):**  While analyzing specific companies is a bit beyond the scope of this episode, Matthew  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:00):**  took a look at the list.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:01):**  It seems like the companies that Pip has referenced fall roughly into two camps where there's  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:07):**  one, which is a lot more about how data is actually sourced and where like the physical  
**[0:24:14-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:14):**  means of acquisition as opposed to infrastructure that much more recognizes that there's heterogeneous  
**[0:24:23-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:23):**  sources out there and that the real work actually is in cleansing and standardizing and integrating  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:30):**  and making it useful rather than solving the collection problem.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:35):**  Yeah, that's definitely been one of my, I guess one of our evolving observations about  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:39):**  the kinds of companies we look at as investors.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:42):**  Like do we think that it will be venture scale to back companies that are doing data collection  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:24:46):**  and doing it in unique ways if they've got ways to modify the light, to be able to have

**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:23):**  of those categories or which of those categories are increasingly exciting?  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:27):**  Well my mind went the other way in terms of, I think we're the ones that have challenges  
**[0:25:32-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:32):**  certainly are, yeah, maybe the way to think about it is do your economics benefit from  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:41):**  the inexorable cycle of technological improvement?  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:44):**  And I think that's always been the challenge with anything that's got a presence in the  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:48):**  field that with hardware you're making concrete choices, picking the best of what's available  
**[0:25:55-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:25:55):**  at that time, but once it's in the field it's hard not for it to be a sunk cost in a lot  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:04):**  of ways.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:05):**  It's specific about the way it measures, about the way it communicates, about the capacity  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:10):**  of its batteries and all those sorts of things.

**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:19):**  total ownership.

**[0:26:25-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:25):**  do this and 10 meters and that kind of thing, for sure that's true today, but dollars to  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:33):**  donuts that it's 10x better than that in less than 10 years.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:39):**  And so if that is true and we're talking about business models more than specific technology  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:45):**  innovation, then I think the ones that are where that cycle is a tailwind rather than  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:51):**  a headwind are the ones that I'm more excited about.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:54):**  And do you think that there's a venture scale opportunity for, again not that venture scale  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:26:58):**  is the only good kind of opportunity, but for some of the kind of connective tissue  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:03):**  or infrastructure type plays that Pip is talking about here?  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:07):**  She gives the example of a Spotify for farm data.

**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:12):**  Well, I mean, yes, we have imagined in fact that we have made investments based on the  
**[0:27:17-0:27:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:17):**  idea that a value chain is increasingly a digital artifact or a digital asset and that  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:26):**  you would want to imagine a value chain that is programmable.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:30):**  So I think that's a pretty appealing idea when we talk to people deeply involved in  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:37):**  these parts of the value chain, like there's so much knowledge that is built up with individuals.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:44):**  And that's why sometimes certainly why the case that particular midstream participants  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:50):**  do what they do really well.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:52):**  But that idea of a higher level of agility, we see this in kind of general business or  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:27:57):**  say e-commerce would be a good example of where the sort of low code ability to put  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:28:04):**  really sophisticated campaigns together and to get the user kind of all the way to actually  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:28:09):**  paying for their basket of goods.

**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:28:16):**  on top of infrastructure that understands the asset class a lot better, that understands

**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:29:07):**  to lack of interoperability, the lack of interoperability has been primarily driven by two reasons.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:29:14):**  Number one, zero-sum game mentality.

**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:29:34):**  easy to share data with between two systems.

**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:29:42):**  companies can provide enough value, then the issues with privacy will go down.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:29:48):**  Interoperability is an elusive goal with a murky definition and creates resource prioritization  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:29:54):**  and allocation challenges.

**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:11):**  What do you think of the two reasons that he gives?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:13):**  Yeah, like the kind of zero-sum thread to pull on and to some extent like that, probably  
**[0:30:21-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:21):**  there is that same principle with the kind of good faith insurance example, like to have  
**[0:30:28-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:28):**  that zero-sum mentality ignores the idea that in actual fact, we can only create these new

**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:44):**  Those are unfounded fears from a vendor point of view, but I think Rishi's point there is  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:50):**  if that's what you're worried about, you don't have a proper value proposition, which I think  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:55):**  is something that we're super comfortable with as well.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:30:57):**  And probably also goes to Dan's point, which is if you're genuinely in the category of  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:02):**  creation business here, then you should be confident about being open and being part  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:08):**  of an open system because you've actually identified where the value is and you're confident  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:12):**  in delivering it.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:13):**  Yeah, it got me thinking a little bit, not so much around interoperability, but around  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:16):**  what companies in the architect space have been really confident and bullish in their  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:21):**  marketing around like we do this and just owning what they do.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:26):**  And actually farmer's business network came to mind and we had Charles on the podcast  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:30):**  recently, but just that they were unapologetically a farmer first in some ways that maybe was

**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:47):**  our founders in our portfolio to have that kind of bold positioning.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:52):**  The presentation from swarm farm the other day, they've gone from, there's been a series  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:31:56):**  of revolutions in the industry and now there'll be this other one, which is like a yes.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:00):**  And in some ways marketing is better if it's like you're wrong, this is broken.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:03):**  We're doing it differently.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:05):**  And so the positioning they've been playing with a little more recently is we've been  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:08):**  promised this precision agro revolution and it just hasn't been delivered.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:13):**  Like we're not getting the value from this because all of this talk around this data  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:18):**  that we can collect in the mountains of it is just not working for farmers.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:22):**  And so this whole narrative is broken.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:23):**  Instead, what we need is actual equipment and tools that use the data to do useful things  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:29):**  for farmers.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:30):**  And so starting to get at a bit more of a positioning around like the data for data  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:34):**  sake is not useful.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:36):**  It needs to have a value proposition for the grower on the ground to actually do stuff.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:40):**  Yeah, I think that is a good example.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:41):**  I was having a conversation with a bunch of pretty active producers yesterday and I think  
**[0:32:45-0:32:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:45):**  that exact example came up is once you experienced what it's like to have fully autonomous selective  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:52):**  fallow weed management, like you're never going to go back to whatever it is you used  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:32:57):**  to do before that because it just makes so much sense.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:00):**  The sort of combination of those factors now, absolutely you can't do that without a high  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:05):**  degree of data sharing and ideally that would be supported by a platform.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:11):**  Autonomy is only workable and it's only good because large amounts of data sharing are  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:16):**  happening and there's significant amounts of infrastructure.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:19):**  So I think those are good examples of in the end, the application wins, right?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:24):**  Like where there's compelling economics is where you should focus.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:27):**  And if you're going around in a loop, having trouble explaining to farmers why they should  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:33):**  share their data, I don't think that's the actual problem.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:36):**  I think the actual problem is that you haven't discovered an economically meaningful solution  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:41):**  or your solution is not to an economically meaningful problem.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/8/3/farm-data-fears-agtech-audience-response#t=0:33:45):**  With that, I think we will call this another experimental episode of AgTech So What.

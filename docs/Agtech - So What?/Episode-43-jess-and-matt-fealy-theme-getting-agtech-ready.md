### Agtech - So What?  (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 22:30:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:00:11):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:00:16):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:00:21):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:00:26):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:30-0:00:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:00:30):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Today's episode is the third in our series  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:00:47):**  on getting ag tech ready. This theme is produced in partnership with Decipher, a precision  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:00:53):**  agriculture solution that helps growers and agronomists make data-driven decisions. Today,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:00:58):**  we're trying something a bit new on the podcast in terms of the episode format. We hope you  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:03):**  like it, and I'm sure you'll let us know if you don't. Today's guests are Jess and Matt  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:09):**  Feeley, a family farming team that not too long ago were latte-sipping corporate executives.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:15):**  But Jess and Matt have farming in their blood, and they've returned to farming after years  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:19):**  working in the corporate world. Jess says that, what did you call it? A midlife crisis.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:24):**  I call it the farmer mutant gene. So we talk about the farmer mutant gene that kicks in,  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:31):**  you know, farming's in your blood, it's in your blood, and it kicks in somewhere around  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:35):**  your mid-30s and draws you back to the farm. So yeah, we left a big smoke out, you know,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:40):**  big high paying jobs and kids in schools and everything and decided to take off around  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:44):**  Australia in a camper trailer on our very long way home, back to far north Queensland  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:49):**  to try our hand at agriculture. For many people, getting ready for something new means having  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:01:56):**  a plan, being prepared, and knowing what to expect. And in farming, it often means drawing  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:01):**  on years of experience and hard-earned intuition. But for Jess and Matt, being new to farming  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:07):**  and not knowing was actually a benefit. When we first got here, you know, we're brand new  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:12):**  to the farming gig. Nobody knows about the farm, nobody knows about us. It was a real  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:16):**  shock to us that we would just put our produce in a truck and send it off to the markets  
**[0:02:21-0:02:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:21):**  and hope we got paid. For me, watching all my hard work, my blood, true blood, sweat  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:29):**  and tears just being put in the back of a truck, sent away and not knowing what was  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:33):**  going to happen to it, how much money I was going to get for it, etc, etc, was really  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:38):**  foreign and alien for me. It was a bit of a pivotal moment in our first season, we did  
**[0:02:43-0:02:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:43):**  quite a bit of contract packing for external growers. And there was quite a lot of reject  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:50):**  mangoes that didn't meet the supermarket spec. We just took a photo of what we then dubbed  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:02:57):**  mango mountain, which is just this big pile of mangoes out the back of the farm. You know,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:02):**  I guess probably being city consumers at that point, we didn't realise that that was just  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:06):**  what happens. So there was this moment we looked at that mango mountain and decided,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:11):**  no, look, there's got to be a better way. Bringing new perspectives to farming can be  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:15):**  an advantage. For Jess and Matt, it meant that they were looking at everything with  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:19):**  fresh eyes, and they weren't attached to a business as usual approach. So after our first  
**[0:03:24-0:03:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:24):**  season, we really sat down and went, okay, we have to build some demand around our product.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:31):**  But Jess and Matt, like many farmers were selling into wholesale markets, where building  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:36):**  demand is not easy. As Jess said earlier, when they started out, no one knew about the  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:41):**  farm. Their answer was to build a following on social media by focusing on what their  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:46):**  customers wanted. And I think we were uniquely positioned to do that because we hadn't been  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:52):**  the cafe latte sipping consumer in the city. So we kind of knew what they wanted to see.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:03:59):**  Having come from big corporate jobs in the city, you might think that they had a plan  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:03):**  and a strategy. But that wasn't the case.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:06):**  I didn't write a communications plan. I didn't, you know, there was nothing formal in place.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:11):**  It was more, let's just have a, let's just have a go at this. Like, let's just see what  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:15):**  happens. You know, I think that's the value of a family farm and Matt having an iPhone  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:19):**  in his pocket that he could take a snap in the shed or take a snap out in the paddock  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:24):**  and post that. And it was, there was a real direct connection there that people could  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:29):**  relate to. And it was very organic and very genuine. Well, this morning we put a post  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:34):**  out this morning about breakfast. We just cut up a couple of avocados, put it on a piece  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:37):**  of toast and you know, it's just us. Was it a bit uncomfortable at all? I'm imagining  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:43):**  like Jess, you being like, okay, we're going to do this social media thing and have a go.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:47):**  And you're like, right, Matt, take a photo of this thing in the paddock today. Like,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:51):**  is that a bit how it went? And Matt, were you like, no, I don't like, that's a bit weird.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:54):**  I don't want to do it. Like, was there any resistance or it was obvious that you would  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:04:57):**  just have a go? It certainly wasn't weird. I mean, I most definitely get the whip pulled  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:02):**  out on me every now and then because you know, I'm a bit busy, Sarah. I don't have time for  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:07):**  taking photos of stuff. But for me, I'd done a little bit of international business studies  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:11):**  at university and there was one particular thing that really resonated with me. His name  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:16):**  escapes me at the moment, but it was a Japanese man who basically saved Toyota. Now the man  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:22):**  he's referring to is Taichi Ono, an engineer at Toyota who revolutionized supply chain  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:27):**  logistics in manufacturing. Traditionally, you would build a car and then push it out  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:32):**  into the marketplace and hope that someone buys it. What Taichi Ono did was to flip that  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:38):**  and build a car when the demand was there. This is known as pull production. And the  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:43):**  same principle also applies to marketing of a product in agriculture. It's much better  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:48):**  to pull your audience to your product rather than push it onto them. And this is what Jess  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:53):**  and Matt saw as an opportunity.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:05:56):**  The goal was for the consumer who was following us on Instagram to go into the shop and say,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:02):**  hey, do you have blue sky produce avocados? And that shop owner goes, who the bloody hell  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:07):**  is blue sky produce? But the shop owner goes into the markets and says to his agent, hey,  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:12):**  do you have blue sky produce avocados? And that marketing agent goes, well, who the bloody  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:16):**  hell is blue sky produce? So they start Googling who's blue sky produce. And then my phone  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:20):**  rings and say, hey, can I have some of your blue sky produce avocados? So we flipped it  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:25):**  around from us pushing our produce through the market to our consumer, our followers  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:29):**  pulling it through the market. And that, that I think is what we did differently to many  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:35):**  others, particularly in the beginning.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:37):**  Now of course, it's much harder than just hopping online and setting up an Instagram  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:41):**  account. It does take time to create content and build a following. Fortunately for Jess,  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:46):**  it could fit her schedule as she had just had a baby. And social media was something  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:50):**  she was passionate about. That would be a meaningful contribution to the farm business.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:06:55):**  The key to it is just being authentic and genuine and being consistent, but being realistic  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:05):**  about the fact that it does take time. And, you know, we do try to do a post a day, but  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:10):**  there will be days where we don't post and people kind of get that. It's just really  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:15):**  kind of share our story.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:19):**  So what is their story? A big part of it is that out of the box thinking. And that has  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:23):**  also led them to changes in their production system.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:27):**  Not having the preconceived ideas of how it just should be done. When we started making  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:31):**  new blocks and planting new trees, etc, I just looked for, okay, how's the best way  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:36):**  this should be done without any of that latency, without any of that legacy kind of knowledge  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:41):**  and just go, okay, well, clean slate, green, greenfield site. This is how it should be  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:45):**  done if you were to do it in 2015 rather than just doing it the way all the other blocks  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:51):**  were done and they were planted in the eighties. So implementing things like drip irrigation  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:55):**  for me was just, well, I did the research, I did the reading, I looked at the figures,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:07:58):**  I did the sums and there's no way it wouldn't work. And probably being a little bit naive  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:04):**  too, I would just start conversations with people and just say, hey, you know, how do  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:07):**  you do this? How do you do this really, really well? And I sort of found a grower nearby  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:14):**  that was implementing a lot of the things that I wanted to implement. So I just picked  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:19):**  up the phone and, you know, thankfully he was a very open and sharing young fellow,  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:25):**  same sort of age as us. Can we still call ourselves young? No. Okay. Maybe cut that  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:30):**  one there, Sarah, because we're not that young. I think on a podcast you can, right? No one  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:35):**  does. Well, nobody can see all our wrinkles. So yeah, let's go with young. So look, he  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:40):**  was really great, Hank Van Niekerk, and he sort of really just opened his books for me  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:45):**  and just said, hey, look, this is how it works. This is, here's some of the pros, here's some  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:48):**  of the cons and yeah, it went from there. For Jess and Matt, talking to their neighbors  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:53):**  and finding a trusted mentor was a great way to get some practical insights. But Matt has  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:08:57):**  also done his own research, which led him to successfully apply for a Nuffield Scholarship,  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:02):**  a program that took Matt around the world to learn from agricultural leaders in other  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:06):**  countries, including the US and the Middle East. And he's positive about the future of  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:11):**  ag tech. But when it comes to being ag tech ready, there are still some hurdles and some  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:15):**  lessons to be learned from other countries. A lot of it comes from a need. And I often  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:21):**  say to people, look, change doesn't happen until it's, till it's needed. And say, for  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:26):**  example, with the Israelis, you know, they, they have fought wars and lost thousands and  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:31):**  thousands of young men and women to fight for water. They just cannot continue to use  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:38):**  200 liters an hour sprinklers under their trees. So they, by this, through necessity,  
**[0:09:44-0:09:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:44):**  had to invent the world's most water efficient irrigation systems. And because I've got such  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:51):**  small pockets of very good arable land in Israel, they also then had to become very  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:09:58):**  efficient at their land use. So high density plantings in Israel are just a common thing.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:10:04):**  And all the years of research into root stocks and plant growth regulators and  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:10:09):**  trellising methods, this is just second nature to them, because they don't have a lot of really good  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:10:14):**  land. For us in Australia, land's cheap, there's plenty of it, you know, waters, particularly here  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:10:19):**  in the tropics just comes every year in the wet season. So we become a little complacent in  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:10:24):**  Australia around those things, whereas other countries had a real need to become very,  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:10:29):**  very efficient. One challenge that Matt has seen is that until farmers have a real or perceived  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:10:34):**  need to innovate, there can be a reluctance to break out of their comfort zone and try new  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:10:39):**  things. And that is especially true when it comes to digital products. Agriculture and farmers don't  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:10:46):**  open the gate or open the door to technologists as openly as they would perhaps say, you know,  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:10:53):**  fertiliser consultant. What's behind that hesitation? Trust. Matt boils this down to two  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:00):**  things. First, the fear of the unknown. And second, too many technologies that have been over promised  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:06):**  but under delivered in the past. But things are changing. Matt's key message for growers that  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:11):**  want to get agtech ready is to keep it simple. So I think for growers, they need to be a little  
**[0:11:17-0:11:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:17):**  more open minded, lean in a little bit and adopt low hanging fruit agtech solutions, rather than  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:25):**  thinking that tomorrow they have to implement this new wireless technology with sensors all over the  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:31):**  farm with this platform that's going to start driving automated tractors and start having  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:36):**  robots picking fruit, you know, just some automated irrigation systems and some farm  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:40):**  management platforms that have really been fairly well proven over the years just start implementing  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:47):**  those first. The reason Matt says to keep it simple is that before ag can take on big changes,  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:53):**  individual farmers and industry groups need to tackle some fundamental challenges. The biggest  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:11:59):**  problem approaching high value intensity, intensified horticulture is labour and the supply  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:12:05):**  of labour. So a lot of people think, oh, robotic harvesters, great, let's get those in the paddocks as soon as possible.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:12:11):**  And as I said before, I think the technology is actually there. But there's a whole lot of things  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:12:15):**  that have to change before any robotic harvest is going to go out and pick the trees. And I think  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:12:20):**  that the changes that have to happen to facilitate that technology are actually sound business choices  
**[0:12:27-0:12:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:12:27):**  today to address labour concerns. And Matt says that once farmers address these business fundamentals  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:12:35):**  around labour, bringing new technology on board will be a natural progression. And he has seen this  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:12:40):**  firsthand in Israel. As it turns out, they did it all to try to reduce labour and increase  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:12:44):**  productivity for sound business choices, but it's actually put them in the most robot ready position  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:12:51):**  in the world. But they didn't do it for robots. They did it for sound business sense, high density,  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:12:58):**  low water, easier for humans to pick, turns out to be really, really easy for robots.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:03):**  Now that Matt has finished his nut field, he's sharing his experiences, as well as debunking  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:08):**  some myths. First question anybody ever asked me after finding out about my nut field is,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:12):**  do you have a robot on your farm? Where's the robots? Can I buy one? No, you can't, because your  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:17):**  trees are planted on 12 metre by 10 metre centres and there's no robot in the world that's  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:22):**  going to be able to pick that. You have to go to high density, two dimensional tree structures,  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:27):**  which is really easy for humans to pick. And then it'll be actually ready for robots as well. And  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:33):**  there are plenty of examples where other sectors of horticulture have gone on this journey,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:37):**  and it has paid off financially. You just have to look at the apple and pear industry. And 40 years  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:42):**  ago, they are where we are today with most tropical tree crops. And just look at what they did now.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:48):**  I mean, they were looking at two, three, maybe four tonnes to the hectare. Now they're at 40,  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:52):**  50, 60 tonnes to the hectare as an average. There's people achieving 120 tonnes of hectare in apples.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:13:58):**  Instead of having to go out and buy more land, which is getting more and more expensive every  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:04):**  day, and buy more water, more importantly, which is getting more and more expensive,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:08):**  start making the land that you've got work harder, work better, work more productively.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:12):**  So I say to people, well, where do you want to be in 40 years time? Do you still want to be getting  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:16):**  four tonnes to the hectare like apples were 40 years ago? Or do you want to be getting 120 tonnes  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:21):**  to the hectare? And if the financial incentive doesn't move farmers into action, Matt suggests  
**[0:14:26-0:14:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:26):**  another approach. Imagine your farm tomorrow in Australia without the Backpacker Working Holiday  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:34):**  Scheme. Imagine it tomorrow without the Seasonal Workplace Scheme. These are two government schemes  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:38):**  that basically provide our workforce. This is real, and it's a government decision that could  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:44):**  just be changed tomorrow, completely outside of your control, that will have massive effect on  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:51):**  your business. So if we're leaving it up to government to make these massive decisions that  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:14:55):**  are going to affect our farm, control what you can control. When I speak to industry,  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:00):**  like Hort Innovation and these people, I say, we need to pour money into rootstock trials,  
**[0:15:06-0:15:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:06):**  plant growth regulators, trellis trials, pruning techniques. That's what I tell industry, but  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:13):**  growers, I say, you know what, industry is not doing it yet. So get out there and do it yourself.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:18):**  Start a trial, work it out, see what works for you. When we think about being agtech ready,  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:23):**  Jess and Matt take a big picture view. It's not just about individual farmers, but also about how  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:29):**  regional communities can benefit. There's a real opportunity with agtech and rural communities,  
**[0:15:35-0:15:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:35):**  I think, because naturally the technology required is going to be developed in regional areas. Farms  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:45):**  need the technology, so our towns are going to have to provide the supporting services.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:51):**  In the gold rush here is, you know, a lot of people made a lot of money digging up gold,  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:55):**  but I tell you what, there's a lot of people making money selling shovels and picks as well.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:15:59):**  So it's not just about the gold rush. It's not just about the agtech. There's going to be gold  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:04):**  in the hills for the industry that will be born out of this. And what we get really passionate  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:10):**  about is the fact that it will be a rural based industry. There is opportunities for kids, bright  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:17):**  kids to stay in agriculture, stay in rural communities, earn good money. And in this new  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:22):**  emerging industry, something that both of us agree on and are really passionate about.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:26):**  Jess and Matt have become advocates in this space through their involvement with the Future Agro  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:30):**  Challenge Australia, a competition where agtech startups pitch to a panel and the winner goes on  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:35):**  to represent Australia at a global event. The passion that I have for that event is really about  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:41):**  giving people in a rural community, for us it's here on the Tablelands, the opportunity to see  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:47):**  what's happening around Australia in the agtech space. So bringing kind of some of the leaders  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:53):**  up here to the Tablelands to pitch and demonstrate what they've been working on in agtech  
**[0:16:58-0:17:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:16:58):**  and also have an event like that happen in a rural community. Often there's a little bit of disconnect  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:17:05):**  between ag and tech and I think sometimes people forget that the ag and agtech comes first.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:17:12):**  Thank you guys so much. I love hearing how positive an impact you've had. Like I love hearing  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:17:16):**  about you guys speaking at different things, starting events, starting new businesses, like the  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=382797#t=0:17:20):**  kind of gift keeps on giving and I think that's so important and just commend you guys for

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 20:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agfentik Group.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:07):**  You've probably heard of these seemingly magical inputs that farmers are told they can put  
**[0:00:11-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:11):**  on their seeds or crops, and then suddenly the plant is heat resistant or no longer waterlogged.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:17):**  Often these are biologicals, a different type of input.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:21):**  And let's be honest, right now, many in the industry would call them snake oil.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:26):**  People say it's a trade secret, we can't tell you, but we increase pepper production by 17%  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:31):**  and we lower your nitrogen bill by 23%.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:34):**  That doesn't cut it if you want to scale this business.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:39):**  That's Jarrett Chambers.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:40):**  He's the president of ATP Nutrition, and he's all about plant nutrition, including biologicals  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:45):**  and biostimulants.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:46):**  For Jarrett and his company, the science is critical for credibility in the market.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:52):**  In this episode, we dig into the so what of biologicals, not just biostimulants, but also  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:00:56):**  products like biopesticides and biofertilizers to understand why they've historically had  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:02):**  such a poor rep and a poor track record of adoption.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:05):**  Shane Thomas, agronomist and author of Upstream Ag Insights, also joins us to look at the  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:10):**  drivers behind biologicals and what characteristics, business models, and incentives can help ensure  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:16):**  they fit into established farming systems.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:18):**  It's a complex topic, but that's never stopped us before.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:21):**  On the plus side, it turns out our two Canadian guests already know each other.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:25):**  I actually, I don't know if I've ever told you this, Jarrett, but I don't think you remember,  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:30):**  but I had my first ever agronomy conference that I was at.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:33):**  Jarrett was actually speaking and I was still in university.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:37):**  He presented and he was talking about something along the lines of zinc and root growth.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:41):**  At that point, when you're a summer student, nobody gives you the time of day because you're  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:44):**  not going to influence sales, you're not going to influence anything.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:47):**  I went up to Jarrett and asked him a question about zinc and if he could send me some of  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:50):**  the slides and he literally was like, yeah, I'll take your email.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:53):**  He sent me like the entire slide deck.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:56):**  That was fairly humbling.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:57):**  So I'm not even sure how to reply to that.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:58):**  So I'm not going to say.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:01:59):**  I don't know if I told you that before.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:00):**  You probably don't remember it was at a grow event.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:04):**  I do.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:05):**  Yeah, I do remember the grow events.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:06):**  Yes, I do remember the grow events.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:08):**  Yes.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:09):**  That's very nice, Shane.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:10):**  It never ceases to amaze me how ag is such a small world.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:13):**  But before we get too far into biologicals, I asked Jarrett, who has a master's of science  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:17):**  in soil fertility and microbiology and has spent the last two decades understanding nutrition  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:23):**  and plants, to explain what exactly we're talking about here.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:27):**  So we're going to break it down into a couple pieces.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:30):**  Okay, so really today, the biologicals, you have your biologicals that are for pest control.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:37):**  So the bio pesticide world.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:40):**  That is one main space and that is a space where most of the uptake is in either greenhouse  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:47):**  production, horticulture production or field grown high value crops, field grown production  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:52):**  with 7, 8, 9, 10 applications during the year where you're just protecting that crop.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:02:57):**  That is a pretty big space for the bio pesticide industry.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:02):**  Then there's also the bio stimulatory piece of the biologicals, which is the area which  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:09):**  falls under one of the four categories of bio stimulants.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:13):**  So when I look at bio stimulants, I look at four categories based off everything I've  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:17):**  read, you have the biological family as one of the four main categories under the bio  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:23):**  stimulant umbrella.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:24):**  And again, this is not just my opinion, this is me reading what everybody else is saying.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:29):**  Then of course, you have your seaweed extracts or plant extracts is one of the four families.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:34):**  Then you have your carbon based products, which is like your humics and your fulvic  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:38):**  acids as the third family.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:40):**  And then your fourth family are these amino acids or these protein hydrolysates.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:45):**  So those are the four main families.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:47):**  So when you look under bio stimulants or bio nutritionals under the biologicals, that falls  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:53):**  under that one of the four categories as a bio stimulant.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:03:56):**  Those are sort of the two main things, the bio pesticide and then the bio stimulant.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:01):**  I think, you know, within that bio stimulant side is where you would find also the inoculants  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:06):**  side of things where your nitrogen fixation around the legume side, but also the new products  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:11):**  that are working to actually do it in the corns and all those other different products  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:15):**  as well.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:16):**  And I think one thing that I get questions on a lot too is, you know, when we hear bio  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:20):**  stimulants and biologicals, we tend to think something that is actually living, but a bio  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:25):**  stimulant is actually based on what it does to the plant, it stimulates the plant and  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:30):**  Jared touched on the protein hydrolysates and the nitrogenous compounds, which aren't  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:36):**  necessarily living organisms, they are something else.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:40):**  And so those actually do deliver a stimulation to that plant that is naturally occurring  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:46):**  and makes it do something exude or release different extracts out of the plant roots  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:51):**  or something along those lines, call it to stimulate its systemic acquired response,  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:55):**  which is kind of like a plant immune system.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:04:57):**  And so you get something along those lines too, which I think is worth noting on top.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:03):**  That's super helpful explanation.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:04):**  What we then talk about often in the investment world, and I imagine farmers care about this  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:08):**  too is sort of the mechanism, like how does it work?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:12):**  So is that sort of separate to what it's stimulating or the different categories you outlined?  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:17):**  You could actually have a different mechanism as in it, it uses a fungus to do this, or  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:21):**  it targets this kind of plant response.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:22):**  Is that right?  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:23):**  That the kind of mechanism is separate from the application?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:26):**  Well, I'll take a first stab at it.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:28):**  So I think this is really the key piece for credibility for this space.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:35):**  Sometimes you would say in the past, I put on this biological and I increased yield.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:43):**  First of all, that's not the mechanism.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:05:44):**  That's not the mode of action.

**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:17:15):**  sort of blanket approach.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:17:18):**  It just kills everything.

**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:17:24):**  I think it gets to your point before on how much do growers really need to understand  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:17:27):**  because it isn't a silver bullet.

**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:17:50):**  When I think about it, you have this, you kind of have all this complexity around it,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:17:53):**  of course, which to your point, it's more about how do we have an easy button.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:17:57):**  But what makes this also challenging is it's invisible in a lot of ways.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:01):**  When you apply a herbicide, you can see the weed die.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:03):**  You can see it turn purple.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:05):**  You can see it turn yellow.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:06):**  When you apply a fungicide, you can see the disease decreasing or not moving up any faster.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:11):**  You can see dead insects with an insecticide.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:13):**  When it comes to biostimulants in a lot of ways, it is something that is entirely invisible.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:19):**  Sometimes you do get a nice greening response.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:21):**  Sometimes you do get less disease, those sorts of things.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:23):**  But a lot of the time, it's all internal.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:25):**  And so that can be a challenge to really get people to buy in and to see the benefit and  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:30):**  those sorts of things.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:31):**  And even when you see that benefit, there's still this function of the incentive for the  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:36):**  farmer.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:37):**  And right now, there's not necessarily incentive to apply less nitrogen and improve the nitrogen  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:43):**  use efficiency.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:44):**  There's not necessarily the incentive to have better soil health, all these sorts of things.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:48):**  So a farmer views it as, well, I could just put on more nitrogen instead of applying this  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:52):**  $10 an acre product, or I can just apply more phosphorus or something along those lines.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:18:57):**  And so you get this misalignment of incentives that is still a challenge for people to see.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:03):**  And until we get some of that figured out, I think that's one of the little hurdles,  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:07):**  I suppose, when it comes to getting adoption, moving the needle even more.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:12):**  I think Jared alluded to it.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:14):**  Biostimulants and biologicals are supposed to grow at a keg or of something like 13%  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:18):**  year over year, somewhere in there.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:20):**  But if we could really get more agronomy, I mean, that's pretty rapid.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:23):**  But when you look at farmers and agronomists that have apprehension, that could be even  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:26):**  higher, if we had a better understanding of the incentives, had a better understanding  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:31):**  of how they actually work.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:33):**  It goes to your point before around what farmers actually need to know and how much information  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:40):**  they can be provided with.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:41):**  But it's not just information, right?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:42):**  It's also the incentives and the practice change and the advice to actually get the  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:46):**  value out of these products.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:47):**  And where does that value sit?  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:48):**  Is it just a yield increase like they might be used to?  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:50):**  Or is it thinking about nutrition or what consumers want or tying it to some kind of  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:54):**  supply chain incentive?  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:55):**  I guess there's a whole other set of challenges that I want to talk about briefly, which is  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:19:59):**  like, does it require practice change?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:02):**  Like, how do you apply this?  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:04):**  Do I need to treat something differently?  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:05):**  Do I need to spray something differently?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:06):**  Do I need different equipment?  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:08):**  Do I need to store it differently?  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:09):**  Which is a range of challenges for kind of going to market with these products.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:13):**  So maybe, Jared, can you talk a little bit about the challenges with actually fitting  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:17):**  into the current system?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:18):**  Yeah, so first of all, you have to fit in, I mean, I've not sat down, I guess, in the  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:26):**  last year and a half, zoomed with many companies and I kind of joke with them because they  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:31):**  have this concept and they want to change the way a producer grows their crop.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:36):**  And so, I'm usually fairly blunt with them and kind of say, well, you're not going to  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:40):**  be successful.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:41):**  This has got nothing to do with your technology.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:43):**  This has got to do with you have to fit in with what they're doing.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:46):**  So you have to figure out how are you compatible with their planter or their air seeder and  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:52):**  the way you put on something through drip irrigation in California, you have to cut  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:20:58):**  your mind off when you start coming to broadacre agriculture that doesn't have drip irrigation.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:02):**  So you have to basically integrate in.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:05):**  So what a lot of people are trying to do is they're saying, well, I want to get on the  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:08):**  seed because it's fairly economical and we get a good response.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:12):**  Well, first of all, it is fairly economical and you do get a good response, but trying  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:17):**  to get on the seed, everybody wants to get on the seed and there's only so much space  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:21):**  on the seed.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:22):**  So that's a whole other question.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:23):**  So now you say, well, if I don't own a seed company or if I don't have a strategic partnership  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:27):**  with a seed company, how do I get on the seed?  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:30):**  That's really hard.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:31):**  So now you say, okay, well, now I got to get into the existing application as a soil application.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:38):**  So my product is, and I'm just making these as examples, my products are liquid fertilizers,  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:42):**  but 94% of the farmers use granular fertilizer.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:46):**  So am I going to ask them to switch to a liquid?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:48):**  Well, you got 6% of the market, you can go after the other 94% said no.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:53):**  So you're going to say, well, maybe I'll get them to spray my biostimulant onto their granular  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:57):**  fertilizer.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:21:58):**  Well, people don't have the equipment to do that.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:00):**  So again, you have a great technology you can't get on.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:04):**  So you got, and then of course you have to be compatible.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:05):**  If it's an in-season spray, your timing has to match a herbicide timing, your it has to  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:10):**  match a fungicide timing, or maybe some of these new plant growth regulators, they have  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:14):**  a different timing.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:15):**  So that's actually opening things up, but you have to integrate in.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:18):**  It has to go right in what they're doing.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:21):**  And in a lot of these farms, a lot of these big farms nowadays, a lot of people talk about  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:26):**  they're planting 7 to 10% of their entire farm in one day.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:32):**  7 to 10%.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:35):**  It doesn't matter if you're a 1500 acre farmer or in Shane's area, there's some 60 or 70,000

**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:46):**  So you have to fit into their system.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:48):**  It has to be flawless.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:50):**  And again, practicality, or some people refer to logistics.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:56):**  Logistics trumps the technology sometimes.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:22:59):**  So this is where sometimes it's a give and a take.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:02):**  Maybe you take something maybe not quite as perfect, but it fits in naturally.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:07):**  And I think people that are getting commercial understand that.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:11):**  We do still have a number, wow, I talked to a lot of companies that have a great product,  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:15):**  but the form of the product, the delivery of the product, the dustiness of their product,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:21):**  the lack of compatibility, it's their kiss to death.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:25):**  It's fascinating because this doesn't apply just to biologicals, right?  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:29):**  You can even go all the consumer side and say single use plastics or something like  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:32):**  that, right?  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:33):**  Getting humans to change their behavior and bring a bag to the grocery store and use bins  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:37):**  and fill them with jars.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:38):**  Like we're just not going to do it.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:39):**  So it's much easier to make a plastic bag that we can just throw away better, but how  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:43):**  environmentally friendly is that?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:45):**  And there's a million applications.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:46):**  So it gets actually back to human psychology, I would say as much as any kind of particular  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:50):**  technology.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:52):**  I'll throw one more comment in there.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:54):**  It's aligned with what you just alluded to, Sarah, and Jared talked about too, but this  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:23:58):**  is more on the bio pesticide side of things, but the need for other technology, not just  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:04):**  the equipment and the logistics side of things, but if we get into pheromone based bio pesticides,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:09):**  all of a sudden, you're not going to just go and apply this random pheromone clear across  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:14):**  to disrupt the mating cycles of insects.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:16):**  You need to understand where are the insects?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:18):**  What insects are there?  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:19):**  And I know there's a company Tenacious invested in that can help remotely identify those insects,  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:24):**  but that's a need for that type of technology and then the call it large scale buy-in of  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:29):**  numerous farms and groups clear across a large geography to be able to leverage the bio pheromone  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:35):**  because insects move.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:36):**  They're not just this, they don't stop at field borders.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:39):**  They don't really care whether there's a field border there or a road or not.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:42):**  They're going to move.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:43):**  And so you need some of these other technologies to help support the adoption of some of these  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:47):**  bio based products.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:49):**  Which I guess to me kind of leads to some of these business model challenges.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:53):**  And we've got new kinds of investors wanting to fund agriculture generally and biologicals  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:24:58):**  in particular, venture capital investors among them, which I see there's a couple of challenges.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:03):**  One, just understanding the science and how complex it can be.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:06):**  Two is maybe all those trials you were talking about before, Jared, to really understand  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:11):**  the mechanism like that's expensive and may or may not be well suited to kind of venture  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:15):**  capital timelines and funding, capex requirements, that kind of things.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:21):**  And then the third one is the business model of the adoption.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:24):**  Like is this something that just goes in a channel, gets crunched through margins over  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:28):**  time and ultimately, like how do you get to scale and actually make the kind of return  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:32):**  venture capital investors would be looking for?  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:36):**  Here's the thing that I'll try to capture in essence.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:39):**  For any of these companies to be a one product company, the probability of success is very  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:46):**  low.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:48):**  And there's a lot of reasons.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:49):**  And I'll start with a few and I'm pretty sure I got my whiteboard, I got all the list.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:53):**  The first one is the cost to do this science, the cost to have an accountant, a production  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:25:59):**  manager, a logistics person, a sales team, and so on and so on is very large, whether  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:04):**  you have one product or a portfolio.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:06):**  So your cost of that business is very large with one product.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:10):**  The other thing is you can think about the customer.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:14):**  The customers right now, one of their challenges at the ag retail level and the retail level  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:18):**  is everybody's inundating them with their single super product.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:23):**  And there's hundreds of companies walking through that door.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:26):**  And customers, retailers, distributors, and growers don't want to just have to focus so  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:34):**  much time on one product.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:35):**  They want something with portfolio.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:37):**  And what that ties into is the relevancy of every visit.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:41):**  My whole thing is that you got to be authentic, you got to be differentiated, and you got  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:46):**  to be relevant.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:47):**  So what you talk to the producer, the retailer in January is different than when you talk  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:51):**  to them in April, different than what you talk to them in June, different when we talk  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:54):**  to them in July and August.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:26:56):**  You have to have what is relevant, what helps them fill a gap at that window that you're  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:00):**  having that 30-minute call with them.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:03):**  So what happens is single product companies have a very difficult challenge.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:07):**  Yes, there's a product called Roundup.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:09):**  We may know about that.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:10):**  Kind of the biggest herbicide in the world.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:12):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:13):**  That's the exception.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:14):**  But let's think about the biologicals.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:15):**  That's where I'm in the biggest biologicals out there.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:17):**  And that's nitrogen-fixing organisms, right?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:21):**  Rhizobium, bradyrhizobium.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:24):**  And there's companies that have a portfolio around that and they do very well.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:28):**  But as we look at other companies that maybe have a bacillus or some type of pseudomonas,  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:35):**  for them to really get that into the market is hard.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:37):**  So they need to find a strategic partner to go to the market.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:40):**  And this is where consolidation, either at the company level or at the distributor level,  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:47):**  is going to be key for the financial success of this company.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:27:53):**  And I mean, heck, I've talked to distributors, retailers, for the last 30-something years.

**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:02):**  with that company for one product that it's proven but the farmers aren't running in to  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:08):**  order it yet.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:09):**  So there's a lot of demand creation, a lot of work, a lot of effort gone into it.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:12):**  And yes, they're saying there's lots of margin, but the revenue right now is very low.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:16):**  I want to ask Shane, one of the challenges in this space as well is what fits into the  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:22):**  system right now and what might be attractive to a retailer when he goes or an advisor to  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:26):**  go have those visits and have something every season to talk about that's relevant might  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:31):**  be really different than what a venture capital investor might sort of see as long-term successful.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:36):**  So there is this kind of near-term, adds value today challenge, but fits in the existing  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:40):**  system might require margin crunch, et cetera, versus kind of possible futures.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:45):**  How do you think about that?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:47):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:48):**  We've talked a little bit about that is the factor, the scalability of something and the  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:53):**  defensibility of something.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:28:56):**  And part of that is you have something that might fit into the retail or the farmers day-to-day  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:02):**  right now with a four or five products that might be very stable.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:05):**  They might be very efficacious.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:07):**  They might have a very tank mixable approach as well.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:10):**  And so really nice fit right now.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:12):**  But all of a sudden, when you start to factor in a different future or some of these other  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:16):**  trends that are coming, like carbon sequestration, all of a sudden, how does that tie into what  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:22):**  this product is going to do today?  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:23):**  It's not necessarily relevant, but might be more interesting for a venture capitalist  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:27):**  in the future, because all of a sudden now can you come up with a unique business model  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:31):**  that integrates into that carbon model or that carbon credit system that helps to support  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:36):**  that farmer to produce better quality grains or outputs, as well as gives them a new revenue  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:41):**  stream or an incremental revenue stream from the carbon slots.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:44):**  And I think one of the other aspects of this too is the call it defensibility that we've  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:49):**  talked about before.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:50):**  But when you have something that is 3% better, you know, Jarrett was talking about all these  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:54):**  different products.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:29:55):**  Well, one product might be 3% better than everything else out there, but it's just going  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:00):**  to turn into a terrible game to play.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:02):**  It gets commoditized, everything gets crunched from a margin perspective, but then it also  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:06):**  leads to weird, terrible games in the marketplace as well with tricking of trials and all these  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:11):**  different things.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:12):**  And so really what is probably going to be the most interesting to the venture capital  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:16):**  groups is something that is going to fit into a bigger platform play.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:21):**  And again, what that exactly looks like gets to be kind of what we alluded to earlier with  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:25):**  the pheromones and different technologies.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:28):**  What sort of technology is going to help with really understanding the carbon being sequestered,  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:33):**  the amount being sequestered to be able to verify that and which biological is actually  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:37):**  going to deliver that to the farmer and to that soil.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:40):**  And so this is where it starts to get a little more interesting in my opinion from that longer  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:44):**  term perspective.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:45):**  But you start to have to use your imagination a little bit more than the traditional linear  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:50):**  route to market that we would traditionally be talking about and considering today.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:55):**  Which is actually different than how an agronomist might see it, right?  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:30:58):**  If you're an agronomist today or a retailer thinking about procurement and partnerships,  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:02):**  you might not be, you may or may not be thinking about that longer term perspective, but the  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:06):**  kinds of things you'd be recommending or thinking about procuring and distributing would be  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:11):**  pretty different, I imagine.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:13):**  Is that true?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:14):**  Jay, you're nodding.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:16):**  You know, I think it is.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:17):**  I mean, we work with our innovative distributors and retailers and growers and they see it.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:21):**  They really see how things connect up.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:23):**  And Shane nailed it, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but the carbon piece,  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:28):**  you know, if you read the articles, it's a wild west.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:30):**  But at the end of the day, it actually, it is a really fascinating mechanism because  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:36):**  what it's really going to do is it's really going to help us get a better handle on where  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:42):**  we sit, where's our baseline at today?  
**[0:31:45-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:45):**  I mean, I think about broad acre agriculture, I think about 19% of the soils are soil sampled,  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:52):**  fields are sampled every year.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:54):**  60% of the fields are sampled once every three years.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:31:57):**  3% to 5% of the fields, sometimes 1% to 3% of the fields are tissue sampled.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:03):**  So we're trying to be scientists.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:05):**  We have great technology and we refuse to go to the doctor to see where we're at.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:11):**  I mean, how can you put on an investment, a significant investment of all these elements  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:17):**  if you don't have a soil test?  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:19):**  How can we put on an investment of managing a crop when we don't have a tissue test or  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:24):**  a blood analysis to say how we're doing here today?  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:28):**  So when I think about the carbon program, I think about you're measuring organic carbon,  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:33):**  which is organic matter.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:34):**  So in measuring that mechanism, the baseline, that field, you're probably going to be start  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:38):**  to measure other elements.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:39):**  So to me, the carbon platform is a fantastic platform to actually learn more about our  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:45):**  soil health, our soil system, and ultimately our plant system, which comes into this restoring  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:51):**  the balance.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:52):**  This becomes this philosophical challenge of, do you restore the balance in the soil  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:32:58):**  by creating a healthier plant that excretes metabolites into the root rhizosphere that  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:04):**  the biological population of the soil says, thank you, and I'm going to proliferate making  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:08):**  the soil more healthy, or is it the reverse?  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:13):**  My background is soil chemistry.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:15):**  The last 20 years has been plant nutrition.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:18):**  So I'm more on the plant nutrition side right now.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:20):**  But again, it is this complicated system.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:22):**  I think the carbon platform is totally cool.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:24):**  I think we're going to learn a ton about everything because of this.

**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:32):**  And if you don't do it, I don't want it to be if you don't do it, you get penalised.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:36):**  And that's my concern with some of these government programs.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:39):**  If you don't fill in your survey, we're going to charge you more money.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:42):**  If you fill it in, we'll get you back where you are.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:45):**  That platform never has ever gone over well.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:47):**  To me, there has to be an incentive.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:50):**  Just speaking to the agronomy side of the equation, Sarah, you alluded to, when I think  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:33:54):**  of what an agronomist's role is, it's to maximise profitability, taking into account sustainability,  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:01):**  optimising for sustainability and production.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:03):**  And so when you start to layer in other products or other revenue streams, you just need to  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:09):**  take that into the equation.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:11):**  And today, carbon is not necessarily in the equation.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:13):**  But all of a sudden, when you start to add a different revenue stream into that equation,  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:17):**  or you start to have the sustainability function of that weighted heavier, all of a sudden,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:22):**  that's just something that's going to need to be considered within the context of a recommendation,  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:27):**  within planning and within the conversations with farmers.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:30):**  And I think given that, we will see biologicals begin to work their way in a little bit more  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:37):**  within that sort of conversation.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:38):**  The other aspect, I guess, if we're talking about incentives and platforms, carbon's one  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:45):**  sort of efficacy in the field and things farmers already care about is another.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:49):**  The thing that is interesting about carbon is consumers are starting to care.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:53):**  And so you get these other big machines in the system moving in this direction.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:34:57):**  I guess another one that strikes me that could be possible is nutrition.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:00):**  If we start to understand more the relationship between what's happening at an agronomic level  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:05):**  and nutrition, that there's maybe some pull through from brands and consumers, is that  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:10):**  possible or another kind of platform that could drive adoption?  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:13):**  I think that's an interesting one.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:14):**  The answer is I would say is yes, we just have a little bit of a ways to go on that.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:19):**  And again, I'll come back to my Harvest Zinc initiative.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:21):**  We've done a lot of work, many people have done a lot of work to show how to make nutrient  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:26):**  dense food.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:29):**  And it's by intensively managing your crop using analytical tools to know where you're  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:34):**  at and knowing when to put on certain nutrients to increase the density in that harvested  
**[0:35:39-0:35:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:39):**  crop.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:40):**  Wouldn't it be cool to go to a store and be able to determine the nutrient density of  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:45):**  that tomato or of that bunch of grapes or of that banana and actually knowing what the  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:50):**  nutrient density is so that we're not consuming just biomass in our body, we're actually consuming  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:56):**  the elements that we need.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:35:58):**  And I think driving to nutrient density is, I guess, sadly for myself, Sarah, that's actually  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:05):**  already, I'm almost exhausted through that because I think maybe, and Shane was a part  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:10):**  of this when we first got going on this, I think maybe we were a little bit ahead of  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:13):**  our time or maybe we were a little too optimistic in that people would just jump on it.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:17):**  And I really think as we move from the mechanism of farming, whether it's be conventional farming  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:22):**  or organic farming or regenerative farming or all the different types of farming, ultimately  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:27):**  the consumer wants, I think is a good return to their body for every kilogram of food they  
**[0:36:32-0:36:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:32):**  consume.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:33):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:34):**  I would totally agree.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:35):**  And the potential for these kinds of solutions to deliver more of those benefits, more of  
**[0:36:42-0:36:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:42):**  the consumer benefits seems like a no brainer.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:44):**  And yet, as we've been talking about the complexity around how you actually do that, who pays  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:48):**  for it, how you get to scale, how you know that it works and how you avoid the kind of  
**[0:36:51-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:51):**  snake oil sales question is the real one.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:53):**  I know when I was first looking at this space, I started calling them sort of magical plant  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:36:58):**  whispering juices because that's how it felt.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:00):**  You know, you meet the kind of crazy scientist in the lab that's like, well, if you just  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:03):**  make this concoction and then it, you know, look at our trial results here.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:06):**  And we also did it in this country and look at it over on this plant and it's magical.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:10):**  But you get into how, how would you scale that?  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:12):**  How do you repeat it?  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:13):**  How is it shelf stable?  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:14):**  Like these are not easy questions to answer.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:15):**  I guess I want to end on when you zoom out and look forward, call it 10, 15 years.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:21):**  Do you think we're having really different conversations?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:24):**  Are these widely adopted?  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:25):**  There's consolidation in the industry.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:27):**  I'll start with you, Shane.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:28):**  Yeah, I think what we will see is that there will be increased adoption utilization of  
**[0:37:33-0:37:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:33):**  these bio stimulant based or bio based products.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:35):**  And I don't think it's necessarily going to be all standalone or this or that, or it's  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:40):**  going to be more of this and that.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:42):**  And so we will see more combo formulations where there's going to be a bio pesticide  
**[0:37:47-0:37:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:47):**  co formulated with a synthetic pesticide.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:50):**  And that's really a big opportunity because there's millions and millions of kilograms  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:54):**  of synthetic pesticides put down.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:37:57):**  But the biggest opportunity is not to just cold turkey, cut them out and use these bio  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:02):**  pesticides.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:03):**  It's to strategically integrate the bio based products where it makes sense to make sure  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:09):**  that they are augmenting that synthetic product.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:11):**  And I think there's opportunity in that.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:13):**  So I think that's something that we will see in the next 10 years.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:16):**  I think when it comes to being able to essentially start to code the DNA and be able to make  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:21):**  it genetically engineer a microbe to produce exactly or close to exactly what you want,  
**[0:38:26-0:38:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:26):**  which will really increase not only the stability, but the efficacy and the consistency of that  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:33):**  bio stimulant or that bio based product in the soil or in the plant or in combination  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:38):**  with a synthetic product.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:39):**  So I think that technology is really going to underpin a lot of what we see in the next  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:44):**  10, 15 years.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:45):**  So that's something I'm bullish on and excited for to help move things ahead in this space.

**[0:38:54-0:38:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:54):**  So much for the young people respecting their elders.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:38:57):**  I think, yes, I think Shane nailed it.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:00):**  It's about integration of these technologies to slowly evolve the space to the reduction  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:08):**  in some other inputs.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:10):**  One of the things I think that's also interesting that Shane alluded to was the industry, we're  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:15):**  not using biologicals to their fullest, like say we would in maybe the pharmaceutical industry  
**[0:39:21-0:39:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:21):**  or some of these other industries.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:22):**  Like if we think about it, MSG, you can make MSG through the fermentation using a certain  
**[0:39:27-0:39:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:27):**  organism.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:28):**  I mean, of course, we use fermentation to make cheese and milk and lactic acid and citric  
**[0:39:33-0:39:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:33):**  acid.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:34):**  So we start thinking about that and you start thinking about where do I see a biologicals  
**[0:39:39-0:39:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:39):**  fitting?  
**[0:39:40-0:39:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:40):**  I see biologicals fitting as a production plant sitting in some company's facility that  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:47):**  the organisms are your engine.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:50):**  Rather than having compressors and heat and pressure and extracting nitrogen from the  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:39:57):**  atmosphere or taking some type of compound and pulling it together, we're going to ask,  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:02):**  I think, we should be asking the organisms to make this end product, just like they do  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:07):**  in the pharmaceutical industry.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:09):**  Then we extract that compound and that compound, as Shane alluded to, may look very similar  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:16):**  to a synthetic chemical.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:19):**  But it's not made through chemical synthesis, it's made through biological synthesis.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:25):**  And if we can say that this organism, and I don't even want to say one, because I don't  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:31):**  know, by the way, you just have some organism, some bacillus species that makes a compound  
**[0:40:35-0:40:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:35):**  that looks very much like a compound for weed control or fungal control.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:42):**  I think that is where, if this can happen, it can move.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:46):**  And I think it can move because it's moved in almost every other industry we're in, whether  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:51):**  it's the food industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the clothing industry, we're using  
**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:56):**  organisms to develop compounds.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:40:59):**  So where we're at right now, we've got organisms we want to put on into the soil.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:03):**  Shane and I talk about this a lot, are the organisms even alive or dead when they go  
**[0:41:07-0:41:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:07):**  into the soil?  
**[0:41:09-0:41:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:09):**  People say, but they still work.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:10):**  Well, good.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:11):**  So why are they working?  
**[0:41:12-0:41:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:12):**  Is it the organism or is it the compound they produce?  
**[0:41:15-0:41:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:15):**  It's probably the compound they produce.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:17):**  Now if we take those 1000 compounds that they make and we start to slipstream it down, and  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:22):**  Shane was referring to it earlier about using great analytical chemistry to isolate this  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:26):**  one compound that now controls nematodes.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:30):**  And I'm just picking, I don't know why I said nematodes, it picks an nematode that looks  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:33):**  very similar to synthetic chemical.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:37):**  Is that not what we want as an entire society?  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:41):**  And we use organisms as a positive production plant.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:46):**  And then ultimately that's going to reduce our carbon emissions too.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/28/biologicals-snake-oil-or-science#t=0:41:52):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

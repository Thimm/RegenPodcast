### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 20:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentic.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:07):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nollet.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:09):**  This episode jumps back to our Regen Ag series, this time with a debate.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:14):**  The debate was held at a recent live AgTech meetup where we asked our panelists whether  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:19):**  Regen Ag is greenwashing or good business.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:23):**  It is such a clever word because what is the opposite of Regen?  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:27):**  I'm a degenerative farmer, I'm not regenerative.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:30):**  I turn around and say, 200 years on the same patch of dirt.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:32):**  I irrigate, I use for, I drive tractors and I'm making money and I think my landscape looks good.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:41):**  I just don't think we need to get tied up in the term too much.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:44):**  Okay, if we're doing something that is beneficial for the landscape, I think we can all agree  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:48):**  on that more plants, more diverse, more cover ticks a lot of boxes.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:55):**  Yep, there are two sides to this debate and that was just a taste of what's to come.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:00):**  Let me properly introduce you to our panelists.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:03):**  You just heard a bit from Richard Leask.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:05):**  He's a wine grower in the McLaren Vale area of South Australia, a region famous for its Shiraz.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:11):**  And he believes that Regen is worth investigating.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:15):**  Also on the pro-Regen side of the debate is Toby Grogan.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:19):**  Toby works as a natural capital specialist for a company called Impact Ag.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:24):**  And on the Regen Ag skeptic side is Will Bignell.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:28):**  You heard him at the start there too.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:29):**  Will describes himself as a conventional farmer, but I'm not sure if that's an accurate description.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:35):**  In addition to running a mixed farming operation in Tasmania, he produces boutique vegetables  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:40):**  and cheeses and owns a drone company.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:43):**  So let's hear from our very impressive panelists directly.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:47):**  Richard is the first of the three to take the stage.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:50):**  I'm a wine grower from McLaren Vale in South Australia, 2019 Nuffield Scholar, where I  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:57):**  spent 12 months of the year.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:59):**  Last year going around the world, looking at what is regenerative agriculture and where  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:03):**  does it sit in terms of vineyard, the vineyard industry.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:06):**  So it's a massive subject to try and sum up in five minutes.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:10):**  In terms of our brand and our business, we're on the journey.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:13):**  We've implemented most of the practices on one of our farms and we're using a number  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:19):**  of them across a few others, as well as consultancy business that we do.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:22):**  So we're in the testing phase, I would call it.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:25):**  We're seeing some interesting results, but there's still a lot we don't understand about  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:29):**  it and there's still a lot we don't know, but we're working our way through that.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:32):**  So I just want to quickly make a few points, obviously five minutes just to sum it up.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:36):**  Really what we're talking about here is a system change from what we've been doing traditionally.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:40):**  I'll have a very vineyard centric take on this, but just supplement if you're in the  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:45):**  farming industry, your business, and we're working with the same substrates.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:51):**  What is carbon and what does it do for us?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:53):**  We know it's great for soil structure.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:54):**  We know it's good for aeration, particularly good for increasing the available water and  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:59):**  soil, but none of that happens without the biology in the soil.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:02):**  So all of this stuff has to work in harmony.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:05):**  And how do we do that?  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:06):**  We need plenty of plant cover.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:07):**  We need plenty of diversity in the soil to do that.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:10):**  And we need to give that system a chance to do it regularly and without too much disturbance.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:15):**  We know that carbon is a cycle, it's used, the microbes use it, the plants use it.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:22):**  We're not necessarily talking about sequestration here.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:25):**  I'm talking about how to maximise the system to improve our soil organic matter, our soil  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:30):**  structure to give our plants that we're growing in resilience, given that the seasons we've  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:35):**  got are becoming a bit more challenging.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:37):**  That's the real quick upshot of it.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:39):**  The main driver of that is obviously the plant life that we use on it.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:43):**  So if we use a vineyard system, for example, we've got a permanent planting there that  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:47):**  we can utilise, but we've also got a considerable amount of land that perhaps we can use in  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:52):**  a slightly different manner.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:53):**  And the more we have above the ground, the more we're going to have below the ground,  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:56):**  and that's going to help drive the system.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:58):**  So it's a very simple concept in that respect, but complex in a lot of other ways.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:03):**  So we've gone from cultivation to seven herbicide passes a year to control what little organic  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:08):**  matter we've got in the middle of the row.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:10):**  So I don't think anyone can argue that that's a sustainable or even regenerative path moving  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:14):**  into the foreword.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:15):**  So we've got to have a plan B because this isn't something that's going to take us into  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:19):**  farming in the future.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:21):**  I think that sort of sets the context for where I'm looking and where we're trying to  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:25):**  get to in terms of the journey.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:27):**  Toby is also on the Regen Ag journey, not as a farmer, but as someone who works with  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:32):**  farmers and investors to improve the health of their land and raise their overall productivity.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:38):**  So I'm from Impact Ag.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:40):**  We're an asset manager based in Armvale, New South Wales, and we've got farms in Queensland,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:45):**  New South Wales and Western Australia.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:48):**  And all of those are being managed regeneratively and are on a journey to transition to a better  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:54):**  ecosystem.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:55):**  Some of those we've been managing for 10 plus years and others that we've just purchased.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:59):**  So before I start to show you some of our results, I probably need to define Regen Ag,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:05:05):**  which is sometimes a dangerous thing to do.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:05:07):**  But we see it as a regenerative ag, any farming system which aims to actively and profitably  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:05:13):**  improve the farm's natural capital.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:05:15):**  So soil biodiversity and the water cycle.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:05:17):**  So any management activity or management decision that leads to an improved ecosystem broadly

**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:06:56):**  Will, however, is not convinced that Regen Ag is good business.

**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:07:16):**  Seven generations of social history as well.

**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:07:48):**  We've got one of the first four permits to farm deer.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:07:50):**  We farm deer, killed on the farm.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:07:53):**  We milled flower.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:07:54):**  We've got Australia's oldest flower mill.

**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:09):**  running still 10,000 to 15,000 sheep on our properties as family businesses.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:15):**  And it's seven generations succession, which is quite hard to manage, to put it mildly.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:21):**  So my background is this big farming business, but I'm also a pretty curious character.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:26):**  So I ended up going to uni, did a bachelor of Ag science, came back for a year, which  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:31):**  was the 05, 06, 07 drought in Tassie.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:34):**  So we got hit really hard.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:36):**  Where we are is very much in microclimate and we get a bad hit.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:40):**  So it had the millennial drought of 2000, the, what was it?  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:43):**  05, 06, 07, 08, where we had cut off our water rights, which is like cutting off your head  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:48):**  to our business.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:49):**  And we had all this other diversification and we worked very hard at what we were doing,  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:56):**  but we come off this base of very standard conventional farming.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:59):**  I'm at the point where I came home in the drought, I looked for something else to do,  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:03):**  and I went and did a PhD in molecular genetics.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:05):**  I enhanced long chain omega-3 in Australian land and got stuck into that space, which  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:11):**  is somewhere I never thought I would go.

**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:20):**  I am very passionate about the next generation.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:23):**  I mean, we're one of the oldest farming businesses in Australia, we've been told.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:27):**  So we take care, we regenerate our land.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:30):**  It's what we do.

**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:41):**  It's the gift that keeps on giving is what they're promising.

**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:10:39):**  The buy-in is massive for it.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:10:40):**  It is such a clever word because what is the opposite of regen?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:10:44):**  I'm a degenerative farmer.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:10:46):**  I'm not regenerative.

**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:10:49):**  I irrigate, I use for, I drive tractors, I import nutrients and I export heaps.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:10:55):**  And I'm making money, I'm happy and I think my landscape looks good.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:00):**  So I get very torn by the whole concept.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:03):**  I wasn't in agriculture.

**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:22):**  utilise a heap more feed, grow a heap more feed.

**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:28):**  Then you turn around and say, no, you don't need to put on phosphate.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:31):**  Well, I can tell you now what happens after 15-years of drought and dry spells and diversification.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:35):**  You're in the, you can't grow anything.

**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:43):**  And I think that's the important thing.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:44):**  The consumers are buying in left, right and centre, but you don't see farmers buying in.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:47):**  And to me that raises alarm bells when a brand is holding the system up and say, this is  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:54):**  it, and you're not getting farmers buy-in.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:56):**  I just smell a wrath.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:57):**  I want to jump to Richard actually, or back to Richard, to the points Will's making.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:02):**  Is that consistent with what you're seeing globally that farmers aren't buying in, or  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:07):**  maybe there's a difference in corporate farms versus family farms in terms of buy-in that  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:13):**  you might have seen overseas?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:14):**  Look, it's, I think the regen thing is still gaining ground, to be honest, Sarah.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:18):**  I mean, all of the places I went to, I think most of them started as either organic or  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:23):**  biodynamic.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:24):**  Certainly in our industry, biodynamic is quite strong.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:27):**  So I think they start there and then they transition.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:30):**  And I don't disagree at all with some of Will's points.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:34):**  If anyone's interested, I'll have my reports out.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:37):**  And my addition to the principles that are well written about is that the nutrient balancing  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:43):**  in landscape is important.

**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:50):**  or whether there's some organic, or whether there's a bit of both.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:52):**  What I like about the potential of regen is that we take the best out of a lot of these  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:58):**  systems.

**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:01):**  Now, these aren't off the shelf things.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:04):**  They're a set of guidelines that I think you can use that suit your business.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:09):**  So in that context, I think there's interest in it.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:13):**  I'm interested in it because I think there's huge upside in the piece of land that the

**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:27):**  So that's a very narrow focus for us.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:30):**  And I understand that, and I really like some of the figures that Toby's put up because  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:35):**  that helps talk about some of the gains that perhaps as an industry we can make if we just  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:40):**  increase some soil carbon by doing some of these things.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:43):**  And I think we'll look back to Will's point, it's valid.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:46):**  You're exporting, we're exporting nutrient every time we take fruit off the property.

**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:14:04):**  It's not to say it can't be done, but at the moment there's still a lot of stuff we don't  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:14:08):**  know.

**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:14:14):**  ag system.

**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:14:22):**  Toby, I know you're talking to investors in terms of what impact ag does.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:14:28):**  What's the investor conversation like and how much of your thinking about regen ag is

**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:14:42):**  They certainly care about the data component.

**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:16:49):**  How do you think about that balance Will?  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:16:52):**  I'm scared of it.

**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:16:59):**  gone and it all takes capital.

**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:05):**  I run my overdraft through the red line all the time just trying to get that fence in

**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:15):**  It all takes money and the worst thing about this system is it's a slow burner.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:19):**  It's a real burner on finance and I'm part of the Holmes and Sackett benchmarking group,  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:22):**  which is one of my, I love it.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:24):**  It lets me look at my business against everyone what I'm doing and they did a review against  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:28):**  Regen Ag and basically on a similar asset base to me over a 10 year period, I'm a million  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:32):**  dollars down.

**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:35):**  So that's hard data that comes at me.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:37):**  There are aspects of the benchmarking that I shudder at and go, yeah, the philosophical  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:42):**  challenge for me and then being an analytical scientist, like I live for data, like molecular  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:46):**  genetics is this black box of data and associations and all sorts of give and take.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:50):**  And so the farming is exactly the same.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:52):**  Having a PhD and coming back to the farm, a lot of people say, what a waste and I'm  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:55):**  like, no, post hole digger, that's what it stands for.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:57):**  But it's actually my skill set stretched to its limit, just thinking this huge complex  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:02):**  system and analyzing it.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:03):**  And yeah, I love empirical data, but I also go on gut feeling a lot as well.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:08):**  You just heard Will mention Homes and Sackett, an Australian agricultural consultancy that  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:12):**  provides amongst other things, benchmarking services, analyzing how farm businesses compare  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:18):**  with each other.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:20):**  Toby says he uses Homes and Sackett and other data comparison tools to make sure their Regen  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:25):**  Ag practices are in fact improving the profitability of their farms.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:30):**  So benchmarking is a very important tool and we've got to achieve similar results or better  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:37):**  results than industry standard.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:40):**  If we're going to claim that we are good regenerative farm managers and you can do it profitably.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:47):**  I would say we've transitioned a number of properties from a conventional through to  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:52):**  what we would call a regenerative system and done a lot of data, assessed a lot of data  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:57):**  around the cost of that transition.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:59):**  And in many cases we haven't found it to be an expensive process.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:02):**  The Wilmont Cattle Company and Myer Grazing did a case study on that one paddock, splitting  
**[0:19:07-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:07):**  it up into nine and they spent $125 on water and wire, a single hot wire in a trough system.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:16):**  Two thirds of that cost was in the trough system to over four or five year period double  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:20):**  the productivity of that, the pasture production of that subdivision.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:24):**  So that's doubling the current capacity $125 a hectare.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:28):**  If we were to go and buy the neighbour, the neighbour's paddock in that part of the world,  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:32):**  it would cost us $8,000 a hectare.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:34):**  The Holmes and Sackett response to the Regen report I've read, but I think there's in both  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:39):**  instances there's good key takeaways of both those reports.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:42):**  But I certainly wouldn't discredit the benchmarking data and the expertise that an organisation  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:48):**  like that has.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:49):**  There's been some back and forth on that, I think catalyzed by the Australian Farm Institute.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:53):**  But yeah, it kind of goes, I guess, to the some of the heart of the question around this  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:58):**  evidence base and this definition.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:00):**  And there's questions around, well, is, you know, changing the stocking rate particularly  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:05):**  regenerative and some kind of ambiguity around is this just a catch all marketing term or  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:11):**  is this an actual set of things that has evidence behind it?  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:15):**  Richard, how do you think about that?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:17):**  You mentioned principles.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:18):**  How do you think about that?  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:19):**  Well, I think it's both.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:20):**  I mean, what I can give you some real time cost on the system change for us, because  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:26):**  like, again, I think there's there's huge upside for Vinyard.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:29):**  We're utilising livestock in a couple of places that have taken out two to three tractor passes  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:34):**  at the start of the season for us.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:36):**  Now, that's just a real time cost at $100 a hectare every time you get on a tractor  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:40):**  to do something.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:41):**  That's money that's straight back into your bottom line.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:43):**  So that's an easy win.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:45):**  Some of that livestock's been leased, some of it's been grown out by us.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:49):**  So there's another income stream for very little infrastructure other than a hot wire  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:55):**  in a lot of places.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:56):**  But also, like, will you know, some of it would add to do some significant fencing,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:00):**  but it's a one off cost.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:01):**  So there's certainly huge potential in that.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:04):**  But it depends a bit where you're at.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:06):**  Obviously, my goal to go around the world was to pick holes and pick out the good bits  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:10):**  out of arable farming, cropping systems, grazing systems, anything that looked like that managed  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:17):**  grass and plants and utilise that into a vineyard setting.

**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:28):**  or whether we've already got challenges around resistance to herbicide and vineyards.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:33):**  So that's not a feasible thing going forward.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:35):**  You know, if you don't have a plan B for that, you're going backwards.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:39):**  And we know that cultivation isn't the answer either because it's costly.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:44):**  Every time you do it, it's costing you money.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:46):**  And again, at $100 a hectare, you can't go from one herbicide or two herbicides a year  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:51):**  to three cultivation passes because it's costing you more money and it's doing more damage  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:54):**  to your soil.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:55):**  So this is where the regen bit comes in for me.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:58):**  Now, I just don't think we need to get tied up in the term too much.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:02):**  OK, if we're doing something that is beneficial for the landscape, I think we can all agree  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:06):**  on that more plants, more diverse, more cover ticks a lot of boxes.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:12):**  OK.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:13):**  It's better than less plants cultivation and bare ground.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:17):**  It's got no photosynthetic capacity at all.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:19):**  It does no one any good.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:21):**  So rather than get too worried about whose regen and what's not regen, let's focus on  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:26):**  the things that we know work.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:27):**  And we can talk about the stuff that we don't know yet.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:32):**  That's coming.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:33):**  I'm a bit like Toby.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:34):**  I've read plenty of reports that suggest both sides of the argument.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:38):**  So that tells us that we're still working on these things.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:40):**  But it's a three dimensional system.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:42):**  You know, they're really hard to measure and triple replicate and do all those things.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:47):**  You come back to your own system and say, what's my key goal here?  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:50):**  Now, for me, it was to improve my water holding capacity or at least plant available water  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:56):**  and reduce my costs.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:57):**  And how do I do that?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:59):**  And I look at some of these processes and do it.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:01):**  You know, if we go to, again, another example is cover cropping.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:05):**  Growers that are going around putting in single species cover crops have been doing it for  
**[0:23:08-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:08):**  years.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:09):**  That's doing some good.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:10):**  So then it takes three cultivation passes to set it up.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:14):**  There's three tractor passes.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:15):**  The Arable guys were working this out years ago where they just direct drill it mostly.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:19):**  Yeah, they use a bit of herbicide to get it right.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:21):**  But that's a better system than what that's doing.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:23):**  So let's utilise some of that knowledge and transfer it across into our own systems.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:28):**  Will, you were shaking your head and nodding.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:30):**  You know, I think that's the danger in it though.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:33):**  You're cherry picking it.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:34):**  Like what you're describing is the leading edge of conventional ag.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:36):**  Like I run a UAV company and operate drones all over the world.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:39):**  I see a lot of paddocks and a lot of data.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:42):**  And like you watch Col the corn star or the millennial farmer on YouTube, I mean, they  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:46):**  are huge conveyors of ag and you watch what they're doing with a Yeta system and their  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:51):**  press wheels and the fuel burn on the tractor.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:53):**  That's just conventional farming.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:54):**  It's smart farming, using pressure and trash residues and mechanical techniques.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:00):**  But that's what I see here.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:02):**  They cherry pick it and people don't see the whole concept.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:04):**  And luckily we're looking at the bottom end of the bell curve in agriculture.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:09):**  So it's good management is what you guys are describing.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:11):**  And I mean, Regen is just still grazing rebranded as far as I'm concerned.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:15):**  It's exactly the same.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:16):**  But the problem, the danger to me is that you're taking a beautiful concept of a conventional  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:21):**  farming.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:22):**  Like I'm super high tech with what I do, the amount of remote sensing I have going on in  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:26):**  variable applications and whatever, I'm pushing it.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:29):**  But then Regen, you're pushing a brand out of the default position is degenerative.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:33):**  So if I'm a really smart, switched on, cutting edge UAV operating variable rate irrigator  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:39):**  guy doing his thing, I'm degenerative, default position.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:43):**  And that bugs me.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:44):**  I want to jump into that tech point.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:47):**  There's a couple of questions here around what kind of technologies, monitoring, et  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:52):**  cetera, are you using in these farms and especially when it comes to Regen Ag or just improving  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:58):**  soil and land management?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:00):**  So I run a 2000 hectare private Wi-Fi mesh with something like 300 access points, everything  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:08):**  from turning power points on and off to save energy through to, I have soil moisture probes

**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:19):**  I run variable rate irrigation on individual sprinklers.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:21):**  I have a kilometre long irrigator that does 200 degrees, pushes the boundaries of irrigation.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:26):**  A variable rate soil test, soil test every paddock, replace all my capital P. We've got

**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:47):**  And I, 80 Ks away from the farm.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:50):**  I don't live on the farm as such, just the way succession panned out.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:53):**  And so I farm remotely from cameras.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:55):**  I'm not exceptional in what I do.

**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:27:34):**  So Will, I can find the vests and the chemical company hats and bits and pieces as well.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:27:39):**  We can get on the treadmill of continuous pest and disease control and herbicide control

**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:27:47):**  I keep looking at what I'm doing and saying, well, am I in this perpetuity?

**[0:27:55-0:27:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:27:55):**  Is there a better way?

**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:01):**  Can I do it through soil biology and soil health to a degree?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:07):**  Can I do it with other ecosystem services by companion plantings and bits and pieces

**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:21):**  And it's just about asking those questions.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:22):**  You know, I just think Will's point is valid.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:26):**  The good managers will always analyse their business.

**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:47):**  we utilise that and use it to our advantage and farm it.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:51):**  Some of that will be stuff that we can do on the land.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:54):**  Some of it will be inputs.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:56):**  But we understand the chemistry bit.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:58):**  We know how that works.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:29:00):**  We've been doing it in the Green Revolution for the last 50 years.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:29:04):**  The next big set will be how do we make the biology do some of this stuff for us?  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:29:09):**  It may well be in transition with inputs, but if we don't give it a go, then we're not

**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:29:16):**  I just think there's an opportunity to have a crack at some stuff.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:29:20):**  Now, don't do 4000 acres off the top of your bat, but have a little bit in the corner where

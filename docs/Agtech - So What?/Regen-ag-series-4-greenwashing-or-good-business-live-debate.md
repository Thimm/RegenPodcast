### Agtech - So What?  (2020-00-09)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentic.  I'm your host, Sarah Nollet.  This episode jumps back to our Regen Ag series, this time with a debate.  The debate was held at a recent live AgTech meetup where we asked our panelists whether  Regen Ag is greenwashing or good business.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:23):**  It is such a clever word because what is the opposite of Regen?  I'm a degenerative farmer, I'm not regenerative.  I turn around and say, 200 years on the same patch of dirt.  I irrigate, I use for, I drive tractors and I'm making money and I think my landscape looks good.  I just don't think we need to get tied up in the term too much.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:00:44):**  Okay, if we're doing something that is beneficial for the landscape, I think we can all agree  on that more plants, more diverse, more cover ticks a lot of boxes.  Yep, there are two sides to this debate and that was just a taste of what's to come.  Let me properly introduce you to our panelists.  You just heard a bit from Richard Leask.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:05):**  He's a wine grower in the McLaren Vale area of South Australia, a region famous for its Shiraz.  And he believes that Regen is worth investigating.  Also on the pro-Regen side of the debate is Toby Grogan.  Toby works as a natural capital specialist for a company called Impact Ag.  And on the Regen Ag skeptic side is Will Bignell.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:28):**  You heard him at the start there too.  Will describes himself as a conventional farmer, but I'm not sure if that's an accurate description.  In addition to running a mixed farming operation in Tasmania, he produces boutique vegetables  and cheeses and owns a drone company.  So let's hear from our very impressive panelists directly.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:01:47):**  Richard is the first of the three to take the stage.  I'm a wine grower from McLaren Vale in South Australia, 2019 Nuffield Scholar, where I  spent 12 months of the year.  Last year going around the world, looking at what is regenerative agriculture and where  does it sit in terms of vineyard, the vineyard industry.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:06):**  So it's a massive subject to try and sum up in five minutes.  In terms of our brand and our business, we're on the journey.  We've implemented most of the practices on one of our farms and we're using a number  of them across a few others, as well as consultancy business that we do.  So we're in the testing phase, I would call it.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:25):**  We're seeing some interesting results, but there's still a lot we don't understand about  it and there's still a lot we don't know, but we're working our way through that.  So I just want to quickly make a few points, obviously five minutes just to sum it up.  Really what we're talking about here is a system change from what we've been doing traditionally.  I'll have a very vineyard centric take on this, but just supplement if you're in the  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:02:45):**  farming industry, your business, and we're working with the same substrates.  What is carbon and what does it do for us?  We know it's great for soil structure.  We know it's good for aeration, particularly good for increasing the available water and  soil, but none of that happens without the biology in the soil.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:02):**  So all of this stuff has to work in harmony.  And how do we do that?  We need plenty of plant cover.  We need plenty of diversity in the soil to do that.  And we need to give that system a chance to do it regularly and without too much disturbance.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:15):**  We know that carbon is a cycle, it's used, the microbes use it, the plants use it.  We're not necessarily talking about sequestration here.  I'm talking about how to maximise the system to improve our soil organic matter, our soil  structure to give our plants that we're growing in resilience, given that the seasons we've  got are becoming a bit more challenging.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:37):**  That's the real quick upshot of it.  The main driver of that is obviously the plant life that we use on it.  So if we use a vineyard system, for example, we've got a permanent planting there that  we can utilise, but we've also got a considerable amount of land that perhaps we can use in  a slightly different manner.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:03:53):**  And the more we have above the ground, the more we're going to have below the ground,  and that's going to help drive the system.  So it's a very simple concept in that respect, but complex in a lot of other ways.  So we've gone from cultivation to seven herbicide passes a year to control what little organic  matter we've got in the middle of the row.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:10):**  So I don't think anyone can argue that that's a sustainable or even regenerative path moving  into the foreword.  So we've got to have a plan B because this isn't something that's going to take us into  farming in the future.  I think that sort of sets the context for where I'm looking and where we're trying to  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:25):**  get to in terms of the journey.  Toby is also on the Regen Ag journey, not as a farmer, but as someone who works with  farmers and investors to improve the health of their land and raise their overall productivity.  So I'm from Impact Ag.  We're an asset manager based in Armvale, New South Wales, and we've got farms in Queensland,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:04:45):**  New South Wales and Western Australia.  And all of those are being managed regeneratively and are on a journey to transition to a better  ecosystem.  Some of those we've been managing for 10 plus years and others that we've just purchased.  So before I start to show you some of our results, I probably need to define Regen Ag,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:05:05):**  which is sometimes a dangerous thing to do.  But we see it as a regenerative ag, any farming system which aims to actively and profitably  improve the farm's natural capital.  So soil biodiversity and the water cycle.  So any management activity or management decision that leads to an improved ecosystem broadly  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:05:24):**  and at Impact Ag, we are a data-driven business.  So all our decisions need to be based on factual evidence and data.  So the first thing that we focus on when it comes to measuring is productivity and financial  metrics.  If it's not profitable, it's not going to be successful.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:05:41):**  This is a graph from the Wilmot Cattle Company in Northern New South Wales.  You'll see a blue dotted line, which is the trend rainfall going down.  You'll see a green line, which is the soil carbon, soil organic carbon levels going up.  So this is a business that primarily through grazing management was able to improve their  soil health and productivity.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:06:00):**  And the measures here I've used are soil carbon.  So they've gone on a regenerative journey from 2010 through 2016.  And then they've more recently had some very tough years.  And I think Regen Ag, when you're getting climate conditions that enable you to impact  the landscape you're working on, you've got an opportunity to regenerate it.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:06:19):**  When you go through a couple of years like we've just had, and rainfall shows it here,  the focus needs to be on protecting that landscape.  So when you're able to regenerate it, when you need to protect it.  And as I said, data-driven business, and we've got a bit of a case study that the Mire Raising  guys did for us on this asset, Bart Davidson.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:06:37):**  And this was on a small case study of one paddock on this property that went from 60  hectares to nine paddocks of six and a half hectares.  And over a four year period through Mire Grazing, we measured a doubling of grass yield, or  an increase of 220 kilos per hectare per hundred mil.  So that to me sounds like good business.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:06:56):**  Will, however, is not convinced that Regen Ag is good business.  In fact, he's worried that producers could lose money and ultimately even their farms  by following Regen Ag philosophies.  I'm a seventh generation farmer down in Tassie.  Basically been here since the original land grant.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:07:14):**  What that means is we have a lot of junk lying around.  Seven generations of social history as well.  So social capital, as I term it, understanding our landscape.  And our business has been incredibly diversified over those generations.  We've gone from 100,000 acres, currently I'm farming about 4,000 acres or 1700 odd hectares  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:07:33):**  now.  A mix of grazing, overhead irrigation with pivot irrigators and running a mix of poppies,  barley for sheep feed and dairy feed.  That's my core business as such.  But however, we, my father pioneered the deer industry in Australia.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:07:48):**  We've got one of the first four permits to farm deer.  We farm deer, killed on the farm.  We milled flower.  We've got Australia's oldest flower mill.  We have grown all sorts of boutique vegetables.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:07:59):**  We started small scale farmhouse cheese making, milking sheep and goats, selling direct to  restaurants, growing 2 million strawberry runners a year, all that sort of stuff alongside  running still 10,000 to 15,000 sheep on our properties as family businesses.  And it's seven generations succession, which is quite hard to manage, to put it mildly.  So my background is this big farming business, but I'm also a pretty curious character.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:26):**  So I ended up going to uni, did a bachelor of Ag science, came back for a year, which  was the 05, 06, 07 drought in Tassie.  So we got hit really hard.  Where we are is very much in microclimate and we get a bad hit.  So it had the millennial drought of 2000, the, what was it?  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:08:43):**  05, 06, 07, 08, where we had cut off our water rights, which is like cutting off your head  to our business.  And we had all this other diversification and we worked very hard at what we were doing,  but we come off this base of very standard conventional farming.  I'm at the point where I came home in the drought, I looked for something else to do,  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:03):**  and I went and did a PhD in molecular genetics.  I enhanced long chain omega-3 in Australian land and got stuck into that space, which  is somewhere I never thought I would go.  So I have a very sustainable, what a word to use, ethos towards farming.  I am very passionate about the next generation.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:23):**  I mean, we're one of the oldest farming businesses in Australia, we've been told.  So we take care, we regenerate our land.  It's what we do.  If we didn't, we weren't regenerative farmers, but I use all the inputs you can imagine.  And the reason I fear regen is, and I'm quite anti it, is it's the magic pudding.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:41):**  It's the gift that keeps on giving is what they're promising.  I understand the concept of soil carbon.  We've been drilling for 40 years.  My organic carbon levels in all my soils work.  I try and conserve ground cover, but I also recognise I extract a huge amount of resources  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:09:55):**  from the landscape.  And no matter how hard I try, biological activity is driven by 100 milli- per 100 milli-rein  is driven by it.  And you just can't put it back in.  That's my ethos.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:10:06):**  We had the capital stripped out of the business pretty aggressively into diversification.  And I've been working for 3-years, really hard to bring it back up.  And it's almost uneconomical because while my father was a very skilled graze here, you  learn how to read grass and graze properly and keep ground cover, come in on 3-leaf,  do your feed budgets.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:10:26):**  And all of a sudden you get these massive gains.  You grow the weeds you've got, you eat the weeds you've got, you change the weeds you've  got in that way in your business.  And I get really challenged by this idea because regen really invigorates the end consumer.  The buy-in is massive for it.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:10:40):**  It is such a clever word because what is the opposite of regen?  I'm a degenerative farmer.  I'm not regenerative.  I turn around and say, 200-years on the same patch of dirt.  I irrigate, I use for, I drive tractors, I import nutrients and I export heaps.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:10:55):**  And I'm making money, I'm happy and I think my landscape looks good.  So I get very torn by the whole concept.  I wasn't in agriculture.  Someone who's smart and switched on, who's a good manager and a good business head on  them is going to succeed in Ag regardless, especially if it's your own business, you've  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:14):**  got that buy-in.  And I, I fear of God in me that I'm watching people get really good at grazing, go and  utilise a heap more feed, grow a heap more feed.  They can up their stocking rate because I've just learned to graze.  Then you turn around and say, no, you don't need to put on phosphate.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:31):**  Well, I can tell you now what happens after 15-years of drought and dry spells and diversification.  You're in the, you can't grow anything.  So I'm here not as an antagonist, but yeah, to me, I just don't buy in.  And I think that's the important thing.  The consumers are buying in left, right and centre, but you don't see farmers buying in.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:11:47):**  And to me that raises alarm bells when a brand is holding the system up and say, this is  it, and you're not getting farmers buy-in.  I just smell a wrath.  I want to jump to Richard actually, or back to Richard, to the points Will's making.  Is that consistent with what you're seeing globally that farmers aren't buying in, or  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:07):**  maybe there's a difference in corporate farms versus family farms in terms of buy-in that  you might have seen overseas?  Look, it's, I think the regen thing is still gaining ground, to be honest, Sarah.  I mean, all of the places I went to, I think most of them started as either organic or  biodynamic.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:24):**  Certainly in our industry, biodynamic is quite strong.  So I think they start there and then they transition.  And I don't disagree at all with some of Will's points.  If anyone's interested, I'll have my reports out.  And my addition to the principles that are well written about is that the nutrient balancing  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:43):**  in landscape is important.  And I don't think we should get hung up on whether that is a bit of well-timed synthetic  or whether there's some organic, or whether there's a bit of both.  What I like about the potential of regen is that we take the best out of a lot of these  systems.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:12:59):**  We're designing the bit that suits you.  Now, these aren't off the shelf things.  They're a set of guidelines that I think you can use that suit your business.  So in that context, I think there's interest in it.  I'm interested in it because I think there's huge upside in the piece of land that the  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:17):**  mine industry's got that they currently use to drive tractors on and really don't think  about how they can be utilised for the ecosystem benefits for the vineyard as a whole.  So that's a very narrow focus for us.  And I understand that, and I really like some of the figures that Toby's put up because  that helps talk about some of the gains that perhaps as an industry we can make if we just  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:13:40):**  increase some soil carbon by doing some of these things.  And I think we'll look back to Will's point, it's valid.  You're exporting, we're exporting nutrient every time we take fruit off the property.  I've seen some really good examples, but yet to be totally convinced in a high production  horticultural setting that these systems will run and manage themselves without any inputs  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:14:00):**  from us.  So, you know, it's a work in progress.  It's not to say it can't be done, but at the moment there's still a lot of stuff we don't  know.  So it's got grounding in the US for sure, but it's a very counterpoint to the current  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:14:14):**  ag system.  They're miles apart, and that's why it's got some voice.  But whether it's across the mainstream, it's probably yet to be decided.  Toby, I know you're talking to investors in terms of what impact ag does.  What's the investor conversation like and how much of your thinking about regen ag is  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:14:33):**  driven by that ability to attract capital or really tell that story to investors, or  do they care about the data and that kind of evidence base as well?  They certainly care about the data component.  And I think it's important that farming can get a lot of bad press around whether it's  animal welfare or climate impact.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:14:53):**  So for us, it's a bit about neutralising that as well and presenting agriculture in the  best light.  And we're now in a position where we've been collecting this data and analysing this data  ourselves for 10 years.  We're not a business that has appeared last week and decided we're regen and we're going  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:15:14):**  to save the world.  We're a business that is built on a decade of data that demonstrates that we can, with  lower inputs, certainly not no inputs, but lower inputs with management change, increase  productivity, increase returns.  So those financial metrics are obviously integral to the financial or investor market.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:15:38):**  And it's about being able to present that data coherently and with enough history to  reduce their view of risk in agriculture.  The other thing I would say is from an investor point of view, the climate change and being  able to invest, whether it's a small family investor that we deal with or a large corporate,  being able to invest their money into something that can demonstrate that it is a low impact  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:16:04):**  or it is carbon positive investment is increasing exponentially.  And as an industry, I think we are pretty well positioned to present ourselves as being  a low carbon investment and in the best case scenarios, a carbon positive investment.  I'm really curious to hear from all of you about this challenge of kind of principles  based versus evidence based and the excitement around how Regen Ag sounds and some of those  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:16:32):**  climate benefits with the on the ground challenge of do I actually change what I'm doing and  what level of evidence do I need before I'm actually going to risk the bottom line to  get started with maybe what does lack evidence, but I might believe in.  How do you think about that balance Will?  I'm scared of it.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:16:54):**  In the position I was in, we were heavily de-stopped, nutrients were gone, fences were  gone and it all takes capital.  So to regenerate a landscape takes a heck of a lot of money, phenomenal.  I run my overdraft through the red line all the time just trying to get that fence in  to lock that North facing slope off to stop erosion to get that bit under control.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:15):**  It all takes money and the worst thing about this system is it's a slow burner.  It's a real burner on finance and I'm part of the Holmes and Sackett benchmarking group,  which is one of my, I love it.  It lets me look at my business against everyone what I'm doing and they did a review against  Regen Ag and basically on a similar asset base to me over a 10 year period, I'm a million  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:32):**  dollars down.  I'm a million dollars behind on that system.  So that's hard data that comes at me.  There are aspects of the benchmarking that I shudder at and go, yeah, the philosophical  challenge for me and then being an analytical scientist, like I live for data, like molecular  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:17:46):**  genetics is this black box of data and associations and all sorts of give and take.  And so the farming is exactly the same.  Having a PhD and coming back to the farm, a lot of people say, what a waste and I'm  like, no, post hole digger, that's what it stands for.  But it's actually my skill set stretched to its limit, just thinking this huge complex  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:02):**  system and analyzing it.  And yeah, I love empirical data, but I also go on gut feeling a lot as well.  You just heard Will mention Homes and Sackett, an Australian agricultural consultancy that  provides amongst other things, benchmarking services, analyzing how farm businesses compare  with each other.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:20):**  Toby says he uses Homes and Sackett and other data comparison tools to make sure their Regen  Ag practices are in fact improving the profitability of their farms.  So benchmarking is a very important tool and we've got to achieve similar results or better  results than industry standard.  If we're going to claim that we are good regenerative farm managers and you can do it profitably.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:18:47):**  I would say we've transitioned a number of properties from a conventional through to  what we would call a regenerative system and done a lot of data, assessed a lot of data  around the cost of that transition.  And in many cases we haven't found it to be an expensive process.  The Wilmont Cattle Company and Myer Grazing did a case study on that one paddock, splitting  
**[0:19:07-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:07):**  it up into nine and they spent $125 on water and wire, a single hot wire in a trough system.  Two thirds of that cost was in the trough system to over four or five year period double  the productivity of that, the pasture production of that subdivision.  So that's doubling the current capacity $125 a hectare.  If we were to go and buy the neighbour, the neighbour's paddock in that part of the world,  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:32):**  it would cost us $8,000 a hectare.  The Holmes and Sackett response to the Regen report I've read, but I think there's in both  instances there's good key takeaways of both those reports.  But I certainly wouldn't discredit the benchmarking data and the expertise that an organisation  like that has.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:19:49):**  There's been some back and forth on that, I think catalyzed by the Australian Farm Institute.  But yeah, it kind of goes, I guess, to the some of the heart of the question around this  evidence base and this definition.  And there's questions around, well, is, you know, changing the stocking rate particularly  regenerative and some kind of ambiguity around is this just a catch all marketing term or  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:11):**  is this an actual set of things that has evidence behind it?  Richard, how do you think about that?  You mentioned principles.  How do you think about that?  Well, I think it's both.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:20):**  I mean, what I can give you some real time cost on the system change for us, because  like, again, I think there's there's huge upside for Vinyard.  We're utilising livestock in a couple of places that have taken out two to three tractor passes  at the start of the season for us.  Now, that's just a real time cost at $100 a hectare every time you get on a tractor  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:40):**  to do something.  That's money that's straight back into your bottom line.  So that's an easy win.  Some of that livestock's been leased, some of it's been grown out by us.  So there's another income stream for very little infrastructure other than a hot wire  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:20:55):**  in a lot of places.  But also, like, will you know, some of it would add to do some significant fencing,  but it's a one off cost.  So there's certainly huge potential in that.  But it depends a bit where you're at.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:06):**  Obviously, my goal to go around the world was to pick holes and pick out the good bits  out of arable farming, cropping systems, grazing systems, anything that looked like that managed  grass and plants and utilise that into a vineyard setting.  We know that we've got some challenges coming up around whether it be market around herbicide  or whether we've already got challenges around resistance to herbicide and vineyards.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:33):**  So that's not a feasible thing going forward.  You know, if you don't have a plan B for that, you're going backwards.  And we know that cultivation isn't the answer either because it's costly.  Every time you do it, it's costing you money.  And again, at $100 a hectare, you can't go from one herbicide or two herbicides a year  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:21:51):**  to three cultivation passes because it's costing you more money and it's doing more damage  to your soil.  So this is where the regen bit comes in for me.  Now, I just don't think we need to get tied up in the term too much.  OK, if we're doing something that is beneficial for the landscape, I think we can all agree  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:06):**  on that more plants, more diverse, more cover ticks a lot of boxes.  OK.  It's better than less plants cultivation and bare ground.  It's got no photosynthetic capacity at all.  It does no one any good.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:21):**  So rather than get too worried about whose regen and what's not regen, let's focus on  the things that we know work.  And we can talk about the stuff that we don't know yet.  That's coming.  I'm a bit like Toby.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:34):**  I've read plenty of reports that suggest both sides of the argument.  So that tells us that we're still working on these things.  But it's a three dimensional system.  You know, they're really hard to measure and triple replicate and do all those things.  You come back to your own system and say, what's my key goal here?  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:22:50):**  Now, for me, it was to improve my water holding capacity or at least plant available water  and reduce my costs.  And how do I do that?  And I look at some of these processes and do it.  You know, if we go to, again, another example is cover cropping.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:05):**  Growers that are going around putting in single species cover crops have been doing it for  years.  That's doing some good.  So then it takes three cultivation passes to set it up.  There's three tractor passes.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:15):**  The Arable guys were working this out years ago where they just direct drill it mostly.  Yeah, they use a bit of herbicide to get it right.  But that's a better system than what that's doing.  So let's utilise some of that knowledge and transfer it across into our own systems.  Will, you were shaking your head and nodding.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:30):**  You know, I think that's the danger in it though.  You're cherry picking it.  Like what you're describing is the leading edge of conventional ag.  Like I run a UAV company and operate drones all over the world.  I see a lot of paddocks and a lot of data.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:23:42):**  And like you watch Col the corn star or the millennial farmer on YouTube, I mean, they  are huge conveyors of ag and you watch what they're doing with a Yeta system and their  press wheels and the fuel burn on the tractor.  That's just conventional farming.  It's smart farming, using pressure and trash residues and mechanical techniques.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:00):**  But that's what I see here.  They cherry pick it and people don't see the whole concept.  And luckily we're looking at the bottom end of the bell curve in agriculture.  So it's good management is what you guys are describing.  And I mean, Regen is just still grazing rebranded as far as I'm concerned.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:15):**  It's exactly the same.  But the problem, the danger to me is that you're taking a beautiful concept of a conventional  farming.  Like I'm super high tech with what I do, the amount of remote sensing I have going on in  variable applications and whatever, I'm pushing it.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:29):**  But then Regen, you're pushing a brand out of the default position is degenerative.  So if I'm a really smart, switched on, cutting edge UAV operating variable rate irrigator  guy doing his thing, I'm degenerative, default position.  And that bugs me.  I want to jump into that tech point.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:24:47):**  There's a couple of questions here around what kind of technologies, monitoring, et  cetera, are you using in these farms and especially when it comes to Regen Ag or just improving  soil and land management?  So I run a 2000 hectare private Wi-Fi mesh with something like 300 access points, everything  from turning power points on and off to save energy through to, I have soil moisture probes  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:13):**  in all my cropping paddocks.  They measure down to 80 centimetres.  I watch all my irrigation infiltration.  I run variable rate irrigation on individual sprinklers.  I have a kilometre long irrigator that does 200 degrees, pushes the boundaries of irrigation.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:26):**  A variable rate soil test, soil test every paddock, replace all my capital P. We've got  four, five trial sites on our farm that are lifetime trial sites on tree recruitment,  the pasture species, deep core organic carbon levels of our soil, north facing slope trials,  like we do heaps of stuff.  And I, 80 Ks away from the farm.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:25:50):**  I don't live on the farm as such, just the way succession panned out.  And so I farm remotely from cameras.  I'm not exceptional in what I do.  As the debate was heating up and we started digging into ag tech, it was clear that no  one thinks that simply deploying tech on farm or collecting data is enough, at least not  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:26:07):**  yet, to answer the question of whether regen ag is worthwhile.  Will uses a lot of technology and remains completely unconvinced by the claims of regen  ag, but Toby and Richard also use the latest tech to understand what they're seeing on  farm.  And for them, it does back up their regen claims.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:26:25):**  So what's going on here?  Do we need more data, better tech?  Are emotions getting in the way?  Is perhaps a comfort with longstanding business models in agriculture influencing decision  making?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:26:37):**  I asked Will if we're simply using high input systems in some cases, because that's what  we've always done.  Yeah, it's very, you know, Holmes and Sackett call them parasites on your business, all  these advisors and sales reps and stuff.  It's so easy to get complacent.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:26:51):**  You get the free eskies, the HAP, the Leatherman, the little mini bikes for the kids, they read  you perfectly.  And it's so easy to become complacent and the parasites feed on you basically.  But that comes back down to the individual, regardless of what colour hat you wear and  what camp you sit in your farming, if you let them run, they'll run with you and they'll  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:27:08):**  clean you up.  Their job is to make money off you.  And a lot of people have seen it fall into that trap, do just solely rely on an agronomist  or someone for their input.  And Toby's business and stuff, alternative views, the data they put out and analysing  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:27:22):**  it yourself and centring yourself around what you want to do.  That's the critical thing.  A good manager is going to win regardless of what hat they wear, because they're managing  their business.  Richard, thoughts?  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:27:32):**  Yeah, well, I mean, I'll play devil's advocate.  So Will, I can find the vests and the chemical company hats and bits and pieces as well.  We can get on the treadmill of continuous pest and disease control and herbicide control  and that whole thing.  So where do we get off?  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:27:47):**  I keep looking at what I'm doing and saying, well, am I in this perpetuity?  Do I have to continue to do this to my plants to keep them alive?  Is there a better way?  I'm viewing the lens and saying, well, how do I change this paradigm?  Can I do it through soil biology and soil health to a degree?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:07):**  Can I do it with other ecosystem services by companion plantings and bits and pieces  and other things?  Do I, I don't say I'm going to go cold turkey, but can I get off some of this stuff?  It's a drip feed.  So, you know, it works both ways.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:21):**  And it's just about asking those questions.  You know, I just think Will's point is valid.  The good managers will always analyse their business.  So for us, it's about, you know, what we're looking at in terms of system changes, saying  before I go out and do what I've always done, is there a better way?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:38):**  And if you don't ask that question, then you're never going to know whether there's another  answer to it.  You know, I think the next big phase in ag tech will be biology and understanding how  we utilise that and use it to our advantage and farm it.  Some of that will be stuff that we can do on the land.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:28:54):**  Some of it will be inputs.  But we understand the chemistry bit.  We know how that works.  We've been doing it in the Green Revolution for the last 50 years.  The next big set will be how do we make the biology do some of this stuff for us?  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:29:09):**  It may well be in transition with inputs, but if we don't give it a go, then we're not  going to know.  And that's where my mindset sits.  I just think there's an opportunity to have a crack at some stuff.  Now, don't do 4000 acres off the top of your bat, but have a little bit in the corner where  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:29:25):**  you're prepared to make a loss or, you know, have a failure on that isn't going to break  you.  But you might actually learn something because if we don't try something new, we're just  going to be on the mouse wheel for however long we're on it until it falls off the hinges.  The danger of doing that though, just little games again and again and again, you don't  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:29:42):**  go anywhere.  You just make life bloody complex.  I've seen it.  That's what I lived through was little experiments, little games.  Sometimes just going, I've got to get off this, got to restructure it.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:29:52):**  It's the best solution.  To make money, you've got to be in it to capitalise in the long game in Ag.  There's no short game in it.  It's a five-year system, I reckon.  Three years to change something, particularly livestock, but five years to feel a system.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/9/regen-ag-is-it-greenwashing-or-good-business#t=0:30:04):**  If you're just experimenting every year, you're just experimenting, it's just a distraction.  Focus on the core business, manage it.  Like, yeah, you've got to get off the treadmill or looking at your business.  That ethos encouraging that and I think the best way to do it is beer.  Have a beer with your mates.

Huge money and it brought a whole heave of us back.  It brought me back from a PhD and postdoc, mates who are solicitors, lawyers, guys with  some high flies that have come back to farming.

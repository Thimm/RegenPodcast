**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:00:09):**  And just last week, our whole team got the chance to get out of town and onto the farm.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:00:15):**  And not just any farm either.

**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:00:34):**  of our job.

**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:00:50):**  to check their staying power, and to test and learn how our hypotheses need to change  
**[0:00:55-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:00:55):**  alongside people, landscapes and markets.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:00:58):**  In that spirit, this week, while we're taking a break to work on some new content that we're  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:02):**  really pumped about, we wanted to revisit our original conversation with Mark, which  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:07):**  was published back on July 15, 2020.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:10):**  Since then, a lot has changed.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:12):**  And as we visited the farm and revisited the discussion, I found some new insights, especially  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:16):**  in light of developments in carbon markets, the continued rising star of regenerative

**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:27):**  And I think you will too.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:28):**  Our chat started, as our hardest core fans may remember, with a bit of context about  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:33):**  Mark's very unusual background.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:36):**  I was actually raised in South Korea in the 1960s.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:40):**  I just turned 60 a month ago, so that dates me.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:44):**  My parents were missionaries in South Korea and as a very small child, no matter whichever  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:49):**  country we lived in, they'd always find me in a pig style, wherever the animals were.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:53):**  So I was always heading towards ag, even though I have non-farming parents.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:01:57):**  I suppose that gave a strong emphasis for a social justice type background, having been  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:02):**  brought up in a missionary, although I'm actually an atheist.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:06):**  And that imprinted on me.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:08):**  And then we moved all around different parts of the world.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:11):**  And then we settled in Melbourne for my secondary schooling.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:15):**  And then once I finished that, I went and started working on farms and didn't have enough  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:20):**  capital to get started for what we wanted to do.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:23):**  So I realized I had to get another income, went back to university when I was 23 and  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:29):**  did a geography degree and ended up teaching for 10 years, secondary here and in Africa,  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:35):**  actually.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:36):**  While in Melbourne, Mark and his wife Eve started the family.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:39):**  At one time, they had four kids under six years old.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:43):**  But the pull to get into agriculture never went away.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:47):**  We always had small properties in Gippsland when we were teaching and stuff, just running  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:51):**  villas and a few sheep.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:54):**  And then we decided to go over scale.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:55):**  We came, we were very fortunate.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:02:57):**  We came up here in 1996, we started purchasing and bought all our land pre the MIS blue gum  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:03):**  schemes.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:04):**  And we were fortunate that we could buy large swaths of land at relatively low cost.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:10):**  We had a very simple formula.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:12):**  We realized to be within two hours of a capital city was going to knock us out from being  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:17):**  competitive at a scale scalable agriculture level.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:21):**  And we were always attracted, obviously, to grazing and livestock.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:24):**  And so the choices sort of chose themselves to be frank with you.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:28):**  Right.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:29):**  I've got a million questions, all least of which is how you became an atheist.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:33):**  But I suppose we can save that for maybe a different podcast or a chat over a beverage.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:39):**  Can you, I guess, tell me about the operation today, like give us a bit of a picture of  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:45):**  where it's at.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:46):**  OK.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:47):**  Jigsaw Farms, as it's now called, has changed in size a few times since Mark and Eve first  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:52):**  started.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:53):**  We shrunk slightly a few years ago when we, I had a health issue, I had a heart operation.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:03:59):**  And after that, we made a decision that we had to make a sustainable lifestyle.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:02):**  We got to about 16,500 acres.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:05):**  And we're employing nine people and running about 35,000 ewes and nearly up to about 1600  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:13):**  breeding cattle.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:14):**  And we made a decision when land prices improved that part of our succession farm plan was  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:19):**  to shrink, which was slightly unusual when everyone else was growing.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:23):**  But we still have significant size.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:26):**  Today the farm is about eight and a half thousand acres across two blocks.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:30):**  But despite changes in size, their focus at the core remains the same.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:35):**  We grow grass.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:36):**  It's that simple.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:37):**  Since we've purchased the properties, we've measured the outcome.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:40):**  We've doubled the food and fibre on a per hectare basis off all the properties we've  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:44):**  bought and in some instances three or four times.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:47):**  We're a high input system.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:49):**  So we use fertiliser strategically and in quite a precision way.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:55):**  And we have sort of eight different blends going out.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:04:57):**  And we've come back to where we stabilise.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:05:00):**  We join 20,000 merino ewes to either a terminal sire or for self replacing.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:05:08):**  We've got good fertility now, mainly through selecting for muscle and fat.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:05:13):**  And we've got about, what are we calving down, I think we're calving down at 690 crossbred  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:05:19):**  cattle as well.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:05:20):**  So that keeps us busy.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:05:22):**  Over time, Mark has made a lot of non-traditional and in some cases, perhaps controversial decisions  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:05:29):**  on the farm.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:05:30):**  This year we'll have ceased all mulesing.

**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:06:43):**  make it work.

**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:06:48):**  The original driver was an animal welfare basis.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:06:50):**  We really were unhappy with mulesing.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:06:54):**  And we also could smell the smell the smoke coming that in that's when we started selecting

**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:07:10):**  One of our previous podcast guests, Mark Ferg Ferguson, back in episode 60, actually played

**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:07:22):**  But like many adopters of technologies and new practices, it wasn't something that Mark  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:07:27):**  just jumped into in one go.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:07:29):**  He had a plan and made small, measured changes over time.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:07:33):**  I've looked pretty heavily at some of the market forces that are at play, whether it's  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:07:37):**  a social license or whether it's a price premium, I think the two tend to run together because  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:07:42):**  one may reflect others or there might be a time lag between the two.

**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:07:51):**  risk of flies in an Australian environment.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:07:55):**  When we felt that confidence going forward, we obviously did it.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:07:59):**  We've done trials every year where it isn't like we've just gone wholesale bang.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:04):**  And this last year we ceased at the Helmdoo, the Melbourne Forest properties completely  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:10):**  and treatment.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:11):**  And we got through the summer and we were pretty confident.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:14):**  And then this year we've decided to go to do the whole thing, whereas we're not actually  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:18):**  doing it at all in terms of the freeze branding.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:22):**  We have a mules to sheep here for nearly coming up to our fifth year.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:28):**  So we haven't done a mules since then.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:30):**  So there'd be one age group, maybe one and a half age groups, if that makes sense, that  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:36):**  have got mules on them on the property and that would be it.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:39):**  Another pretty big initiative that Mark has taken on at Jigsaw is going carbon neutral.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:44):**  Again, I was interested in the drivers.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:47):**  What made Mark decide to go down this path?  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:50):**  Well I chaired the Climate Institute for 12 years from 2005.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:55):**  And it was Sydney based and I spent a lot of my life going back and forth to there,  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:08:58):**  which probably wasn't good for my carbon footprint.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:01):**  And I was heavily involved in looking at some of the problems, but some of the solutions  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:08):**  to do with climate change.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:10):**  And it became pretty self-evident that as a community we needed to act and as a world,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:16):**  as a globe we needed to act, but also as individuals we needed to act.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:20):**  And so it seems somewhat hypocritical if we were meat producers here, which have got a  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:25):**  fair carbon footprint on them, that we didn't actually look at how we manage our own farms  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:31):**  in that context.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:33):**  We've always been heavily into shelter belts and trees and agroforestry for high value  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:40):**  saw log production.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:42):**  And so Melbourne Uni actually approached us and we worked with them on doing a full audit  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:48):**  of our carbon footprint using predominantly grass grow models.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:52):**  But it was a quite exhausting one.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:54):**  It's actually been peer reviewed and published through CSIRO, the paper now.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:09:58):**  And we achieved carbon neutrality here in 2011.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:02):**  And that's predominantly by having about 18% of the farms down to trees for saw logs or  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:08):**  for permanent revegetation shelter belts.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:11):**  And so the motivation was there, but we had to say, I think we're there and using some  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:17):**  of the perhaps the simpler tools, but not quite as accurate tools, we went through the  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:21):**  full process.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:22):**  I would not encourage anyone to do it.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:26):**  It's quite an arduous process and not necessarily a commercial reward one.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:31):**  Yeah, that's what I was going to ask about because it sounds like the audit, the initial  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:36):**  verification, the baselining and even some of those practices can potentially be seen  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:41):**  as detrimental to profits.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:43):**  How do you think about the kind of return on investment of these kinds of programs and  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:47):**  practices?  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:48):**  Yeah, well, I mean, I think you have to look into the whole systems perspective.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:52):**  I mean, in terms of whole farm planning, I always say, you know, like we've been obviously  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:10:59):**  been doing it for quite a few years now, but we've had when we have a tour group of people  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:11:03):**  come through and they go, well, what should I do?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:11:05):**  How do I do it?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:11:06):**  Well, I say make a plan and then in some good years you can invest in it and some years  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:11:11):**  you can't.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:11:12):**  And you need to understand where you're going in terms of your plan.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:11:15):**  And that may be generational that they get to that plan.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:11:17):**  It may not even be in that generation, but just make sure that what you're doing won't

**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:12:36):**  Although I should say for, I think the solution for most people isn't the trees.

**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:12:58):**  So you guys did it because it was, you felt the right thing to do.

**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:13:23):**  Like, you know, we, we, we thought we were going to be there, but by the time you put

**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:13:44):**  period and you had to end it.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:13:46):**  But that's real farming.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:13:47):**  You know, real farming is movement and trading and bringing things in and some good years  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:13:52):**  and some bad years and you know, where you need to, you've got excess feed and you've  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:13:57):**  got a not enough feed and, and, and all of that had to be done over a number of years.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:14:02):**  So they were pretty keen to do it as well.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:14:04):**  So, and they've now, they've now working with the MLA for beef farmers, they've got, they're  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:14:10):**  running out of much simpler form using some of the stuff we use for 50 different farms

**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:14:21):**  And the challenge now is, is for the sheep industry, to be honest, is to hook into it.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:14:25):**  And there's no, there's no arguments in the sheep industry.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:14:27):**  Well, there's probably is that I don't hear, but you know, most people in the sheep industry  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:14:31):**  are happy to understand at least what the problem is.

**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:14:38):**  When you say the problem, you mean in terms of emissions or what do you mean by the problem?

**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:14:46):**  a 2030 red meat industry in Australia will be carbon neutral.

**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:06):**  things and it's all changed over time.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:08):**  I mean, you know, like there are times when you do things for the pure, if we'd had good  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:12):**  years and financially we could afford to go a bit harder in terms of you know, doing offset  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:19):**  trees or the, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm a wood nut too.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:23):**  I love timber.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:24):**  So, you know, the sawlog timbers have an intrinsic value, but also an economic value.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:28):**  I mean the, our trees when we harvest them after a 25 year rotation, are going to challenge  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:33):**  any of the sheep production for returns.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:35):**  I mean, they're going to be over $20,000 net return per hectare, but the problem is you  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:40):**  have no income in that 20 year, 25 year block.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:43):**  So you know, it's all about having that within the landscape.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:46):**  So when we put those trees in, they were based on the desire to have a diverse income, superannuation  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:17:54):**  outcomes, succession planning, all those number type things, but they're also, we like trees.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:00):**  So, you know, that's using two of those four categories in that decision.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:05):**  In terms of some of the, say the carbon neutrality expectation, well, we didn't have the technologies  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:11):**  where we could reduce the methane on those animals.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:14):**  Although we did recognise by running a higher input system, this is one of the challenge  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:19):**  for some of the regen ag people, by actually producing your emissions intensity per kilos  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:26):**  produced as a measurement tool, these high input systems very often outgun them on their  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:33):**  methane.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:34):**  You know, if you've got an extensive low input system, you need to somehow equate that methane  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:40):**  per kilo, whether it's per lamb or per wool kilo, whatever the criteria you're using.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:47):**  And that's one of the challenges.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:48):**  So we were confident that by doing that, by being economies of scale and being highly  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:53):**  efficient, we were going to make money out of it, it was going to do it, but at the same  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:18:58):**  time we were conscious that it had to reduce that carbon loading per kilo.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:02):**  So again, that's two of your categories.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:04):**  And in my brain, when we were talking about it, I'm not sure how I separate that, to be  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:08):**  honest with you.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:09):**  It sounds like not much of it though was in the market premium or kind of some other reward  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:16):**  category.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:17):**  I think the discretionary market premiums, there's a little bit in wool, we've done a  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:22):**  little bit there with some carbon neutral products going through where we had to track  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:26):**  them from farm gate to, it was a quothra, it was a sportswear brand hitting an Italian  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:33):**  shop and we had to do an offset there and that was to understand it.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:36):**  But it was tickling on the edges.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:38):**  It's not a serious one there.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:41):**  The language now is that consumers post COVID are going to probably are going to be a lot  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:47):**  more discretionary, understanding the wool market I'm reading now is there's people are  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:52):**  going to buy less wool, they're going to buy better wool, they're going to buy what's it  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:19:56):**  called ageless fashion items, all of that, which is, you know, if that comes to fruition,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:03):**  then I think we will be in a strong position.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:05):**  So the other half of the question, which you sort of inferred without asking directly is  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:11):**  it also protects us in these markets going forward.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:14):**  So even though the opportunity isn't perhaps there now for the market premium, there's  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:19):**  a little bit on the fringes, there is a market premium on animal welfare issues, just look  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:26):**  at ZQ.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:27):**  I mean, that's a pretty straightforward one there.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:28):**  There's a clear market premium.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:30):**  But on those other aspects, say it's a biodiversity question, you know, whether it's a naturalness,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:36):**  which is one of the other categories, which I never quite understand what it means, or  
**[0:20:39-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:39):**  whether it's on a carbon basis, those markets going forward are not going to disappear.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:47):**  They can only grow, but how much are they going to grow by?  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:49):**  I don't know.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:50):**  But by doing what we did again, and that whole systems approach and on a whole farm basis,  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:55):**  I think we've set ourselves up to have more opportunities to enter those markets than  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:20:59):**  if we didn't.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:00):**  So it's sort of a double negative, really, isn't it?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:03):**  We did it because what could happen, but it may not happen.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:06):**  But the trends are pretty, I'm a trend person, I look at trends.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:10):**  You mentioned Regen Ag, the narrative can sometimes be really oversimplified, right?  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:16):**  Well, if we just farmed better, then consumers were rewarded, and we could save the environment,  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:21):**  and why doesn't everyone just do it?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:23):**  And we'll call it regenerative, and everyone will be happy.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:26):**  And I think that misses all of the nuances that you've just started to get into.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:31):**  Well there's an implication too that to be brutal is what we're doing is not regenerative.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:36):**  I mean, if you look at our carbon stores, which we measure rigorously, we get to about  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:40):**  4%, and then it doesn't move much at all from then.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:43):**  So then they say, oh, you've got to look at your soil biologies, and you're going to have  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:45):**  to look at rotation.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:46):**  Well, we rotationally graze.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:48):**  We do a range of different grazing systems, and we just can't move it.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:52):**  Our biggest change in getting locked in carbon here was not using fertiliser, it was going  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:58):**  to a perennial system.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:21:59):**  As soon as we went to a perennial system away from using annuals, we started locking carbon  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:22:04):**  up.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:22:05):**  And I would argue that by us doubling the, you know, our farms here are double the district  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:22:10):**  average in terms of carrying capacity.

**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:22:18):**  Our profitability here is, you know, we'll be frank, we've had on average an over 10%

**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:33:14):**  I mean, our stock records are still on Excel.

**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:04):**  And we made a decision, which in hindsight, we kept too much stock too early.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:09):**  And so one of the challenges for us going forward is to have more flex in our system,

**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:17):**  So we make decisions early.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:19):**  It's all about, we don't try to pick the top of the market or the bottom of the market.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:23):**  We try to make decisions.

**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:35):**  We need to be able to sleep at night and we're still profitable.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:38):**  But it's about using the, you know, even though the three month weather forecast is not the  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:43):**  most reliable tool, it's still on the basis, I always say, well, it's better than using  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:47):**  nothing.

**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:53):**  those drought years.

**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:34:58):**  And that's reflected in our breeding objectives.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:35:00):**  I mean, we have a true dual purpose, you now that can go to a terminal or it can go to  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:35:06):**  a, back to a Merino.

**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:35:19):**  You know, you just go buy some more terminal rams.

**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/6/2/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming-sustainable-livestock#t=0:35:23):**  But then there are consequences obviously further on.

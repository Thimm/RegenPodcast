### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 19:57:36)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:48:**  Hello everyone and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:51:**  We're your hosts Etienne and Dimitri.  
**0:00:51-0:00:55:**  Today we have the pleasure of sharing with you a conversation with Steve Gabriel from  
**0:00:55-0:00:57:**  Wellspring Forest Farm.  
**0:00:57-0:01:01:**  Steve has written a great book that we really enjoyed and we highly recommend to you and  
**0:01:01-0:01:04:**  so we were super excited to have him on the podcast.  
**0:01:04-0:01:10:**  I really enjoyed this episode and Steve manages to situate silver pasture and trees in a broader  
**0:01:10-0:01:15:**  ecological understanding of the farm but he also gives us plenty of practical information  
**0:01:15-0:01:19:**  on how to go about planting out trees and managing animals.  
**0:01:19-0:01:26:**  So I think you'll come out with a really exciting overview of silver pasture but also full of  
**0:01:26-0:01:28:**  practical details to make it work on your land.  
**0:01:28-0:01:30:**  I really hope you enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:30-0:01:33:**  Hi Steve, welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:33-0:01:34:**  Thanks so good to be here with you all.  
**0:01:34-0:01:39:**  Yeah it's great to have you here and I'm sure we're gonna have a fascinating conversation.  
**0:01:39-0:01:44:**  Both of us read your book when it came out and really enjoyed it so we're very excited  
**0:01:44-0:01:45:**  to have you.  
**0:01:45-0:01:50:**  Maybe to start things off you could tell us a bit about yourself, how you got into agriculture  
**0:01:50-0:01:53:**  and how you got to start the farm you have at the moment.  
**0:01:53-0:01:58:**  Yeah I came to agriculture a couple ways.  
**0:01:58-0:02:05:**  My grandfather was a farmer in Illinois in the Midwest and so experienced a bit in my  
**0:02:05-0:02:11:**  family of sort of the post-World War II farming era.  
**0:02:11-0:02:17:**  My aunts and uncles all grew up on a farm and then promptly fled to get off the farm  
**0:02:17-0:02:18:**  and have better paying jobs.  
**0:02:18-0:02:23:**  My grandfather always loved farming and eventually got out of it too but always had a couple  
**0:02:23-0:02:31:**  acres of corn in his back field and kept bees and things like that and he was always just  
**0:02:31-0:02:35:**  someone I admired and liked hanging out with and I just liked riding the tractor with him.  
**0:02:35-0:02:46:**  So that was definitely an influence and then for me as I started to grow up I really recognized  
**0:02:46-0:02:51:**  my deep love for the forest and the woods and looked for a way to basically have a job  
**0:02:51-0:02:58:**  that allowed me to be outside as much as possible which started out as like studying recreation  
**0:02:58-0:03:02:**  and thinking I was going to be a river guide or something like that or take people out  
**0:03:02-0:03:10:**  into the woods but was really hit with the reality of the environmental crisis and as  
**0:03:10-0:03:16:**  I've learned the social crisis that really goes alongside that and realized I probably  
**0:03:16-0:03:23:**  couldn't spend my life just enjoying the woods but also needed to take an active part in  
**0:03:23-0:03:32:**  restoration and reclamation and trying to restore health in some way and so that led  
**0:03:32-0:03:41:**  me really down a path of starting at forestry school and then feeling a bit disillusioned  
**0:03:41-0:03:46:**  with the overwhelming focus on just timber as the only value expressed in our economy  
**0:03:46-0:03:57:**  for the forest and eventually started to find small little kernels of possibility.  
**0:03:57-0:04:01:**  For me producing maple syrup was one of the first things that captured my attention where  
**0:04:01-0:04:06:**  I saw something really interesting and cool that could be done in the woods that also  
**0:04:06-0:04:11:**  provided income and sustenance for folks and I grew up in a part of the world where that's  
**0:04:11-0:04:17:**  a really rich part of history and of relationship to land, the relationship to the changing  
**0:04:17-0:04:23:**  of the seasons and so I just loved the process and that was really the gateway for me teaching  
**0:04:23-0:04:30:**  youth about maple sugaring as a way to connect them to the natural world and from there we  
**0:04:30-0:04:36:**  thinned our sugar bush one year to support the trees there and had a bunch of logs and  
**0:04:36-0:04:43:**  happened to learn from a farmer nearby about growing shiitakes on logs and so it's just  
**0:04:43-0:04:48:**  kind of like crescendoed from there into different things realizing that the forest could be  
**0:04:48-0:04:56:**  a place that provides a lot of support for humans and also could be a way to store the  
**0:04:56-0:05:02:**  land and so yeah that's been the journey that was almost 20 years ago now and then it's  
**0:05:02-0:05:07:**  really been jumping in full and trying to figure out what that actually looks like and  
**0:05:07-0:05:15:**  realizing the dreamy idealized version when I first started is very different than the  
**0:05:15-0:05:21:**  practical day-to-day and the little details that are inevitably part of agroforestry and  
**0:05:21-0:05:23:**  forestry and land stewardship.  
**0:05:23-0:05:28:**  And could you tell us a bit more specifically about Wellspring Forest Farm, how you started  
**0:05:28-0:05:34:**  that and what kind of local context surrounds it?  
**0:05:34-0:05:40:**  Yeah, so we're in the Finger Lakes region of right pretty much in the middle of New  
**0:05:40-0:05:43:**  York State in the Northeast US.  
**0:05:43-0:05:51:**  It's a cold temperate climate, rather humid and we have four pretty distinct seasons usually.  
**0:05:51-0:05:59:**  It used to be pretty guaranteed that we'd start freezing up sometime in November, December  
**0:05:59-0:06:03:**  and the ground would stay frozen until you know March.  
**0:06:03-0:06:09:**  I used to tap trees in late February and early March and that was again almost 20 years ago  
**0:06:09-0:06:12:**  and now we tap sometimes in late January.  
**0:06:12-0:06:18:**  I think the earliest was even like January 10th or something and so just in my short  
**0:06:18-0:06:21:**  existence here things are definitely changing.  
**0:06:21-0:06:26:**  We can't count on the ground being frozen in the same way and that has a lot of implications  
**0:06:26-0:06:29:**  for ecosystem health.  
**0:06:29-0:06:34:**  Generally we're blessed with a really even spread of rainfall throughout the year but  
**0:06:34-0:06:35:**  that's also changing.  
**0:06:35-0:06:38:**  Our rain is now coming in more sporadic events.  
**0:06:38-0:06:43:**  We'll have short periodic droughts and when the rain comes it often comes in really heavy  
**0:06:43-0:06:45:**  events all at once.  
**0:06:45-0:06:53:**  So we're fortunate to have usually ample access to water as part of our systems.  
**0:06:53-0:07:00:**  This part of the world traditionally is forested land and then we could talk about the nuances  
**0:07:00-0:07:08:**  of that but the Haudenosaunee people or the Goi-Kono is the Kew-Gah nation who traditionally  
**0:07:08-0:07:14:**  stewarded these lands for thousands of years before colonization.  
**0:07:14-0:07:19:**  Change the landscape very much in agriculture and agroforestry mindset although they wouldn't  
**0:07:19-0:07:25:**  have called it that right because agroforestry used to just be called farming or land stewardship.  
**0:07:25-0:07:30:**  It's kind of recently we've had to name it as something separate but our farm is about  
**0:07:30-0:07:35:**  45 acres.  
**0:07:35-0:07:42:**  Some of it we have title to and some of it we release and we run a mixed small diversified  
**0:07:42-0:07:49:**  farm our main crop is mushrooms both outdoors and we do some indoor production as well.  
**0:07:49-0:07:56:**  We have our sheep and our ducks which we utilize a lot in civil pasture systems and we produce  
**0:07:56-0:08:02:**  maple syrup of course both on our land and some trees we lease up the road from us so  
**0:08:02-0:08:04:**  we have to haul sap every spring.  
**0:08:04-0:08:10:**  So our seasons are pretty dynamic and so we're in a time right now where it's the quietest  
**0:08:10-0:08:16:**  November and December but again you know starting the new year we'll be looking to the trees  
**0:08:16-0:08:20:**  to figure out when we need to tap in and maple for us really starts the whole season.  
**0:08:20-0:08:24:**  And in terms of local markets are you able to commercialize locally or do you have to  
**0:08:24-0:08:25:**  go a bit further?  
**0:08:25-0:08:32:**  So far we're in an area that's really supportive of small local farms and values that both  
**0:08:32-0:08:40:**  like direct customers as well as chefs and things like that in restaurants but we also  
**0:08:40-0:08:44:**  have a pretty pretty sizable tourism industry around here.  
**0:08:44-0:08:51:**  People visit these lakes and spend time around here and so yeah we mostly had not had a hard  
**0:08:51-0:08:58:**  time unloading our products pretty much off the farm or not too far from it.  
**0:08:58-0:09:02:**  And I know you mentioned mushrooms I mean there's so many things that you do that are  
**0:09:02-0:09:08:**  fascinating and you talk about these and also your first book if I'm if I'm correct Farming  
**0:09:08-0:09:15:**  the Woods but today we thought about maybe zooming in more into the silvopasture systems.  
**0:09:15-0:09:18:**  One of the reasons is that there's already actually a few podcasts that we listened to  
**0:09:18-0:09:22:**  before this one where you talk a bit more about mushroom cultivation and we'll make  
**0:09:22-0:09:26:**  sure we put some links so that our listeners can access that knowledge.  
**0:09:26-0:09:31:**  But yeah today looking a bit more specifically to silvopasture I was wondering if you could  
**0:09:31-0:09:36:**  give us a bit more detail of an overview maybe you know the number of animals you have and  
**0:09:36-0:09:43:**  the different plots of lands, a forest or pasture or you know mixed forest and pasture.  
**0:09:43-0:09:49:**  Yeah definitely and what I think is beautiful about silvopasture in general is the while  
**0:09:49-0:09:56:**  the mushrooms from a income standpoint make up the majority of of that aspect of our farm  
**0:09:56-0:10:03:**  the silvopasture is easily the system that impacts the acreage the most amount of land  
**0:10:03-0:10:09:**  so the mushrooms actually we grow on like less than a tenth of an acre but the silvopasture  
**0:10:09-0:10:15:**  is almost and eventually will be I think throughout the majority of the farm and and so I think  
**0:10:15-0:10:21:**  that's a really important aspect is that some agroforestry practices are very confined or  
**0:10:21-0:10:25:**  very specific to types of the land you know different types of landscape or different  
**0:10:25-0:10:31:**  types of ecosystem but the silvopasture really can fit in in almost any any open niche and  
**0:10:31-0:10:36:**  that's the way we've been thinking about it so so I think of the whole farm as a silvopasture  
**0:10:36-0:10:41:**  it's just in different stages of succession.  
**0:10:41-0:10:48:**  When we arrived and we started stewarding this piece of land around 2010 we brought  
**0:10:48-0:10:53:**  some mushroom logs here and started tapping trees and slowly worked into the silvopasture  
**0:10:53-0:11:00:**  the farm was pretty much 50 percent open pasture and 50 percent forest and and to me that really  
**0:11:00-0:11:06:**  speaks to the way modern agriculture has subdivided and and put these these different ecosystems  
**0:11:06-0:11:10:**  in boxes it's like the edge between the field and the forest could not be more dramatic  
**0:11:10-0:11:17:**  just one stops and the other starts you know and yeah the edges are only determined by  
**0:11:17-0:11:21:**  where the last person decided to turn their tractor when they were mowing or plowing or  
**0:11:21-0:11:26:**  whatever they were doing so it's it's just a bunch of boxes in our landscape and it's  
**0:11:26-0:11:32:**  a bunch of boxes with these harsh edges and that has nothing to do with the way again  
**0:11:32-0:11:38:**  in traditional indigenous people stewarded the land ship or the way nature creates really  
**0:11:38-0:11:45:**  dynamic edges between different ecosystems so for us our first attention was to to look  
**0:11:45-0:11:52:**  at those elements especially around water and hydrology and slope and try to ignore  
**0:11:52-0:11:57:**  what this sort of impact that had been placed on the landscape for decades and decades and  
**0:11:57-0:12:01:**  decades and really look at the landscape from a watershed perspective from a forest perspective  
**0:12:01-0:12:05:**  from an animal perspective from from something different and try to see different lines see  
**0:12:05-0:12:11:**  different boundaries and and then think about the silvopasture as one way to support the  
**0:12:11-0:12:15:**  restoration work so some of our silvopasture is creek restoration work also and some of  
**0:12:15-0:12:21:**  our silvopasture is forest management some of our silvopasture is planting trees in a  
**0:12:21-0:12:27:**  field to to break the wind to create a better microclimate for the grazing animals but it's  
**0:12:27-0:12:35:**  it's for us really important that it reflects what the land wants so to speak and so you  
**0:12:35-0:12:39:**  know before we impose an idea of what it looks like and I always like to say with silvopasture  
**0:12:39-0:12:45:**  a lot of pictures out there show these like grids of trees and I I there's there's appropriate  
**0:12:45-0:12:52:**  places for rows and and certainly patterns like that but there's so much opportunity  
**0:12:52-0:12:57:**  to integrate silvopasture in so many different patterns and so many different processes it  
**0:12:57-0:13:02:**  starts with what the land is is asking for I think and starts from that lens and then  
**0:13:02-0:13:10:**  we can blend that with our goals for for production so our main animal is is sheep we have in  
**0:13:10-0:13:18:**  our grazing season will run about 60 or 65 lambs and ewes together the breed we use is  
**0:13:18-0:13:25:**  called Katahdin and Katahdin is named after Mount Katahdin which is in the state of Maine  
**0:13:25-0:13:32:**  it's a sheep breed really interesting history took several English traditional English breeds  
**0:13:32-0:13:38:**  and crossed them with the St. Croix which is a Caribbean breed so it's a hare sheep  
**0:13:38-0:13:45:**  does not produce wool and we chose that intentionally and it's also a sheep that breed that really  
**0:13:45-0:13:52:**  tolerates pretty cold conditions as well as pretty hot conditions and is is really also  
**0:13:52-0:13:57:**  really resilient to parasites so it kind of seemed like a win-win-win oh yeah we found  
**0:13:57-0:14:03:**  them and and what we've also found since working with them on the landscape is they're phenomenal  
**0:14:03-0:14:11:**  browsers meaning they they prefer woody vegetation almost equally to pasture which is a huge  
**0:14:11-0:14:15:**  advantage when we're when we're focused on hopefully utilizing both of those types of  
**0:14:15-0:14:21:**  vegetation in the in the grazing plan so not all sheep are like that and of course not  
**0:14:21-0:14:25:**  all goats will graze some will just go off to the woody stuff so we really found a great  
**0:14:25-0:14:30:**  a great breed to work with we'll definitely come back to that because it's it's a really  
**0:14:30-0:14:35:**  fascinating aspect of silvopasture but before we we progress in the conversation I was wondering  
**0:14:35-0:14:40:**  if you can give us a description of the different ecosystems you have then because you know  
**0:14:40-0:14:45:**  you've mentioned that you have a diversity of of ecosystems on the farm and clearly you're  
**0:14:45-0:14:50:**  trying to really base your production on them sure yeah and we have if folks are interested  
**0:14:50-0:14:55:**  on our on our farm home page we have kind of a Google Earth tour that you can take and  
**0:14:55-0:15:00:**  actually see like videos of different parts of the farm which is something that I started  
**0:15:00-0:15:05:**  working on we do an online silvopasture class and I started sharing that as a way to snap  
**0:15:05-0:15:12:**  some video of different aspects of it but I would say like we don't have like amazingly  
**0:15:12-0:15:22:**  old like healthy forest most of the landscape was was really abandoned farmland but we exist  
**0:15:22-0:15:26:**  at the top of the watershed and it's a pretty high elevation relatively high elevation for  
**0:15:26-0:15:32:**  where we are a pretty windy site because of that and the ecosystems what we have is a  
**0:15:32-0:15:38:**  large pond in the in the middle of the farm it's about two and a half acres that a lot  
**0:15:38-0:15:46:**  of the water flows into and so there's sort of a vein of riparian area of a wetlands that  
**0:15:46-0:15:53:**  that then drains into a smaller seasonal creek or something that flows periodically and then  
**0:15:53-0:15:57:**  down into this pond and then we have another watershed that kind of sits just along one  
**0:15:57-0:16:02:**  of our boundaries of the property that as we learned actually harvests a lot of the  
**0:16:02-0:16:06:**  water from the whole hillside because of the way they chose on the roads to dig all the  
**0:16:06-0:16:11:**  ditches so a lot of the dishes empty right into this area and it can cause a lot of problems  
**0:16:11-0:16:17:**  during these heavy rain events so the bottom of our land we have a gully that's almost  
**0:16:17-0:16:22:**  six feet deep you can almost stand in it and be lost in it if you're short enough and we're  
**0:16:22-0:16:26:**  working to restore that but it's a product of these these heavy rain events that are  
**0:16:26-0:16:31:**  just eroding the heck out of the land so so we have kind of this water to watersheds flowing  
**0:16:31-0:16:36:**  through the land and then we have a lot of different little forest types this this farm  
**0:16:36-0:16:40:**  actually was an old nursery and so there's kind of interesting diversity in the tree  
**0:16:40-0:16:48:**  species but we have some nice forests dominated with eastern white pine and so more of a pine  
**0:16:48-0:16:55:**  area and some pine plantations as well that are areas we're really valuing for winter  
**0:16:55-0:16:59:**  winter livestock quarters for the sheep because they're nice and sheltered and on the drier  
**0:16:59-0:17:04:**  part of the land and we have a nice of course sugar maple stand which is probably our healthiest  
**0:17:04-0:17:09:**  stand of woods only about a couple acres of the land and then the rest is this mosaic  
**0:17:09-0:17:18:**  of what happens when farmers just stop clearing and so it's a mix of sort of native tree species  
**0:17:18-0:17:23:**  and so-called you know quote-unquote invasive species I don't like to use that word and  
**0:17:23-0:17:27:**  I actually really think there's value to some of the species that have shown up on the landscape  
**0:17:27-0:17:33:**  especially from a fodder livestock value but um we can talk about that more some of our  
**0:17:33-0:17:39:**  research looking at different species and what what kind of nutrition they really offer  
**0:17:39-0:17:40:**  to our livestock yeah.  
**0:17:40-0:17:46:**  One of the big topics that we wanted to to talk to you about today and one of the things  
**0:17:46-0:17:49:**  that also really inspired us when we were reading your book I actually have the copy  
**0:17:49-0:17:57:**  in front of me right now is when you mentioned that you're trying to incentivize a diversity  
**0:17:57-0:18:04:**  of different silvopastural systems and so we'd like to kind of unpack that a bit with  
**0:18:04-0:18:09:**  you and to understand you know the decisions why or why you're deciding to do this but  
**0:18:09-0:18:14:**  maybe it's worth before that to for you to explain to us you know these different you've  
**0:18:14-0:18:19:**  mentioned it already but maybe elaborate more or describe more these different silvopastural  
**0:18:19-0:18:22:**  systems that you've created on the farm yeah.  
**0:18:22-0:18:27:**  Yeah I mean I think again I think a lot of people first think of just a grid of trees  
**0:18:27-0:18:35:**  or evenly spaced rows or like an orchard you know spacing as as the way it can look but  
**0:18:35-0:18:39:**  I think what's important is that and this is also from the animal perspective like every  
**0:18:39-0:18:43:**  single paddock that we move our animals through we move our animals about once a day during  
**0:18:43-0:18:50:**  the grazing season and you know every time they move I feel like their experience should  
**0:18:50-0:18:55:**  be different than the last place they were and when I say experience I mean mostly what  
**0:18:55-0:19:00:**  they're eating and what they're finding to forage in the landscape and we try to frame  
**0:19:00-0:19:08:**  our grazing as and our our silvopasture as habitat creation I have a background in sort  
**0:19:08-0:19:14:**  of environmental restoration we talk all the time about wildlife habitat and the complexities  
**0:19:14-0:19:19:**  of that and that it wasn't just a uniform thing it needed lots of different faces to  
**0:19:19-0:19:23:**  to work and it's actually no different for domesticated livestock it's kind of a weird  
**0:19:23-0:19:29:**  thing that we haven't we don't talk about livestock and domestic animals in the same  
**0:19:29-0:19:33:**  way we do about wildlife but they have the same needs and and they can really benefit  
**0:19:33-0:19:38:**  from having different experiences as they move throughout the landscape and I don't  
**0:19:38-0:19:44:**  know if you come across a book the art and science of shepherding but it's actually  
**0:19:44-0:19:50:**  based on research done with herding groups in in France have you have you heard of that  
**0:19:50-0:19:54:**  book I've just ordered it actually okay all right you're right that you're housed in the  
**0:19:54-0:19:58:**  tree you're supposed to bring it to me I have it on my table and I didn't even read the  
**0:19:58-0:20:04:**  title you know what that's funny so we have heard of this book apparently Steve there  
**0:20:04-0:20:11:**  you go well well now it's on your your must read list so super Michael Muray and Fred  
**0:20:11-0:20:17:**  Provenza wrote that together and what they really do is they look at the ways traditional  
**0:20:17-0:20:23:**  French herding views the landscape and uses animals to to both manage it and and give  
**0:20:23-0:20:28:**  the animals like healthy sustenance and what I found what found was really compelling one  
**0:20:28-0:20:34:**  of the stories or certain narratives in that book is it's often seen that you know the  
**0:20:34-0:20:37:**  common folks think oh the the herders are just out there kind of like letting the sheep  
**0:20:37-0:20:41:**  roam and they go here they go there whatever it doesn't matter but in the book they draw  
**0:20:41-0:20:47:**  this parallel to actually that the herder is more like a chef crafting a meal for their  
**0:20:47-0:20:53:**  animals and actually thinks about the sequencing of different foods that the animal gets and  
**0:20:53-0:20:58:**  in that sequencing they find that the overall intake the amount of food the animal eats  
**0:20:58-0:21:04:**  and also the health of the animal are both increased as through that experience of eating  
**0:21:04-0:21:08:**  a little bit of high nitrogen clover maybe in the morning and then having a later meal  
**0:21:08-0:21:14:**  of grass later on and then moving to something that's really high and condensed tannins often  
**0:21:14-0:21:20:**  woody browse has some of the woody browse has high condensed tannins and that can help  
**0:21:20-0:21:26:**  slow the digestion down reduce the methane output and also reduce the parasite impacts  
**0:21:26-0:21:31:**  on on grazing ruminants so and it actually does matter their research shows it matters  
**0:21:31-0:21:36:**  which order those things happen in okay and so there's a lot of lessons in there to pull  
**0:21:36-0:21:40:**  from but the the take home if we come back to the farm and some of our silvopasture things  
**0:21:40-0:21:45:**  is we don't want every single paddock to look the same we want our silvopastures to all  
**0:21:45-0:21:51:**  be sort of different to a degree so there's a there's a continuum from really dense forests  
**0:21:51-0:21:57:**  to completely open pasture and and then there's a lot of in between about density of trees  
**0:21:57-0:22:04:**  types of tree spacing types of species so we're actually looking to not have the entire  
**0:22:04-0:22:10:**  farm in any one type but actually vary that throughout so some thick dense woods are really  
**0:22:10-0:22:16:**  great in the fall and winter for us those are sheltered areas that don't actually aren't  
**0:22:16-0:22:21:**  open enough to provide light to the forest floor and won't ever grow forages which is  
**0:22:21-0:22:25:**  good because in the fall and the winter we don't want our animals actually grazing because  
**0:22:25-0:22:29:**  there's nothing to eat it's not going to regenerate what we want them to do is is be comfortable  
**0:22:29-0:22:34:**  and and eat the hay that we give them right that's that's that time of year so those are  
**0:22:34-0:22:38:**  the sheltered areas and that's the most extreme most dense forest and then we have a lot of  
**0:22:38-0:22:43:**  space that we're cultivating in between opening up the canopy enough to get that light in  
**0:22:43-0:22:48:**  and establishing good forage in the understory and then there's going to be parts of the  
**0:22:48-0:22:51:**  farm where that are still open pasture which has its own advantages during different times  
**0:22:51-0:22:56:**  of the year if everything was covered in trees we would probably see a lull in the start  
**0:22:56-0:23:01:**  of the growing season because what happens in civil pasture often is in cold climates  
**0:23:01-0:23:08:**  is the the the grasses are slower to start as we go from you know late winter to early  
**0:23:08-0:23:13:**  spring but then they tend to catch up and actually do better in the hotter parts of  
**0:23:13-0:23:18:**  the season so we actually want some areas in open pasture and some areas in some tree  
**0:23:18-0:23:23:**  cover and some areas in dense tree cover and we find that that's matching up with our kind  
**0:23:23-0:23:28:**  of grazing patterns as we get a bit more sophisticated and learn you know a little more every single  
**0:23:28-0:23:34:**  year wow that's that's really interesting and so it's it's also a question of it's not  
**0:23:34-0:23:40:**  just a question of animal health and animal well-being but it's also a question of productivity  
**0:23:40-0:23:46:**  of food right so you can better balance the productivity of your land is that is that  
**0:23:46-0:23:51:**  is that correct yeah i think there i think that's the beauty of it is it all goes hand  
**0:23:51-0:23:56:**  in hand if you are able to have a grazing event on a certain piece of land at the optimal  
**0:23:56-0:24:02:**  time and then move the animals so that that land can rest and regenerate optimally you  
**0:24:02-0:24:07:**  can regraise that same area three or even four times in a season in this climate and  
**0:24:07-0:24:11:**  that's you know that's ideal because you're getting four times the productivity then if  
**0:24:11-0:24:14:**  you just put a big old fence around your whole land and let the animals just go wherever  
**0:24:14-0:24:20:**  they wanted to and that's that's where rotational grazing and silvopasture really you can't  
**0:24:20-0:24:25:**  separate those two you have to be integrating both and it also is relates to the the pressure  
**0:24:25-0:24:31:**  the animals can put on trees especially young trees when you're not moving them on and giving  
**0:24:31-0:24:39:**  the space a bit of a rest yeah well there's a lot of things to to unpack here but i'm  
**0:24:39-0:24:45:**  still still just to understand the the kind of the the impact of this type of diversity  
**0:24:45-0:24:50:**  that you're creating i guess that's also got a really important effect on the ecosystem  
**0:24:50-0:24:55:**  services that your land provides right with this diversity of ecosystem of ecosystems  
**0:24:55-0:25:01:**  you're also creating a diversity of habitat for biodiversity but also i can imagine it  
**0:25:01-0:25:08:**  goes beyond that right yeah i think i mean it's that's a harder thing to it's all hard  
**0:25:08-0:25:14:**  to kind of quantify and measure right uh well we we have a neighbor who lives on on the  
**0:25:14-0:25:21:**  same land as us that is an avid birder and i will say that um the both the number of  
**0:25:21-0:25:26:**  birds and also the species diversity that we've seen in the last 10 years since we've  
**0:25:26-0:25:31:**  we've started working on this landscape both thinning woods and also planting trees is  
**0:25:31-0:25:36:**  has really jumped remarkably and we see species that are really rare for the area and things  
**0:25:36-0:25:43:**  like that so so that's where we're you know seeing the farm is becoming more diverse over  
**0:25:43-0:25:49:**  time we can see that visually and and take a note of the species and things like that  
**0:25:49-0:25:53:**  i think some of the other kind of ways to measure that are harder too but i i think  
**0:25:53-0:25:58:**  that um it's a question we're always asking is what where's the intersection of what's  
**0:25:58-0:26:03:**  good for the the land what's good for our production and livestock goals and what's  
**0:26:03-0:26:08:**  good for wildlife or the larger picture and i think there's there's plenty of places to  
**0:26:08-0:26:13:**  find the intersection of all those things and do that work whenever we aren't quite  
**0:26:13-0:26:19:**  so sure then we we hold off and we think more we talk to others we research more that sort  
**0:26:19-0:26:27:**  of thing one of the the main questions that comes out of um you know understanding your  
**0:26:27-0:26:36:**  system is how do you manage with um the complexity of this diversity in the sense you know you've  
**0:26:36-0:26:39:**  got to move the the animals throughout this different these different sections it will  
**0:26:39-0:26:45:**  mean different you know types of management different maybe um fencing i'm not too sure  
**0:26:45-0:26:51:**  but how do you manage the the the complexity that this diversity creates when you're comparing  
**0:26:51-0:26:56:**  it for example to another silver pasture system where it's just you know rows 15 meters apart  
**0:26:56-0:27:00:**  of trees with pasture in between on 40 acres and you know you're just it's just kind of  
**0:27:00-0:27:06:**  simple and standard um and you know we can understand now that comes with certain it  
**0:27:06-0:27:11:**  would come with certain not disadvantages but less advantages that this system brings  
**0:27:11-0:27:16:**  but maybe in terms of you know efficiency of movement or management it might be more  
**0:27:16-0:27:20:**  interesting so i'm curious to know what you what you have to to say about you know the  
**0:27:20-0:27:27:**  complexity of of this type of systems yeah that's a really important question and um  
**0:27:27-0:27:32:**  can can really arrest someone from getting started because it can feel really overwhelming  
**0:27:32-0:27:38:**  so when i work with folks i i often encourage them to reflect on their own goals and and  
**0:27:38-0:27:42:**  what kind of layers of complexity they're comfortable with because i think it's it's  
**0:27:42-0:27:48:**  a personal decision actually um so i like to walk the land almost every day and i like  
**0:27:48-0:27:52:**  to observe and i know a lot of tree species and i'm just constant curious and i can think  
**0:27:52-0:27:57:**  about a lot of different little parts of the land simultaneously but i know for other people  
**0:27:57-0:28:02:**  that would be that would be too much so i think you have to find where you fall on that  
**0:28:02-0:28:08:**  gradient and how much you want to you know nerd out about it and and and integrate it  
**0:28:08-0:28:15:**  into your life um and i always encourage people to start with a smaller area and it's an area  
**0:28:15-0:28:19:**  of the land that they can as they're thinking about how to design a silvopasture that they  
**0:28:19-0:28:26:**  can both visit routinely and also walk through like entirely so not just walk around you  
**0:28:26-0:28:31:**  know the outside of some dense thicket of brush but actually what's the area i can get  
**0:28:31-0:28:37:**  into and observe and take some time to think about and for some people that might be a  
**0:28:37-0:28:43:**  much smaller space than for others right so that's one thing is kind of biting off smaller  
**0:28:43-0:28:49:**  chunks and considering who you are and how that how you relate to that um diversity is  
**0:28:49-0:28:55:**  important on a site level and it's important at different scales for different things but  
**0:28:55-0:29:01:**  one of the errors we made early on was when we were planting trees is we would plant a  
**0:29:01-0:29:06:**  row of trees and in that row we might have five or six different species of trees that  
**0:29:06-0:29:10:**  we would you know alternate between you know every other tree or every few trees would  
**0:29:10-0:29:15:**  be a different species and that's incredibly hard to manage because those trees are probably  
**0:29:15-0:29:19:**  all growing at different rates they have different needs for pruning different needs for all  
**0:29:19-0:29:24:**  sorts of things and and one of the things we realized early on is we we want to grow  
**0:29:24-0:29:28:**  trees but we also want to grow them fast enough so that the animals can can start interacting  
**0:29:28-0:29:35:**  with them and so if you have you know even two two species and one grows twice as fast  
**0:29:35-0:29:39:**  as the other well you have to wait for the slowest one to be ready for animal interaction  
**0:29:39-0:29:45:**  before the other ones can be opened up to it so so we actually plant our rows in monocultures  
**0:29:45-0:29:49:**  and meaning that a single row for a paddock we might just do in one species but then the  
**0:29:49-0:29:54:**  next row might be a different species so diversity is not within the row but it's within the  
**0:29:54-0:30:00:**  field or within the paddock if that makes sense and then we do have pat we do have uniform  
**0:30:00-0:30:04:**  patterns throughout the landscape we look for patterns to create you know paddocks that  
**0:30:04-0:30:10:**  are roughly the same size and then we plant trees on the edges of those paddocks so we  
**0:30:10-0:30:16:**  don't want to create all these wonky shapes and you know different sizes and things that  
**0:30:16-0:30:21:**  we have to work around so you know uniformity and and straight lines and rows have their  
**0:30:21-0:30:26:**  place but I think overall if we look and zoom out at the site we see something that from  
**0:30:26-0:30:32:**  a species level from a pattern level it has that diversity and so I think there's just  
**0:30:32-0:30:38:**  finding that balance between things that's important since you talk about planting trees  
**0:30:38-0:30:43:**  and some of the considerations that come with it maybe you could tell us what trees you've  
**0:30:43-0:30:49:**  planted following what patterns so that we get an idea of that aspect of your operation  
**0:30:49-0:30:56:**  we started with a lot more a lot a much longer list of species than then we plant now and  
**0:30:56-0:31:02:**  I think that's important so we did some test plantings early on to see what what the site  
**0:31:02-0:31:11:**  seemed to respond to well and we kind of picked a wide range of species we thought were good  
**0:31:11-0:31:15:**  and then and then saw what they did in the landscape and also kind of refined our own  
**0:31:15-0:31:24:**  goals over time these days we're focused on a smaller set of trees that are that we know  
**0:31:24-0:31:32:**  have good fodder value for the animals that grow well on our site that we can easily propagate  
**0:31:32-0:31:36:**  very inexpensively I think a thing sometimes you don't realize if you really want to plant  
**0:31:36-0:31:43:**  trees extensively on your farm probably a farm nursery is going to be part of your essential  
**0:31:43-0:31:48:**  farm infrastructure because it's it's not feasible for most of us to keep buying in  
**0:31:48-0:31:55:**  our tree stock year after year and so propagating some of the easier species that fit well on  
**0:31:55-0:32:00:**  your site is a really good way to to go from seedlings that could cost several dollars  
**0:32:00-0:32:07:**  apiece to you know several cents apiece or something like that and so we've really we've  
**0:32:07-0:32:12:**  really refined that list down and part of it was researching for the book and really  
**0:32:12-0:32:18:**  thinking about which species had had that promise and and for me it's also which species  
**0:32:18-0:32:23:**  that we can plant and give a little attention to in the first years and then and then they're  
**0:32:23-0:32:29:**  kind of good if you plant 50 acres of fruit trees you have a lot of management on your  
**0:32:29-0:32:36:**  hands for a long time and that's great if you want to do it but we only have I think  
**0:32:36-0:32:40:**  a half acre in in fruit and nut trees right now and that's still hard for us to keep up  
**0:32:40-0:32:46:**  with so if we want to plant our farm with trees we got to pick trees that are really  
**0:32:46-0:32:51:**  adaptive to the environment and and very resilient and can kind of take care of themselves and  
**0:32:51-0:32:56:**  so we've kind of like really and these are great species I was interested in the book  
**0:32:56-0:33:00:**  too like what species work in other parts of the world other climates what are what  
**0:33:00-0:33:04:**  are templates because I'm really interested in seeing silvopasture not just happen in  
**0:33:04-0:33:09:**  little micro pockets around but like what would it look like to really roll it out broad  
**0:33:09-0:33:13:**  scale and I think one of the things is let's keep it simple let's just get a lot of trees  
**0:33:13-0:33:19:**  in the ground quickly that can grow and so in my research I really found that globally  
**0:33:19-0:33:24:**  in many climates mostly I'm thinking still you know temperate climates was the focus  
**0:33:24-0:33:30:**  of the book and things like that but we find these species that just do incredibly well  
**0:33:30-0:33:34:**  at all sorts of different elevations all sorts of different rainfall regimes all sorts of  
**0:33:34-0:33:40:**  different patterns and poplar and willow just kept coming up to the top is like really good  
**0:33:40-0:33:44:**  places to start and probably one of the reasons is because you can take a cutting of that  
**0:33:44-0:33:50:**  those trees stick in the ground it'll basically grow another tree yeah if we could do that  
**0:33:50-0:33:54:**  with more trees we would agroforestry wouldn't be such a such a niche thing right it'd be  
**0:33:54-0:34:02:**  much more common I agree so so those are great and they're easy they provide a lot of nutritional  
**0:34:02-0:34:07:**  benefits to livestock if you wanted to think about feeding them out they provide a lot  
**0:34:07-0:34:16:**  of benefits to water areas and riparian plantings and they can produce a lot of biomass whether  
**0:34:16-0:34:21:**  that's beneficial for the site or I went to a farm in Canada during an agroforestry conference  
**0:34:21-0:34:29:**  where they were using willow as a power source for the farm as their electricity source so  
**0:34:29-0:34:32:**  they're growing it on the edges of the fields and then using that to power the farm you  
**0:34:32-0:34:37:**  know so there's lots of different ways it can be integrated into other systems so those  
**0:34:37-0:34:43:**  are great foundations and actually in New Zealand which is a great place to look for  
**0:34:43-0:34:49:**  for established you know institutional and government supported grass grazing systems  
**0:34:49-0:34:55:**  New Zealand is certainly far ahead of many other places in the world there's been active  
**0:34:55-0:35:00:**  research and promotion of willow and poplar as part of grazing systems for a long time  
**0:35:00-0:35:04:**  there okay so I think there's good promise there the other pieces I think we need to  
**0:35:04-0:35:13:**  add are trees that have really dense nutrient composition probably globally in the temperate  
**0:35:13-0:35:20:**  climate the most commonly used one would be mulberry and it's one of the highest sources  
**0:35:20-0:35:24:**  of protein and nutrients that actually is digestible by even animals that just have  
**0:35:24-0:35:31:**  one stomach like pigs and and poultry this is a tree that's being used in China as a  
**0:35:31-0:35:36:**  pig feed source they'll actually harvest the leaf material and pelletize it and feed it  
**0:35:36-0:35:42:**  as a pig feed and then for us the other one that's really key is our trees that fix nitrogen  
**0:35:42-0:35:49:**  and and so they're therefore very fast growing and also are helping rebuild soil health so  
**0:35:49-0:35:59:**  our go-to in this climate is black locust because it not only fixes nitrogen it also  
**0:35:59-0:36:04:**  is it produces an incredibly rot resistant wood and so that's really valuable for a lot  
**0:36:04-0:36:10:**  of you know other projects around the farm and have you planted all of these then on  
**0:36:10-0:36:18:**  your farm or have you chosen only a few so we were focused on on those those mainly those  
**0:36:18-0:36:22:**  species like I say we have some orchards we have different things going on but but when  
**0:36:22-0:36:25:**  we look at the broad acre part of the farm that's those are the main ones that we're  
**0:36:25-0:36:33:**  focusing on at this point yeah and I'm thinking you know what led you to to want to include  
**0:36:33-0:36:38:**  trees in pasture because arguably you could say well I have kind of forest areas where  
**0:36:38-0:36:43:**  I'm gonna rotate my animals and utilize that space manage them with animals and then I  
**0:36:43-0:36:47:**  have my open pasture which I keep as a different ecosystem but clearly you felt the need to  
**0:36:47-0:36:52:**  have a you know bringing in trees into open pasture could you explain us a bit the the  
**0:36:52-0:36:57:**  reasoning and maybe when is it a good idea and maybe when when maybe we should be cautious  
**0:36:57-0:37:05:**  of that sure yeah I mean I couple things one is a real interest in in the carbon sequestration  
**0:37:05-0:37:11:**  efforts that that we all need to be engaging with so when we're thinning the woods we're  
**0:37:11-0:37:15:**  not necessarily in the short term like storing carbon we're often releasing carbon right  
**0:37:15-0:37:20:**  but when we're planting trees and fields we're actively engaging with carbon sequestration  
**0:37:20-0:37:27:**  and that when we talk about the climate benefits of civil pasture it is exclusively talking  
**0:37:27-0:37:33:**  about trees in pasture that is where there's a lot of promise for having productive farm  
**0:37:33-0:37:40:**  systems and sequestering carbon and and those fast growing tree species and shrub species  
**0:37:40-0:37:45:**  that have really dense fibrous root systems so some of the ones I mentioned there's others  
**0:37:45-0:37:49:**  hazelnut is a good example of a shrub species that's incredibly fast growing has very dense  
**0:37:49-0:37:53:**  root systems these are these are really the powerhouses of carbon sequestration and so  
**0:37:53-0:38:00:**  that's an important goal for our farm the shade and shelter value to our animals so  
**0:38:00-0:38:05:**  in the in the hotter months they want to be under shelter they want access to shade they  
**0:38:05-0:38:13:**  don't want to just be an open sun we find really good value in having pretty widely  
**0:38:13-0:38:19:**  spaced you know 20 meters 60 feet or so rows of trees that they can access in their paddocks  
**0:38:19-0:38:24:**  and benefit from some periodic shade throughout the day and also I've mentioned our farms  
**0:38:24-0:38:30:**  pretty windy so they get some benefit for shelter from the wind and then the other thing  
**0:38:30-0:38:35:**  that I am digging into more and have a lot of questions about what we know is is true  
**0:38:35-0:38:42:**  is when we bring trees into pasture we are increasing the fungal presence in the soil  
**0:38:42-0:38:49:**  of the pasture so open pastures grasslands tend to be bacteria dominated soils when we  
**0:38:49-0:38:55:**  add trees we bring a fungal presence there and that's not only good for soil health for  
**0:38:55-0:39:01:**  cycling of nutrients and water but also again for carbon sequestration and the newest science  
**0:39:01-0:39:05:**  is really showing that where carbon lives in tree based systems is actually a lot in  
**0:39:05-0:39:10:**  mycorrhizal fungal networks it's not it's definitely in the trees of course it's definitely  
**0:39:10-0:39:13:**  in the root systems but a lot of it's being cycled and held long term in fungal networks  
**0:39:13-0:39:19:**  and so I think that's a really important aspect long term is to see our soils which have been  
**0:39:19-0:39:26:**  often cleared and stripped that fungal presence is greatly diminished and so we want to be  
**0:39:26-0:39:30:**  active in bringing that back and I think there's just there's no there's no way that doesn't  
**0:39:30-0:39:35:**  help every aspect of the farm big and small.  
**0:39:35-0:39:40:**  I'd like to get a better idea of when you are planting into the pasture what kind of  
**0:39:40-0:39:46:**  spacing you've chosen in between the lines even you know how dense do you plant the trees  
**0:39:46-0:39:51:**  on the line and what kind of or if you don't plant in lines what kind of pattern do you  
**0:39:51-0:39:56:**  use would it be possible to get a brief overview because I imagine the full answer is very  
**0:39:56-0:40:01:**  complex but would be great to have a brief overview of how that works and the kind of  
**0:40:01-0:40:06:**  the decision making process that you that you choose.  
**0:40:06-0:40:15:**  Our approach is kind of different with each area and like I say we often think about the  
**0:40:15-0:40:21:**  intersection between the land needs and our grazing system and how that can be efficient  
**0:40:21-0:40:26:**  so sometimes we'll think more about planting trees on straight rows and grids sort of a  
**0:40:26-0:40:31:**  good pattern and sometimes the contour of the land provides us a really good template  
**0:40:31-0:40:37:**  to map our trees off of so we might pick a contour line and then do parallel rows from  
**0:40:37-0:40:49:**  that line which is something we did at least initially early on and I think that we learned  
**0:40:49-0:40:53:**  the hard way if you start planting trees you should accept that many trees will probably  
**0:40:53-0:40:59:**  die in the process both because that's what trees do and because you're learning and that's  
**0:40:59-0:41:02:**  okay.  
**0:41:02-0:41:10:**  Mother nature plants you know per acre draws upon a hundred thousand seeds from falling  
**0:41:10-0:41:15:**  from the sky being blown in coming up from the soil animals bringing them in a hundred  
**0:41:15-0:41:21:**  thousand seeds per acre to produce a finished forest of a hundred to two hundred trees so  
**0:41:21-0:41:27:**  there's great there's a lot of trees that start and don't live to be you know in this  
**0:41:27-0:41:33:**  climate sometimes they could live 300, 400 years old right but most of the trees don't  
**0:41:33-0:41:38:**  live that long and so that's important to understand is when we plant a seedling it's  
**0:41:38-0:41:45:**  one of those hundred thousand seeds they may not all make it and so we try to mimic what  
**0:41:45-0:41:51:**  mother nature does which is to plant really densely and then thin so our rows of trees  
**0:41:51-0:42:00:**  tend to be where we'll plant trees as close as a meter three feet apart and no greater  
**0:42:00-0:42:08:**  than two meters or six feet apart so we really want to plant them densely and the only exception  
**0:42:08-0:42:16:**  to that would be if I have like a really nice you know grafted tree that has a lot of extra  
**0:42:16-0:42:20:**  value to it right a lot of selection a lot of thought and care gone into it I'm going  
**0:42:20-0:42:24:**  to give that more space and and baby it a bit more but I'm talking about planting on  
**0:42:24-0:42:31:**  a broader scale with seedlings and so that's what we often think about and then we tried  
**0:42:31-0:42:36:**  early on pretty rows that were often very close together we found over time that sheep  
**0:42:36-0:42:44:**  it should be at least 60 feet or I guess 20 meters between rows to effectively have a  
**0:42:44-0:42:53:**  good grazing lane and I think it would probably be up to double that with for for cattle and  
**0:42:53-0:42:58:**  things like that so we really want to start with wider alleys and then we can always fill  
**0:42:58-0:43:03:**  them in so if you imagine starting with two wide alleys on either side of a grazing paddock  
**0:43:03-0:43:06:**  if those trees grow up and the animals can then interact with them well then you can  
**0:43:06-0:43:11:**  shift where your paddocks are your fence lines and you could plant you know a next set of  
**0:43:11-0:43:17:**  rows in between those ones that are established and so if you wanted to have a denser planting  
**0:43:17-0:43:22:**  long term that might be a good idea another key factor is to think about the fencing and  
**0:43:22-0:43:26:**  protection of trees is always going to be cheaper when you when you do it to groups  
**0:43:26-0:43:33:**  of trees versus individual ones so whether you do rows or you plant in clusters it's  
**0:43:33-0:43:38:**  better to think about fencing and protection in in a in a group sense than an individual  
**0:43:38-0:43:44:**  tree sense because it just becomes really cost prohibitive and difficult to work around  
**0:43:44-0:43:49:**  you know individual trees so not always the case but in general if you're thinking about  
**0:43:49-0:43:54:**  how am I going to do this on a lot of a lot of land I think those things are going to  
**0:43:54-0:43:58:**  help make it you know a much more efficient process and much more likely to succeed.  
**0:43:58-0:44:03:**  Could you tell us a bit more about the difference between planting in lines and in clusters  
**0:44:03-0:44:08:**  and the kind of advantages and disadvantages associated to each?  
**0:44:08-0:44:13:**  It depends a bit on the species of the tree so some trees you know we see out in the natural  
**0:44:13-0:44:19:**  world they grow in thickets and that's how they prefer like you know poplar stands actually  
**0:44:19-0:44:24:**  genetically or sometimes all the same same species they've they've grown from root suckers  
**0:44:24-0:44:31:**  and it can be just literally one one genetic parent that's that produces all this offspring  
**0:44:31-0:44:34:**  and so they want that kind of habitat and that kind of environment so that can kind  
**0:44:34-0:44:45:**  of make sense in some contexts. I think that there's again the the patterning of of clusters  
**0:44:45-0:44:50:**  or rows or individual trees is a bit about the tree and a bit about the landscape and  
**0:44:50-0:44:55:**  a bit about how you want to manage it all at once so there's never one that's that's  
**0:44:55-0:45:00:**  the best there's there's a combination of those things that's the best for the specific  
**0:45:00-0:45:13:**  place and at a specific time I'd say too. So we found that for instance we were often  
**0:45:13-0:45:19:**  doing cluster planting in some of the wetland and riparian areas and that's sometimes because  
**0:45:19-0:45:23:**  the animals actually aren't engaging with those areas as much and the wildlife can have  
**0:45:23-0:45:27:**  more of an impact and so it's easy to kind of fence them out and leave them be. The areas  
**0:45:27-0:45:32:**  that we're grazing more frequently which would be the open fields that we've established  
**0:45:32-0:45:38:**  trees we find that rows tend to be a bit more easy to manage and we're just using our existing  
**0:45:38-0:45:44:**  portable fence to also keep our livestock off the trees at the same time so we're not  
**0:45:44-0:45:50:**  having two fencing systems or anything like that.  
**0:45:50-0:45:56:**  Do you usually use portable fence to exclude the trees from the animals or how do you kind  
**0:45:56-0:46:00:**  of deal with these first few years where you don't want animals interacting with those  
**0:46:00-0:46:05:**  young trees? Yeah I mean basically we don't have any we don't have any permanent fence  
**0:46:05-0:46:09:**  we haven't had any permanent fence I should say until this year. We're finally putting  
**0:46:09-0:46:17:**  some permanent fence in our our winter paddock area but we didn't have that luxury when we  
**0:46:17-0:46:22:**  got to the farm sometimes you get a farm that has fencing and actually that was kind of  
**0:46:22-0:46:28:**  nice because we weren't beholden to that decision and we were able to tuck the animals in a  
**0:46:28-0:46:33:**  lot of kind of edges and areas that if we had a permanent fence perimeter fence that  
**0:46:33-0:46:37:**  probably would have been excluded because often those permanent fences you know keep  
**0:46:37-0:46:41:**  the woods out and keep the animals in the in the pasture so we were able to play a lot  
**0:46:41-0:46:47:**  with shapes and size and and patterns like that which was nice and we use a lot of the  
**0:46:47-0:46:54:**  just just foldable you know net fencing works great for sheep and it's slow when you start  
**0:46:54-0:46:58:**  but once you get the hang of it I think it's a pretty efficient way to go we do some of  
**0:46:58-0:47:05:**  that we also do you know a triple run of the single strand poly wire we'll run that in  
**0:47:05-0:47:11:**  between so often what we'll do is we'll use the net fencing as a perimeter and then we'll  
**0:47:11-0:47:16:**  subdivide paddocks with the with you know usually three strands of poly wire because  
**0:47:16-0:47:21:**  that's a bit quicker to put up and then we can have an area where they're grazing there  
**0:47:21-0:47:25:**  for seven to ten days in moving through different smaller paddocks and then we can move the  
**0:47:25-0:47:31:**  whole the whole bit somewhere else on the land so it works pretty well just a quick  
**0:47:31-0:47:36:**  question here it might be a bit of a rookie question but why not use the three strand  
**0:47:36-0:47:42:**  wire for all around is it not safe enough for the whole I mean for the whole fencing  
**0:47:42-0:47:48:**  infrastructure yeah yeah yeah for sheep right in this context the the I worked with cattle  
**0:47:48-0:47:52:**  for many years before we got sheep and the one thing I miss is that you could keep them  
**0:47:52-0:47:56:**  in sometimes with just a single strand of poly wire if they were trained to it it's  
**0:47:56-0:48:03:**  beautiful you almost didn't need anything the sheep are a bit more you know temperamental  
**0:48:03-0:48:06:**  of course you could have goats and pigs which it feels like they get up in the morning with  
**0:48:06-0:48:14:**  the goal of getting out of whatever fence but the sheep I would say so lambing is a  
**0:48:14-0:48:21:**  factor we have our lambs running with our ewes and they'll get underneath you know if  
**0:48:21-0:48:24:**  there's not enough strands that aren't hot enough they'll get underneath and start causing  
**0:48:24-0:48:30:**  trouble the ram lambs in particular like to try to go under and over and just have a have  
**0:48:30-0:48:36:**  a good time they're a bit more rambunctious yeah I would say it's mostly it's mostly that  
**0:48:36-0:48:43:**  factor is that you know fencing is potentially both a psychological and a physical barrier  
**0:48:43-0:48:48:**  but the net fencing provides a bit more of a physical barrier as well as is electrified  
**0:48:48-0:48:54:**  versus I feel like the strand is really more psychological okay because even you know our  
**0:48:54-0:48:58:**  we have older ewes that you know if we don't if we don't move them at the right time they're  
**0:48:58-0:49:04:**  sheep are fully most sheep breeds are willing to go along with your grazing plan until you  
**0:49:04-0:49:09:**  don't move them soon enough and when they're ready you know they'll start making troubling  
**0:49:09-0:49:13:**  decisions about you know breaching the fence they'll start deciding when to move or when  
**0:49:13-0:49:19:**  not to yeah they know the grazing plan better than you do yeah so a big rookie mistake we  
**0:49:19-0:49:24:**  made was we used to have just enough fencing for maybe one or two paddocks at a time and  
**0:49:24-0:49:29:**  we weren't you know we're not we're not on the farm full time we have other jobs supporting  
**0:49:29-0:49:33:**  us as well so you know we weren't always able to set them up at the right time during the  
**0:49:33-0:49:37:**  week and so we'd have all this kind of we weren't able to move them when the grass was  
**0:49:37-0:49:41:**  telling us it was time to move or when the sheep were because we'd had to set up the  
**0:49:41-0:49:46:**  fence so the take home was we now have enough fence for four to five paddocks at a time  
**0:49:46-0:49:49:**  and we'll set that up all at the beginning of the week and we pretty much have a week's  
**0:49:49-0:49:54:**  worth of paddocks ready to go so that we're moving the animals when they're ready or the  
**0:49:54-0:49:59:**  grass is ready or both rather than when we have time to do it that makes a lot of sense  
**0:49:59-0:50:07:**  taking a step back to the you know design and implementation of these different of these  
**0:50:07-0:50:13:**  systems of the tree systems on pasture there's something quite tempting when you start integrating  
**0:50:13-0:50:18:**  elements to integrate many different elements by that I mean instead of integrating just  
**0:50:18-0:50:24:**  you know a fodder tree as you mentioned like a willow into a pasture there's a temptation  
**0:50:24-0:50:30:**  to include a tree that can be or different trees that can also produce nuts that can  
**0:50:30-0:50:38:**  also produce wood and that can be pollarded for fodder and for firewood for chips you  
**0:50:38-0:50:41:**  know there's kind of this temptations when you this temptation when you get into these  
**0:50:41-0:50:47:**  systems to over over integrate if I can call it this and I'd like to know about your take  
**0:50:47-0:50:55:**  on this when is it worth to add many different yields to a pasture and when not what are  
**0:50:55-0:51:02:**  the limits of this kind of thinking yeah I think well I mentioned early on we we planted  
**0:51:02-0:51:07:**  a lot of different species and I don't I feel like there's this there's this thing that  
**0:51:07-0:51:12:**  afflicts a lot of us in agroforestry which is that in the winter we get these catalogs  
**0:51:12-0:51:17:**  of trees and we start thinking about what we could possibly do in the coming season  
**0:51:17-0:51:23:**  catalogs come in and it's very easy to add this and 25 of this to the shopping cart right  
**0:51:23-0:51:28:**  and and then you you pay for it and then you forget about it and suddenly in the spring  
**0:51:28-0:51:31:**  you've got this boatload of trees coming and you don't even know where you're gonna put  
**0:51:31-0:51:40:**  them right that's like something we've done so many times and so what I would say is one  
**0:51:40-0:51:46:**  way to temper that is to ask yourself the question you know how many species can I get  
**0:51:46-0:51:55:**  to know in a season as intimately as I might get to know a good friend so not just knowing  
**0:51:55-0:52:01:**  their name or or or where they might like to be planted but like what's their root structure  
**0:52:01-0:52:05:**  like what's their branching structure do they need to be pruned in the first year when do  
**0:52:05-0:52:12:**  they flower when do they set seed you know what what insect and pest pressure might they  
**0:52:12-0:52:18:**  they experience all sorts of different things right so it's not just knowing a couple things  
**0:52:18-0:52:22:**  but really getting to know a few species at a time I think is one of the things I wish  
**0:52:22-0:52:29:**  I had done earlier is take the time to do that and so you know it's okay to start with  
**0:52:29-0:52:35:**  a couple and then add on as you as you go and in the same way with the yields it's beautiful  
**0:52:35-0:52:39:**  in your mind conceptually and again I think this happens a lot in the winter we think  
**0:52:39-0:52:45:**  and we dream about all the possibilities of what we could do and then it comes to when  
**0:52:45-0:52:50:**  we actually are on the ground what can we do what what do we actually with all the realities  
**0:52:50-0:52:56:**  and the constraints of of life and and the ecosystem like what are we actually doing  
**0:52:56-0:53:01:**  and I don't visit successful farms that have you know a hundred different products what  
**0:53:01-0:53:05:**  people tend to do over time is they try a bunch of stuff and then they refine it down  
**0:53:05-0:53:11:**  to just a handful of things that actually work well for them like oh my body likes doing  
**0:53:11-0:53:16:**  this thing you may think you want to grow a bunch of wood for chipping let's say but  
**0:53:16-0:53:25:**  if you work behind a wood chipper for one day I know that I I now exclusively trade  
**0:53:25-0:53:29:**  usually with a local arborist to just deliver us wood chips because I'm I don't want to  
**0:53:29-0:53:32:**  stand behind a wood chipper all day I have no desire to do that we've done that on like  
**0:53:32-0:53:38:**  you know tens of days and and and grease on Massey farm like chipping olive pruning has  
**0:53:38-0:53:42:**  been like this crazy task so I totally get what you're saying like end up with this cute  
**0:53:42-0:53:46:**  little pile right and you're like oh that's like I worked for four hours and I think I  
**0:53:46-0:53:54:**  can mow so it's important to think about and learn because in your mind you can imagine  
**0:53:54-0:53:58:**  this is all going to be great but you know what do you actually want to do with your  
**0:53:58-0:54:04:**  time what does it look like and and I think less is more I think starting with a few things  
**0:54:04-0:54:09:**  and building upon that is really important so if I add an element to my farm how is it  
**0:54:09-0:54:15:**  connected to the other elements not adding something that's completely separate completely  
**0:54:15-0:54:20:**  out of out of you know some other other space is going to require other equipment and other  
**0:54:20-0:54:26:**  expertise and things like that so for us back to the silver pasture when we really thought  
**0:54:26-0:54:30:**  about all the cool things that silver pasture could offer what we decided was most important  
**0:54:30-0:54:36:**  for us was planting trees for shade shelter and fodder for animals that's what we're interested  
**0:54:36-0:54:42:**  in from the livestock perspective and then we wanted to see those trees for the environment  
**0:54:42-0:54:51:**  sequester carbon and and restore good habitat for wildlife so that's already a lot of things  
**0:54:51-0:54:54:**  but it's a lot less than saying yeah I want all the benefits and all the possible things  
**0:54:54-0:54:58:**  so none of our trees we're not growing fence posts we're not growing stuff for wood chip  
**0:54:58-0:55:04:**  material we're not trying to also produce a large crop of tree you know tree nuts or  
**0:55:04-0:55:09:**  fruit or something like that so that's what we decided for us and the scent the silver  
**0:55:09-0:55:14:**  pasture is centered around supporting the sheep and the health of the sheep both nutritionally  
**0:55:14-0:55:21:**  and sort of medicinally I have a friend up the road who has an apple cider orchard and  
**0:55:21-0:55:25:**  he has sheep and he also has geese and he has a much smaller group of sheep than us  
**0:55:25-0:55:31:**  he has we have you know like I said 60-65 he runs about six or eight and he has a flock  
**0:55:31-0:55:37:**  of 15 geese and the reason he has those numbers is not because he's trying to run a profitable  
**0:55:37-0:55:44:**  livestock enterprise he's actually trying to run a healthy orchard and if he had 65  
**0:55:44-0:55:48:**  sheep he would be driving himself crazy trying to feed them all summer and what he wants  
**0:55:48-0:55:53:**  to do is take care of his apples so he has the sheep there to support his tree crop system  
**0:55:53-0:55:57:**  right and I think that's a really important distinction I think that if you want to go  
**0:55:57-0:56:05:**  into a tree crop system you can have livestock but probably at much smaller numbers and density  
**0:56:05-0:56:10:**  than if you want to have a livestock system because I don't think the numbers often match  
**0:56:10-0:56:17:**  up so we did a grant project where we actually looked at raising ducks in our in our shiitake  
**0:56:17-0:56:24:**  yard to reduce the slug damage we were experiencing and our proposal was oh this will be great  
**0:56:24-0:56:31:**  we'll have ducks we can reduce slug damage and we can also raise a meat duck but after  
**0:56:31-0:56:36:**  doing that for two years we crunched the numbers and we realized that for slug protection we  
**0:56:36-0:56:40:**  actually only needed about 20 ducks but to run a good meat enterprise we needed to raise  
**0:56:40-0:56:47:**  at least 300 a year yeah and 300 ducks in the woods does a lot of damage actually to  
**0:56:47-0:56:52:**  the to the leaf cover on the forest floor so it's actually not a positive effect on  
**0:56:52-0:57:00:**  the ecosystem right so so I just like to offer those because the number of animals the density  
**0:57:00-0:57:04:**  and all the different types of crops people often want to marry they don't always match  
**0:57:04-0:57:09:**  up and so you have to kind of think well what are my cash crops and what are my subsistence  
**0:57:09-0:57:16:**  crops and which elements might support you know the cash crop and and I think you can  
**0:57:16-0:57:21:**  find a lot of different combinations that work but very few farms that I know of do  
**0:57:21-0:57:26:**  you know a massive nut or fruit orchard as well as a very large livestock operation they're  
**0:57:26-0:57:30:**  usually focused on coming at it from one angle or the next well that's I think that's some  
**0:57:30-0:57:35:**  really good advice I can definitely identify to to that trying to pile everything on top  
**0:57:35-0:57:40:**  of each other and not necessarily thinking it well through the the clock is ticking though  
**0:57:40-0:57:47:**  and there is something that I wanted us to talk about is animal fodder and a bit of the  
**0:57:47-0:57:53:**  behavior of animals could you tell us you know how much of tree fodder do your sheep  
**0:57:53-0:58:00:**  can eat and you know what kind of proportion of their diet does it represent so it depends  
**0:58:00-0:58:05:**  on the year and we're very much figuring this out this is why we got into silvopasture was  
**0:58:05-0:58:11:**  because in 2016 we'd already started planting trees on the farm we were playing with different  
**0:58:11-0:58:17:**  things but the word and the concept of really intentionally doing silvopasture really hit  
**0:58:17-0:58:24:**  home as more of just like a curiosity in 2016 when we had the driest year I've ever experienced  
**0:58:24-0:58:31:**  here and apparently one of the driest years on record in this part of the world and during  
**0:58:31-0:58:35:**  that time we did our we had this beautiful rotational grazing plan we moved the animals  
**0:58:35-0:58:39:**  around the farm we did did our first rotation in the spring we came back to the you know  
**0:58:39-0:58:45:**  that first paddock and the grass hadn't regrown at all it was just it shut down and it was  
**0:58:45-0:58:50:**  a particularly intensive drought coupled with really extreme heat and so the animals were  
**0:58:50-0:58:57:**  like feeling that as well and it was a point in time when we saw our our fellow farmers  
**0:58:57-0:59:01:**  you know buying up all the hay they could find from other parts of the state or the  
**0:59:01-0:59:05:**  country you know really searching for that people were draining their ponds it was sort  
**0:59:05-0:59:08:**  of this thing where we're like oh when these things hit like we're none of us are really  
**0:59:08-0:59:14:**  ready for this like what does it look like to be ready when stuff gets hard for us we  
**0:59:14-0:59:20:**  decided with our catatons at that time to try browse grazing them basically we we stopped  
**0:59:20-0:59:24:**  grazing them on the pasture because we knew that would do damage and we started fencing  
**0:59:24-0:59:31:**  them in these large woody hedgerows and edges and all the parts of the farm that we had  
**0:59:31-0:59:35:**  not paid attention to basically in the first four or five years said oh yeah we'll get  
**0:59:35-0:59:40:**  to them someday we'll clear them out but they became really essential and our animals lived  
**0:59:40-0:59:46:**  off of this woody vegetation for about 45 days without any grass it was just all woody  
**0:59:46-0:59:53:**  vegetation and and we I mean at that point we had a very dense again these were very  
**0:59:53-0:59:57:**  dense areas no one had ever managed them so there was a lot of material available and  
**0:59:57-1:00:01:**  what happened was our work pattern shifted from moving them every day moving fencing  
**1:00:01-1:00:06:**  to going in and cutting trees down with loppers and hand saws and chainsaws and actually thinning  
**1:00:06-1:00:12:**  stuff and we actually just did that again a bit this year a little less intense but  
**1:00:12-1:00:17:**  we had a abnormally dry year which wasn't as extreme but we certainly saw some dry patterns  
**1:00:17-1:00:23:**  and it was a very cold and late spring and so the grass never really kind of came online  
**1:00:23-1:00:28:**  it was very slow this year but we put our animals in a new area of woods and and fed  
**1:00:28-1:00:35:**  them a substantial amount of their food this summer as well from from the tree fodder so  
**1:00:35-1:00:41:**  that works for now the key is that these are areas of the land that again have been neglected  
**1:00:41-1:00:45:**  from management for a long time so there's a lot of stuff there for them to eat and as  
**1:00:45-1:00:49:**  we keep kind of hitting them hard with these more extreme seasons we're seeing you know  
**1:00:49-1:00:56:**  we don't know what the the response is going to be long term so for us fodder is is an  
**1:00:56-1:01:00:**  emergency food source and it's something that we're realizing very quickly that we have  
**1:01:00-1:01:05:**  to manage in order to sustain long term because it's not trees are not going to work in the  
**1:01:05-1:01:11:**  same way of grasses where i can graze it rest it for 30 or 40 days and then come back and  
**1:01:11-1:01:18:**  graze it again frankly we don't know exactly the recovery and what that looks like and  
**1:01:18-1:01:24:**  that's something that we all in the agroforestry world need to need to do some investigating  
**1:01:24-1:01:32:**  on and share our findings you know all that being said what we do know is that there's  
**1:01:32-1:01:37:**  ample vegetation out there it's just a question of figuring out how to manage it and and i  
**1:01:37-1:01:43:**  was fortunate i've been over to england a few times and visit some remnants of some  
**1:01:43-1:01:48:**  of the coppice uh forestry systems that are still being managed there and you can see  
**1:01:48-1:01:55:**  when it's actively managed in an intentional way how much vegetation can be produced and  
**1:01:55-1:01:59:**  sustained on a on a small piece of land so i think it's a question of what does it look  
**1:01:59-1:02:05:**  like to to potentially get there but for now it's an emergency food source for us and it's  
**1:02:05-1:02:10:**  also we see it as a nutritional supplement so in a normal year we'll do a good amount  
**1:02:10-1:02:14:**  of pruning we'll do a good amount of thinning and we'll bring stuff to the animals what  
**1:02:14-1:02:18:**  we find with tree fodder is that the nutrient density is much higher than in most of the  
**1:02:18-1:02:24:**  pasture forages and then we know things like willow i mentioned willow there's a lot of  
**1:02:24-1:02:33:**  research about the the condensed tannin value and the tannins in willow if fed to animals  
**1:02:33-1:02:38:**  will reduce the the parasite pressure on their system and it will also reduce their methane  
**1:02:38-1:02:44:**  that's that's been pretty well documented and you'll see in the animals they'll only  
**1:02:44-1:02:50:**  eat so much willow because it it's harder for them to digest it's it's like drink drink  
**1:02:50-1:02:54:**  a nice uh light wine versus something really high in tannins right it kind of fills you  
**1:02:54-1:03:00:**  up or like yeah or like a stout versus uh an ale you know these things yeah same kind  
**1:03:00-1:03:04:**  of thing it's like oh i can only have so much of this so it has that medicinal benefit so  
**1:03:04-1:03:08:**  we make sure that the the sheep are getting access to willow you know ideally weekly through  
**1:03:08-1:03:12:**  their grazing cycle they're not necessarily needing it every day but we want to make sure  
**1:03:12-1:03:16:**  they're kind of dosed up on it and they have it available to them um and so that's kind  
**1:03:16-1:03:21:**  of how we see it now long term um we'd love to be planting what are called fodder blocks  
**1:03:21-1:03:25:**  which are much more dense intentionally planted areas that we graze a little bit harder and  
**1:03:25-1:03:29:**  we hope to do research to see how they respond but that's going to you know take some years  
**1:03:29-1:03:34:**  to both establish and manage and really start to understand but then if you were um taking  
**1:03:34-1:03:39:**  the the coppice example uh could you imagine systems where they can harvest that matter  
**1:03:39-1:03:43:**  themselves instead of you having to prune the trees and bring it to them i think so  
**1:03:43-1:03:49:**  i think um we're doing a lot of pollarding of existing trees now because we want to have  
**1:03:49-1:03:57:**  control over when they hit it um but i think yes i think what we see and there's there's  
**1:03:57-1:04:02:**  definitely more examples in the tropics in silvopasture we can see areas getting fully  
**1:04:02-1:04:11:**  um coppiced uh and there's examples with um entire fields being planted sometimes 40 000  
**1:04:11-1:04:17:**  stems to the acre and then just getting grazed wholesale um and then recovering and being  
**1:04:17-1:04:22:**  able to sometimes be grazed again in the same season now that's again in the tropics so  
**1:04:22-1:04:27:**  we have a different climate that allows for that but yeah i think those kind of things  
**1:04:27-1:04:33:**  are feasible um and but you know we need to try stuff out on a smaller scale and start  
**1:04:33-1:04:37:**  to understand it's going to get real specific to the region in the part of the world but  
**1:04:37-1:04:43:**  i i think there's great potential in it and what we know is that woody uh plants do much  
**1:04:43-1:04:49:**  better to to in terms of growing and sustaining themselves in extremely dry and extremely  
**1:04:49-1:04:55:**  wet scenarios um so all these dry years what we see is that the pasture can crisp up really  
**1:04:55-1:04:59:**  quickly but the trees kind of look normal right like they they're still doing their  
**1:04:59-1:05:05:**  thing they're very efficient at that so whether we're you know thinning larger trees coppicing  
**1:05:05-1:05:10:**  pollarding playing with these things i think what we know is it's a reliable source of  
**1:05:10-1:05:14:**  vegetation it's not that's not the question the question is how we manage it to really  
**1:05:14-1:05:20:**  sustain it in the long term but do you see ways um in which we could use fodder to feed  
**1:05:20-1:05:25:**  animals that would be efficient in time because if i understand correctly at the moment either  
**1:05:25-1:05:29:**  you're in a position where you're in extreme times so somewhere you're just not counting  
**1:05:29-1:05:33:**  your time because if your animals have nothing to eat obviously you'll do whatever it takes  
**1:05:33-1:05:37:**  for them to have food or you're in like normal years where you just give them a small amount  
**1:05:37-1:05:42:**  of fodder so it doesn't take that much time so but i'm wondering if we could think of  
**1:05:42-1:05:48:**  a system when in normal years um maybe with those like fodder blocks do you think that  
**1:05:48-1:05:52:**  would be reasonable in terms of management and the number the amount of time you have  
**1:05:52-1:05:56:**  to spend pruning and bringing that matter to them i think it's feasible for certain  
**1:05:56-1:06:00:**  species i think there's going to be again some of the ones i mentioned before probably  
**1:06:00-1:06:07:**  our best candidates to figure out and um one of the things we have done is um some of the  
**1:06:07-1:06:13:**  willow that we've coppiced is does really well it produces these nice um multi-stemmed  
**1:06:13-1:06:18:**  re you know clusters of regrowth and we'll take that cluster and we'll actually tie some  
**1:06:18-1:06:23:**  twine around it and bundle it up and then we'll just cut it at the base and then we  
**1:06:23-1:06:26:**  just have that whole bundle that we throw on the tractor and bring to the animals right  
**1:06:26-1:06:31:**  so that's a lot more efficient um in many ways but i i get what you're saying and i  
**1:06:31-1:06:35:**  think that it's important to think about ways that we can have the animals freely browse  
**1:06:35-1:06:40:**  material as well as ways that we can kind of harvest and choose when to feed out material  
**1:06:40-1:06:46:**  so um sure i think it's theoretically feasible it's certainly not the it is not the foundation  
**1:06:46-1:06:51:**  of our grazing the foundation of our grazing program is still good pasture forages and  
**1:06:51-1:06:56:**  still establishing good forage in tree systems i think the tree stuff we can continue to  
**1:06:56-1:07:02:**  kind of pepper in there and then figure out over time what it might look like yeah there's  
**1:07:02-1:07:07:**  a really interesting um or there are some really interesting machines um or at least  
**1:07:07-1:07:14:**  what seemed interesting to me when i was looking at them that can harvest um that can copies  
**1:07:14-1:07:19:**  actually um for example willow and some of them that can actually um that were much more  
**1:07:19-1:07:26:**  heavy duty and maybe not so feasible for a farm maybe as a in a cons as a group of different  
**1:07:26-1:07:31:**  farms but that could literally harvest willow and bale it as well so i think that might  
**1:07:31-1:07:36:**  be something interesting to look at in these systems to try you know mechanize the harvesting  
**1:07:36-1:07:40:**  the copy thing and the pollarding that can easily be transported to other areas or can  
**1:07:40-1:07:44:**  be easily just dropped on the floor and get the animals in there i don't i don't know  
**1:07:44-1:07:48:**  if you've got some ideas about i'm sure you've seen some of these machines yeah a lot of  
**1:07:48-1:07:53:**  them there's been a lot of work in the states around using like willow as a biomass plant  
**1:07:53-1:07:58:**  and so there's plenty of data and research about you know basically planting willow almost  
**1:07:58-1:08:02:**  like you plant corn in a field and having this dense stand come up and then harvesting  
**1:08:02-1:08:06:**  it all a lot of that machinery though like chipped it up so it wasn't you know it's not  
**1:08:06-1:08:10:**  as good for a food source but there's there's definitely other machinery that could potentially  
**1:08:10-1:08:17:**  be adapted or utilized and um it's it it's like any agricultural challenge i i we grow  
**1:08:17-1:08:20:**  elderberry a bit and we're we're working on figuring out how to make that efficiently  
**1:08:20-1:08:26:**  work as a as a product to sell um but it's very labor intensive to harvest and and we  
**1:08:26-1:08:29:**  see this time and time again that agricultural products it's it's not a question of if it  
**1:08:29-1:08:34:**  can be done it's a question of if there's enough will and interest from folks to say  
**1:08:34-1:08:38:**  this is important enough to develop that machine or that piece of equipment right and i think  
**1:08:38-1:08:43:**  that um as more and more people get interested as we we think about these things whether  
**1:08:43-1:08:47:**  we're adapting some existing equipment or we're coming up with something new i don't  
**1:08:47-1:08:53:**  think that's the limiting part it's it's the will for us to want to see trees as an integral  
**1:08:53-1:08:57:**  part of our landscape and our grazing system and that's still the hill i'm trying to climb  
**1:08:57-1:09:01:**  is getting people excited about that because a lot of a lot of farmers i don't know how  
**1:09:01-1:09:06:**  it's what it's like for you and your all's experience in europe but in the states i'll  
**1:09:06-1:09:10:**  do these talks and conferences and these farmers will come up to me and say wait you know i  
**1:09:10-1:09:13:**  was told to take all the trees out of my pasture and now here you are telling me to put all  
**1:09:13-1:09:18:**  these trees in the pasture you know this is a psychology that's been persistent for for  
**1:09:18-1:09:24:**  quite some time and that's actually probably like my lifetime's worth of work is hopefully  
**1:09:24-1:09:30:**  to help help uh change that a bit and then maybe you know then we'll start talking about  
**1:09:30-1:09:35:**  the next level which is really scaling and and doing these things and and that that might  
**1:09:35-1:09:41:**  be the realistic pace this has to happen at i don't know i want i want to dig deeper just  
**1:09:41-1:09:45:**  on one aspect here because um if i can explain one of the experiences that we saw in greece  
**1:09:45-1:09:50:**  is where there was we were in a region where there are a lot of shepherds and the guys  
**1:09:50-1:09:55:**  there are are pollarding their mulberries they actually there's mulberries for decorative  
**1:09:55-1:10:00:**  purposes that are planted everywhere in the towns in the villages and also on the farms  
**1:10:00-1:10:06:**  and so they're there's something decorative and beautiful there and um they're pollarded  
**1:10:06-1:10:11:**  and so all the farmers go into during the the end of the summer they go into when the  
**1:10:11-1:10:15:**  past is starting to be starting to struggle a lot especially in that climate or when you  
**1:10:15-1:10:20:**  know they're basically the fields that they've left to dry um as a storage is a technical  
**1:10:20-1:10:25:**  term for this but i forgot the name um dry stock or i don't know what it is so that when  
**1:10:25-1:10:30:**  that's all been eaten they go into the village and they they're actually the the arborists  
**1:10:30-1:10:35:**  of the of the villages and they prune all the trees they put um with chainsaws or with  
**1:10:35-1:10:40:**  loppers and they put it in their in their pickup trucks and they take it to their to  
**1:10:40-1:10:45:**  their animals and just to go a bit in more detail into what you said because i'm very  
**1:10:45-1:10:51:**  curious about this for your operation your scale um it doesn't you're saying that it  
**1:10:51-1:10:57:**  doesn't quite make sense economically speaking like in terms of your time um and yeah in  
**1:10:57-1:11:01:**  terms of the value of your time to go into a system that you've planted and to pull our  
**1:11:01-1:11:07:**  trees with the chainsaw with loppers and to have that as as as an important source for  
**1:11:07-1:11:12:**  the animals is that why you're not using it or if not what's the reason why you're not  
**1:11:12-1:11:18:**  doing that specific management type well i think we are it's just a it's again it's more  
**1:11:18-1:11:23:**  of a supplement than like the main course right um okay and i think it's mostly the  
**1:11:23-1:11:28:**  volume of material and uncertainty about its recovery and not wanting to overdo it um i've  
**1:11:28-1:11:34:**  been mostly pleasantly surprised that the recovery and you have to think you know uh  
**1:11:34-1:11:39:**  let's say a mulberry tree in greece that's been there for 80 years is going to have a  
**1:11:39-1:11:44:**  much different recovery track than a mulberry i planted five years ago you know that yeah  
**1:11:44-1:11:51:**  the ability of an established system to regenerate is really powerful and if you have a one of  
**1:11:51-1:11:55:**  the things has been beautiful working with farmers from all over is some of them realize  
**1:11:55-1:11:59:**  that they have these legacy trees they have older things that have been managed in this  
**1:11:59-1:12:04:**  way in the past and that they could take that back on and they get really good regeneration  
**1:12:04-1:12:10:**  from those older trees and and start to see them as so valuable to their operation i think  
**1:12:10-1:12:16:**  that's a big thing um and for us a lot of the woody land like i mentioned is covered  
**1:12:16-1:12:21:**  in you know these so-called invasive species which like one of the most common that's on  
**1:12:21-1:12:33:**  our farm um is we we know it as european buckthorn um and it uh responds to grazing and pollarding  
**1:12:33-1:12:39:**  and pruning so well like it has no problem with uh with getting hit and and recovering  
**1:12:39-1:12:45:**  and it's it's ironic because a lot of the conservationists around around them get really  
**1:12:45-1:12:48:**  mad at it because it's so hard to eradicate you can't get rid of it you can't cut it down  
**1:12:48-1:12:52:**  you can't dig it out you know you can't even put it pesticide on it it won't kill it but  
**1:12:52-1:12:56:**  that kind of resiliency is exactly what i want in a fodder tree right because i want  
**1:12:56-1:13:03:**  to be able to have the animals um hit it beat it eat it and it's come back um and so we're  
**1:13:03-1:13:07:**  looking for those indicators in the landscape and we can we'd rather manage the ones that  
**1:13:07-1:13:11:**  exist and are showing those then you know tear those out and put some other species  
**1:13:11-1:13:17:**  in so i think there's plenty to work with but yeah from an economic perspective we put  
**1:13:17-1:13:25:**  the time into harvesting when we have it and it can be really quick like so we keep a pair  
**1:13:25-1:13:31:**  of loppers in the cart that we we we move with the sheep that has the um the battery  
**1:13:31-1:13:37:**  for the the you know the energizer in it and we have a nice hand saw and all that and so  
**1:13:37-1:13:41:**  anytime we have 10 minutes we can harvest quite a bit of stuff for them to gnaw on it's  
**1:13:41-1:13:46:**  not going to feed them their entire diet but it's a bit of a supplement and so no we do  
**1:13:46-1:13:51:**  that pretty routinely around the farm um but it's still important to have the foundation  
**1:13:51-1:13:57:**  i think of a grazing system be in the forages and and i think it's a good it's a good encouragement  
**1:13:57-1:14:01:**  for new folks to say okay i'm well i'm not trying to replace everything i'm trying to  
**1:14:01-1:14:06:**  just add in um and again when you start doing the research you really see that the value  
**1:14:06-1:14:13:**  of the woody brush is dense nutrients um and also resiliency to to extreme weather and  
**1:14:13-1:14:20:**  so those are just things to kind of keep thinking about i confirmed to you that um in greece  
**1:14:20-1:14:24:**  the the trees that they are pollarding are are at least 30 years old usually you know  
**1:14:24-1:14:30:**  minimum 20 and but then they hit them every year they take off everything all of the branches  
**1:14:30-1:14:34:**  every year and then the next year they're another like in some cases two meters three  
**1:14:34-1:14:41:**  meters tall um you know like regrowth um very dense they they provide shade for whole terraces  
**1:14:41-1:14:46:**  i wanted to ask as well just in terms of uh understanding the animal behavior you mentioned  
**1:14:46-1:14:51:**  that you had a specific breed that's actually a pretty good browser um how important is  
**1:14:51-1:14:57:**  the breed then in terms of um sheep or cows or eating that fodder probably pretty important  
**1:14:57-1:15:03:**  i you know we haven't tried you know 10 different breeds side by side to see um i know again  
**1:15:03-1:15:11:**  um i'd recommend folks check out uh fred prevents his work um which is not just about the french  
**1:15:11-1:15:16:**  herding we talked about but also a lot of research he did um in the u.s around animal  
**1:15:16-1:15:23:**  preference for brows and different different foods and they found you can train and and  
**1:15:23-1:15:28:**  teach animals they may not always have the instinct or the familiarity with certain foods  
**1:15:28-1:15:33:**  but you can definitely work with them to to start eating more of those in their diet so  
**1:15:33-1:15:39:**  um but obviously that can take more time and energy so i think my recommendation is you  
**1:15:39-1:15:45:**  you you select a species uh that best matches your landscape and and the things you're going  
**1:15:45-1:15:48:**  to be feeding it and then recognize there might be some training or some some work along  
**1:15:48-1:15:54:**  the way but i i do think that a lot of them can can learn uh to value it um they just  
**1:15:54-1:15:59:**  may not be familiar so like our friends uh up the road have a sheep dairy and their their  
**1:15:59-1:16:04:**  sheep get uh pretty pampered um you know they're they're they're balancing diet more they're  
**1:16:04-1:16:08:**  feeding out a lot of alfalfa and sort of um you know they're milking them every day and  
**1:16:08-1:16:13:**  so they're getting this this dose of things as they go through uh food to to keep up the  
**1:16:13-1:16:19:**  nutrition and so they're a lot less um interested in you know the scrubby brows on the edge  
**1:16:19-1:16:23:**  of the farm because they know they're going to go get the pampered you know spa treatment  
**1:16:23-1:16:29:**  when they go to the milking parlor um and so they're not as interested but uh our animals  
**1:16:29-1:16:32:**  are used to fending for themselves and kind of finding what they can landscape and so  
**1:16:32-1:16:40:**  they're really um game for trying almost anything and a lot of plants even that i've seen on  
**1:16:40-1:16:44:**  toxic plant lists are actually things that our animals readily eat and are interested  
**1:16:44-1:16:51:**  in um which is really interesting so i think it all depends on on that relationship um  
**1:16:51-1:16:56:**  and uh and so there's it's part nature and part nurture i guess is that is the short  
**1:16:56-1:17:00:**  answer to that um one one more thing i want to say about breed it's really important when  
**1:17:00-1:17:07:**  you select a breed not just those characteristics but also your local community um so we almost  
**1:17:07-1:17:13:**  picked a really obscure sheep breed but we decided not to because um we would be the  
**1:17:13-1:17:17:**  only people within like a five-hour radius that had this breed which makes it really  
**1:17:17-1:17:24:**  hard to diversify your breed find a ram all these kind of things long term and so partially  
**1:17:24-1:17:28:**  why we chose cotons is because we could find five or six other farms pretty close by that  
**1:17:28-1:17:34:**  had the had the same breed and we're interested in keeping that a pure a pure stock and that's  
**1:17:34-1:17:40:**  been really helpful from us uh you know being able to raise and keep a healthy healthy genetic  
**1:17:40-1:17:45:**  pool in our in our flock so so keep that in mind a larger large the larger context is  
**1:17:45-1:17:49:**  also important i think when you're when you're selecting the type of animal yeah and that's  
**1:17:49-1:17:56:**  that's super interesting um but if i understand properly then you also have um so you have  
**1:17:56-1:18:01:**  pasture where you're establishing trees and then you're also establishing forages in uh  
**1:18:01-1:18:07:**  wooded areas that you're thinning right yeah and um yeah i was just wondering how the management  
**1:18:07-1:18:12:**  of that rotation within the trees how that works you know um is it much different than  
**1:18:12-1:18:17:**  having them in pasture logistically but also in term of the timing and the density you  
**1:18:17-1:18:24:**  might use for the flock i'm also thinking in in terms of you know potential damage to  
**1:18:24-1:18:29:**  the existing woods yeah there's there's there's definitely differences um but they're the  
**1:18:29-1:18:33:**  same differences that i experienced with just open pasture where at different times of the  
**1:18:33-1:18:38:**  year and different different realities hit um you know the grasses never grow all at  
**1:18:38-1:18:43:**  the same rate even within the same field um it's always a bit surprising to see those  
**1:18:43-1:18:47:**  variations and try to figure out why that's going on but one of the things we learned  
**1:18:47-1:18:52:**  early on with the woods is that we really need to establish wide alleys where you can  
**1:18:52-1:18:58:**  get your fencing in um you know initially we thought enough to kind of crawl through  
**1:18:58-1:19:04:**  with the net fence was good but uh it gets stuck on every every twig and we quickly realized  
**1:19:04-1:19:10:**  we needed to have at least a you know four feet or so of width whatever the size of your  
**1:19:10-1:19:14:**  your mower your brush hog your your tractor was a good width to to make sure you have  
**1:19:14-1:19:19:**  cleared um so that you can get the fencing in and out unless you're doing something more  
**1:19:19-1:19:26:**  permanent so that's i think one piece um we try to uh as we've learned our grazing system  
**1:19:26-1:19:31:**  we know which paddocks are going to be really robust in the spring we try to save the silva  
**1:19:31-1:19:36:**  pasture areas like i said they're a bit late to start as it's warming up and they also  
**1:19:36-1:19:41:**  tend to do hold on better in the hot part of the summer so for us here we try to graze  
**1:19:41-1:19:46:**  the open fields earlier in the season and then move the animals into the wooded areas  
**1:19:46-1:19:51:**  you know during those hotter times if we can try to guess when those are right because  
**1:19:51-1:19:58:**  it's it's a bit different every year um we we formulate a grazing plan so we have a grazing  
**1:19:58-1:20:02:**  plan with paddocks and and our where we think we're going to move them next but it's not  
**1:20:02-1:20:07:**  like we start at paddock one and and go two three four five six seven you know all the  
**1:20:07-1:20:13:**  way to 45 or whatever um we often are bouncing around a bit more and that's often because  
**1:20:13-1:20:17:**  we're we're seeing what's happening in the land we say actually this area is ready let's  
**1:20:17-1:20:22:**  go here first and then we'll we'll go back to that other part so um i feel like grazing  
**1:20:22-1:20:27:**  is is wonderful because it forces us to be out on our farm observing what's going on  
**1:20:27-1:20:32:**  and constantly making those decisions but you can't ever count on it being uniform even  
**1:20:32-1:20:38:**  without a silvopasture and so so you you're you know that farm walk the loop walking around  
**1:20:38-1:20:43:**  seeing where your fields are is is essential to to making sure everything's going to work  
**1:20:43-1:20:49:**  well on that uh really interesting um final notes which i think is a perfect place to  
**1:20:49-1:20:56:**  stop the interview actually um um yeah i think it's we've covered everything that we wanted  
**1:20:56-1:21:02:**  to cover during uh during uh for this interview and you've answered um very precisely and  
**1:21:02-1:21:07:**  very interestingly um all our different uh all our different questions so thank you so  
**1:21:07-1:21:14:**  much for this um i wanted to ask you something quickly as um as a listener of the podcast  
**1:21:14-1:21:19:**  as you mentioned at the at the beginning i'm curious to know what you'd like to what you'd  
**1:21:19-1:21:23:**  like to hear on the podcast what would you like to hear more of for example or ideally  
**1:21:23-1:21:26:**  what would you like us to who would you like us to interview what would you like us to  
**1:21:26-1:21:34:**  ask what would you like us to focus on well there's so many things i think um i mean i  
**1:21:34-1:21:38:**  learn a lot from the just different stories and experiences people are having as they're  
**1:21:38-1:21:43:**  implementing agroforestry you know in a lot of different contexts i think that's great  
**1:21:43-1:21:48:**  so the more you know i specifically kept the book to the temperate climate because i knew  
**1:21:48-1:21:51:**  i didn't have a lot of experience in other climates but i can still learn a lot from  
**1:21:51-1:21:57:**  people's experience um i really feel like in agroforestry we we all need to to tap into  
**1:21:57-1:22:03:**  sort of the indigeneity of of agroforestry a bit more i think there's a lot of older  
**1:22:03-1:22:09:**  wisdom out there in the landscape and it's probably not people who uh maybe are online  
**1:22:09-1:22:17:**  or on podcasts right like my um one of my forestry mentors uh um you know doesn't have  
**1:22:17-1:22:22:**  a cell phone the way i find him as i go like knock on his door um so i don't know how that  
**1:22:22-1:22:28:**  works for your podcast but you know that that expertise and experience is so important of  
**1:22:28-1:22:34:**  of people who have been like in in landscapes for a long time you know um but the other  
**1:22:34-1:22:43:**  thing is i would love to connect you all with some folks like um who are doing this this  
**1:22:43-1:22:48:**  whole tree fodder piece is i think interesting to a lot of people but there's only there's  
**1:22:48-1:22:51:**  not that many people that are like drilling really deep but there are some folks doing  
**1:22:51-1:22:54:**  some cool stuff like in england they're doing they were i don't know if they're still doing  
**1:22:54-1:22:59:**  it with some research with tree hay and like storing it for winter and then feeding it  
**1:22:59-1:23:05:**  out and i know a farmer up in maine who's who's a really interesting uh woman who is  
**1:23:05-1:23:09:**  doing some cool stuff with tree fodder so okay stuff is some people i could connect  
**1:23:09-1:23:16:**  you with yeah that would that would keep digging that that trench and um as a final question  
**1:23:16-1:23:23:**  um what's the top tip that you would give to a current farmer or a new farmer that's  
**1:23:23-1:23:30:**  starting in silver pasture i think we've we've hit upon it a lot it's it's really important  
**1:23:30-1:23:37:**  to start small with uh chunks you can bite off and chew and digest and understand that  
**1:23:37-1:23:44:**  to establish trees we're talking about at least uh you know two or three seasons worth  
**1:23:44-1:23:49:**  of work in one place so when you're thinking about planting trees it's okay if i plant  
**1:23:49-1:23:54:**  100 trees this year and i plant 100 trees next year next year i also have to take care  
**1:23:54-1:23:59:**  of those other 100 trees and then the third year i have to take care of the new 100 trees  
**1:23:59-1:24:03:**  i plant plus the 100 i planted the year before plus the 100 i planted so think about the  
**1:24:03-1:24:08:**  number of trees you feel like you can plant and manage in a year and if it's 10 that's  
**1:24:08-1:24:13:**  great and if it's 100 that's great if it's a thousand that's great but just try to try  
**1:24:13-1:24:20:**  being really realistic with that and um you know less is more in that sense and and you  
**1:24:20-1:24:25:**  can increase the scope and the intensity of the work as you get more comfortable with  
**1:24:25-1:24:31:**  the work so start small and allow it to grow as it should

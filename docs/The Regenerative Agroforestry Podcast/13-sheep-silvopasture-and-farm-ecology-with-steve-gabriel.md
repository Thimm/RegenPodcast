### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (2021-01-12)  

**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  our soils and ecosystems?  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  Hello everyone and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:51:**  We're your hosts Etienne and Dimitri.  Today we have the pleasure of sharing with you a conversation with Steve Gabriel from  Wellspring Forest Farm.  
**0:00:57-0:01:01:**  Steve has written a great book that we really enjoyed and we highly recommend to you and  so we were super excited to have him on the podcast.  I really enjoyed this episode and Steve manages to situate silver pasture and trees in a broader  
**0:01:10-0:01:15:**  ecological understanding of the farm but he also gives us plenty of practical information  on how to go about planting out trees and managing animals.  So I think you'll come out with a really exciting overview of silver pasture but also full of  
**0:01:26-0:01:28:**  practical details to make it work on your land.  I really hope you enjoy the episode.  Hi Steve, welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:33-0:01:34:**  Thanks so good to be here with you all.  Yeah it's great to have you here and I'm sure we're gonna have a fascinating conversation.  Both of us read your book when it came out and really enjoyed it so we're very excited  
**0:01:44-0:01:45:**  to have you.  Maybe to start things off you could tell us a bit about yourself, how you got into agriculture  and how you got to start the farm you have at the moment.  
**0:01:53-0:01:58:**  Yeah I came to agriculture a couple ways.  My grandfather was a farmer in Illinois in the Midwest and so experienced a bit in my  family of sort of the post-World War II farming era.  
**0:02:11-0:02:17:**  My aunts and uncles all grew up on a farm and then promptly fled to get off the farm  and have better paying jobs.  My grandfather always loved farming and eventually got out of it too but always had a couple  
**0:02:23-0:02:31:**  acres of corn in his back field and kept bees and things like that and he was always just  someone I admired and liked hanging out with and I just liked riding the tractor with him.  So that was definitely an influence and then for me as I started to grow up I really recognized  
**0:02:46-0:02:51:**  my deep love for the forest and the woods and looked for a way to basically have a job  that allowed me to be outside as much as possible which started out as like studying recreation  and thinking I was going to be a river guide or something like that or take people out  
**0:03:02-0:03:10:**  into the woods but was really hit with the reality of the environmental crisis and as  I've learned the social crisis that really goes alongside that and realized I probably  couldn't spend my life just enjoying the woods but also needed to take an active part in  
**0:03:23-0:03:32:**  restoration and reclamation and trying to restore health in some way and so that led  me really down a path of starting at forestry school and then feeling a bit disillusioned  with the overwhelming focus on just timber as the only value expressed in our economy  
**0:03:46-0:03:57:**  for the forest and eventually started to find small little kernels of possibility.  For me producing maple syrup was one of the first things that captured my attention where  I saw something really interesting and cool that could be done in the woods that also  
**0:04:06-0:04:11:**  provided income and sustenance for folks and I grew up in a part of the world where that's  a really rich part of history and of relationship to land, the relationship to the changing  of the seasons and so I just loved the process and that was really the gateway for me teaching  
**0:04:23-0:04:30:**  youth about maple sugaring as a way to connect them to the natural world and from there we  thinned our sugar bush one year to support the trees there and had a bunch of logs and  happened to learn from a farmer nearby about growing shiitakes on logs and so it's just  
**0:04:43-0:04:48:**  kind of like crescendoed from there into different things realizing that the forest could be  a place that provides a lot of support for humans and also could be a way to store the  land and so yeah that's been the journey that was almost 20 years ago now and then it's  
**0:05:02-0:05:07:**  really been jumping in full and trying to figure out what that actually looks like and  realizing the dreamy idealized version when I first started is very different than the  practical day-to-day and the little details that are inevitably part of agroforestry and  
**0:05:21-0:05:23:**  forestry and land stewardship.  And could you tell us a bit more specifically about Wellspring Forest Farm, how you started  that and what kind of local context surrounds it?  
**0:05:34-0:05:40:**  Yeah, so we're in the Finger Lakes region of right pretty much in the middle of New  York State in the Northeast US.  It's a cold temperate climate, rather humid and we have four pretty distinct seasons usually.  
**0:05:51-0:05:59:**  It used to be pretty guaranteed that we'd start freezing up sometime in November, December  and the ground would stay frozen until you know March.  I used to tap trees in late February and early March and that was again almost 20 years ago  
**0:06:09-0:06:12:**  and now we tap sometimes in late January.  I think the earliest was even like January 10th or something and so just in my short  existence here things are definitely changing.  
**0:06:21-0:06:26:**  We can't count on the ground being frozen in the same way and that has a lot of implications  for ecosystem health.  Generally we're blessed with a really even spread of rainfall throughout the year but  
**0:06:34-0:06:35:**  that's also changing.  Our rain is now coming in more sporadic events.  We'll have short periodic droughts and when the rain comes it often comes in really heavy  
**0:06:43-0:06:45:**  events all at once.  So we're fortunate to have usually ample access to water as part of our systems.  This part of the world traditionally is forested land and then we could talk about the nuances  
**0:07:00-0:07:08:**  of that but the Haudenosaunee people or the Goi-Kono is the Kew-Gah nation who traditionally  stewarded these lands for thousands of years before colonization.  Change the landscape very much in agriculture and agroforestry mindset although they wouldn't  
**0:07:19-0:07:25:**  have called it that right because agroforestry used to just be called farming or land stewardship.  It's kind of recently we've had to name it as something separate but our farm is about  45 acres.  
**0:07:35-0:07:42:**  Some of it we have title to and some of it we release and we run a mixed small diversified  farm our main crop is mushrooms both outdoors and we do some indoor production as well.  We have our sheep and our ducks which we utilize a lot in civil pasture systems and we produce  
**0:07:56-0:08:02:**  maple syrup of course both on our land and some trees we lease up the road from us so  we have to haul sap every spring.  So our seasons are pretty dynamic and so we're in a time right now where it's the quietest  
**0:08:10-0:08:16:**  November and December but again you know starting the new year we'll be looking to the trees  to figure out when we need to tap in and maple for us really starts the whole season.  And in terms of local markets are you able to commercialize locally or do you have to  
**0:08:24-0:08:25:**  go a bit further?  So far we're in an area that's really supportive of small local farms and values that both  like direct customers as well as chefs and things like that in restaurants but we also  
**0:08:40-0:08:44:**  have a pretty pretty sizable tourism industry around here.  People visit these lakes and spend time around here and so yeah we mostly had not had a hard  time unloading our products pretty much off the farm or not too far from it.  
**0:08:58-0:09:02:**  And I know you mentioned mushrooms I mean there's so many things that you do that are  fascinating and you talk about these and also your first book if I'm if I'm correct Farming  the Woods but today we thought about maybe zooming in more into the silvopasture systems.  
**0:09:15-0:09:18:**  One of the reasons is that there's already actually a few podcasts that we listened to  before this one where you talk a bit more about mushroom cultivation and we'll make  sure we put some links so that our listeners can access that knowledge.  
**0:09:26-0:09:31:**  But yeah today looking a bit more specifically to silvopasture I was wondering if you could  give us a bit more detail of an overview maybe you know the number of animals you have and  the different plots of lands, a forest or pasture or you know mixed forest and pasture.  
**0:09:43-0:09:49:**  Yeah definitely and what I think is beautiful about silvopasture in general is the while  the mushrooms from a income standpoint make up the majority of of that aspect of our farm  the silvopasture is easily the system that impacts the acreage the most amount of land  
**0:10:03-0:10:09:**  so the mushrooms actually we grow on like less than a tenth of an acre but the silvopasture  is almost and eventually will be I think throughout the majority of the farm and and so I think  that's a really important aspect is that some agroforestry practices are very confined or  
**0:10:21-0:10:25:**  very specific to types of the land you know different types of landscape or different  types of ecosystem but the silvopasture really can fit in in almost any any open niche and  that's the way we've been thinking about it so so I think of the whole farm as a silvopasture  
**0:10:36-0:10:41:**  it's just in different stages of succession.  When we arrived and we started stewarding this piece of land around 2010 we brought  some mushroom logs here and started tapping trees and slowly worked into the silvopasture  
**0:10:53-0:11:00:**  the farm was pretty much 50 percent open pasture and 50 percent forest and and to me that really  speaks to the way modern agriculture has subdivided and and put these these different ecosystems  in boxes it's like the edge between the field and the forest could not be more dramatic  
**0:11:10-0:11:17:**  just one stops and the other starts you know and yeah the edges are only determined by  where the last person decided to turn their tractor when they were mowing or plowing or  whatever they were doing so it's it's just a bunch of boxes in our landscape and it's  
**0:11:26-0:11:32:**  a bunch of boxes with these harsh edges and that has nothing to do with the way again  in traditional indigenous people stewarded the land ship or the way nature creates really  dynamic edges between different ecosystems so for us our first attention was to to look  
**0:11:45-0:11:52:**  at those elements especially around water and hydrology and slope and try to ignore  what this sort of impact that had been placed on the landscape for decades and decades and  decades and really look at the landscape from a watershed perspective from a forest perspective  
**0:12:01-0:12:05:**  from an animal perspective from from something different and try to see different lines see  different boundaries and and then think about the silvopasture as one way to support the  restoration work so some of our silvopasture is creek restoration work also and some of  
**0:12:15-0:12:21:**  our silvopasture is forest management some of our silvopasture is planting trees in a  field to to break the wind to create a better microclimate for the grazing animals but it's  it's for us really important that it reflects what the land wants so to speak and so you  
**0:12:35-0:12:39:**  know before we impose an idea of what it looks like and I always like to say with silvopasture  a lot of pictures out there show these like grids of trees and I I there's there's appropriate  places for rows and and certainly patterns like that but there's so much opportunity  
**0:12:52-0:12:57:**  to integrate silvopasture in so many different patterns and so many different processes it  starts with what the land is is asking for I think and starts from that lens and then  we can blend that with our goals for for production so our main animal is is sheep we have in  
**0:13:10-0:13:18:**  our grazing season will run about 60 or 65 lambs and ewes together the breed we use is  called Katahdin and Katahdin is named after Mount Katahdin which is in the state of Maine  it's a sheep breed really interesting history took several English traditional English breeds  
**0:13:32-0:13:38:**  and crossed them with the St. Croix which is a Caribbean breed so it's a hare sheep  does not produce wool and we chose that intentionally and it's also a sheep that breed that really  tolerates pretty cold conditions as well as pretty hot conditions and is is really also  
**0:13:52-0:13:57:**  really resilient to parasites so it kind of seemed like a win-win-win oh yeah we found  them and and what we've also found since working with them on the landscape is they're phenomenal  browsers meaning they they prefer woody vegetation almost equally to pasture which is a huge  
**0:14:11-0:14:15:**  advantage when we're when we're focused on hopefully utilizing both of those types of  vegetation in the in the grazing plan so not all sheep are like that and of course not  all goats will graze some will just go off to the woody stuff so we really found a great  
**0:14:25-0:14:30:**  a great breed to work with we'll definitely come back to that because it's it's a really  fascinating aspect of silvopasture but before we we progress in the conversation I was wondering  if you can give us a description of the different ecosystems you have then because you know  
**0:14:40-0:14:45:**  you've mentioned that you have a diversity of of ecosystems on the farm and clearly you're  trying to really base your production on them sure yeah and we have if folks are interested  on our on our farm home page we have kind of a Google Earth tour that you can take and  
**0:14:55-0:15:00:**  actually see like videos of different parts of the farm which is something that I started  working on we do an online silvopasture class and I started sharing that as a way to snap  some video of different aspects of it but I would say like we don't have like amazingly  
**0:15:12-0:15:22:**  old like healthy forest most of the landscape was was really abandoned farmland but we exist  at the top of the watershed and it's a pretty high elevation relatively high elevation for  where we are a pretty windy site because of that and the ecosystems what we have is a  
**0:15:32-0:15:38:**  large pond in the in the middle of the farm it's about two and a half acres that a lot  of the water flows into and so there's sort of a vein of riparian area of a wetlands that  that then drains into a smaller seasonal creek or something that flows periodically and then  
**0:15:53-0:15:57:**  down into this pond and then we have another watershed that kind of sits just along one  of our boundaries of the property that as we learned actually harvests a lot of the  water from the whole hillside because of the way they chose on the roads to dig all the  
**0:16:06-0:16:11:**  ditches so a lot of the dishes empty right into this area and it can cause a lot of problems  during these heavy rain events so the bottom of our land we have a gully that's almost  six feet deep you can almost stand in it and be lost in it if you're short enough and we're  
**0:16:22-0:16:26:**  working to restore that but it's a product of these these heavy rain events that are  just eroding the heck out of the land so so we have kind of this water to watersheds flowing  through the land and then we have a lot of different little forest types this this farm  
**0:16:36-0:16:40:**  actually was an old nursery and so there's kind of interesting diversity in the tree  species but we have some nice forests dominated with eastern white pine and so more of a pine  area and some pine plantations as well that are areas we're really valuing for winter  
**0:16:55-0:16:59:**  winter livestock quarters for the sheep because they're nice and sheltered and on the drier  part of the land and we have a nice of course sugar maple stand which is probably our healthiest  stand of woods only about a couple acres of the land and then the rest is this mosaic  
**0:17:09-0:17:18:**  of what happens when farmers just stop clearing and so it's a mix of sort of native tree species  and so-called you know quote-unquote invasive species I don't like to use that word and  I actually really think there's value to some of the species that have shown up on the landscape  
**0:17:27-0:17:33:**  especially from a fodder livestock value but um we can talk about that more some of our  research looking at different species and what what kind of nutrition they really offer  to our livestock yeah.  
**0:17:40-0:17:46:**  One of the big topics that we wanted to to talk to you about today and one of the things  that also really inspired us when we were reading your book I actually have the copy  in front of me right now is when you mentioned that you're trying to incentivize a diversity  
**0:17:57-0:18:04:**  of different silvopastural systems and so we'd like to kind of unpack that a bit with  you and to understand you know the decisions why or why you're deciding to do this but  maybe it's worth before that to for you to explain to us you know these different you've  
**0:18:14-0:18:19:**  mentioned it already but maybe elaborate more or describe more these different silvopastural  systems that you've created on the farm yeah.  Yeah I mean I think again I think a lot of people first think of just a grid of trees  
**0:18:27-0:18:35:**  or evenly spaced rows or like an orchard you know spacing as as the way it can look but  I think what's important is that and this is also from the animal perspective like every  single paddock that we move our animals through we move our animals about once a day during  
**0:18:43-0:18:50:**  the grazing season and you know every time they move I feel like their experience should  be different than the last place they were and when I say experience I mean mostly what  they're eating and what they're finding to forage in the landscape and we try to frame  
**0:19:00-0:19:08:**  our grazing as and our our silvopasture as habitat creation I have a background in sort  of environmental restoration we talk all the time about wildlife habitat and the complexities  of that and that it wasn't just a uniform thing it needed lots of different faces to  
**0:19:19-0:19:23:**  to work and it's actually no different for domesticated livestock it's kind of a weird  thing that we haven't we don't talk about livestock and domestic animals in the same  way we do about wildlife but they have the same needs and and they can really benefit  
**0:19:33-0:19:38:**  from having different experiences as they move throughout the landscape and I don't  know if you come across a book the art and science of shepherding but it's actually  based on research done with herding groups in in France have you have you heard of that  
**0:19:50-0:19:54:**  book I've just ordered it actually okay all right you're right that you're housed in the  tree you're supposed to bring it to me I have it on my table and I didn't even read the  title you know what that's funny so we have heard of this book apparently Steve there  
**0:20:04-0:20:11:**  you go well well now it's on your your must read list so super Michael Muray and Fred  Provenza wrote that together and what they really do is they look at the ways traditional  French herding views the landscape and uses animals to to both manage it and and give  
**0:20:23-0:20:28:**  the animals like healthy sustenance and what I found what found was really compelling one  of the stories or certain narratives in that book is it's often seen that you know the  common folks think oh the the herders are just out there kind of like letting the sheep  
**0:20:37-0:20:41:**  roam and they go here they go there whatever it doesn't matter but in the book they draw  this parallel to actually that the herder is more like a chef crafting a meal for their  animals and actually thinks about the sequencing of different foods that the animal gets and  
**0:20:53-0:20:58:**  in that sequencing they find that the overall intake the amount of food the animal eats  and also the health of the animal are both increased as through that experience of eating  a little bit of high nitrogen clover maybe in the morning and then having a later meal  
**0:21:08-0:21:14:**  of grass later on and then moving to something that's really high and condensed tannins often  woody browse has some of the woody browse has high condensed tannins and that can help  slow the digestion down reduce the methane output and also reduce the parasite impacts  
**0:21:26-0:21:31:**  on on grazing ruminants so and it actually does matter their research shows it matters  which order those things happen in okay and so there's a lot of lessons in there to pull  from but the the take home if we come back to the farm and some of our silvopasture things  
**0:21:40-0:21:45:**  is we don't want every single paddock to look the same we want our silvopastures to all  be sort of different to a degree so there's a there's a continuum from really dense forests  to completely open pasture and and then there's a lot of in between about density of trees  
**0:21:57-0:22:04:**  types of tree spacing types of species so we're actually looking to not have the entire  farm in any one type but actually vary that throughout so some thick dense woods are really  great in the fall and winter for us those are sheltered areas that don't actually aren't  
**0:22:16-0:22:21:**  open enough to provide light to the forest floor and won't ever grow forages which is  good because in the fall and the winter we don't want our animals actually grazing because  there's nothing to eat it's not going to regenerate what we want them to do is is be comfortable  
**0:22:29-0:22:34:**  and and eat the hay that we give them right that's that's that time of year so those are  the sheltered areas and that's the most extreme most dense forest and then we have a lot of  space that we're cultivating in between opening up the canopy enough to get that light in  
**0:22:43-0:22:48:**  and establishing good forage in the understory and then there's going to be parts of the  farm where that are still open pasture which has its own advantages during different times  of the year if everything was covered in trees we would probably see a lull in the start  
**0:22:56-0:23:01:**  of the growing season because what happens in civil pasture often is in cold climates  is the the the grasses are slower to start as we go from you know late winter to early  spring but then they tend to catch up and actually do better in the hotter parts of  
**0:23:13-0:23:18:**  the season so we actually want some areas in open pasture and some areas in some tree  cover and some areas in dense tree cover and we find that that's matching up with our kind  of grazing patterns as we get a bit more sophisticated and learn you know a little more every single  
**0:23:28-0:23:34:**  year wow that's that's really interesting and so it's it's also a question of it's not  just a question of animal health and animal well-being but it's also a question of productivity  of food right so you can better balance the productivity of your land is that is that  
**0:23:46-0:23:51:**  is that correct yeah i think there i think that's the beauty of it is it all goes hand  in hand if you are able to have a grazing event on a certain piece of land at the optimal  time and then move the animals so that that land can rest and regenerate optimally you  
**0:24:02-0:24:07:**  can regraise that same area three or even four times in a season in this climate and  that's you know that's ideal because you're getting four times the productivity then if  you just put a big old fence around your whole land and let the animals just go wherever  
**0:24:14-0:24:20:**  they wanted to and that's that's where rotational grazing and silvopasture really you can't  separate those two you have to be integrating both and it also is relates to the the pressure  the animals can put on trees especially young trees when you're not moving them on and giving  
**0:24:31-0:24:39:**  the space a bit of a rest yeah well there's a lot of things to to unpack here but i'm  still still just to understand the the kind of the the impact of this type of diversity  that you're creating i guess that's also got a really important effect on the ecosystem  
**0:24:50-0:24:55:**  services that your land provides right with this diversity of ecosystem of ecosystems  you're also creating a diversity of habitat for biodiversity but also i can imagine it  goes beyond that right yeah i think i mean it's that's a harder thing to it's all hard  
**0:25:08-0:25:14:**  to kind of quantify and measure right uh well we we have a neighbor who lives on on the  same land as us that is an avid birder and i will say that um the both the number of  birds and also the species diversity that we've seen in the last 10 years since we've  
**0:25:26-0:25:31:**  we've started working on this landscape both thinning woods and also planting trees is  has really jumped remarkably and we see species that are really rare for the area and things  like that so so that's where we're you know seeing the farm is becoming more diverse over  
**0:25:43-0:25:49:**  time we can see that visually and and take a note of the species and things like that  i think some of the other kind of ways to measure that are harder too but i i think  that um it's a question we're always asking is what where's the intersection of what's  
**0:25:58-0:26:03:**  good for the the land what's good for our production and livestock goals and what's  good for wildlife or the larger picture and i think there's there's plenty of places to  find the intersection of all those things and do that work whenever we aren't quite  
**0:26:13-0:26:19:**  so sure then we we hold off and we think more we talk to others we research more that sort  of thing one of the the main questions that comes out of um you know understanding your  system is how do you manage with um the complexity of this diversity in the sense you know you've  
**0:26:36-0:26:39:**  got to move the the animals throughout this different these different sections it will  mean different you know types of management different maybe um fencing i'm not too sure  but how do you manage the the the complexity that this diversity creates when you're comparing  
**0:26:51-0:26:56:**  it for example to another silver pasture system where it's just you know rows 15 meters apart  of trees with pasture in between on 40 acres and you know you're just it's just kind of  simple and standard um and you know we can understand now that comes with certain it  
**0:27:06-0:27:11:**  would come with certain not disadvantages but less advantages that this system brings  but maybe in terms of you know efficiency of movement or management it might be more  interesting so i'm curious to know what you what you have to to say about you know the  
**0:27:20-0:27:27:**  complexity of of this type of systems yeah that's a really important question and um  can can really arrest someone from getting started because it can feel really overwhelming  so when i work with folks i i often encourage them to reflect on their own goals and and  
**0:27:38-0:27:42:**  what kind of layers of complexity they're comfortable with because i think it's it's  a personal decision actually um so i like to walk the land almost every day and i like  to observe and i know a lot of tree species and i'm just constant curious and i can think  
**0:27:52-0:27:57:**  about a lot of different little parts of the land simultaneously but i know for other people  that would be that would be too much so i think you have to find where you fall on that  gradient and how much you want to you know nerd out about it and and and integrate it  
**0:28:08-0:28:15:**  into your life um and i always encourage people to start with a smaller area and it's an area  of the land that they can as they're thinking about how to design a silvopasture that they  can both visit routinely and also walk through like entirely so not just walk around you  
**0:28:26-0:28:31:**  know the outside of some dense thicket of brush but actually what's the area i can get  into and observe and take some time to think about and for some people that might be a  much smaller space than for others right so that's one thing is kind of biting off smaller  
**0:28:43-0:28:49:**  chunks and considering who you are and how that how you relate to that um diversity is  important on a site level and it's important at different scales for different things but  one of the errors we made early on was when we were planting trees is we would plant a  
**0:29:01-0:29:06:**  row of trees and in that row we might have five or six different species of trees that  we would you know alternate between you know every other tree or every few trees would  be a different species and that's incredibly hard to manage because those trees are probably  
**0:29:15-0:29:19:**  all growing at different rates they have different needs for pruning different needs for all  sorts of things and and one of the things we realized early on is we we want to grow  trees but we also want to grow them fast enough so that the animals can can start interacting  
**0:29:28-0:29:35:**  with them and so if you have you know even two two species and one grows twice as fast  as the other well you have to wait for the slowest one to be ready for animal interaction  before the other ones can be opened up to it so so we actually plant our rows in monocultures  
**0:29:45-0:29:49:**  and meaning that a single row for a paddock we might just do in one species but then the  next row might be a different species so diversity is not within the row but it's within the  field or within the paddock if that makes sense and then we do have pat we do have uniform  
**0:30:00-0:30:04:**  patterns throughout the landscape we look for patterns to create you know paddocks that  are roughly the same size and then we plant trees on the edges of those paddocks so we  don't want to create all these wonky shapes and you know different sizes and things that  
**0:30:16-0:30:21:**  we have to work around so you know uniformity and and straight lines and rows have their  place but I think overall if we look and zoom out at the site we see something that from  a species level from a pattern level it has that diversity and so I think there's just  
**0:30:32-0:30:38:**  finding that balance between things that's important since you talk about planting trees  and some of the considerations that come with it maybe you could tell us what trees you've  planted following what patterns so that we get an idea of that aspect of your operation  
**0:30:49-0:30:56:**  we started with a lot more a lot a much longer list of species than then we plant now and  I think that's important so we did some test plantings early on to see what what the site  seemed to respond to well and we kind of picked a wide range of species we thought were good  
**0:31:11-0:31:15:**  and then and then saw what they did in the landscape and also kind of refined our own  goals over time these days we're focused on a smaller set of trees that are that we know  have good fodder value for the animals that grow well on our site that we can easily propagate  
**0:31:32-0:31:36:**  very inexpensively I think a thing sometimes you don't realize if you really want to plant  trees extensively on your farm probably a farm nursery is going to be part of your essential  farm infrastructure because it's it's not feasible for most of us to keep buying in  
**0:31:48-0:31:55:**  our tree stock year after year and so propagating some of the easier species that fit well on  your site is a really good way to to go from seedlings that could cost several dollars  apiece to you know several cents apiece or something like that and so we've really we've  
**0:32:07-0:32:12:**  really refined that list down and part of it was researching for the book and really  thinking about which species had had that promise and and for me it's also which species  that we can plant and give a little attention to in the first years and then and then they're  
**0:32:23-0:32:29:**  kind of good if you plant 50 acres of fruit trees you have a lot of management on your  hands for a long time and that's great if you want to do it but we only have I think  a half acre in in fruit and nut trees right now and that's still hard for us to keep up  
**0:32:40-0:32:46:**  with so if we want to plant our farm with trees we got to pick trees that are really  adaptive to the environment and and very resilient and can kind of take care of themselves and  so we've kind of like really and these are great species I was interested in the book  
**0:32:56-0:33:00:**  too like what species work in other parts of the world other climates what are what  are templates because I'm really interested in seeing silvopasture not just happen in  little micro pockets around but like what would it look like to really roll it out broad  
**0:33:09-0:33:13:**  scale and I think one of the things is let's keep it simple let's just get a lot of trees  in the ground quickly that can grow and so in my research I really found that globally  in many climates mostly I'm thinking still you know temperate climates was the focus  
**0:33:24-0:33:30:**  of the book and things like that but we find these species that just do incredibly well  at all sorts of different elevations all sorts of different rainfall regimes all sorts of  different patterns and poplar and willow just kept coming up to the top is like really good  
**0:33:40-0:33:44:**  places to start and probably one of the reasons is because you can take a cutting of that  those trees stick in the ground it'll basically grow another tree yeah if we could do that  with more trees we would agroforestry wouldn't be such a such a niche thing right it'd be  
**0:33:54-0:34:02:**  much more common I agree so so those are great and they're easy they provide a lot of nutritional  benefits to livestock if you wanted to think about feeding them out they provide a lot  of benefits to water areas and riparian plantings and they can produce a lot of biomass whether  
**0:34:16-0:34:21:**  that's beneficial for the site or I went to a farm in Canada during an agroforestry conference  where they were using willow as a power source for the farm as their electricity source so  they're growing it on the edges of the fields and then using that to power the farm you  
**0:34:32-0:34:37:**  know so there's lots of different ways it can be integrated into other systems so those  are great foundations and actually in New Zealand which is a great place to look for  for established you know institutional and government supported grass grazing systems  
**0:34:49-0:34:55:**  New Zealand is certainly far ahead of many other places in the world there's been active  research and promotion of willow and poplar as part of grazing systems for a long time  there okay so I think there's good promise there the other pieces I think we need to  
**0:35:04-0:35:13:**  add are trees that have really dense nutrient composition probably globally in the temperate  climate the most commonly used one would be mulberry and it's one of the highest sources  of protein and nutrients that actually is digestible by even animals that just have  
**0:35:24-0:35:31:**  one stomach like pigs and and poultry this is a tree that's being used in China as a  pig feed source they'll actually harvest the leaf material and pelletize it and feed it  as a pig feed and then for us the other one that's really key is our trees that fix nitrogen  
**0:35:42-0:35:49:**  and and so they're therefore very fast growing and also are helping rebuild soil health so  our go-to in this climate is black locust because it not only fixes nitrogen it also  is it produces an incredibly rot resistant wood and so that's really valuable for a lot  
**0:36:04-0:36:10:**  of you know other projects around the farm and have you planted all of these then on  your farm or have you chosen only a few so we were focused on on those those mainly those  species like I say we have some orchards we have different things going on but but when  
**0:36:22-0:36:25:**  we look at the broad acre part of the farm that's those are the main ones that we're  focusing on at this point yeah and I'm thinking you know what led you to to want to include  trees in pasture because arguably you could say well I have kind of forest areas where  
**0:36:38-0:36:43:**  I'm gonna rotate my animals and utilize that space manage them with animals and then I  have my open pasture which I keep as a different ecosystem but clearly you felt the need to  have a you know bringing in trees into open pasture could you explain us a bit the the  
**0:36:52-0:36:57:**  reasoning and maybe when is it a good idea and maybe when when maybe we should be cautious  of that sure yeah I mean I couple things one is a real interest in in the carbon sequestration  efforts that that we all need to be engaging with so when we're thinning the woods we're  
**0:37:11-0:37:15:**  not necessarily in the short term like storing carbon we're often releasing carbon right  but when we're planting trees and fields we're actively engaging with carbon sequestration  and that when we talk about the climate benefits of civil pasture it is exclusively talking  
**0:37:27-0:37:33:**  about trees in pasture that is where there's a lot of promise for having productive farm  systems and sequestering carbon and and those fast growing tree species and shrub species  that have really dense fibrous root systems so some of the ones I mentioned there's others  
**0:37:45-0:37:49:**  hazelnut is a good example of a shrub species that's incredibly fast growing has very dense  root systems these are these are really the powerhouses of carbon sequestration and so  that's an important goal for our farm the shade and shelter value to our animals so  
**0:38:00-0:38:05:**  in the in the hotter months they want to be under shelter they want access to shade they  don't want to just be an open sun we find really good value in having pretty widely  spaced you know 20 meters 60 feet or so rows of trees that they can access in their paddocks  
**0:38:19-0:38:24:**  and benefit from some periodic shade throughout the day and also I've mentioned our farms  pretty windy so they get some benefit for shelter from the wind and then the other thing  that I am digging into more and have a lot of questions about what we know is is true  
**0:38:35-0:38:42:**  is when we bring trees into pasture we are increasing the fungal presence in the soil  of the pasture so open pastures grasslands tend to be bacteria dominated soils when we  add trees we bring a fungal presence there and that's not only good for soil health for  
**0:38:55-0:39:01:**  cycling of nutrients and water but also again for carbon sequestration and the newest science  is really showing that where carbon lives in tree based systems is actually a lot in  mycorrhizal fungal networks it's not it's definitely in the trees of course it's definitely  
**0:39:10-0:39:13:**  in the root systems but a lot of it's being cycled and held long term in fungal networks  and so I think that's a really important aspect long term is to see our soils which have been  often cleared and stripped that fungal presence is greatly diminished and so we want to be  
**0:39:26-0:39:30:**  active in bringing that back and I think there's just there's no there's no way that doesn't  help every aspect of the farm big and small.  I'd like to get a better idea of when you are planting into the pasture what kind of  
**0:39:40-0:39:46:**  spacing you've chosen in between the lines even you know how dense do you plant the trees  on the line and what kind of or if you don't plant in lines what kind of pattern do you  use would it be possible to get a brief overview because I imagine the full answer is very  
**0:39:56-0:40:01:**  complex but would be great to have a brief overview of how that works and the kind of  the decision making process that you that you choose.  Our approach is kind of different with each area and like I say we often think about the  
**0:40:15-0:40:21:**  intersection between the land needs and our grazing system and how that can be efficient  so sometimes we'll think more about planting trees on straight rows and grids sort of a  good pattern and sometimes the contour of the land provides us a really good template  
**0:40:31-0:40:37:**  to map our trees off of so we might pick a contour line and then do parallel rows from  that line which is something we did at least initially early on and I think that we learned  the hard way if you start planting trees you should accept that many trees will probably  
**0:40:53-0:40:59:**  die in the process both because that's what trees do and because you're learning and that's  okay.  Mother nature plants you know per acre draws upon a hundred thousand seeds from falling  
**0:41:10-0:41:15:**  from the sky being blown in coming up from the soil animals bringing them in a hundred  thousand seeds per acre to produce a finished forest of a hundred to two hundred trees so  there's great there's a lot of trees that start and don't live to be you know in this  
**0:41:27-0:41:33:**  climate sometimes they could live 300, 400 years old right but most of the trees don't  live that long and so that's important to understand is when we plant a seedling it's  one of those hundred thousand seeds they may not all make it and so we try to mimic what  
**0:41:45-0:41:51:**  mother nature does which is to plant really densely and then thin so our rows of trees  tend to be where we'll plant trees as close as a meter three feet apart and no greater  than two meters or six feet apart so we really want to plant them densely and the only exception  
**0:42:08-0:42:16:**  to that would be if I have like a really nice you know grafted tree that has a lot of extra  value to it right a lot of selection a lot of thought and care gone into it I'm going  to give that more space and and baby it a bit more but I'm talking about planting on  
**0:42:24-0:42:31:**  a broader scale with seedlings and so that's what we often think about and then we tried  early on pretty rows that were often very close together we found over time that sheep  it should be at least 60 feet or I guess 20 meters between rows to effectively have a  
**0:42:44-0:42:53:**  good grazing lane and I think it would probably be up to double that with for for cattle and  things like that so we really want to start with wider alleys and then we can always fill  them in so if you imagine starting with two wide alleys on either side of a grazing paddock  
**0:43:03-0:43:06:**  if those trees grow up and the animals can then interact with them well then you can  shift where your paddocks are your fence lines and you could plant you know a next set of  rows in between those ones that are established and so if you wanted to have a denser planting  
**0:43:17-0:43:22:**  long term that might be a good idea another key factor is to think about the fencing and  protection of trees is always going to be cheaper when you when you do it to groups  of trees versus individual ones so whether you do rows or you plant in clusters it's  
**0:43:33-0:43:38:**  better to think about fencing and protection in in a in a group sense than an individual  tree sense because it just becomes really cost prohibitive and difficult to work around  you know individual trees so not always the case but in general if you're thinking about  
**0:43:49-0:43:54:**  how am I going to do this on a lot of a lot of land I think those things are going to  help make it you know a much more efficient process and much more likely to succeed.  Could you tell us a bit more about the difference between planting in lines and in clusters  
**0:44:03-0:44:08:**  and the kind of advantages and disadvantages associated to each?  It depends a bit on the species of the tree so some trees you know we see out in the natural  world they grow in thickets and that's how they prefer like you know poplar stands actually  
**0:44:19-0:44:24:**  genetically or sometimes all the same same species they've they've grown from root suckers  and it can be just literally one one genetic parent that's that produces all this offspring  and so they want that kind of habitat and that kind of environment so that can kind  
**0:44:34-0:44:45:**  of make sense in some contexts. I think that there's again the the patterning of of clusters  or rows or individual trees is a bit about the tree and a bit about the landscape and  a bit about how you want to manage it all at once so there's never one that's that's  
**0:44:55-0:45:00:**  the best there's there's a combination of those things that's the best for the specific  place and at a specific time I'd say too. So we found that for instance we were often  doing cluster planting in some of the wetland and riparian areas and that's sometimes because  
**0:45:19-0:45:23:**  the animals actually aren't engaging with those areas as much and the wildlife can have  more of an impact and so it's easy to kind of fence them out and leave them be. The areas  that we're grazing more frequently which would be the open fields that we've established  
**0:45:32-0:45:38:**  trees we find that rows tend to be a bit more easy to manage and we're just using our existing  portable fence to also keep our livestock off the trees at the same time so we're not  having two fencing systems or anything like that.  
**0:45:50-0:45:56:**  Do you usually use portable fence to exclude the trees from the animals or how do you kind  of deal with these first few years where you don't want animals interacting with those  young trees? Yeah I mean basically we don't have any we don't have any permanent fence  
**0:46:05-0:46:09:**  we haven't had any permanent fence I should say until this year. We're finally putting  some permanent fence in our our winter paddock area but we didn't have that luxury when we  got to the farm sometimes you get a farm that has fencing and actually that was kind of  
**0:46:22-0:46:28:**  nice because we weren't beholden to that decision and we were able to tuck the animals in a  lot of kind of edges and areas that if we had a permanent fence perimeter fence that  probably would have been excluded because often those permanent fences you know keep  
**0:46:37-0:46:41:**  the woods out and keep the animals in the in the pasture so we were able to play a lot  with shapes and size and and patterns like that which was nice and we use a lot of the  just just foldable you know net fencing works great for sheep and it's slow when you start  
**0:46:54-0:46:58:**  but once you get the hang of it I think it's a pretty efficient way to go we do some of  that we also do you know a triple run of the single strand poly wire we'll run that in  between so often what we'll do is we'll use the net fencing as a perimeter and then we'll  
**0:47:11-0:47:16:**  subdivide paddocks with the with you know usually three strands of poly wire because  that's a bit quicker to put up and then we can have an area where they're grazing there  for seven to ten days in moving through different smaller paddocks and then we can move the  
**0:47:25-0:47:31:**  whole the whole bit somewhere else on the land so it works pretty well just a quick  question here it might be a bit of a rookie question but why not use the three strand  wire for all around is it not safe enough for the whole I mean for the whole fencing  
**0:47:42-0:47:48:**  infrastructure yeah yeah yeah for sheep right in this context the the I worked with cattle  for many years before we got sheep and the one thing I miss is that you could keep them  in sometimes with just a single strand of poly wire if they were trained to it it's  
**0:47:56-0:48:03:**  beautiful you almost didn't need anything the sheep are a bit more you know temperamental  of course you could have goats and pigs which it feels like they get up in the morning with  the goal of getting out of whatever fence but the sheep I would say so lambing is a  
**0:48:14-0:48:21:**  factor we have our lambs running with our ewes and they'll get underneath you know if  there's not enough strands that aren't hot enough they'll get underneath and start causing  trouble the ram lambs in particular like to try to go under and over and just have a have  
**0:48:30-0:48:36:**  a good time they're a bit more rambunctious yeah I would say it's mostly it's mostly that  factor is that you know fencing is potentially both a psychological and a physical barrier  but the net fencing provides a bit more of a physical barrier as well as is electrified  
**0:48:48-0:48:54:**  versus I feel like the strand is really more psychological okay because even you know our  we have older ewes that you know if we don't if we don't move them at the right time they're  sheep are fully most sheep breeds are willing to go along with your grazing plan until you  
**0:49:04-0:49:09:**  don't move them soon enough and when they're ready you know they'll start making troubling  decisions about you know breaching the fence they'll start deciding when to move or when  not to yeah they know the grazing plan better than you do yeah so a big rookie mistake we  
**0:49:19-0:49:24:**  made was we used to have just enough fencing for maybe one or two paddocks at a time and  we weren't you know we're not we're not on the farm full time we have other jobs supporting  us as well so you know we weren't always able to set them up at the right time during the  
**0:49:33-0:49:37:**  week and so we'd have all this kind of we weren't able to move them when the grass was  telling us it was time to move or when the sheep were because we'd had to set up the  fence so the take home was we now have enough fence for four to five paddocks at a time  
**0:49:46-0:49:49:**  and we'll set that up all at the beginning of the week and we pretty much have a week's  worth of paddocks ready to go so that we're moving the animals when they're ready or the  grass is ready or both rather than when we have time to do it that makes a lot of sense  
**0:49:59-0:50:07:**  taking a step back to the you know design and implementation of these different of these  systems of the tree systems on pasture there's something quite tempting when you start integrating  elements to integrate many different elements by that I mean instead of integrating just  
**0:50:18-0:50:24:**  you know a fodder tree as you mentioned like a willow into a pasture there's a temptation  to include a tree that can be or different trees that can also produce nuts that can  also produce wood and that can be pollarded for fodder and for firewood for chips you  
**0:50:38-0:50:41:**  know there's kind of this temptations when you this temptation when you get into these  systems to over over integrate if I can call it this and I'd like to know about your take  on this when is it worth to add many different yields to a pasture and when not what are  
**0:50:55-0:51:02:**  the limits of this kind of thinking yeah I think well I mentioned early on we we planted  a lot of different species and I don't I feel like there's this there's this thing that  afflicts a lot of us in agroforestry which is that in the winter we get these catalogs  
**0:51:12-0:51:17:**  of trees and we start thinking about what we could possibly do in the coming season  catalogs come in and it's very easy to add this and 25 of this to the shopping cart right  and and then you you pay for it and then you forget about it and suddenly in the spring  
**0:51:28-0:51:31:**  you've got this boatload of trees coming and you don't even know where you're gonna put  them right that's like something we've done so many times and so what I would say is one  way to temper that is to ask yourself the question you know how many species can I get  
**0:51:46-0:51:55:**  to know in a season as intimately as I might get to know a good friend so not just knowing  their name or or or where they might like to be planted but like what's their root structure  like what's their branching structure do they need to be pruned in the first year when do  
**0:52:05-0:52:12:**  they flower when do they set seed you know what what insect and pest pressure might they  they experience all sorts of different things right so it's not just knowing a couple things  but really getting to know a few species at a time I think is one of the things I wish  
**0:52:22-0:52:29:**  I had done earlier is take the time to do that and so you know it's okay to start with  a couple and then add on as you as you go and in the same way with the yields it's beautiful  in your mind conceptually and again I think this happens a lot in the winter we think  
**0:52:39-0:52:45:**  and we dream about all the possibilities of what we could do and then it comes to when  we actually are on the ground what can we do what what do we actually with all the realities  and the constraints of of life and and the ecosystem like what are we actually doing  
**0:52:56-0:53:01:**  and I don't visit successful farms that have you know a hundred different products what  people tend to do over time is they try a bunch of stuff and then they refine it down  to just a handful of things that actually work well for them like oh my body likes doing  
**0:53:11-0:53:16:**  this thing you may think you want to grow a bunch of wood for chipping let's say but  if you work behind a wood chipper for one day I know that I I now exclusively trade  usually with a local arborist to just deliver us wood chips because I'm I don't want to  
**0:53:29-0:53:32:**  stand behind a wood chipper all day I have no desire to do that we've done that on like  you know tens of days and and and grease on Massey farm like chipping olive pruning has  been like this crazy task so I totally get what you're saying like end up with this cute  
**0:53:42-0:53:46:**  little pile right and you're like oh that's like I worked for four hours and I think I  can mow so it's important to think about and learn because in your mind you can imagine  this is all going to be great but you know what do you actually want to do with your  
**0:53:58-0:54:04:**  time what does it look like and and I think less is more I think starting with a few things  and building upon that is really important so if I add an element to my farm how is it  connected to the other elements not adding something that's completely separate completely  
**0:54:15-0:54:20:**  out of out of you know some other other space is going to require other equipment and other  expertise and things like that so for us back to the silver pasture when we really thought  about all the cool things that silver pasture could offer what we decided was most important  
**0:54:30-0:54:36:**  for us was planting trees for shade shelter and fodder for animals that's what we're interested  in from the livestock perspective and then we wanted to see those trees for the environment  sequester carbon and and restore good habitat for wildlife so that's already a lot of things  
**0:54:51-0:54:54:**  but it's a lot less than saying yeah I want all the benefits and all the possible things  so none of our trees we're not growing fence posts we're not growing stuff for wood chip  material we're not trying to also produce a large crop of tree you know tree nuts or  
**0:55:04-0:55:09:**  fruit or something like that so that's what we decided for us and the scent the silver  pasture is centered around supporting the sheep and the health of the sheep both nutritionally  and sort of medicinally I have a friend up the road who has an apple cider orchard and  
**0:55:21-0:55:25:**  he has sheep and he also has geese and he has a much smaller group of sheep than us  he has we have you know like I said 60-65 he runs about six or eight and he has a flock  of 15 geese and the reason he has those numbers is not because he's trying to run a profitable  
**0:55:37-0:55:44:**  livestock enterprise he's actually trying to run a healthy orchard and if he had 65  sheep he would be driving himself crazy trying to feed them all summer and what he wants  to do is take care of his apples so he has the sheep there to support his tree crop system  
**0:55:53-0:55:57:**  right and I think that's a really important distinction I think that if you want to go  into a tree crop system you can have livestock but probably at much smaller numbers and density  than if you want to have a livestock system because I don't think the numbers often match  
**0:56:10-0:56:17:**  up so we did a grant project where we actually looked at raising ducks in our in our shiitake  yard to reduce the slug damage we were experiencing and our proposal was oh this will be great  we'll have ducks we can reduce slug damage and we can also raise a meat duck but after  
**0:56:31-0:56:36:**  doing that for two years we crunched the numbers and we realized that for slug protection we  actually only needed about 20 ducks but to run a good meat enterprise we needed to raise  at least 300 a year yeah and 300 ducks in the woods does a lot of damage actually to  
**0:56:47-0:56:52:**  the to the leaf cover on the forest floor so it's actually not a positive effect on  the ecosystem right so so I just like to offer those because the number of animals the density  and all the different types of crops people often want to marry they don't always match  
**0:57:04-0:57:09:**  up and so you have to kind of think well what are my cash crops and what are my subsistence  crops and which elements might support you know the cash crop and and I think you can  find a lot of different combinations that work but very few farms that I know of do  
**0:57:21-0:57:26:**  you know a massive nut or fruit orchard as well as a very large livestock operation they're  usually focused on coming at it from one angle or the next well that's I think that's some  really good advice I can definitely identify to to that trying to pile everything on top  
**0:57:35-0:57:40:**  of each other and not necessarily thinking it well through the the clock is ticking though  and there is something that I wanted us to talk about is animal fodder and a bit of the  behavior of animals could you tell us you know how much of tree fodder do your sheep  
**0:57:53-0:58:00:**  can eat and you know what kind of proportion of their diet does it represent so it depends  on the year and we're very much figuring this out this is why we got into silvopasture was  because in 2016 we'd already started planting trees on the farm we were playing with different  
**0:58:11-0:58:17:**  things but the word and the concept of really intentionally doing silvopasture really hit  home as more of just like a curiosity in 2016 when we had the driest year I've ever experienced  here and apparently one of the driest years on record in this part of the world and during  
**0:58:31-0:58:35:**  that time we did our we had this beautiful rotational grazing plan we moved the animals  around the farm we did did our first rotation in the spring we came back to the you know  that first paddock and the grass hadn't regrown at all it was just it shut down and it was  
**0:58:45-0:58:50:**  a particularly intensive drought coupled with really extreme heat and so the animals were  like feeling that as well and it was a point in time when we saw our our fellow farmers  you know buying up all the hay they could find from other parts of the state or the  
**0:59:01-0:59:05:**  country you know really searching for that people were draining their ponds it was sort  of this thing where we're like oh when these things hit like we're none of us are really  ready for this like what does it look like to be ready when stuff gets hard for us we  
**0:59:14-0:59:20:**  decided with our catatons at that time to try browse grazing them basically we we stopped  grazing them on the pasture because we knew that would do damage and we started fencing  them in these large woody hedgerows and edges and all the parts of the farm that we had  
**0:59:31-0:59:35:**  not paid attention to basically in the first four or five years said oh yeah we'll get  to them someday we'll clear them out but they became really essential and our animals lived  off of this woody vegetation for about 45 days without any grass it was just all woody  
**0:59:46-0:59:53:**  vegetation and and we I mean at that point we had a very dense again these were very  dense areas no one had ever managed them so there was a lot of material available and  what happened was our work pattern shifted from moving them every day moving fencing  
**1:00:01-1:00:06:**  to going in and cutting trees down with loppers and hand saws and chainsaws and actually thinning  stuff and we actually just did that again a bit this year a little less intense but  we had a abnormally dry year which wasn't as extreme but we certainly saw some dry patterns  
**1:00:17-1:00:23:**  and it was a very cold and late spring and so the grass never really kind of came online  it was very slow this year but we put our animals in a new area of woods and and fed  them a substantial amount of their food this summer as well from from the tree fodder so  
**1:00:35-1:00:41:**  that works for now the key is that these are areas of the land that again have been neglected  from management for a long time so there's a lot of stuff there for them to eat and as  we keep kind of hitting them hard with these more extreme seasons we're seeing you know  
**1:00:49-1:00:56:**  we don't know what the the response is going to be long term so for us fodder is is an  emergency food source and it's something that we're realizing very quickly that we have  to manage in order to sustain long term because it's not trees are not going to work in the  
**1:01:05-1:01:11:**  same way of grasses where i can graze it rest it for 30 or 40 days and then come back and  graze it again frankly we don't know exactly the recovery and what that looks like and  that's something that we all in the agroforestry world need to need to do some investigating  
**1:01:24-1:01:32:**  on and share our findings you know all that being said what we do know is that there's  ample vegetation out there it's just a question of figuring out how to manage it and and i  was fortunate i've been over to england a few times and visit some remnants of some  
**1:01:43-1:01:48:**  of the coppice uh forestry systems that are still being managed there and you can see  when it's actively managed in an intentional way how much vegetation can be produced and  sustained on a on a small piece of land so i think it's a question of what does it look  
**1:01:59-1:02:05:**  like to to potentially get there but for now it's an emergency food source for us and it's  also we see it as a nutritional supplement so in a normal year we'll do a good amount  of pruning we'll do a good amount of thinning and we'll bring stuff to the animals what  
**1:02:14-1:02:18:**  we find with tree fodder is that the nutrient density is much higher than in most of the  pasture forages and then we know things like willow i mentioned willow there's a lot of  research about the the condensed tannin value and the tannins in willow if fed to animals  
**1:02:33-1:02:38:**  will reduce the the parasite pressure on their system and it will also reduce their methane  that's that's been pretty well documented and you'll see in the animals they'll only  eat so much willow because it it's harder for them to digest it's it's like drink drink  
**1:02:50-1:02:54:**  a nice uh light wine versus something really high in tannins right it kind of fills you  up or like yeah or like a stout versus uh an ale you know these things yeah same kind  of thing it's like oh i can only have so much of this so it has that medicinal benefit so  
**1:03:04-1:03:08:**  we make sure that the the sheep are getting access to willow you know ideally weekly through  their grazing cycle they're not necessarily needing it every day but we want to make sure  they're kind of dosed up on it and they have it available to them um and so that's kind  
**1:03:16-1:03:21:**  of how we see it now long term um we'd love to be planting what are called fodder blocks  which are much more dense intentionally planted areas that we graze a little bit harder and  we hope to do research to see how they respond but that's going to you know take some years  
**1:03:29-1:03:34:**  to both establish and manage and really start to understand but then if you were um taking  the the coppice example uh could you imagine systems where they can harvest that matter  themselves instead of you having to prune the trees and bring it to them i think so  
**1:03:43-1:03:49:**  i think um we're doing a lot of pollarding of existing trees now because we want to have  control over when they hit it um but i think yes i think what we see and there's there's  definitely more examples in the tropics in silvopasture we can see areas getting fully  
**1:04:02-1:04:11:**  um coppiced uh and there's examples with um entire fields being planted sometimes 40 000  stems to the acre and then just getting grazed wholesale um and then recovering and being  able to sometimes be grazed again in the same season now that's again in the tropics so  
**1:04:22-1:04:27:**  we have a different climate that allows for that but yeah i think those kind of things  are feasible um and but you know we need to try stuff out on a smaller scale and start  to understand it's going to get real specific to the region in the part of the world but  
**1:04:37-1:04:43:**  i i think there's great potential in it and what we know is that woody uh plants do much  better to to in terms of growing and sustaining themselves in extremely dry and extremely  wet scenarios um so all these dry years what we see is that the pasture can crisp up really  
**1:04:55-1:04:59:**  quickly but the trees kind of look normal right like they they're still doing their  thing they're very efficient at that so whether we're you know thinning larger trees coppicing  pollarding playing with these things i think what we know is it's a reliable source of  
**1:05:10-1:05:14:**  vegetation it's not that's not the question the question is how we manage it to really  sustain it in the long term but do you see ways um in which we could use fodder to feed  animals that would be efficient in time because if i understand correctly at the moment either  
**1:05:25-1:05:29:**  you're in a position where you're in extreme times so somewhere you're just not counting  your time because if your animals have nothing to eat obviously you'll do whatever it takes  for them to have food or you're in like normal years where you just give them a small amount  
**1:05:37-1:05:42:**  of fodder so it doesn't take that much time so but i'm wondering if we could think of  a system when in normal years um maybe with those like fodder blocks do you think that  would be reasonable in terms of management and the number the amount of time you have  
**1:05:52-1:05:56:**  to spend pruning and bringing that matter to them i think it's feasible for certain  species i think there's going to be again some of the ones i mentioned before probably  our best candidates to figure out and um one of the things we have done is um some of the  
**1:06:07-1:06:13:**  willow that we've coppiced is does really well it produces these nice um multi-stemmed  re you know clusters of regrowth and we'll take that cluster and we'll actually tie some  twine around it and bundle it up and then we'll just cut it at the base and then we  
**1:06:23-1:06:26:**  just have that whole bundle that we throw on the tractor and bring to the animals right  so that's a lot more efficient um in many ways but i i get what you're saying and i  think that it's important to think about ways that we can have the animals freely browse  
**1:06:35-1:06:40:**  material as well as ways that we can kind of harvest and choose when to feed out material  so um sure i think it's theoretically feasible it's certainly not the it is not the foundation  of our grazing the foundation of our grazing program is still good pasture forages and  
**1:06:51-1:06:56:**  still establishing good forage in tree systems i think the tree stuff we can continue to  kind of pepper in there and then figure out over time what it might look like yeah there's  a really interesting um or there are some really interesting machines um or at least  
**1:07:07-1:07:14:**  what seemed interesting to me when i was looking at them that can harvest um that can copies  actually um for example willow and some of them that can actually um that were much more  heavy duty and maybe not so feasible for a farm maybe as a in a cons as a group of different  
**1:07:26-1:07:31:**  farms but that could literally harvest willow and bale it as well so i think that might  be something interesting to look at in these systems to try you know mechanize the harvesting  the copy thing and the pollarding that can easily be transported to other areas or can  
**1:07:40-1:07:44:**  be easily just dropped on the floor and get the animals in there i don't i don't know  if you've got some ideas about i'm sure you've seen some of these machines yeah a lot of  them there's been a lot of work in the states around using like willow as a biomass plant  
**1:07:53-1:07:58:**  and so there's plenty of data and research about you know basically planting willow almost  like you plant corn in a field and having this dense stand come up and then harvesting  it all a lot of that machinery though like chipped it up so it wasn't you know it's not  
**1:08:06-1:08:10:**  as good for a food source but there's there's definitely other machinery that could potentially  be adapted or utilized and um it's it it's like any agricultural challenge i i we grow  elderberry a bit and we're we're working on figuring out how to make that efficiently  
**1:08:20-1:08:26:**  work as a as a product to sell um but it's very labor intensive to harvest and and we  see this time and time again that agricultural products it's it's not a question of if it  can be done it's a question of if there's enough will and interest from folks to say  
**1:08:34-1:08:38:**  this is important enough to develop that machine or that piece of equipment right and i think  that um as more and more people get interested as we we think about these things whether  we're adapting some existing equipment or we're coming up with something new i don't  
**1:08:47-1:08:53:**  think that's the limiting part it's it's the will for us to want to see trees as an integral  part of our landscape and our grazing system and that's still the hill i'm trying to climb  is getting people excited about that because a lot of a lot of farmers i don't know how  
**1:09:01-1:09:06:**  it's what it's like for you and your all's experience in europe but in the states i'll  do these talks and conferences and these farmers will come up to me and say wait you know i  was told to take all the trees out of my pasture and now here you are telling me to put all  
**1:09:13-1:09:18:**  these trees in the pasture you know this is a psychology that's been persistent for for  quite some time and that's actually probably like my lifetime's worth of work is hopefully  to help help uh change that a bit and then maybe you know then we'll start talking about  
**1:09:30-1:09:35:**  the next level which is really scaling and and doing these things and and that that might  be the realistic pace this has to happen at i don't know i want i want to dig deeper just  on one aspect here because um if i can explain one of the experiences that we saw in greece  
**1:09:45-1:09:50:**  is where there was we were in a region where there are a lot of shepherds and the guys  there are are pollarding their mulberries they actually there's mulberries for decorative  purposes that are planted everywhere in the towns in the villages and also on the farms  
**1:10:00-1:10:06:**  and so they're there's something decorative and beautiful there and um they're pollarded  and so all the farmers go into during the the end of the summer they go into when the  past is starting to be starting to struggle a lot especially in that climate or when you  
**1:10:15-1:10:20:**  know they're basically the fields that they've left to dry um as a storage is a technical  term for this but i forgot the name um dry stock or i don't know what it is so that when  that's all been eaten they go into the village and they they're actually the the arborists  
**1:10:30-1:10:35:**  of the of the villages and they prune all the trees they put um with chainsaws or with  loppers and they put it in their in their pickup trucks and they take it to their to  their animals and just to go a bit in more detail into what you said because i'm very  
**1:10:45-1:10:51:**  curious about this for your operation your scale um it doesn't you're saying that it  doesn't quite make sense economically speaking like in terms of your time um and yeah in  terms of the value of your time to go into a system that you've planted and to pull our  
**1:11:01-1:11:07:**  trees with the chainsaw with loppers and to have that as as as an important source for  the animals is that why you're not using it or if not what's the reason why you're not  doing that specific management type well i think we are it's just a it's again it's more  
**1:11:18-1:11:23:**  of a supplement than like the main course right um okay and i think it's mostly the  volume of material and uncertainty about its recovery and not wanting to overdo it um i've  been mostly pleasantly surprised that the recovery and you have to think you know uh  
**1:11:34-1:11:39:**  let's say a mulberry tree in greece that's been there for 80 years is going to have a  much different recovery track than a mulberry i planted five years ago you know that yeah  the ability of an established system to regenerate is really powerful and if you have a one of  
**1:11:51-1:11:55:**  the things has been beautiful working with farmers from all over is some of them realize  that they have these legacy trees they have older things that have been managed in this  way in the past and that they could take that back on and they get really good regeneration  
**1:12:04-1:12:10:**  from those older trees and and start to see them as so valuable to their operation i think  that's a big thing um and for us a lot of the woody land like i mentioned is covered  in you know these so-called invasive species which like one of the most common that's on  
**1:12:21-1:12:33:**  our farm um is we we know it as european buckthorn um and it uh responds to grazing and pollarding  and pruning so well like it has no problem with uh with getting hit and and recovering  and it's it's ironic because a lot of the conservationists around around them get really  
**1:12:45-1:12:48:**  mad at it because it's so hard to eradicate you can't get rid of it you can't cut it down  you can't dig it out you know you can't even put it pesticide on it it won't kill it but  that kind of resiliency is exactly what i want in a fodder tree right because i want  
**1:12:56-1:13:03:**  to be able to have the animals um hit it beat it eat it and it's come back um and so we're  looking for those indicators in the landscape and we can we'd rather manage the ones that  exist and are showing those then you know tear those out and put some other species  
**1:13:11-1:13:17:**  in so i think there's plenty to work with but yeah from an economic perspective we put  the time into harvesting when we have it and it can be really quick like so we keep a pair  of loppers in the cart that we we we move with the sheep that has the um the battery  
**1:13:31-1:13:37:**  for the the you know the energizer in it and we have a nice hand saw and all that and so  anytime we have 10 minutes we can harvest quite a bit of stuff for them to gnaw on it's  not going to feed them their entire diet but it's a bit of a supplement and so no we do  
**1:13:46-1:13:51:**  that pretty routinely around the farm um but it's still important to have the foundation  i think of a grazing system be in the forages and and i think it's a good it's a good encouragement  for new folks to say okay i'm well i'm not trying to replace everything i'm trying to  
**1:14:01-1:14:06:**  just add in um and again when you start doing the research you really see that the value  of the woody brush is dense nutrients um and also resiliency to to extreme weather and  so those are just things to kind of keep thinking about i confirmed to you that um in greece  
**1:14:20-1:14:24:**  the the trees that they are pollarding are are at least 30 years old usually you know  minimum 20 and but then they hit them every year they take off everything all of the branches  every year and then the next year they're another like in some cases two meters three  
**1:14:34-1:14:41:**  meters tall um you know like regrowth um very dense they they provide shade for whole terraces  i wanted to ask as well just in terms of uh understanding the animal behavior you mentioned  that you had a specific breed that's actually a pretty good browser um how important is  
**1:14:51-1:14:57:**  the breed then in terms of um sheep or cows or eating that fodder probably pretty important  i you know we haven't tried you know 10 different breeds side by side to see um i know again  um i'd recommend folks check out uh fred prevents his work um which is not just about the french  
**1:15:11-1:15:16:**  herding we talked about but also a lot of research he did um in the u.s around animal  preference for brows and different different foods and they found you can train and and  teach animals they may not always have the instinct or the familiarity with certain foods  
**1:15:28-1:15:33:**  but you can definitely work with them to to start eating more of those in their diet so  um but obviously that can take more time and energy so i think my recommendation is you  you you select a species uh that best matches your landscape and and the things you're going  
**1:15:45-1:15:48:**  to be feeding it and then recognize there might be some training or some some work along  the way but i i do think that a lot of them can can learn uh to value it um they just  may not be familiar so like our friends uh up the road have a sheep dairy and their their  
**1:15:59-1:16:04:**  sheep get uh pretty pampered um you know they're they're they're balancing diet more they're  feeding out a lot of alfalfa and sort of um you know they're milking them every day and  so they're getting this this dose of things as they go through uh food to to keep up the  
**1:16:13-1:16:19:**  nutrition and so they're a lot less um interested in you know the scrubby brows on the edge  of the farm because they know they're going to go get the pampered you know spa treatment  when they go to the milking parlor um and so they're not as interested but uh our animals  
**1:16:29-1:16:32:**  are used to fending for themselves and kind of finding what they can landscape and so  they're really um game for trying almost anything and a lot of plants even that i've seen on  toxic plant lists are actually things that our animals readily eat and are interested  
**1:16:44-1:16:51:**  in um which is really interesting so i think it all depends on on that relationship um  and uh and so there's it's part nature and part nurture i guess is that is the short  answer to that um one one more thing i want to say about breed it's really important when  
**1:17:00-1:17:07:**  you select a breed not just those characteristics but also your local community um so we almost  picked a really obscure sheep breed but we decided not to because um we would be the  only people within like a five-hour radius that had this breed which makes it really  
**1:17:17-1:17:24:**  hard to diversify your breed find a ram all these kind of things long term and so partially  why we chose cotons is because we could find five or six other farms pretty close by that  had the had the same breed and we're interested in keeping that a pure a pure stock and that's  
**1:17:34-1:17:40:**  been really helpful from us uh you know being able to raise and keep a healthy healthy genetic  pool in our in our flock so so keep that in mind a larger large the larger context is  also important i think when you're when you're selecting the type of animal yeah and that's  
**1:17:49-1:17:56:**  that's super interesting um but if i understand properly then you also have um so you have  pasture where you're establishing trees and then you're also establishing forages in uh  wooded areas that you're thinning right yeah and um yeah i was just wondering how the management  
**1:18:07-1:18:12:**  of that rotation within the trees how that works you know um is it much different than  having them in pasture logistically but also in term of the timing and the density you  might use for the flock i'm also thinking in in terms of you know potential damage to  
**1:18:24-1:18:29:**  the existing woods yeah there's there's there's definitely differences um but they're the  same differences that i experienced with just open pasture where at different times of the  year and different different realities hit um you know the grasses never grow all at  
**1:18:38-1:18:43:**  the same rate even within the same field um it's always a bit surprising to see those  variations and try to figure out why that's going on but one of the things we learned  early on with the woods is that we really need to establish wide alleys where you can  
**1:18:52-1:18:58:**  get your fencing in um you know initially we thought enough to kind of crawl through  with the net fence was good but uh it gets stuck on every every twig and we quickly realized  we needed to have at least a you know four feet or so of width whatever the size of your  
**1:19:10-1:19:14:**  your mower your brush hog your your tractor was a good width to to make sure you have  cleared um so that you can get the fencing in and out unless you're doing something more  permanent so that's i think one piece um we try to uh as we've learned our grazing system  
**1:19:26-1:19:31:**  we know which paddocks are going to be really robust in the spring we try to save the silva  pasture areas like i said they're a bit late to start as it's warming up and they also  tend to do hold on better in the hot part of the summer so for us here we try to graze  
**1:19:41-1:19:46:**  the open fields earlier in the season and then move the animals into the wooded areas  you know during those hotter times if we can try to guess when those are right because  it's it's a bit different every year um we we formulate a grazing plan so we have a grazing  
**1:19:58-1:20:02:**  plan with paddocks and and our where we think we're going to move them next but it's not  like we start at paddock one and and go two three four five six seven you know all the  way to 45 or whatever um we often are bouncing around a bit more and that's often because  
**1:20:13-1:20:17:**  we're we're seeing what's happening in the land we say actually this area is ready let's  go here first and then we'll we'll go back to that other part so um i feel like grazing  is is wonderful because it forces us to be out on our farm observing what's going on  
**1:20:27-1:20:32:**  and constantly making those decisions but you can't ever count on it being uniform even  without a silvopasture and so so you you're you know that farm walk the loop walking around  seeing where your fields are is is essential to to making sure everything's going to work  
**1:20:43-1:20:49:**  well on that uh really interesting um final notes which i think is a perfect place to  stop the interview actually um um yeah i think it's we've covered everything that we wanted  to cover during uh during uh for this interview and you've answered um very precisely and  
**1:21:02-1:21:07:**  very interestingly um all our different uh all our different questions so thank you so  much for this um i wanted to ask you something quickly as um as a listener of the podcast  as you mentioned at the at the beginning i'm curious to know what you'd like to what you'd  
**1:21:19-1:21:23:**  like to hear on the podcast what would you like to hear more of for example or ideally  what would you like us to who would you like us to interview what would you like us to  ask what would you like us to focus on well there's so many things i think um i mean i  
**1:21:34-1:21:38:**  learn a lot from the just different stories and experiences people are having as they're  implementing agroforestry you know in a lot of different contexts i think that's great  so the more you know i specifically kept the book to the temperate climate because i knew  
**1:21:48-1:21:51:**  i didn't have a lot of experience in other climates but i can still learn a lot from  people's experience um i really feel like in agroforestry we we all need to to tap into  sort of the indigeneity of of agroforestry a bit more i think there's a lot of older  
**1:22:03-1:22:09:**  wisdom out there in the landscape and it's probably not people who uh maybe are online  or on podcasts right like my um one of my forestry mentors uh um you know doesn't have  a cell phone the way i find him as i go like knock on his door um so i don't know how that  
**1:22:22-1:22:28:**  works for your podcast but you know that that expertise and experience is so important of  of people who have been like in in landscapes for a long time you know um but the other  thing is i would love to connect you all with some folks like um who are doing this this  
**1:22:43-1:22:48:**  whole tree fodder piece is i think interesting to a lot of people but there's only there's  not that many people that are like drilling really deep but there are some folks doing  some cool stuff like in england they're doing they were i don't know if they're still doing  
**1:22:54-1:22:59:**  it with some research with tree hay and like storing it for winter and then feeding it  out and i know a farmer up in maine who's who's a really interesting uh woman who is  doing some cool stuff with tree fodder so okay stuff is some people i could connect  
**1:23:09-1:23:16:**  you with yeah that would that would keep digging that that trench and um as a final question  um what's the top tip that you would give to a current farmer or a new farmer that's  starting in silver pasture i think we've we've hit upon it a lot it's it's really important  
**1:23:30-1:23:37:**  to start small with uh chunks you can bite off and chew and digest and understand that  to establish trees we're talking about at least uh you know two or three seasons worth  of work in one place so when you're thinking about planting trees it's okay if i plant  
**1:23:49-1:23:54:**  100 trees this year and i plant 100 trees next year next year i also have to take care  of those other 100 trees and then the third year i have to take care of the new 100 trees  i plant plus the 100 i planted the year before plus the 100 i planted so think about the  
**1:24:03-1:24:08:**  number of trees you feel like you can plant and manage in a year and if it's 10 that's  great and if it's 100 that's great if it's a thousand that's great but just try to try  being really realistic with that and um you know less is more in that sense and and you  
**1:24:20-1:24:25:**  can increase the scope and the intensity of the work as you get more comfortable with  the work so start small and allow it to grow as it should  we hope you enjoyed this episode as much as we did as usual you can find all the relevant

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:34:30)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:48:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:53:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we had a special kind of session.  
**0:00:53-0:01:00:**  If you recall Matteo from our first episode on the podcast and you may also know Koon  
**0:01:00-0:01:04:**  from investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast.  
**0:01:04-0:01:08:**  We actually all ended up reunited in Susano on Matteo's farm and so we thought it would  
**0:01:08-0:01:12:**  be a good idea to have a chat together.  
**0:01:12-0:01:17:**  And so we asked on social media, we asked you what you wanted us to talk about and the  
**0:01:17-0:01:23:**  most prominent questions were how to get started in farming or how to get started in agroecological  
**0:01:23-0:01:25:**  farms and agroforestry.  
**0:01:25-0:01:29:**  So we had a chat about this, how to kickstart an operation.  
**0:01:29-0:01:34:**  We bounced some ideas back and forth and as you know farming is a huge adventure and it  
**0:01:34-0:01:37:**  requires thorough preparation and planning.  
**0:01:37-0:01:40:**  So we hope that this conversation can give you some food for thought.  
**0:01:40-0:01:45:**  If you enjoyed this experimental episode let us know and we can try to work out some more  
**0:01:45-0:01:48:**  collabs so enjoy.  
**0:01:48-0:01:56:**  Thank you for accepting this invite and yeah we got a few questions and one of the key  
**0:01:56-0:02:03:**  ones that came out out of three out of the five questions we received from our listeners.  
**0:02:03-0:02:07:**  One of the questions that came out the most was starting a farm.  
**0:02:07-0:02:13:**  A lot of people want to know about how to start a farm and possibly what tips we could  
**0:02:13-0:02:18:**  give to a new farmer that doesn't necessarily come from a farming background and that wants  
**0:02:18-0:02:24:**  to get into agroecology and regenerative agriculture but also potentially from the finance perspective  
**0:02:24-0:02:26:**  how to get it started on the finance side.  
**0:02:26-0:02:30:**  So maybe we start with that Matteo do you want to go ahead?  
**0:02:30-0:02:32:**  Don't do it.  
**0:02:32-0:02:40:**  No it's a very complex question because it is really connected to the context, to the  
**0:02:40-0:02:45:**  country, to the region, to the climate, to our attitude.  
**0:02:45-0:02:49:**  So it's very difficult questions I would say it depends.  
**0:02:49-0:02:57:**  Normally the best idea is to go and volunteer and work in the highest diversified farms  
**0:02:57-0:03:03:**  around the world for a few months, a few years in order to get a sense of what it means farming  
**0:03:03-0:03:08:**  even though farming from other people is not the same as starting your own farm, having  
**0:03:08-0:03:15:**  responsibilities and having your own operation going on and the stress and all the rest.  
**0:03:15-0:03:20:**  So site analysis is extremely important and site analysis is not just about what soil,  
**0:03:20-0:03:28:**  what climate, what crops I could grow, it's about neighborhood, it's about the neighbors  
**0:03:28-0:03:33:**  that are at the borders of the farm as well, the neighborhood in terms of the economy,  
**0:03:33-0:03:40:**  the market where I can sell, how I can sell, how I should sell as well as if it's a touristic  
**0:03:40-0:03:47:**  area or is an area where there are already lots of vegetable farms or lots of grass fed  
**0:03:47-0:03:49:**  meat producers.  
**0:03:49-0:03:54:**  It's very important to be extremely convinced in starting a farm.  
**0:03:54-0:04:02:**  When you don't have to do it you really have to want to start a farm because it's tricky.  
**0:04:02-0:04:08:**  So it's very important, something I didn't say, to inform yourself to go and ask to the  
**0:04:08-0:04:15:**  local health and safety department, the veterinary health and safety department, the authorities  
**0:04:15-0:04:22:**  that take care of the whole thing about food processing, about food production and you  
**0:04:22-0:04:27:**  really have to know what you should do, what you can do because I know many farmers, many  
**0:04:27-0:04:33:**  people that started beautiful, very well working farms from agronomy and management point of  
**0:04:33-0:04:38:**  view but then they had big problems with health and safety issues.  
**0:04:38-0:04:40:**  So this is very important.  
**0:04:40-0:04:46:**  For example in our case the health and safety institution organization, a local organization  
**0:04:46-0:04:54:**  told us that we are not going to have chickens for production and two hours away from here  
**0:04:54-0:05:01:**  our friends started a farm and health and safety organization told them why don't you  
**0:05:01-0:05:04:**  start with eggs and grass fed chickens.  
**0:05:04-0:05:06:**  So it really changes a lot.  
**0:05:06-0:05:10:**  I think it's a very good point of context and you need to take a decision what you want  
**0:05:10-0:05:15:**  to do based on the experience you have around the world and volunteering and working on  
**0:05:15-0:05:16:**  other farms.  
**0:05:16-0:05:21:**  Do you want to run it, I wouldn't say it as a lifestyle business but do you want to run  
**0:05:21-0:05:25:**  it, like how do you want to run it with you and or your family depending on if that's  
**0:05:25-0:05:26:**  there.  
**0:05:26-0:05:29:**  Do you want to scale it as a business which might be ending up buying a lot of land or  
**0:05:29-0:05:35:**  managing a lot of land or do you want a highly diversified farm that mostly is on the homesteading  
**0:05:35-0:05:40:**  side you're selling enough to supply to get enough cash in basically to manage your life  
**0:05:40-0:05:41:**  and that's okay.  
**0:05:41-0:05:44:**  Like really what are your choices and do you need to own the land or not?  
**0:05:44-0:05:45:**  Are you going to be operating on somebody else?  
**0:05:45-0:05:52:**  Like what's the smallest possible thing you can try somewhere and then the crucial bit  
**0:05:52-0:05:56:**  like every farmer you always meet needs a market otherwise you're just living on the  
**0:05:56-0:06:00:**  land which is great which is not a thing but you're not farming and farming is a business  
**0:06:00-0:06:07:**  if you choose to make it like that meaning that it's extremely important to understand  
**0:06:07-0:06:13:**  your market, the prices, the taxes, the competition or other collectives you can work with.  
**0:06:13-0:06:18:**  It makes no sense to farm the most amazing regenerative farm chickens if nobody in your  
**0:06:18-0:06:23:**  area is buying chickens and people underestimate that a lot and it's very difficult because  
**0:06:23-0:06:27:**  you have to be really really good at farming, really really good at processing, harvesting,  
**0:06:27-0:06:28:**  etc.  
**0:06:28-0:06:32:**  Really good at marketing, really good at accounting, really good at delivering and that's very  
**0:06:32-0:06:34:**  difficult to have that in one or two people.  
**0:06:34-0:06:39:**  That's why we often see from a finance perspective it's really really difficult to invest in  
**0:06:39-0:06:44:**  smaller ones because it's so difficult to get a good handle on the numbers and to understand  
**0:06:44-0:06:47:**  the margins which probably are there but to understand the accounting because simply there's  
**0:06:47-0:06:49:**  no time to do the accounting properly.  
**0:06:49-0:06:52:**  So it really depends where you want to run it as a business which means you need to follow  
**0:06:52-0:06:54:**  certain business rules.  
**0:06:54-0:06:57:**  If you want to run it as a farming business and you want to sell you also need to follow  
**0:06:57-0:07:01:**  certain like Matteo said hygienic rules and in business there are certain rules like certain  
**0:07:01-0:07:05:**  accounting principles you need to follow if you ever want to get a bank loan or if you  
**0:07:05-0:07:07:**  ever want to get an investor which we get to later.  
**0:07:07-0:07:13:**  You have to be able to show that you're able to sell for a price that covers more than  
**0:07:13-0:07:17:**  your costs very simply and you have to be able to show that you're following your accounting  
**0:07:17-0:07:21:**  your hours which nobody does it in farming almost nobody and be able to say okay if I  
**0:07:21-0:07:26:**  invest X or if I get more hours meaning I hire somebody I can do more but you have to  
**0:07:26-0:07:32:**  be unfortunately able to fill out a spreadsheet and if you decide to go down that route and  
**0:07:32-0:07:37:**  I think we need a lot more farming as businesses or entrepreneurs in farming that are able  
**0:07:37-0:07:40:**  to do that not because we need to make a lot more money etc we need to be able to do those  
**0:07:40-0:07:46:**  calculations to really change farming because for now most of the discussions in farming  
**0:07:46-0:07:49:**  in extractive agriculture are about the use.  
**0:07:49-0:07:53:**  We never asked the question okay what were the costs even apart from the externality  
**0:07:53-0:07:56:**  costs and all the environmental costs and social costs but simply what are the costs  
**0:07:56-0:08:01:**  if you look most are let's say barely or not profitable and if we want to have a dent and  
**0:08:01-0:08:05:**  change something we need to be able to show like this is at least equal if not better  
**0:08:05-0:08:09:**  and I'm completely convinced we can do better and we can have the margins and more profit  
**0:08:09-0:08:14:**  flowing back to the land but we have to be able to show that if you want to go down that  
**0:08:14-0:08:18:**  route if you want to go the entrepreneurial route and you want to have manage and manage  
**0:08:18-0:08:23:**  a company we have to run it as a company and that's a choice you make at the beginning  
**0:08:23-0:08:26:**  and maybe you run a company on top of somebody else's land which is like you run the chickens  
**0:08:26-0:08:30:**  not a Mateus farm because he's not allowed but somewhere else two hours from here and  
**0:08:30-0:08:34:**  maybe that's what you do and you optimize for that in the context of the land and the  
**0:08:34-0:08:38:**  landscape and the customers etc but without customers a market and without understanding  
**0:08:38-0:08:44:**  your numbers which can be super boring I understand it's very difficult to be able to convince  
**0:08:44-0:08:48:**  others to join you or to convince somebody to put money to work so I would say really  
**0:08:48-0:08:54:**  boring answer market and numbers and understand your numbers context apart from usually the  
**0:08:54-0:08:58:**  hygiene because if you're not allowed to do things you're gonna end up pretty quickly  
**0:08:58-0:09:02:**  in a lot of trouble obviously I mean what I see from all of this is and also from my  
**0:09:02-0:09:11:**  experiences it takes so many skills to farm and it's just absolutely crazy and that's  
**0:09:11-0:09:15:**  one of the things that you know I would give advice to people based on my experience again  
**0:09:15-0:09:20:**  it's it's go slow and train yourself really properly and that's something that I didn't  
**0:09:20-0:09:26:**  do enough of and that I'm doing now but it's got a high cost just get started without being  
**0:09:26-0:09:30:**  fully prepared and you have to be prepared as you said in business you've got to also  
**0:09:30-0:09:34:**  be prepared in terms of your local context understanding it legally financially the economics  
**0:09:34-0:09:39:**  of it the markets but also in terms of all the many many skills that you need because  
**0:09:39-0:09:46:**  mistakes in farming they actually cost a lot as much financially as emotionally and you  
**0:09:46-0:09:50:**  can easily find yourself with an overwhelming situation and which you're not in control  
**0:09:50-0:09:55:**  of so I really like this idea of looking at the numbers to be in control of of your business  
**0:09:55-0:09:59:**  because in being in control of your business means that you know you are able to adapt  
**0:09:59-0:10:05:**  it to you and so what you want to prevent the burnout because we see we all know people  
**0:10:05-0:10:10:**  that have worked at farms and have traveled seed the complexity of starting farms using  
**0:10:10-0:10:16:**  regenerative approaches which adds a lot more complexity compared to a normal between brackets  
**0:10:16-0:10:23:**  and people burn out very very regularly and it's 80 hours plus and if the cash flow doesn't  
**0:10:23-0:10:27:**  come in and you're struggling to make ends meet like there are only so many years you  
**0:10:27-0:10:33:**  can do this and I would urge everyone to think okay this is a 20 30 40 year journey you're  
**0:10:33-0:10:39:**  starting probably hopefully because we need you but make sure you can make those 20 30  
**0:10:39-0:10:43:**  but like well there's no it's no use for anyone that after two years completely burned out  
**0:10:43-0:10:47:**  your body is finished your mind is finished your relationship might be finished and then  
**0:10:47-0:10:51:**  what are you gonna do and we in the movement need people that are gonna do this for 20  
**0:10:51-0:10:56:**  30 40 50 years unfortunately not fortunately but we need you're doing a marathon and be  
**0:10:56-0:11:01:**  ready for that physically mentally financially because you're gonna it's a long game it's  
**0:11:01-0:11:05:**  not something that in two years suddenly boom like stuff explodes and everything will be  
**0:11:05-0:11:11:**  fine this is a very long slow in terms of sometimes very fast game sounds all quite  
**0:11:11-0:11:15:**  negative what we're saying it's amazing I mean if you have able to do it and against  
**0:11:15-0:11:19:**  all odds and we're so early in the sector it's amazing yeah you really as you said before  
**0:11:19-0:11:26:**  you really have to be clear with yourself if it's an alternative job that you you want  
**0:11:26-0:11:32:**  or if it's a lifestyle it may be simpler to see it as an alternative job because you're  
**0:11:32-0:11:42:**  gonna be sharper less in the air less dreamy and you start just with one production one  
**0:11:42-0:11:48:**  activity without thinking about too many things together and you do that but of course it's  
**0:11:48-0:11:56:**  not just like an alternative job because the amount of variables that exist in nature and  
**0:11:56-0:12:01:**  in agriculture they're just uncountable every year is something different you thought okay  
**0:12:01-0:12:07:**  next year I'm gonna do it right now there will be another problem but also other opportunities  
**0:12:07-0:12:11:**  there is something very important about this whole thing that we never take into account  
**0:12:11-0:12:19:**  which is not a financial thing is not a production or connect something really touchable which  
**0:12:19-0:12:27:**  is how farming can change people and it can change society because farming is a perfect  
**0:12:27-0:12:34:**  substrate to deal with humbleness to deal with the frugality to deal with all these  
**0:12:34-0:12:40:**  very important things that makes us better people sooner or later if you don't give up  
**0:12:40-0:12:45:**  of course and I think it's something that it can't be quantified from an economical  
**0:12:45-0:12:51:**  point of view but at the end of the game if we are not just interested in money and actually  
**0:12:51-0:12:56:**  we are speaking about regenerative agriculture regenerative agriculture is not just a set  
**0:12:56-0:13:01:**  of different techniques to make something different and be very good and kind with the  
**0:13:01-0:13:08:**  planet no it's also to change the society I personally don't really don't care about  
**0:13:08-0:13:16:**  changing the agronomy behind our production the methods if I don't change myself and the  
**0:13:16-0:13:22:**  people that surrounds me and the society that surrounds me because I don't care to give  
**0:13:22-0:13:29:**  food good food high quality food producing a very good ecological way to people that  
**0:13:29-0:13:36:**  are still behaving in the same way and I think this can't be quantified not yet but as we  
**0:13:36-0:13:41:**  are trying to quantify and to give value to ecosystem services this is an ecosystem service  
**0:13:41-0:13:46:**  yeah that's very interesting for sure and actually if we go down this kind of this path  
**0:13:46-0:13:51:**  of looking at a young farmer or a new farmer that wants to get into this job a big part  
**0:13:51-0:13:56:**  of it is a big part of the conversation and especially when you become you're a new farmer  
**0:13:56-0:13:59:**  and there's quite a lot of idealism and etc one of the big things that we have to deal  
**0:13:59-0:14:05:**  with is complexity and diversity and by diversity I mean diversity of our production etc so  
**0:14:05-0:14:11:**  you know it can often be very tempting to get into a huge world of diverse products  
**0:14:11-0:14:15:**  and just and complex farm you can imagine it or at least I can imagine it quite well  
**0:14:15-0:14:20:**  maybe because we are in one of these farms here but with somebody like you might do has  
**0:14:20-0:14:24:**  a lot of experience we can manage it and I struggle to manage that complexity at the  
**0:14:24-0:14:28:**  beginning when we got started because there was just too many things to learn if I had  
**0:14:28-0:14:34:**  simplified a bit my task and I had started with smaller and complexified through time  
**0:14:34-0:14:38:**  and maybe not as much as I did right now on Massey Farm I would have probably been better  
**0:14:38-0:14:42:**  off so I think it would be nice to talk about that as well because that's something that  
**0:14:42-0:14:47:**  people will want to understand better so how much to complexify and how much diversify  
**0:14:47-0:14:51:**  and I think I know that you had a really interesting point of view from the finance perspective  
**0:14:51-0:14:54:**  there as well and you're looking at projects that are trying to finance themselves and  
**0:14:54-0:14:59:**  they're trying to communicate as well with investors and what do you have to say about  
**0:14:59-0:15:00:**  that?  
**0:15:00-0:15:05:**  I think there's a tension between complexity and finance because as soon as you are going  
**0:15:05-0:15:11:**  out of your context out of your farm let's say looking for outside money looking for  
**0:15:11-0:15:14:**  bank loans but probably your local bank has no idea what you're doing so that's sort of  
**0:15:14-0:15:20:**  a no-go area so you might be wanting to go down the crowdfunding route or crowd lending  
**0:15:20-0:15:24:**  if you talk about investing or speaking with a number of people that somehow through a  
**0:15:24-0:15:28:**  lot of luck mainly have access to a lot more wealth and might want to invest in you they  
**0:15:28-0:15:32:**  might come and visit which happens a lot in places because especially the lighthouse farms  
**0:15:32-0:15:39:**  obviously have a lot of attention as soon as you want to somehow get outside capital  
**0:15:39-0:15:43:**  to be put to work on your farm on your land or the land you're working almost by definition  
**0:15:43-0:15:46:**  you have to write down what you want like you have to at least make a plan okay I'm  
**0:15:46-0:15:52:**  gonna use this twenty five thousand dollars or euros or whatever to do XYZ and as soon  
**0:15:52-0:15:57:**  as you write that down I think you automatically have less complexity because you sort of  
**0:15:57-0:16:01:**  have to plan you have to say okay over the next years I'm gonna use this freezer for  
**0:16:01-0:16:05:**  XYZ I'm gonna use this processing equipment or I'm gonna plant a thousand trees doing  
**0:16:05-0:16:09:**  this and that and this is more or less the market and this like you have to sketch something  
**0:16:09-0:16:15:**  that in a very complex and very diverse farm is not clear yet like it's something that  
**0:16:15-0:16:18:**  over the years you will figure out because every year is different just like Matteo said  
**0:16:18-0:16:24:**  so there's that tension between managing on the go and wanting to take a loan for twenty  
**0:16:24-0:16:28:**  five thousand euros to do XYZ or fifty thousand or a lot more depending on your context and  
**0:16:28-0:16:32:**  your space so I think there is a sweet spot and it really really really depends and I  
**0:16:32-0:16:37:**  would say probably the easiest to get around is to raise for specific projects to not try  
**0:16:37-0:16:42:**  to raise okay we need two million to do everything on this farm to the perfect level saying no  
**0:16:42-0:16:46:**  we start small or we start we need a freezer and a freezer will get us this this and this  
**0:16:46-0:16:52:**  or we need to build six tractor chicken tractors and we need to buy X amount and the chicken  
**0:16:52-0:16:58:**  operation let's imagine it's a separate operation is gonna yield in five years time that the  
**0:16:58-0:17:02:**  loan has this and this and this and then we know we got to pay it back if it exactly comes  
**0:17:02-0:17:07:**  from the chickens or not is not necessarily the point but you need to know at least from  
**0:17:07-0:17:10:**  the beginning that you're able to pay back that loan or able to pay back the investor  
**0:17:10-0:17:15:**  if it's a profit share etc so it forces you to also plan which is not necessarily a bad  
**0:17:15-0:17:19:**  thing maybe you do the numbers and you do some calculations and figure out oh it's actually  
**0:17:19-0:17:23:**  not such a good idea at the moment or maybe it just takes back almost it pays back the  
**0:17:23-0:17:27:**  principal but it helps the land a lot and then it's okay that's a different investment  
**0:17:27-0:17:32:**  in different time but in itself so I think it's a good process even if you're not interested  
**0:17:32-0:17:37:**  to do it is to go through a few of those exercise and to see okay what could it yield could  
**0:17:37-0:17:41:**  it go faster with outside money but if you say okay I want to do the most advanced in  
**0:17:41-0:17:47:**  tropic agroforestry system with 30 40 different types that's gonna be a very big spreadsheet  
**0:17:47-0:17:51:**  to imagine all those variables it's impossible for sure but so you have to sort of get it  
**0:17:51-0:17:54:**  out okay these are the five cash crops out of that system there are more we know that  
**0:17:54-0:17:58:**  maybe one year we sell a lot of that maybe another year we sell a lot of that but let's  
**0:17:58-0:18:03:**  see this as extra that's nice insurance but if we can pay it back with these five over  
**0:18:03-0:18:07:**  ten years or five years whatever then we're good and then the other is extra so you have  
**0:18:07-0:18:11:**  to start thinking more in boxes unfortunately because you have to explain it to an outside  
**0:18:11-0:18:15:**  person that can never understand your complexity why you need that money and how it's gonna  
**0:18:15-0:18:20:**  flow back at some point plus return and that seems to be quite a lot in tension with what  
**0:18:20-0:18:24:**  you're doing here Mateo as well which you have a very diverse farm and actually the  
**0:18:24-0:18:28:**  way that you're selling it has a big part to play in that you know so I mean how do  
**0:18:28-0:18:33:**  you but I'm curious how did you do that Masi well this is interesting because I mean on  
**0:18:33-0:18:37:**  Masi farm we were in a position where the selling directly which is what Mateo does  
**0:18:37-0:18:42:**  here and that enables also huge diversity selling directly and to a local community  
**0:18:42-0:18:48:**  Masi farm we don't have that so we have to either send to Athens or go further and so  
**0:18:48-0:18:54:**  we had to plan yeah but we didn't plan enough at the start and we found it already complex  
**0:18:54-0:18:58:**  to plan for like five core species even that it's interesting because that's the same as  
**0:18:58-0:19:02:**  number you mentioned earlier on but even that was actually just random to sell because you've  
**0:19:02-0:19:07:**  got to you've got to consider okay who's gonna buy that are they gonna want to buy if we  
**0:19:07-0:19:11:**  sell for example to organic shops around are they gonna want to buy just one of our produce  
**0:19:11-0:19:16:**  or they want to buy a kind of a brand set of so all these considerations that we mentioned  
**0:19:16-0:19:20:**  earlier on we're trying to work them out I wouldn't say we have like an economically  
**0:19:20-0:19:25:**  running system yet but we're working out by testing you know we've sold in different places  
**0:19:25-0:19:29:**  we've interacted with different types of sellers and buyers and intermediaries we've also tried  
**0:19:29-0:19:34:**  direct selling and so but further out you know not just in not in our local island which  
**0:19:34-0:19:40:**  doesn't have a market for us and so yeah it's been testing to see where we could go and  
**0:19:40-0:19:43:**  actually it's actually intention with what I was saying at wrong because sometimes you  
**0:19:43-0:19:48:**  can't plan from the start sometimes you have to do and then work things out tests probe  
**0:19:48-0:19:53:**  throw things in different directions see what comes back and then you can create a plan  
**0:19:53-0:19:56:**  but if you don't know exactly what you're getting into because you're a new farmer and  
**0:19:56-0:20:00:**  you are trying to work things out you can't know it all from the beginning so yes you've  
**0:20:00-0:20:04:**  got to get started and that's gonna have a risk but also you can't do too much of it  
**0:20:04-0:20:08:**  because otherwise you're gonna you're gonna sink so which is completely normal from a  
**0:20:08-0:20:12:**  company starting perspective like you write a business plan you start and they always  
**0:20:12-0:20:15:**  joke like you throw it away with the first customer because it's completely different  
**0:20:15-0:20:19:**  than you wrote in your business plan and then it's to your quality of can you pivot can  
**0:20:19-0:20:24:**  you change can you find the niches that work and can you stay alive like can you keep going  
**0:20:24-0:20:28:**  keep eating at least because you need like somewhere on that journey you're gonna find  
**0:20:28-0:20:32:**  the niches that work could take five years ten years could take at least you need to  
**0:20:32-0:20:36:**  make sure that you're still there because otherwise you can find the best niche in year  
**0:20:36-0:20:41:**  six but if in your five you went bankrupt and you lost the land so it's also there so  
**0:20:41-0:20:45:**  okay how many tests can I do what's the risk of every test and is the risk taking down  
**0:20:45-0:20:50:**  the whole thing or not or are they small calculated risk that you can keep going okay and this  
**0:20:50-0:20:53:**  apple variety is gonna work for cider and actually there's a cider market and then year  
**0:20:53-0:20:58:**  five and year six and suddenly it goes but you need to be from the get-go know or at  
**0:20:58-0:21:03:**  least have an idea how to get to year five six ten etc because it's gonna take what I  
**0:21:03-0:21:07:**  hear from you what I'm seeing it's gonna take a couple it's not year one you figure out  
**0:21:07-0:21:11:**  okay this is the golden key and now we're it's gonna take time which is okay but be  
**0:21:11-0:21:16:**  ready we have to be good in giving value to the fact that we are actually reinventing  
**0:21:16-0:21:23:**  landscape management and how do we give a value to something that people don't even  
**0:21:23-0:21:29:**  perceive as something concrete so in your case in at Massey farm probably the most let's  
**0:21:29-0:21:36:**  say spontaneous thing to do which is normally connected to the fact when you don't have  
**0:21:36-0:21:41:**  a local market that can absorb your produce it means normally that you are in a remote  
**0:21:41-0:21:49:**  rural area remote rural area is what people from the city seek for actually you are also  
**0:21:49-0:21:56:**  in a beautiful remote rural area with the sea and in a beautiful island so sometimes  
**0:21:56-0:22:01:**  we have to be more flexible and throwing away our dream of being like the producer that  
**0:22:01-0:22:06:**  goes to the farmers market with the hay hat and say no I just set up my system to be a  
**0:22:06-0:22:13:**  regenerative system in order to change the ecology of this island and to stop desertification  
**0:22:13-0:22:20:**  to stop erosion to sequester carbon to lower down local temperature and so from one point  
**0:22:20-0:22:27:**  of view you are creating the basis to recreate a society in a desertic island at the same  
**0:22:27-0:22:33:**  time you're using what you can use which is like the tourist potential which someone in  
**0:22:33-0:22:40:**  the peri-urban area around Milan is not gonna manage to do nobody's gonna come in holiday  
**0:22:40-0:22:46:**  to spend some times in the polluted and ugly concrete district and little by little you  
**0:22:46-0:22:52:**  will be creating a new community it's just like we do what nature does there will be  
**0:22:52-0:22:58:**  no life if there is no photosynthetic potential and biomass production and animals once the  
**0:22:58-0:23:04:**  animals start to arrive once more plants start to arrive the system gets more abundant more  
**0:23:04-0:23:09:**  productive and it will attract more and more species more and more people more and more  
**0:23:09-0:23:14:**  plants but we have to start from somewhere so yeah I think this is very important like  
**0:23:14-0:23:24:**  discover and use the potentials that your land has rather than trying to mimicry something  
**0:23:24-0:23:30:**  that is happening successfully somewhere else eventually our farm is gonna become like a  
**0:23:30-0:23:38:**  workshop for a proper technologies and low-tech tools for gardening and terraforming Mars  
**0:23:38-0:23:45:**  and all sorts of activities that apparently they are not connected to farming but regenerative  
**0:23:45-0:23:52:**  farming makes them possible to happen in a farm where before it wasn't possible so you  
**0:23:52-0:24:01:**  have to be more disconnected to how to say you have to be more flexible but flexible  
**0:24:01-0:24:10:**  it doesn't mean to grow pumpkins or tomatoes no to open a B&B or to have fish in tanks  
**0:24:10-0:24:16:**  like aquaponics or to attract people because you are planting a beautiful forest which  
**0:24:16-0:24:23:**  is not going to produce any food but is producing oxygen sequestering carbon is the only shaded  
**0:24:23-0:24:31:**  spot in 20 square kilometers so really to have to create a new idea of not farming landscape  
**0:24:31-0:24:38:**  management it goes back also to your context right and to define a bit what's your I mean  
**0:24:38-0:24:42:**  there needs to be some flexibility but there also needs to be some deep thoughts about  
**0:24:42-0:24:46:**  you know how you want to lead your life and going to see different farms and different  
**0:24:46-0:24:51:**  projects that are running things in different ways to experience them oneself and ask for  
**0:24:51-0:24:56:**  the numbers and see and see how long they work and see do I want to do that or not or  
**0:24:56-0:25:02:**  what's what it's a very deep decision on lifestyle and what you want to do and it's a very big  
**0:25:02-0:25:06:**  commitment you make to your landscape if you decide to put roots down there and you're  
**0:25:06-0:25:11:**  going to be there you're going to be there for a long time probably and that's it's not  
**0:25:11-0:25:17:**  something to take lightly and also think that you know just to give a bit of a without creating  
**0:25:17-0:25:22:**  big principles out of it but the experience on Massey farm has been an evolution where  
**0:25:22-0:25:26:**  you arrived we tried we tested lots of things and you know we're in very tough conditions  
**0:25:26-0:25:31:**  with a lot of wind very shallow soil a big drought I mean it's serious the conditions  
**0:25:31-0:25:36:**  there but you know what we're finding out is that there's a local fig called the Kimi  
**0:25:36-0:25:42:**  fig which is firstly an amazing tree but secondly there's a market for it and we're starting  
**0:25:42-0:25:47:**  to see wow wait we can also start to go more into the traditions of the area because what's  
**0:25:47-0:25:52:**  done there for a reason it's done there not far from us actually we're on the southern  
**0:25:52-0:25:57:**  limits of this of what they call the the Kimi fig producing region and so and then we're  
**0:25:57-0:26:02:**  seeing okay well there's sheep around the place and lots of sheep it's kind of our regions  
**0:26:02-0:26:06:**  more known for sheep and goats and we're seeing that okay so we started we tested out the  
**0:26:06-0:26:10:**  market with the figs we're seeing that there's a demand we can make different products with  
**0:26:10-0:26:14:**  it and we're seeing especially that the tree it has the capacity to deal with our conditions  
**0:26:14-0:26:18:**  it's very resistant to the wind it doesn't the fruit don't get damaged the fruit don't  
**0:26:18-0:26:22:**  fall in the wind it's just very adapted and you know the less what you give it the sweeter  
**0:26:22-0:26:27:**  the fruit so you know it's time to tick some boxes and so we're focusing on this suddenly  
**0:26:27-0:26:31:**  and how many years is that in like how long did it take like just to give a perspective  
**0:26:31-0:26:38:**  like from first idea or from starting to starting to see oh that's an interesting line of I  
**0:26:38-0:26:42:**  think it's like three years for us and pretty fast for some it could be for some it could  
**0:26:42-0:26:46:**  be quicker and maybe for some as you guys are saying it could be slower but it took  
**0:26:46-0:26:50:**  us three years to to realize that you know there's something that we can we can do with  
**0:26:50-0:26:55:**  this and that the and also maybe at some point we're gonna you know transform a lot of the  
**0:26:55-0:27:02:**  trees we planted for forage for the sheep who knows and then copies them regularly and  
**0:27:02-0:27:06:**  then we'll have a silvopastia system with figs and sheep roaming underneath and that  
**0:27:06-0:27:11:**  might be so it's also about that flexibility of also taking the system where it kind of  
**0:27:11-0:27:18:**  wants to be taken and the land feed us information and adapting to it I think rigidity is a bit  
**0:27:18-0:27:22:**  of a problem and especially in agroecology where you know you're trying to not base yourself  
**0:27:22-0:27:28:**  on huge inputs and chemistry which is a very powerful tool so you've got to be I think  
**0:27:28-0:27:35:**  it's another argument to be flexible. And then comes the question okay let's say you're  
**0:27:35-0:27:40:**  starting to see the do you then see potentially I'm not saying now now but potentially a  
**0:27:40-0:27:47:**  role for finance to speed things up or not. Well I think that the timing in our context  
**0:27:47-0:27:52:**  again the timing would have been key because if if somebody came a few years ago. I mean  
**0:27:52-0:27:56:**  now because you're so you're talking about okay this is emerging we're observing the  
**0:27:56-0:28:00:**  land we're seeing where it wants to go we're seeing what makes sense or what starts to  
**0:28:00-0:28:04:**  make sense from our context the business a land perspective a social perspective our  
**0:28:04-0:28:10:**  perspective like do you are you comfortable now then to have a potential discussions like  
**0:28:10-0:28:16:**  that is that or is it still oh it's still a bit too early like I feel. Yeah I think  
**0:28:16-0:28:20:**  that it's or is it not useful at all I mean it could possibly be no that the financing  
**0:28:20-0:28:26:**  is key but it's also it's the right time when it's the right time when you have the ability  
**0:28:26-0:28:31:**  to use it efficiently and not to put yourself in danger or also the investor or the funder  
**0:28:31-0:28:35:**  or whatever in danger because at some point you know when you're a new farmer you might  
**0:28:35-0:28:39:**  not be the right time for that and then there's a trick I mean it's tricky that in that position  
**0:28:39-0:28:42:**  because where do you get the funding then and you know how many years you need to train  
**0:28:42-0:28:46:**  yourself before you gain some credibility but it's only after and even if you've trained  
**0:28:46-0:28:49:**  yourself in your revenue new context you know you need to experience the context to be able  
**0:28:49-0:28:55:**  to make the right decisions so there's a timing thing and I think that now it could be entering  
**0:28:55-0:29:00:**  a phase maybe now in the next year where we could be thinking okay let's we could be efficient  
**0:29:00-0:29:05:**  and we could be smart with money coming outside and we could plan a business to create a serious  
**0:29:05-0:29:10:**  business plan one that's based on reality on a reality of we know where we're gonna  
**0:29:10-0:29:14:**  sell our figs who we're gonna sell them to what price we can sell them to we've done  
**0:29:14-0:29:18:**  tests to know how much it takes us to process it what labor we need we know where we're  
**0:29:18-0:29:21:**  gonna find it these are all things we know now I'm saying them because we know them and  
**0:29:21-0:29:26:**  they're key now to really make a solid business plan and to really be able to either scale  
**0:29:26-0:29:32:**  or change or just speed up living out of it and yeah to speed up the objective which is  
**0:29:32-0:29:37:**  to sustain a family from farming so yeah I think that's what I would say to that.  
**0:29:37-0:29:42:**  Mateo could you use investors from outside at what point would it have been good for  
**0:29:42-0:29:48:**  you and especially now would it help you do you see a place of investors on small family  
**0:29:48-0:29:50:**  farms like yours?  
**0:29:50-0:29:57:**  I don't think I'm the right person to answer to this question as people would expect I'm  
**0:29:57-0:30:03:**  saying I don't need money I don't need money because anytime that I wanted to do something  
**0:30:03-0:30:10:**  I started very little or I started and if it was possible to start it and if it wasn't  
**0:30:10-0:30:15:**  possible to start it and I really wanted to do it I created the substrate in order to  
**0:30:15-0:30:17:**  start it.  
**0:30:17-0:30:26:**  To me the finance thing it should go mainly into pushing institutions creating movements  
**0:30:26-0:30:34:**  in order to change policies which are the very big problem for farmers and for the development  
**0:30:34-0:30:39:**  of regenerative agriculture of different techniques different approaches so we really need to  
**0:30:39-0:30:44:**  change the policies because if you look at European policies on so many things like food  
**0:30:44-0:30:52:**  processing on again animal management and animal regenerative animal husbandry is a  
**0:30:52-0:30:58:**  problem I mean we are either in different situations you find yourself in an illegal  
**0:30:58-0:31:04:**  position or in a borderline position which is not good because you don't you are already  
**0:31:04-0:31:08:**  stressed by the climate you're already stressed by the market you're already stressed by so  
**0:31:08-0:31:14:**  many things when you're farming if you're already also stressed by the fact that someone  
**0:31:14-0:31:20:**  can come to the farm and check and see that you're not doing things properly as policies  
**0:31:20-0:31:24:**  are asking is not good it's not good for you it's not good for the movement is not good  
**0:31:24-0:31:31:**  for the stability of the system so policymaking it should not come from farmers.  
**0:31:31-0:31:35:**  Farmers should require because they don't have time they don't have the head they don't  
**0:31:35-0:31:41:**  have the energy they don't have the context they don't have the knowledge so policymakers  
**0:31:41-0:31:46:**  are policymakers and they should ask farmers what they need so if a policymaker comes to  
**0:31:46-0:31:53:**  me and ask me so I can't change these rules these laws what should I change I tell him  
**0:31:53-0:32:00:**  I want to be able to manage my chickens in this way I don't want to have the same rules  
**0:32:00-0:32:06:**  in my commercial kitchen processing facility that the industry is having can you change  
**0:32:06-0:32:12:**  it for me yes don't worry I'm gonna find who's gonna invest in a advertisement campaign and  
**0:32:12-0:32:13:**  this and this and that.  
**0:32:13-0:32:17:**  But that's not investing that's grand I think I have a different take I think we need the  
**0:32:17-0:32:23:**  issue with the movement now that it's made of too many farmers that are stressed out  
**0:32:23-0:32:27:**  and don't have the time to engage in policy I mean the first time we saw somebody engaged  
**0:32:27-0:32:32:**  in policy in the US actually in the House of Representatives was a few weeks ago when  
**0:32:32-0:32:38:**  Gabe Brown spoke why because he got to a level that he had time for that as well so what's  
**0:32:38-0:32:45:**  missing like we're against a lobby that has a lot of money a lot of time to lobby and  
**0:32:45-0:32:50:**  in order to get to something that's why I'm thinking if there's a role for finance it's  
**0:32:50-0:32:55:**  to get to farmers and farms as successful farmers to a level where there's maybe 10%  
**0:32:55-0:33:00:**  of your time going into policy because we need more successful examples for policymakers  
**0:33:00-0:33:06:**  to look at and to engage with and if we rely on overstressed burned out farmers to engage  
**0:33:06-0:33:10:**  with policymakers we're going to be in the same mess 10 years from now like we need you  
**0:33:10-0:33:17:**  Mateo to have more time to engage with policymakers and if you don't have the time you don't engage  
**0:33:17-0:33:21:**  which is perfectly fine but it means policies are not changing because people in the city  
**0:33:21-0:33:27:**  have no clue and rightfully so and they come and visit etc but if we have farmers that  
**0:33:27-0:33:31:**  are getting to a level where they can have dedicated a bit of their time I'm not saying  
**0:33:31-0:33:36:**  that but just a bit to start engaging start discussing start nudging it also means that  
**0:33:36-0:33:40:**  these farms need to get to a level where the time is available and is not absorbed and  
**0:33:40-0:33:44:**  that everybody is working 80 hours a week so I'm scared if we don't take the timing  
**0:33:44-0:33:48:**  part serious this policy is always the last thing on Friday afternoon and why we should  
**0:33:48-0:33:53:**  also do policy and that never happens because we're against a lobby that has time and creates  
**0:33:53-0:33:57:**  time by a lot of money simply and has the lobbyists in Brussels and and I think with  
**0:33:57-0:34:01:**  the movement we need to get to a level we also have the lobbyists in Brussels because  
**0:34:01-0:34:04:**  these rules you can change we've seen that in sustainable renewable energies you can  
**0:34:04-0:34:08:**  actually change these things with time and money and focus and people that are doing  
**0:34:08-0:34:12:**  that and feeding them with the right things okay this is the context we need to understand  
**0:34:12-0:34:16:**  around chickens and this is the context that we need to understand around vegetables and  
**0:34:16-0:34:21:**  these are all the rules that really limit us now but getting a proper overview of that  
**0:34:21-0:34:25:**  and what needs to change is a very dire it's yeah it takes time.  
**0:34:25-0:34:31:**  It's in that way we need to convince people that these alternative ways of farming, agro-cological  
**0:34:31-0:34:35:**  ways of farming are viable systems to feed the population because I feel like that's  
**0:34:35-0:34:38:**  one of the biggest arguments that goes against it.  
**0:34:38-0:34:39:**  Absolutely.  
**0:34:39-0:34:44:**  So I think that that's also part of the issue is that we really need to start creating systems  
**0:34:44-0:34:48:**  that are functioning and that are productive.  
**0:34:48-0:34:50:**  We can see and visit and taste.  
**0:34:50-0:34:53:**  Productive per hectare that are also productive per labor hour.  
**0:34:53-0:34:54:**  Per landscape.  
**0:34:54-0:34:57:**  Which is not the most interesting part of farming at all.  
**0:34:57-0:34:59:**  Keeping records is horrible.  
**0:34:59-0:35:03:**  Yeah and it's you know the interesting part of farming is understanding the ecological  
**0:35:03-0:35:07:**  I want to say that for myself not for everybody but for me it's an understanding ecological  
**0:35:07-0:35:12:**  interactions between species and seeing how we can use a tree to produce as much as possible  
**0:35:12-0:35:17:**  for us and you know this this is what's fascinating it's not fascinating to sit and do the spreadsheets  
**0:35:17-0:35:22:**  or to go out and find the market to sell whereas maybe for some this is the you know.  
**0:35:22-0:35:24:**  And we need those as well.  
**0:35:24-0:35:29:**  Like if you are a seller and isn't it fascinating that until I think a year ago there was only  
**0:35:29-0:35:34:**  one proper paper written about profitability of regenerative farms.  
**0:35:34-0:35:39:**  One which is hilarious but very sad if you think about it now there are a few more but  
**0:35:39-0:35:46:**  we need like the very dry numbers sometimes and in Brussels and in Washington and in Milan  
**0:35:46-0:35:51:**  and Rome and in the other policy places we need unfortunately sometimes also the dry  
**0:35:51-0:35:52:**  numbers.  
**0:35:52-0:35:56:**  And the record keeping and to show.  
**0:35:56-0:35:59:**  It seems from what you're saying that just bringing it back to the earlier conversation  
**0:35:59-0:36:05:**  numbers and all these this economics not the economics but the well it is the economics  
**0:36:05-0:36:13:**  but understanding and recording and planning the financial aspects of a farm is one of  
**0:36:13-0:36:18:**  the main ways that we can communicate with investors and it's one of the if that is important  
**0:36:18-0:36:22:**  for a project and for somebody that wants to get started etc that's looking for funding  
**0:36:22-0:36:24:**  this needs to happen.  
**0:36:24-0:36:28:**  Absolutely and I think I mean you can absolutely communicate with anybody by bringing them  
**0:36:28-0:36:32:**  on the land and showing them examples bring them to other farms that are successful etc  
**0:36:32-0:36:36:**  but if you're looking for somebody's money you need to be able to explain what you're  
**0:36:36-0:36:40:**  going to do with it that you're able to put that to put it to work and that it comes back  
**0:36:40-0:36:45:**  at some point and that's very I mean it needs to be clear and you need to be able to have  
**0:36:45-0:36:50:**  a good feeling not just being able to handle animals and handle trees and handle complexity  
**0:36:50-0:36:55:**  but also handle again if you want to the business side if you want to run a business and if  
**0:36:55-0:36:59:**  you're not comfortable with that make sure you find yourself in a position that you are  
**0:36:59-0:37:04:**  working with people that are that really love the accounting and that you create a context  
**0:37:04-0:37:08:**  that is big enough to support multiple roles and multiple people because again as we came  
**0:37:08-0:37:13:**  to the beginning it's crazy to think like nobody else in a company thinks in the rest  
**0:37:13-0:37:18:**  of the economy things that you can be a great accountant a great farmer a great processor  
**0:37:18-0:37:22:**  a great marketeer and a great delivery guy or girl all in the same person like we don't  
**0:37:22-0:37:29:**  expect that from a company that sells doors and has 20 50 200 people they have different  
**0:37:29-0:37:33:**  roles for a reason and they might switch and change and to keep everybody happy and they  
**0:37:33-0:37:38:**  might manage themselves whole accuracy and they etc etc but they have different roles  
**0:37:38-0:37:42:**  and different qualities so why do we expect that from farmers that they are like superman  
**0:37:42-0:37:47:**  and everything or superwoman I think that's and I said it's super difficult in the beginning  
**0:37:47-0:37:50:**  because you have to do everything because you cannot pay anybody but keep it in mind  
**0:37:50-0:37:54:**  like when you're going through that like okay am I gonna do this accounting forever or am  
**0:37:54-0:37:59:**  I gonna do delivery or am I gonna do processing or am I and also imagine the cost like if  
**0:37:59-0:38:05:**  you are good at accounting you take a hundredth of the time to do it or maybe a tenth and  
**0:38:05-0:38:10:**  much less frustration or if you're good at processing or good at it's we specialize in  
**0:38:10-0:38:16:**  certain things for good reasons and economies of scale exist in many cases and if you want  
**0:38:16-0:38:21:**  to go down that route make sure I mean we have a lot of experience how to run businesses  
**0:38:21-0:38:26:**  on that and it would be amazing to see with all the extra benefit that obviously regenerative  
**0:38:26-0:38:30:**  farming and practices and approaches create all the biodiversity that slowly we start  
**0:38:30-0:38:34:**  to measure more which is all great but in itself it needs to be able to sustain itself  
**0:38:34-0:38:39:**  it needs to be sustainable as a business so we can do this for 20 30 40 50 years and find  
**0:38:39-0:38:44:**  amazing markets and find how we can actually regenerate landscapes of scale because that's  
**0:38:44-0:38:50:**  what I'm after and Matteo is after like how do we do this not on two hectares 10 20 hectares  
**0:38:50-0:38:57:**  but on 20 000. That's actually interestingly something that the previous agricultural model  
**0:38:57-0:39:00:**  that we often call conventional ag which is a big generalization all of this has been  
**0:39:00-0:39:05:**  pretty good at it's creating business models and it hasn't always been to the benefits  
**0:39:05-0:39:10:**  of ecology nor of society but there is definitely some things that are to take and some things  
**0:39:10-0:39:15:**  that are to learn from these systems and that's something that I'm also quite interested in  
**0:39:15-0:39:19:**  at the moment is to look at you know what can be learned from there as well be open-minded  
**0:39:19-0:39:25:**  not just be limited to our alternative models which often you know so we I think that's  
**0:39:25-0:39:29:**  also another aspect of the conversation but I also think it's a really nice place to stop  
**0:39:29-0:39:34:**  the conversation and send this chat there's been a lot of things that brought up and I  
**0:39:34-0:39:42:**  hope that it's been able to somehow clarify or inspire or or you know set things elites  
**0:39:42-0:39:46:**  put some different elements on the table for people to think about and to consider when  
**0:39:46-0:39:50:**  they want to start farming which has been the big topic of this talk so thanks a lot  
**0:39:50-0:39:58:**  for sitting here with us and with me and for chatting let's go back to pruning olives and  
**0:39:58-0:40:05:**  taking care of babies and all of this. It's a beautiful location.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (2021-05-20)  

**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  our soils and ecosystems?  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:53:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we had a special kind of session.  If you recall Matteo from our first episode on the podcast and you may also know Koon  from investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast.  
**0:01:04-0:01:08:**  We actually all ended up reunited in Susano on Matteo's farm and so we thought it would  be a good idea to have a chat together.  And so we asked on social media, we asked you what you wanted us to talk about and the  
**0:01:17-0:01:23:**  most prominent questions were how to get started in farming or how to get started in agroecological  farms and agroforestry.  So we had a chat about this, how to kickstart an operation.  
**0:01:29-0:01:34:**  We bounced some ideas back and forth and as you know farming is a huge adventure and it  requires thorough preparation and planning.  So we hope that this conversation can give you some food for thought.  
**0:01:40-0:01:45:**  If you enjoyed this experimental episode let us know and we can try to work out some more  collabs so enjoy.  Thank you for accepting this invite and yeah we got a few questions and one of the key  
**0:01:56-0:02:03:**  ones that came out out of three out of the five questions we received from our listeners.  One of the questions that came out the most was starting a farm.  A lot of people want to know about how to start a farm and possibly what tips we could  
**0:02:13-0:02:18:**  give to a new farmer that doesn't necessarily come from a farming background and that wants  to get into agroecology and regenerative agriculture but also potentially from the finance perspective  how to get it started on the finance side.  
**0:02:26-0:02:30:**  So maybe we start with that Matteo do you want to go ahead?  Don't do it.  No it's a very complex question because it is really connected to the context, to the  
**0:02:40-0:02:45:**  country, to the region, to the climate, to our attitude.  So it's very difficult questions I would say it depends.  Normally the best idea is to go and volunteer and work in the highest diversified farms  
**0:02:57-0:03:03:**  around the world for a few months, a few years in order to get a sense of what it means farming  even though farming from other people is not the same as starting your own farm, having  responsibilities and having your own operation going on and the stress and all the rest.  
**0:03:15-0:03:20:**  So site analysis is extremely important and site analysis is not just about what soil,  what climate, what crops I could grow, it's about neighborhood, it's about the neighbors  that are at the borders of the farm as well, the neighborhood in terms of the economy,  
**0:03:33-0:03:40:**  the market where I can sell, how I can sell, how I should sell as well as if it's a touristic  area or is an area where there are already lots of vegetable farms or lots of grass fed  meat producers.  
**0:03:49-0:03:54:**  It's very important to be extremely convinced in starting a farm.  When you don't have to do it you really have to want to start a farm because it's tricky.  So it's very important, something I didn't say, to inform yourself to go and ask to the  
**0:04:08-0:04:15:**  local health and safety department, the veterinary health and safety department, the authorities  that take care of the whole thing about food processing, about food production and you  really have to know what you should do, what you can do because I know many farmers, many  
**0:04:27-0:04:33:**  people that started beautiful, very well working farms from agronomy and management point of  view but then they had big problems with health and safety issues.  So this is very important.  
**0:04:40-0:04:46:**  For example in our case the health and safety institution organization, a local organization  told us that we are not going to have chickens for production and two hours away from here  our friends started a farm and health and safety organization told them why don't you  
**0:05:01-0:05:04:**  start with eggs and grass fed chickens.  So it really changes a lot.  I think it's a very good point of context and you need to take a decision what you want  
**0:05:10-0:05:15:**  to do based on the experience you have around the world and volunteering and working on  other farms.  Do you want to run it, I wouldn't say it as a lifestyle business but do you want to run  
**0:05:21-0:05:25:**  it, like how do you want to run it with you and or your family depending on if that's  there.  Do you want to scale it as a business which might be ending up buying a lot of land or  
**0:05:29-0:05:35:**  managing a lot of land or do you want a highly diversified farm that mostly is on the homesteading  side you're selling enough to supply to get enough cash in basically to manage your life  and that's okay.  
**0:05:41-0:05:44:**  Like really what are your choices and do you need to own the land or not?  Are you going to be operating on somebody else?  Like what's the smallest possible thing you can try somewhere and then the crucial bit  
**0:05:52-0:05:56:**  like every farmer you always meet needs a market otherwise you're just living on the  land which is great which is not a thing but you're not farming and farming is a business  if you choose to make it like that meaning that it's extremely important to understand  
**0:06:07-0:06:13:**  your market, the prices, the taxes, the competition or other collectives you can work with.  It makes no sense to farm the most amazing regenerative farm chickens if nobody in your  area is buying chickens and people underestimate that a lot and it's very difficult because  
**0:06:23-0:06:27:**  you have to be really really good at farming, really really good at processing, harvesting,  etc.  Really good at marketing, really good at accounting, really good at delivering and that's very  
**0:06:32-0:06:34:**  difficult to have that in one or two people.  That's why we often see from a finance perspective it's really really difficult to invest in  smaller ones because it's so difficult to get a good handle on the numbers and to understand  
**0:06:44-0:06:47:**  the margins which probably are there but to understand the accounting because simply there's  no time to do the accounting properly.  So it really depends where you want to run it as a business which means you need to follow  
**0:06:52-0:06:54:**  certain business rules.  If you want to run it as a farming business and you want to sell you also need to follow  certain like Matteo said hygienic rules and in business there are certain rules like certain  
**0:07:01-0:07:05:**  accounting principles you need to follow if you ever want to get a bank loan or if you  ever want to get an investor which we get to later.  You have to be able to show that you're able to sell for a price that covers more than  
**0:07:13-0:07:17:**  your costs very simply and you have to be able to show that you're following your accounting  your hours which nobody does it in farming almost nobody and be able to say okay if I  invest X or if I get more hours meaning I hire somebody I can do more but you have to  
**0:07:26-0:07:32:**  be unfortunately able to fill out a spreadsheet and if you decide to go down that route and  I think we need a lot more farming as businesses or entrepreneurs in farming that are able  to do that not because we need to make a lot more money etc we need to be able to do those  
**0:07:40-0:07:46:**  calculations to really change farming because for now most of the discussions in farming  in extractive agriculture are about the use.  We never asked the question okay what were the costs even apart from the externality  
**0:07:53-0:07:56:**  costs and all the environmental costs and social costs but simply what are the costs  if you look most are let's say barely or not profitable and if we want to have a dent and  change something we need to be able to show like this is at least equal if not better  
**0:08:05-0:08:09:**  and I'm completely convinced we can do better and we can have the margins and more profit  flowing back to the land but we have to be able to show that if you want to go down that  route if you want to go the entrepreneurial route and you want to have manage and manage  
**0:08:18-0:08:23:**  a company we have to run it as a company and that's a choice you make at the beginning  and maybe you run a company on top of somebody else's land which is like you run the chickens  not a Mateus farm because he's not allowed but somewhere else two hours from here and  
**0:08:30-0:08:34:**  maybe that's what you do and you optimize for that in the context of the land and the  landscape and the customers etc but without customers a market and without understanding  your numbers which can be super boring I understand it's very difficult to be able to convince  
**0:08:44-0:08:48:**  others to join you or to convince somebody to put money to work so I would say really  boring answer market and numbers and understand your numbers context apart from usually the  hygiene because if you're not allowed to do things you're gonna end up pretty quickly  
**0:08:58-0:09:02:**  in a lot of trouble obviously I mean what I see from all of this is and also from my  experiences it takes so many skills to farm and it's just absolutely crazy and that's  one of the things that you know I would give advice to people based on my experience again  
**0:09:15-0:09:20:**  it's it's go slow and train yourself really properly and that's something that I didn't  do enough of and that I'm doing now but it's got a high cost just get started without being  fully prepared and you have to be prepared as you said in business you've got to also  
**0:09:30-0:09:34:**  be prepared in terms of your local context understanding it legally financially the economics  of it the markets but also in terms of all the many many skills that you need because  mistakes in farming they actually cost a lot as much financially as emotionally and you  
**0:09:46-0:09:50:**  can easily find yourself with an overwhelming situation and which you're not in control  of so I really like this idea of looking at the numbers to be in control of of your business  because in being in control of your business means that you know you are able to adapt  
**0:09:59-0:10:05:**  it to you and so what you want to prevent the burnout because we see we all know people  that have worked at farms and have traveled seed the complexity of starting farms using  regenerative approaches which adds a lot more complexity compared to a normal between brackets  
**0:10:16-0:10:23:**  and people burn out very very regularly and it's 80 hours plus and if the cash flow doesn't  come in and you're struggling to make ends meet like there are only so many years you  can do this and I would urge everyone to think okay this is a 20 30 40 year journey you're  
**0:10:33-0:10:39:**  starting probably hopefully because we need you but make sure you can make those 20 30  but like well there's no it's no use for anyone that after two years completely burned out  your body is finished your mind is finished your relationship might be finished and then  
**0:10:47-0:10:51:**  what are you gonna do and we in the movement need people that are gonna do this for 20  30 40 50 years unfortunately not fortunately but we need you're doing a marathon and be  ready for that physically mentally financially because you're gonna it's a long game it's  
**0:11:01-0:11:05:**  not something that in two years suddenly boom like stuff explodes and everything will be  fine this is a very long slow in terms of sometimes very fast game sounds all quite  negative what we're saying it's amazing I mean if you have able to do it and against  
**0:11:15-0:11:19:**  all odds and we're so early in the sector it's amazing yeah you really as you said before  you really have to be clear with yourself if it's an alternative job that you you want  or if it's a lifestyle it may be simpler to see it as an alternative job because you're  
**0:11:32-0:11:42:**  gonna be sharper less in the air less dreamy and you start just with one production one  activity without thinking about too many things together and you do that but of course it's  not just like an alternative job because the amount of variables that exist in nature and  
**0:11:56-0:12:01:**  in agriculture they're just uncountable every year is something different you thought okay  next year I'm gonna do it right now there will be another problem but also other opportunities  there is something very important about this whole thing that we never take into account  
**0:12:11-0:12:19:**  which is not a financial thing is not a production or connect something really touchable which  is how farming can change people and it can change society because farming is a perfect  substrate to deal with humbleness to deal with the frugality to deal with all these  
**0:12:34-0:12:40:**  very important things that makes us better people sooner or later if you don't give up  of course and I think it's something that it can't be quantified from an economical  point of view but at the end of the game if we are not just interested in money and actually  
**0:12:51-0:12:56:**  we are speaking about regenerative agriculture regenerative agriculture is not just a set  of different techniques to make something different and be very good and kind with the  planet no it's also to change the society I personally don't really don't care about  
**0:13:08-0:13:16:**  changing the agronomy behind our production the methods if I don't change myself and the  people that surrounds me and the society that surrounds me because I don't care to give  food good food high quality food producing a very good ecological way to people that  
**0:13:29-0:13:36:**  are still behaving in the same way and I think this can't be quantified not yet but as we  are trying to quantify and to give value to ecosystem services this is an ecosystem service  yeah that's very interesting for sure and actually if we go down this kind of this path  
**0:13:46-0:13:51:**  of looking at a young farmer or a new farmer that wants to get into this job a big part  of it is a big part of the conversation and especially when you become you're a new farmer  and there's quite a lot of idealism and etc one of the big things that we have to deal  
**0:13:59-0:14:05:**  with is complexity and diversity and by diversity I mean diversity of our production etc so  you know it can often be very tempting to get into a huge world of diverse products  and just and complex farm you can imagine it or at least I can imagine it quite well  
**0:14:15-0:14:20:**  maybe because we are in one of these farms here but with somebody like you might do has  a lot of experience we can manage it and I struggle to manage that complexity at the  beginning when we got started because there was just too many things to learn if I had  
**0:14:28-0:14:34:**  simplified a bit my task and I had started with smaller and complexified through time  and maybe not as much as I did right now on Massey Farm I would have probably been better  off so I think it would be nice to talk about that as well because that's something that  
**0:14:42-0:14:47:**  people will want to understand better so how much to complexify and how much diversify  and I think I know that you had a really interesting point of view from the finance perspective  there as well and you're looking at projects that are trying to finance themselves and  
**0:14:54-0:14:59:**  they're trying to communicate as well with investors and what do you have to say about  that?  I think there's a tension between complexity and finance because as soon as you are going  
**0:15:05-0:15:11:**  out of your context out of your farm let's say looking for outside money looking for  bank loans but probably your local bank has no idea what you're doing so that's sort of  a no-go area so you might be wanting to go down the crowdfunding route or crowd lending  
**0:15:20-0:15:24:**  if you talk about investing or speaking with a number of people that somehow through a  lot of luck mainly have access to a lot more wealth and might want to invest in you they  might come and visit which happens a lot in places because especially the lighthouse farms  
**0:15:32-0:15:39:**  obviously have a lot of attention as soon as you want to somehow get outside capital  to be put to work on your farm on your land or the land you're working almost by definition  you have to write down what you want like you have to at least make a plan okay I'm  
**0:15:46-0:15:52:**  gonna use this twenty five thousand dollars or euros or whatever to do XYZ and as soon  as you write that down I think you automatically have less complexity because you sort of  have to plan you have to say okay over the next years I'm gonna use this freezer for  
**0:16:01-0:16:05:**  XYZ I'm gonna use this processing equipment or I'm gonna plant a thousand trees doing  this and that and this is more or less the market and this like you have to sketch something  that in a very complex and very diverse farm is not clear yet like it's something that  
**0:16:15-0:16:18:**  over the years you will figure out because every year is different just like Matteo said  so there's that tension between managing on the go and wanting to take a loan for twenty  five thousand euros to do XYZ or fifty thousand or a lot more depending on your context and  
**0:16:28-0:16:32:**  your space so I think there is a sweet spot and it really really really depends and I  would say probably the easiest to get around is to raise for specific projects to not try  to raise okay we need two million to do everything on this farm to the perfect level saying no  
**0:16:42-0:16:46:**  we start small or we start we need a freezer and a freezer will get us this this and this  or we need to build six tractor chicken tractors and we need to buy X amount and the chicken  operation let's imagine it's a separate operation is gonna yield in five years time that the  
**0:16:58-0:17:02:**  loan has this and this and this and then we know we got to pay it back if it exactly comes  from the chickens or not is not necessarily the point but you need to know at least from  the beginning that you're able to pay back that loan or able to pay back the investor  
**0:17:10-0:17:15:**  if it's a profit share etc so it forces you to also plan which is not necessarily a bad  thing maybe you do the numbers and you do some calculations and figure out oh it's actually  not such a good idea at the moment or maybe it just takes back almost it pays back the  
**0:17:23-0:17:27:**  principal but it helps the land a lot and then it's okay that's a different investment  in different time but in itself so I think it's a good process even if you're not interested  to do it is to go through a few of those exercise and to see okay what could it yield could  
**0:17:37-0:17:41:**  it go faster with outside money but if you say okay I want to do the most advanced in  tropic agroforestry system with 30 40 different types that's gonna be a very big spreadsheet  to imagine all those variables it's impossible for sure but so you have to sort of get it  
**0:17:51-0:17:54:**  out okay these are the five cash crops out of that system there are more we know that  maybe one year we sell a lot of that maybe another year we sell a lot of that but let's  see this as extra that's nice insurance but if we can pay it back with these five over  
**0:18:03-0:18:07:**  ten years or five years whatever then we're good and then the other is extra so you have  to start thinking more in boxes unfortunately because you have to explain it to an outside  person that can never understand your complexity why you need that money and how it's gonna  
**0:18:15-0:18:20:**  flow back at some point plus return and that seems to be quite a lot in tension with what  you're doing here Mateo as well which you have a very diverse farm and actually the  way that you're selling it has a big part to play in that you know so I mean how do  
**0:18:28-0:18:33:**  you but I'm curious how did you do that Masi well this is interesting because I mean on  Masi farm we were in a position where the selling directly which is what Mateo does  here and that enables also huge diversity selling directly and to a local community  
**0:18:42-0:18:48:**  Masi farm we don't have that so we have to either send to Athens or go further and so  we had to plan yeah but we didn't plan enough at the start and we found it already complex  to plan for like five core species even that it's interesting because that's the same as  
**0:18:58-0:19:02:**  number you mentioned earlier on but even that was actually just random to sell because you've  got to you've got to consider okay who's gonna buy that are they gonna want to buy if we  sell for example to organic shops around are they gonna want to buy just one of our produce  
**0:19:11-0:19:16:**  or they want to buy a kind of a brand set of so all these considerations that we mentioned  earlier on we're trying to work them out I wouldn't say we have like an economically  running system yet but we're working out by testing you know we've sold in different places  
**0:19:25-0:19:29:**  we've interacted with different types of sellers and buyers and intermediaries we've also tried  direct selling and so but further out you know not just in not in our local island which  doesn't have a market for us and so yeah it's been testing to see where we could go and  
**0:19:40-0:19:43:**  actually it's actually intention with what I was saying at wrong because sometimes you  can't plan from the start sometimes you have to do and then work things out tests probe  throw things in different directions see what comes back and then you can create a plan  
**0:19:53-0:19:56:**  but if you don't know exactly what you're getting into because you're a new farmer and  you are trying to work things out you can't know it all from the beginning so yes you've  got to get started and that's gonna have a risk but also you can't do too much of it  
**0:20:04-0:20:08:**  because otherwise you're gonna you're gonna sink so which is completely normal from a  company starting perspective like you write a business plan you start and they always  joke like you throw it away with the first customer because it's completely different  
**0:20:15-0:20:19:**  than you wrote in your business plan and then it's to your quality of can you pivot can  you change can you find the niches that work and can you stay alive like can you keep going  keep eating at least because you need like somewhere on that journey you're gonna find  
**0:20:28-0:20:32:**  the niches that work could take five years ten years could take at least you need to  make sure that you're still there because otherwise you can find the best niche in year  six but if in your five you went bankrupt and you lost the land so it's also there so  
**0:20:41-0:20:45:**  okay how many tests can I do what's the risk of every test and is the risk taking down  the whole thing or not or are they small calculated risk that you can keep going okay and this  apple variety is gonna work for cider and actually there's a cider market and then year  
**0:20:53-0:20:58:**  five and year six and suddenly it goes but you need to be from the get-go know or at  least have an idea how to get to year five six ten etc because it's gonna take what I  hear from you what I'm seeing it's gonna take a couple it's not year one you figure out  
**0:21:07-0:21:11:**  okay this is the golden key and now we're it's gonna take time which is okay but be  ready we have to be good in giving value to the fact that we are actually reinventing  landscape management and how do we give a value to something that people don't even  
**0:21:23-0:21:29:**  perceive as something concrete so in your case in at Massey farm probably the most let's  say spontaneous thing to do which is normally connected to the fact when you don't have  a local market that can absorb your produce it means normally that you are in a remote  
**0:21:41-0:21:49:**  rural area remote rural area is what people from the city seek for actually you are also  in a beautiful remote rural area with the sea and in a beautiful island so sometimes  we have to be more flexible and throwing away our dream of being like the producer that  
**0:22:01-0:22:06:**  goes to the farmers market with the hay hat and say no I just set up my system to be a  regenerative system in order to change the ecology of this island and to stop desertification  to stop erosion to sequester carbon to lower down local temperature and so from one point  
**0:22:20-0:22:27:**  of view you are creating the basis to recreate a society in a desertic island at the same  time you're using what you can use which is like the tourist potential which someone in  the peri-urban area around Milan is not gonna manage to do nobody's gonna come in holiday  
**0:22:40-0:22:46:**  to spend some times in the polluted and ugly concrete district and little by little you  will be creating a new community it's just like we do what nature does there will be  no life if there is no photosynthetic potential and biomass production and animals once the  
**0:22:58-0:23:04:**  animals start to arrive once more plants start to arrive the system gets more abundant more  productive and it will attract more and more species more and more people more and more  plants but we have to start from somewhere so yeah I think this is very important like  
**0:23:14-0:23:24:**  discover and use the potentials that your land has rather than trying to mimicry something  that is happening successfully somewhere else eventually our farm is gonna become like a  workshop for a proper technologies and low-tech tools for gardening and terraforming Mars  
**0:23:38-0:23:45:**  and all sorts of activities that apparently they are not connected to farming but regenerative  farming makes them possible to happen in a farm where before it wasn't possible so you  have to be more disconnected to how to say you have to be more flexible but flexible  
**0:24:01-0:24:10:**  it doesn't mean to grow pumpkins or tomatoes no to open a B&B or to have fish in tanks  like aquaponics or to attract people because you are planting a beautiful forest which  is not going to produce any food but is producing oxygen sequestering carbon is the only shaded  
**0:24:23-0:24:31:**  spot in 20 square kilometers so really to have to create a new idea of not farming landscape  management it goes back also to your context right and to define a bit what's your I mean  there needs to be some flexibility but there also needs to be some deep thoughts about  
**0:24:42-0:24:46:**  you know how you want to lead your life and going to see different farms and different  projects that are running things in different ways to experience them oneself and ask for  the numbers and see and see how long they work and see do I want to do that or not or  
**0:24:56-0:25:02:**  what's what it's a very deep decision on lifestyle and what you want to do and it's a very big  commitment you make to your landscape if you decide to put roots down there and you're  going to be there you're going to be there for a long time probably and that's it's not  
**0:25:11-0:25:17:**  something to take lightly and also think that you know just to give a bit of a without creating  big principles out of it but the experience on Massey farm has been an evolution where  you arrived we tried we tested lots of things and you know we're in very tough conditions  
**0:25:26-0:25:31:**  with a lot of wind very shallow soil a big drought I mean it's serious the conditions  there but you know what we're finding out is that there's a local fig called the Kimi  fig which is firstly an amazing tree but secondly there's a market for it and we're starting  
**0:25:42-0:25:47:**  to see wow wait we can also start to go more into the traditions of the area because what's  done there for a reason it's done there not far from us actually we're on the southern  limits of this of what they call the the Kimi fig producing region and so and then we're  
**0:25:57-0:26:02:**  seeing okay well there's sheep around the place and lots of sheep it's kind of our regions  more known for sheep and goats and we're seeing that okay so we started we tested out the  market with the figs we're seeing that there's a demand we can make different products with  
**0:26:10-0:26:14:**  it and we're seeing especially that the tree it has the capacity to deal with our conditions  it's very resistant to the wind it doesn't the fruit don't get damaged the fruit don't  fall in the wind it's just very adapted and you know the less what you give it the sweeter  
**0:26:22-0:26:27:**  the fruit so you know it's time to tick some boxes and so we're focusing on this suddenly  and how many years is that in like how long did it take like just to give a perspective  like from first idea or from starting to starting to see oh that's an interesting line of I  
**0:26:38-0:26:42:**  think it's like three years for us and pretty fast for some it could be for some it could  be quicker and maybe for some as you guys are saying it could be slower but it took  us three years to to realize that you know there's something that we can we can do with  
**0:26:50-0:26:55:**  this and that the and also maybe at some point we're gonna you know transform a lot of the  trees we planted for forage for the sheep who knows and then copies them regularly and  then we'll have a silvopastia system with figs and sheep roaming underneath and that  
**0:27:06-0:27:11:**  might be so it's also about that flexibility of also taking the system where it kind of  wants to be taken and the land feed us information and adapting to it I think rigidity is a bit  of a problem and especially in agroecology where you know you're trying to not base yourself  
**0:27:22-0:27:28:**  on huge inputs and chemistry which is a very powerful tool so you've got to be I think  it's another argument to be flexible. And then comes the question okay let's say you're  starting to see the do you then see potentially I'm not saying now now but potentially a  
**0:27:40-0:27:47:**  role for finance to speed things up or not. Well I think that the timing in our context  again the timing would have been key because if if somebody came a few years ago. I mean  now because you're so you're talking about okay this is emerging we're observing the  
**0:27:56-0:28:00:**  land we're seeing where it wants to go we're seeing what makes sense or what starts to  make sense from our context the business a land perspective a social perspective our  perspective like do you are you comfortable now then to have a potential discussions like  
**0:28:10-0:28:16:**  that is that or is it still oh it's still a bit too early like I feel. Yeah I think  that it's or is it not useful at all I mean it could possibly be no that the financing  is key but it's also it's the right time when it's the right time when you have the ability  
**0:28:26-0:28:31:**  to use it efficiently and not to put yourself in danger or also the investor or the funder  or whatever in danger because at some point you know when you're a new farmer you might  not be the right time for that and then there's a trick I mean it's tricky that in that position  
**0:28:39-0:28:42:**  because where do you get the funding then and you know how many years you need to train  yourself before you gain some credibility but it's only after and even if you've trained  yourself in your revenue new context you know you need to experience the context to be able  
**0:28:49-0:28:55:**  to make the right decisions so there's a timing thing and I think that now it could be entering  a phase maybe now in the next year where we could be thinking okay let's we could be efficient  and we could be smart with money coming outside and we could plan a business to create a serious  
**0:29:05-0:29:10:**  business plan one that's based on reality on a reality of we know where we're gonna  sell our figs who we're gonna sell them to what price we can sell them to we've done  tests to know how much it takes us to process it what labor we need we know where we're  
**0:29:18-0:29:21:**  gonna find it these are all things we know now I'm saying them because we know them and  they're key now to really make a solid business plan and to really be able to either scale  or change or just speed up living out of it and yeah to speed up the objective which is  
**0:29:32-0:29:37:**  to sustain a family from farming so yeah I think that's what I would say to that.  Mateo could you use investors from outside at what point would it have been good for  you and especially now would it help you do you see a place of investors on small family  
**0:29:48-0:29:50:**  farms like yours?  I don't think I'm the right person to answer to this question as people would expect I'm  saying I don't need money I don't need money because anytime that I wanted to do something  
**0:30:03-0:30:10:**  I started very little or I started and if it was possible to start it and if it wasn't  possible to start it and I really wanted to do it I created the substrate in order to  start it.  
**0:30:17-0:30:26:**  To me the finance thing it should go mainly into pushing institutions creating movements  in order to change policies which are the very big problem for farmers and for the development  of regenerative agriculture of different techniques different approaches so we really need to  
**0:30:39-0:30:44:**  change the policies because if you look at European policies on so many things like food  processing on again animal management and animal regenerative animal husbandry is a  problem I mean we are either in different situations you find yourself in an illegal  
**0:30:58-0:31:04:**  position or in a borderline position which is not good because you don't you are already  stressed by the climate you're already stressed by the market you're already stressed by so  many things when you're farming if you're already also stressed by the fact that someone  
**0:31:14-0:31:20:**  can come to the farm and check and see that you're not doing things properly as policies  are asking is not good it's not good for you it's not good for the movement is not good  for the stability of the system so policymaking it should not come from farmers.  
**0:31:31-0:31:35:**  Farmers should require because they don't have time they don't have the head they don't  have the energy they don't have the context they don't have the knowledge so policymakers  are policymakers and they should ask farmers what they need so if a policymaker comes to  
**0:31:46-0:31:53:**  me and ask me so I can't change these rules these laws what should I change I tell him  I want to be able to manage my chickens in this way I don't want to have the same rules  in my commercial kitchen processing facility that the industry is having can you change  
**0:32:06-0:32:12:**  it for me yes don't worry I'm gonna find who's gonna invest in a advertisement campaign and  this and this and that.  But that's not investing that's grand I think I have a different take I think we need the  
**0:32:17-0:32:23:**  issue with the movement now that it's made of too many farmers that are stressed out  and don't have the time to engage in policy I mean the first time we saw somebody engaged  in policy in the US actually in the House of Representatives was a few weeks ago when  
**0:32:32-0:32:38:**  Gabe Brown spoke why because he got to a level that he had time for that as well so what's  missing like we're against a lobby that has a lot of money a lot of time to lobby and  in order to get to something that's why I'm thinking if there's a role for finance it's  
**0:32:50-0:32:55:**  to get to farmers and farms as successful farmers to a level where there's maybe 10%  of your time going into policy because we need more successful examples for policymakers  to look at and to engage with and if we rely on overstressed burned out farmers to engage  
**0:33:06-0:33:10:**  with policymakers we're going to be in the same mess 10 years from now like we need you  Mateo to have more time to engage with policymakers and if you don't have the time you don't engage  which is perfectly fine but it means policies are not changing because people in the city  
**0:33:21-0:33:27:**  have no clue and rightfully so and they come and visit etc but if we have farmers that  are getting to a level where they can have dedicated a bit of their time I'm not saying  that but just a bit to start engaging start discussing start nudging it also means that  
**0:33:36-0:33:40:**  these farms need to get to a level where the time is available and is not absorbed and  that everybody is working 80 hours a week so I'm scared if we don't take the timing  part serious this policy is always the last thing on Friday afternoon and why we should  
**0:33:48-0:33:53:**  also do policy and that never happens because we're against a lobby that has time and creates  time by a lot of money simply and has the lobbyists in Brussels and and I think with  the movement we need to get to a level we also have the lobbyists in Brussels because  
**0:34:01-0:34:04:**  these rules you can change we've seen that in sustainable renewable energies you can  actually change these things with time and money and focus and people that are doing  that and feeding them with the right things okay this is the context we need to understand  
**0:34:12-0:34:16:**  around chickens and this is the context that we need to understand around vegetables and  these are all the rules that really limit us now but getting a proper overview of that  and what needs to change is a very dire it's yeah it takes time.  
**0:34:25-0:34:31:**  It's in that way we need to convince people that these alternative ways of farming, agro-cological  ways of farming are viable systems to feed the population because I feel like that's  one of the biggest arguments that goes against it.  
**0:34:38-0:34:39:**  Absolutely.  So I think that that's also part of the issue is that we really need to start creating systems  that are functioning and that are productive.  
**0:34:48-0:34:50:**  We can see and visit and taste.  Productive per hectare that are also productive per labor hour.  Per landscape.  
**0:34:54-0:34:57:**  Which is not the most interesting part of farming at all.  Keeping records is horrible.  Yeah and it's you know the interesting part of farming is understanding the ecological  
**0:35:03-0:35:07:**  I want to say that for myself not for everybody but for me it's an understanding ecological  interactions between species and seeing how we can use a tree to produce as much as possible  for us and you know this this is what's fascinating it's not fascinating to sit and do the spreadsheets  
**0:35:17-0:35:22:**  or to go out and find the market to sell whereas maybe for some this is the you know.  And we need those as well.  Like if you are a seller and isn't it fascinating that until I think a year ago there was only  
**0:35:29-0:35:34:**  one proper paper written about profitability of regenerative farms.  One which is hilarious but very sad if you think about it now there are a few more but  we need like the very dry numbers sometimes and in Brussels and in Washington and in Milan  
**0:35:46-0:35:51:**  and Rome and in the other policy places we need unfortunately sometimes also the dry  numbers.  And the record keeping and to show.  
**0:35:56-0:35:59:**  It seems from what you're saying that just bringing it back to the earlier conversation  numbers and all these this economics not the economics but the well it is the economics  but understanding and recording and planning the financial aspects of a farm is one of  
**0:36:13-0:36:18:**  the main ways that we can communicate with investors and it's one of the if that is important  for a project and for somebody that wants to get started etc that's looking for funding  this needs to happen.  
**0:36:24-0:36:28:**  Absolutely and I think I mean you can absolutely communicate with anybody by bringing them  on the land and showing them examples bring them to other farms that are successful etc  but if you're looking for somebody's money you need to be able to explain what you're  
**0:36:36-0:36:40:**  going to do with it that you're able to put that to put it to work and that it comes back  at some point and that's very I mean it needs to be clear and you need to be able to have  a good feeling not just being able to handle animals and handle trees and handle complexity  
**0:36:50-0:36:55:**  but also handle again if you want to the business side if you want to run a business and if  you're not comfortable with that make sure you find yourself in a position that you are  working with people that are that really love the accounting and that you create a context  
**0:37:04-0:37:08:**  that is big enough to support multiple roles and multiple people because again as we came  to the beginning it's crazy to think like nobody else in a company thinks in the rest  of the economy things that you can be a great accountant a great farmer a great processor  
**0:37:18-0:37:22:**  a great marketeer and a great delivery guy or girl all in the same person like we don't  expect that from a company that sells doors and has 20 50 200 people they have different  roles for a reason and they might switch and change and to keep everybody happy and they  
**0:37:33-0:37:38:**  might manage themselves whole accuracy and they etc etc but they have different roles  and different qualities so why do we expect that from farmers that they are like superman  and everything or superwoman I think that's and I said it's super difficult in the beginning  
**0:37:47-0:37:50:**  because you have to do everything because you cannot pay anybody but keep it in mind  like when you're going through that like okay am I gonna do this accounting forever or am  I gonna do delivery or am I gonna do processing or am I and also imagine the cost like if  
**0:37:59-0:38:05:**  you are good at accounting you take a hundredth of the time to do it or maybe a tenth and  much less frustration or if you're good at processing or good at it's we specialize in  certain things for good reasons and economies of scale exist in many cases and if you want  
**0:38:16-0:38:21:**  to go down that route make sure I mean we have a lot of experience how to run businesses  on that and it would be amazing to see with all the extra benefit that obviously regenerative  farming and practices and approaches create all the biodiversity that slowly we start  
**0:38:30-0:38:34:**  to measure more which is all great but in itself it needs to be able to sustain itself  it needs to be sustainable as a business so we can do this for 20 30 40 50 years and find  amazing markets and find how we can actually regenerate landscapes of scale because that's  
**0:38:44-0:38:50:**  what I'm after and Matteo is after like how do we do this not on two hectares 10 20 hectares  but on 20 000. That's actually interestingly something that the previous agricultural model  that we often call conventional ag which is a big generalization all of this has been  
**0:39:00-0:39:05:**  pretty good at it's creating business models and it hasn't always been to the benefits  of ecology nor of society but there is definitely some things that are to take and some things  that are to learn from these systems and that's something that I'm also quite interested in  
**0:39:15-0:39:19:**  at the moment is to look at you know what can be learned from there as well be open-minded  not just be limited to our alternative models which often you know so we I think that's  also another aspect of the conversation but I also think it's a really nice place to stop  
**0:39:29-0:39:34:**  the conversation and send this chat there's been a lot of things that brought up and I  hope that it's been able to somehow clarify or inspire or or you know set things elites  put some different elements on the table for people to think about and to consider when  
**0:39:46-0:39:50:**  they want to start farming which has been the big topic of this talk so thanks a lot  for sitting here with us and with me and for chatting let's go back to pruning olives and  taking care of babies and all of this. It's a beautiful location.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sun, 30 Aug 2020 16:48:48)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:47:**  Hello everyone and welcome on the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:52:**  We're your hosts Dimitri and Etienne and today we're very excited to be interviewing Ethan,  
**0:00:52-0:00:57:**  Harry and Jeremy founders of Propagate Ventures, an innovative company that connects economics  
**0:00:57-0:01:02:**  analytics and agroforestry, helping farmers integrate perennial systems on their farms  
**0:01:02-0:01:05:**  whilst connecting investors to the value of trees.  
**0:01:05-0:01:06:**  So welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:06-0:01:08:**  We're really happy to have you here.  
**0:01:08-0:01:09:**  Thanks so much.  
**0:01:09-0:01:10:**  Glad to be here.  
**0:01:10-0:01:11:**  Thanks for having us.  
**0:01:11-0:01:12:**  Awesome.  
**0:01:12-0:01:17:**  Well, we're very excited to have you guys on and to talk about all of the amazing work  
**0:01:17-0:01:19:**  that you're doing at Propagate.  
**0:01:19-0:01:23:**  But before we get into that, do you think you could tell us a bit about how you guys  
**0:01:23-0:01:27:**  started getting interested in trees and in agroforestry?  
**0:01:27-0:01:28:**  Sure.  
**0:01:28-0:01:37:**  Let me tell you the story of how we all found our way into agroforestry and regenerative  
**0:01:37-0:01:42:**  agriculture for each of us and for different reasons.  
**0:01:42-0:01:46:**  And I'll let Jeremy and Harry jump in here.  
**0:01:46-0:01:54:**  We all found agriculture through food.  
**0:01:54-0:01:59:**  In search of healthy food for Jeremy and myself for health care reasons.  
**0:01:59-0:02:08:**  For example, I'm diabetic and so the food I eat has a direct impact on my health.  
**0:02:08-0:02:15:**  Jeremy has a similar journey around that, although sans the diabetes.  
**0:02:15-0:02:19:**  And with Harry, he worked.  
**0:02:19-0:02:25:**  I mean, Harry, what, the first quarter of your life where you were an Olympic hopeful.  
**0:02:25-0:02:30:**  And so good food meant athletic performance.  
**0:02:30-0:02:37:**  And I think for all of us, once we opened that door to start looking at how is food  
**0:02:37-0:02:42:**  produced, where can we get the most healthy food?  
**0:02:42-0:02:49:**  It's a very natural gateway to having conversations with farmers and getting a deeper understanding  
**0:02:49-0:02:51:**  of how agriculture operates.  
**0:02:51-0:02:53:**  Now, that's a whole basket of worms.  
**0:02:53-0:03:01:**  And all of a sudden you get into the food system and how land is managed and the health  
**0:03:01-0:03:08:**  of our ecosystems, which naturally put us into a journey learning more and getting our  
**0:03:08-0:03:14:**  hands dirty with agroforestry in particular, because we all grew up with a passion around  
**0:03:14-0:03:23:**  agroforestries, either running through the forest or just being mildly connected to trees  
**0:03:23-0:03:28:**  by being born on Earth Day, for example.  
**0:03:28-0:03:31:**  And so all that comes together.  
**0:03:31-0:03:37:**  We now learned about agroforestry, regenerative agriculture.  
**0:03:37-0:03:41:**  And then the follow up question to all that for us, and this is where the inception of  
**0:03:41-0:03:47:**  propagate comes in the sort of light bulb moment, if you will, trying to answer the  
**0:03:47-0:03:55:**  question, why are trees not part of the conventional agricultural model today?  
**0:03:55-0:04:03:**  And because they're not the standard, what can we do to make it easy for farmers and  
**0:04:03-0:04:10:**  everybody else that would be involved to utilize trees as an effective tool in the toolkit  
**0:04:10-0:04:11:**  of agriculture?  
**0:04:11-0:04:12:**  I'll stop there.  
**0:04:12-0:04:20:**  Jeremy, Harry, do you guys want to add a little bit of flair to what I've shared?  
**0:04:20-0:04:21:**  Of course, yeah.  
**0:04:21-0:04:28:**  Just on a personal note, building off of the where our food comes from idea for me with  
**0:04:28-0:04:36:**  athletics, the macronutrient sources, i.e. fat, carbs, protein, having those places,  
**0:04:36-0:04:42:**  those landscapes for the food I was eating came from be in concert with my lens stewardship  
**0:04:42-0:04:43:**  ethic.  
**0:04:43-0:04:46:**  That was extremely important.  
**0:04:46-0:04:54:**  And growing up in a forested biome next to about 50 acres of orchard, actually Massachusetts,  
**0:04:54-0:05:02:**  the connection, say, between intact forest and clean water and say cropland that was  
**0:05:02-0:05:08:**  tilled and water that was murky was always very visceral.  
**0:05:08-0:05:23:**  So linking that in with, so I guess agroforestry being the resulting paradigm from that, that  
**0:05:23-0:05:31:**  really emerged when I guess back during undergrad when I was in a finance course and reading  
**0:05:31-0:05:34:**  a book on agroforestry at the same time.  
**0:05:34-0:05:37:**  And that's really when the light bulb went off for me.  
**0:05:37-0:05:46:**  So it's been a great journey linking up together as propagate over the past four years or so.  
**0:05:46-0:05:52:**  I guess, Jeremy, you can also jump in maybe with your background in the timber products  
**0:05:52-0:05:54:**  business.  
**0:05:54-0:06:04:**  Yeah, as a kid, I grew up in a third generation family business doing stair railing manufacturing  
**0:06:04-0:06:07:**  at a relatively large scale.  
**0:06:07-0:06:15:**  And coming out of that, going into my older years and having some health struggles, I  
**0:06:15-0:06:18:**  was inspired to start farming in college.  
**0:06:18-0:06:25:**  And through that journey, saw the mismatch between the way in which we were managing  
**0:06:25-0:06:31:**  resources on farms and what was being done in terms of manufactured goods across the  
**0:06:31-0:06:32:**  world.  
**0:06:32-0:06:40:**  And so that really led me on a journey to find agroforestry as a solution set to helping  
**0:06:40-0:06:45:**  solve a lot of those problems.  
**0:06:45-0:06:55:**  I would add here that it wasn't so clear in the early days of that discovery process that  
**0:06:55-0:07:05:**  it was a possibility following the early inspirations of people who went out and did it on their  
**0:07:05-0:07:14:**  own was really the nugget of potential that enabled the discovery of agroforestry as a  
**0:07:14-0:07:16:**  potential solution.  
**0:07:16-0:07:24:**  I would say it's not an easy place to land from an economics perspective when looking  
**0:07:24-0:07:27:**  for solutions to these problems.  
**0:07:27-0:07:34:**  And I'm glad that's where my journey brought me, but also where together we landed as a  
**0:07:34-0:07:37:**  good solution set to focus on.  
**0:07:37-0:07:45:**  Yeah, and so what Jeremy and Harry are pointing out is kind of turned into this, I guess,  
**0:07:45-0:07:57:**  infamous motto at Propagate where the three of us, and we want to have this be part of  
**0:07:57-0:08:01:**  the culture and the day to day because we're all so passionate about the food system and  
**0:08:01-0:08:10:**  agriculture is that we really feel it's important to demand that the health of our land and  
**0:08:10-0:08:17:**  our ecosystem is the same as the health of the food that we want to eat.  
**0:08:17-0:08:24:**  And that's fairly macro or maybe bird's eye view.  
**0:08:24-0:08:31:**  But at the end of the day, the goal that we all are striving for with Propagate is to  
**0:08:31-0:08:37:**  create a business that can drive that forward, where there are healthy landscapes that are  
**0:08:37-0:08:47:**  biodiverse and that produce food that's very healthy and delivers caloric value.  
**0:08:47-0:08:48:**  Great.  
**0:08:48-0:08:56:**  Okay, well, so what we were thinking to basically give an idea of what you guys are doing exactly  
**0:08:56-0:09:01:**  is maybe you can walk us through the different stages of a project, kind of from the beginning  
**0:09:01-0:09:08:**  to the end, so that everyone gets an idea of the whole different levels and the different  
**0:09:08-0:09:12:**  activities that you offer through the solution and through your platform.  
**0:09:12-0:09:17:**  So maybe just to start off, you could tell us who usually initiates the projects.  
**0:09:17-0:09:19:**  Is it farmers coming to you or investors?  
**0:09:19-0:09:22:**  And from what end does it start?  
**0:09:22-0:09:26:**  To answer your question, it's a range.  
**0:09:26-0:09:31:**  We have farmers that come to us, we have investors that come to us, we have nonprofits and as  
**0:09:31-0:09:34:**  well as buyers and brands that come to us.  
**0:09:34-0:09:42:**  And really the way in which they find us is they're looking out at their landscapes and  
**0:09:42-0:09:47:**  looking for holistic solutions to solving problems in their landscapes.  
**0:09:47-0:09:53:**  And those problems typically land into two categories, diminishing on farm income and  
**0:09:53-0:10:01:**  stability from an economic perspective and diminishing ecological diversity and kind  
**0:10:01-0:10:05:**  of some clear ecological problems that are occurring on their farms.  
**0:10:05-0:10:12:**  And so depending on each of those stakeholders that we're working with, they all come to  
**0:10:12-0:10:19:**  us with kind of a different mix of those two things and the level of how they weigh those  
**0:10:19-0:10:21:**  in their thinking.  
**0:10:21-0:10:26:**  The way in which we engage with them really is on the upfront helping define their context  
**0:10:26-0:10:28:**  and their goals.  
**0:10:28-0:10:34:**  So that way we can get a really good sense of where they want to lean in terms of the  
**0:10:34-0:10:39:**  type of systems and crops they would potentially focus on in integrating with their existing  
**0:10:39-0:10:41:**  production systems.  
**0:10:41-0:10:47:**  Oftentimes what this looks like is we're working with a farm, they're raising cattle, they're  
**0:10:47-0:10:53:**  interested in the shade benefits of trees on their cattle and their pastures to be able  
**0:10:53-0:10:58:**  to increase weight gain in the heat of summer.  
**0:10:58-0:11:05:**  But where we kind of have to understand is what is their labor capacity?  
**0:11:05-0:11:06:**  What is their infrastructure?  
**0:11:06-0:11:08:**  How close are they to markets?  
**0:11:08-0:11:15:**  And as a result, we can help really define what the right fit crop is for their goals,  
**0:11:15-0:11:20:**  both from an economic perspective in the outcomes that they're seeking on the farm, as well  
**0:11:20-0:11:25:**  as from a lifestyle perspective based upon their context and what they want to manage  
**0:11:25-0:11:31:**  today and where they want to be managing and what they want to be managing 10 years out.  
**0:11:31-0:11:37:**  That really helps define the upfront of the process and helps us get buy-in for a plan  
**0:11:37-0:11:41:**  that is really co-developed with each of those stakeholders.  
**0:11:41-0:11:47:**  From there, we have an analysis tool that we've built that enables us to run 30-year  
**0:11:47-0:11:52:**  long economics on each of these systems and what it will take to implement them on the  
**0:11:52-0:11:55:**  farm level based upon their specific context.  
**0:11:55-0:12:01:**  And by their specific context, what I mean is what is their machinery on the farm?  
**0:12:01-0:12:02:**  How do they want to manage?  
**0:12:02-0:12:06:**  Do they want to manage from a low maintenance perspective or from an intensive management  
**0:12:06-0:12:07:**  perspective?  
**0:12:07-0:12:12:**  So we can really get into the details of what type of infrastructure they need to build  
**0:12:12-0:12:15:**  and the efficiencies that they're seeking with the infrastructure that they're going  
**0:12:15-0:12:18:**  to have on the farm.  
**0:12:18-0:12:23:**  That analysis, and I'm happy to dive into the details of that, which I think is a robust  
**0:12:23-0:12:29:**  part maybe of this conversation, but at a high level, maybe we can paint the picture  
**0:12:29-0:12:31:**  and go from there.  
**0:12:31-0:12:36:**  Once they run through that analysis process, the next phase is project development, where  
**0:12:36-0:12:41:**  we work with them with tools that we've built to enable them to go out and actually plant  
**0:12:41-0:12:44:**  the project.  
**0:12:44-0:12:49:**  And depending on the farm, the way in which we do that ranges in a wide array of potential  
**0:12:49-0:12:51:**  service that we provide.  
**0:12:51-0:12:58:**  At the most basic level, we work with them to help source the right quality tree genetics  
**0:12:58-0:13:02:**  to ensure that they're actually meeting the expectations of what the projections were  
**0:13:02-0:13:05:**  in the analysis.  
**0:13:05-0:13:10:**  That swings all the way through to us actually providing the full suite of project development  
**0:13:10-0:13:16:**  services, working with local labor, working with local machine operators to actually implement  
**0:13:16-0:13:19:**  the system on their farm.  
**0:13:19-0:13:26:**  So that full range of project development can really be context specific.  
**0:13:26-0:13:33:**  Some farms have the tools and the labor and the know-how to go out and implement.  
**0:13:33-0:13:38:**  Some farms need us to be able to bring that training onto the farm and the ability to  
**0:13:38-0:13:42:**  actually implement with a high efficacy onto the farm.  
**0:13:42-0:13:49:**  And then the final piece of what we do is financing, which really the big key to that  
**0:13:49-0:13:56:**  whole part of our business is being able to invest into the trees as assets separate from  
**0:13:56-0:14:03:**  the land and to enable multi-party engagement into those trees.  
**0:14:03-0:14:08:**  A big part of what we do is focusing on working with third party investors to be able to finance  
**0:14:08-0:14:13:**  those trees for farms that are interested in being partners on a long term basis that  
**0:14:13-0:14:19:**  don't necessarily have the capital to buy into those systems over that long time period.  
**0:14:19-0:14:21:**  A lot of the time these systems are expensive.  
**0:14:21-0:14:25:**  This is essentially farm infrastructure.  
**0:14:25-0:14:30:**  And so having that third party capital source is really key to being able to help a lot  
**0:14:30-0:14:32:**  more farms transition toward agroforestry.  
**0:14:32-0:14:36:**  I'm going to stop there and maybe we can dive into more specifics.  
**0:14:36-0:14:39:**  Thank you for that overview of the whole process.  
**0:14:39-0:14:44:**  Does one of you want to explain to us a bit more about that process of analytics?  
**0:14:44-0:14:48:**  What kind of data do you use and what methodology do you mobilize?  
**0:14:48-0:14:49:**  Of course.  
**0:14:49-0:14:50:**  Yeah.  
**0:14:50-0:14:56:**  Let me provide a few sentences with a bit of jargon and then we can deconstruct that  
**0:14:56-0:14:58:**  from there.  
**0:14:58-0:15:04:**  So everything starts with taking a look at the biogeophysical climate around the farm.  
**0:15:04-0:15:12:**  So weather patterns, soil type, what's going on in that regard, coupled with Saveri's holistic  
**0:15:12-0:15:13:**  management framework.  
**0:15:13-0:15:17:**  So what did the decision makers actually want out of their land?  
**0:15:17-0:15:21:**  So we have biological factors and social factors.  
**0:15:21-0:15:23:**  Those are the inputs there.  
**0:15:23-0:15:32:**  So say that's a in-depth survey and conversation and holistic context development that's coupled  
**0:15:32-0:15:37:**  with landscape architecture, tools and software.  
**0:15:37-0:15:41:**  So say robust KML files is another input there.  
**0:15:41-0:15:47:**  And then the outputs on the back end are 30 year long income statements.  
**0:15:47-0:15:54:**  So what starts out as landscape architecture actually finishes as very comprehensive agronomy  
**0:15:54-0:15:55:**  work.  
**0:15:55-0:16:05:**  I think it's important to talk a bit about just from an agroforestry level, what's important  
**0:16:05-0:16:11:**  when looking and designing a landscape and then kind of what we do and being able to  
**0:16:11-0:16:12:**  do that.  
**0:16:12-0:16:19:**  So an important concept is this concept of over yield, which is the ability to increase  
**0:16:19-0:16:26:**  the productivity of an acre by bringing multiple crops together as compared to them in isolation.  
**0:16:26-0:16:32:**  And what we do in terms of looking at it from a design perspective is trying to maximize  
**0:16:32-0:16:37:**  the trade off between any losses in productivity and any gains in productivity by bringing  
**0:16:37-0:16:39:**  systems together.  
**0:16:39-0:16:45:**  And what that looks like is if we're looking at a cattle production system or hay or looking  
**0:16:45-0:16:53:**  at row crops, looking at being able to understand the data behind at what spacing of that system  
**0:16:53-0:17:00:**  does it make sense to grow the crop that is the primary yield, which is the hay or the  
**0:17:00-0:17:07:**  row crop or the cattle or other livestock production system with a tree crop integrated  
**0:17:07-0:17:08:**  into that system.  
**0:17:08-0:17:14:**  So part of that design process is being able to understand things like data like light  
**0:17:14-0:17:20:**  penetration to the understory, light captured by the tree and being able to optimize from  
**0:17:20-0:17:28:**  a geophysical perspective, the 30 year long kind of goals in aligning with those trees  
**0:17:28-0:17:30:**  that are being planted.  
**0:17:30-0:17:37:**  So an example of this is let's say you want to maximize cattle weight gain and you want  
**0:17:37-0:17:43:**  to be able to ensure that productivity of the grasses between the trees maintains a  
**0:17:43-0:17:46:**  certain level of volume as well as protein content.  
**0:17:46-0:17:52:**  So we have the kind of data sets that enable us to make the decisions in terms of spacing  
**0:17:52-0:17:59:**  that allow for us to maximize in the amount of cattle that you have on the farm in terms  
**0:17:59-0:18:01:**  of the feed required.  
**0:18:01-0:18:05:**  So not compromising on that while being able to integrate that second layer of trees into  
**0:18:05-0:18:08:**  that production system.  
**0:18:08-0:18:16:**  From an analysis perspective, what that looks like is a sub centimeter accurate GIS enabled  
**0:18:16-0:18:20:**  design of where the trees are going onto the map.  
**0:18:20-0:18:25:**  So that way if the farm is technologically complex and they actually have the equipment  
**0:18:25-0:18:31:**  to plug that into their tractors, they can automate some processes in terms of planting,  
**0:18:31-0:18:34:**  mowing, et cetera, around where the trees are.  
**0:18:34-0:18:40:**  But it also is important to know that those maps can translate down to somebody who might  
**0:18:40-0:18:47:**  not necessarily have that technological capacity just through things like basic GNS and GPS  
**0:18:47-0:18:51:**  services that they can implement on the farm.  
**0:18:51-0:18:56:**  In terms of the agronomy side, a big part of that is being able to understand the growth  
**0:18:56-0:19:02:**  rates of those trees and how that plays into the economics of being able to both manage  
**0:19:02-0:19:09:**  the biomass, manage the fruit or nut of that tree, but also to be able to understand the  
**0:19:09-0:19:13:**  revenue side of what's possible in terms of the offtakes.  
**0:19:13-0:19:23:**  And from a lot of what defines those potential outcomes is looking at site infrastructure.  
**0:19:23-0:19:29:**  So the equipment, the efficiency of that equipment, the protocols of management and how much it  
**0:19:29-0:19:31:**  takes to manage that crop.  
**0:19:31-0:19:38:**  And then the market side of what's possible in terms of how many potential sales and the  
**0:19:38-0:19:46:**  price of those within the given crop that's being focused on is possible with the farm,  
**0:19:46-0:19:52:**  where that farm is located, the infrastructure that's around that farm, be it cold storage,  
**0:19:52-0:19:56:**  wineries, food brands, et cetera, restaurants.  
**0:19:56-0:20:03:**  And being able to build out a strategy that encompasses all the factors that are unique  
**0:20:03-0:20:09:**  to that farm is what allows us to kind of take those geophysical pieces of spacing and  
**0:20:09-0:20:18:**  the market and cost pieces of managing to be able to put out a highly efficacious model  
**0:20:18-0:20:20:**  for what that implementation can look like.  
**0:20:20-0:20:21:**  Great.  
**0:20:21-0:20:23:**  And where do you get this data from?  
**0:20:23-0:20:25:**  Is it from university studies?  
**0:20:25-0:20:27:**  I was wondering, what's the raw material?  
**0:20:27-0:20:31:**  Yeah, of course, I can jump in there.  
**0:20:31-0:20:35:**  It's very much from disparate sources.  
**0:20:35-0:20:44:**  So yes, university studies, yes, calling up farmers in specific locations and asking them  
**0:20:44-0:20:49:**  about their yields or going to those farms.  
**0:20:49-0:20:53:**  And what we're doing is also creating mechanistic models.  
**0:20:53-0:21:03:**  So based off of certain assumptions, what can we expect from yields, say, in year nine  
**0:21:03-0:21:11:**  in upstate New York, given yields in year seven down in Kentucky, for example?  
**0:21:11-0:21:17:**  So that's just different latitudes for those that are not in the United States.  
**0:21:17-0:21:24:**  And how do you manage to synchronize this data with the local context and some of the  
**0:21:24-0:21:26:**  particularities of farms then?  
**0:21:26-0:21:30:**  Because we all know that from farm to farm, there's so many differences.  
**0:21:30-0:21:33:**  And how do you make sure that you can be relevant to that context?  
**0:21:33-0:21:35:**  Yeah, of course.  
**0:21:35-0:21:43:**  So a lot of it, it's all location specific, as you're noting.  
**0:21:43-0:21:52:**  And if there are yields that are, we'll say, in the direct vicinity, we'll look at growth  
**0:21:52-0:22:03:**  rates of single tree, excuse me, single trees and really create forecasts from there.  
**0:22:03-0:22:11:**  The catch here is that we're often working with crops that are, we'll say, growth market  
**0:22:11-0:22:16:**  crops, like chestnuts in the United States, like blackcurrants in the Northeast United  
**0:22:16-0:22:17:**  States.  
**0:22:17-0:22:25:**  So what we gain in kind of majority market share in a formerly niche market, we might  
**0:22:25-0:22:30:**  compromise on certainty in projections.  
**0:22:30-0:22:40:**  That being said, working in enough, say, correct contingency factors allows us to predict with  
**0:22:40-0:22:44:**  generally very good certainty what yields are going to look like.  
**0:22:44-0:22:45:**  Yeah.  
**0:22:45-0:22:50:**  And I'll kind of jump in and add to all that, based off of everything that both Jeremy and  
**0:22:50-0:23:00:**  Harry have outlined, you can get an understanding that there's a lot of detail and nuance that's  
**0:23:00-0:23:05:**  associated with making an agroforestry system very successful.  
**0:23:05-0:23:12:**  A lot of what we want to do and what we're actively doing is taking those very complex  
**0:23:12-0:23:21:**  details and simplifying them so that a farmer can have all of the insights they need to  
**0:23:21-0:23:27:**  more confidently manage an agroforestry system, whether they're transitioning to an agroforestry  
**0:23:27-0:23:38:**  system or starting a new one, a lot of those details around geo, physical, economic markets  
**0:23:38-0:23:47:**  that are otherwise really extraordinary question marks for an operator, that we can remove  
**0:23:47-0:23:58:**  some of those barriers and provide a very simplified way to approach these components  
**0:23:58-0:24:07:**  so that the transparency and access to information is very clear, while also making sure, as  
**0:24:07-0:24:13:**  Harry pointed out, that from a place-based perspective, there's some economies of scale  
**0:24:13-0:24:21:**  or what we like to say economies of place that are supportive in terms of what one farm  
**0:24:21-0:24:27:**  or multiple farms require in the same region.  
**0:24:27-0:24:32:**  When you look at, for example, an agroforestry system, a silver arable agroforestry system,  
**0:24:32-0:24:40:**  there's a lot of different interactions there between the tree and the plant and the crop.  
**0:24:40-0:24:45:**  For example, trees reducing wind damage and therefore increasing crop yield, or trees  
**0:24:45-0:24:51:**  increasing the soil organic matter, which can then have an impact on water content and  
**0:24:51-0:24:53:**  again on fertility, productivity.  
**0:24:53-0:24:57:**  Do you manage to get to that level of detail in your modeling?  
**0:24:57-0:25:06:**  The below-ground interactions, say between roots and crops, based on water availability,  
**0:25:06-0:25:14:**  at least in the non-brittle high precipitation climates of the majority of the locations  
**0:25:14-0:25:20:**  of where we're working, are less important than the light interactions.  
**0:25:20-0:25:26:**  How much irradiance a tree captures, how much photosynthetic active radiation that tree  
**0:25:26-0:25:34:**  canopy is intercepting as that light makes its way down to the crop.  
**0:25:34-0:25:41:**  What's important to look at, number one, is how much light is the tree capturing and over  
**0:25:41-0:25:45:**  time how is that changing.  
**0:25:45-0:25:49:**  That's really contingent on three factors.  
**0:25:49-0:25:56:**  We actually know this from the research that the SAFE report, the safe...  
**0:25:56-0:26:05:**  Silvo Arable Agroforestry for Europe, mostly out of France and Montpelier, three factors  
**0:26:05-0:26:06:**  there.  
**0:26:06-0:26:08:**  They have an equation.  
**0:26:08-0:26:14:**  It's the canopy width of the tree, the diameter breast height, and then the distance from  
**0:26:14-0:26:21:**  the tree itself dictates how much light is passing through the canopy.  
**0:26:21-0:26:28:**  From there we can look at what species have different sized canopies in different years  
**0:26:28-0:26:34:**  and what does that interaction look like between the tree and the crop beneath.  
**0:26:34-0:26:41:**  At the end of the day we have to ask the question, are we maximizing yields, so dry matter itself,  
**0:26:41-0:26:44:**  or are we maximizing profitability?  
**0:26:44-0:26:52:**  If the margins on the grain crop below or the pasture crop below are really second and  
**0:26:52-0:26:58:**  say lower than the margins on the tree crop yields, then it would make more sense to prioritize  
**0:26:58-0:27:04:**  the tree crop yields and say put more space between those rows.  
**0:27:04-0:27:05:**  Excuse me, that would be the opposite.  
**0:27:05-0:27:14:**  If the tree crop margins and we'll say net income is higher than the understory, then  
**0:27:14-0:27:22:**  put less space and prioritize the trees and more space for the opposite.  
**0:27:22-0:27:27:**  You're not necessarily including so much of the data on the impact of the trees on the  
**0:27:27-0:27:34:**  soil, on the crops in this case, because just to understand it's got less of an impact.  
**0:27:34-0:27:39:**  The light is the predominant factor that will impact the production of the intercrop, for  
**0:27:39-0:27:40:**  example.  
**0:27:40-0:27:47:**  Yes, 100% and that's pretty consistent from southern France, say Mediterranean Montpelier  
**0:27:47-0:27:52:**  over to Guelph, Ontario is what they found as pretty consistent.  
**0:27:52-0:28:01:**  Then in eastern China at about the latitude of South Korea, they found the same thing  
**0:28:01-0:28:03:**  over there.  
**0:28:03-0:28:04:**  That's super interesting.  
**0:28:04-0:28:11:**  And could you guys give us some examples of some of the systems that you guys have been  
**0:28:11-0:28:16:**  designing and helping farmers implement, maybe some of your favorites?  
**0:28:16-0:28:22:**  Yeah, that's the fun part.  
**0:28:22-0:28:32:**  Some of the favorites that I think we've really landed on with farms are integrating black  
**0:28:32-0:28:41:**  locusts into the cattle production rotational grazing systems down in Maryland.  
**0:28:41-0:28:48:**  That is where we're doing relatively wide spaced alleys of black locust integrated with  
**0:28:48-0:28:55:**  a rotation system of Angus cattle.  
**0:28:55-0:29:04:**  Another one is black current production systems integrated with hay at a relatively tight  
**0:29:04-0:29:09:**  spacing for hay, which is about 20 foot row centers.  
**0:29:09-0:29:15:**  Still allows for most of that hay to be in production over the lifespan of that system  
**0:29:15-0:29:18:**  while getting a quality yield out of the black current.  
**0:29:18-0:29:25:**  And another one would be chestnut production systems being able to integrate cattle as  
**0:29:25-0:29:28:**  well as hay crops into the chestnut.  
**0:29:28-0:29:34:**  And those are different spacings from the hay side versus for the cattle side of things.  
**0:29:34-0:29:38:**  Really on the cattle side, it's about maximizing forage growth.  
**0:29:38-0:29:40:**  So it's a little bit of a wider spacing.  
**0:29:40-0:29:46:**  And on the hay side, you can get away with a little bit of a tighter spacing if you're  
**0:29:46-0:29:54:**  looking at certain goals within that hay crop, like protein production rather than volume.  
**0:29:54-0:29:58:**  So it's a wide array of stuff that we'd like to look at.  
**0:29:58-0:30:04:**  And then we've done some projects where we're looking at integrating with corn or soy production  
**0:30:04-0:30:10:**  systems where those are super wide spaced orchard bands of things like peaches, as well  
**0:30:10-0:30:18:**  as some longer term hardwoods like black walnut and swamp white oaks, as well as some black  
**0:30:18-0:30:21:**  locust as well integrated into those systems.  
**0:30:21-0:30:28:**  So more of a long term and short rotational hardwood integration with row crop systems.  
**0:30:28-0:30:29:**  I'll leave it there.  
**0:30:29-0:30:32:**  I'm happy to kind of dive into any of those that you think are interesting.  
**0:30:32-0:30:37:**  Yeah, I'm sure we'll be able to go into more examples as we illustrate the conversation  
**0:30:37-0:30:38:**  as we progress.  
**0:30:38-0:30:43:**  One thing I wanted to ask is, I'm assuming there's a lot of testing that's going out.  
**0:30:43-0:30:49:**  Are you able then to kind of feedback information and to record what's going on compared to  
**0:30:49-0:30:51:**  the projections you made?  
**0:30:51-0:30:55:**  Oh, yeah, that's hugely important.  
**0:30:55-0:31:06:**  Every project we have, we record the successes at the kind of the various levels of the system,  
**0:31:06-0:31:07:**  right?  
**0:31:07-0:31:13:**  From looking at weed suppression in terms of base maintenance of the trees based upon  
**0:31:13-0:31:21:**  a given protocol through to tree growth in terms of height, tree vigor, tree health,  
**0:31:21-0:31:23:**  things of that nature.  
**0:31:23-0:31:30:**  And there's kind of two sides to this looking at kind of the lagging indicators versus the  
**0:31:30-0:31:33:**  leading indicators of these systems.  
**0:31:33-0:31:39:**  And at the end of the day, looking at maximizing yield of the tree outputs that you're looking  
**0:31:39-0:31:44:**  for, those feedback loops come in longer term periods.  
**0:31:44-0:31:51:**  And so, while we have indicators that we can focus on while we're kind of the early stages  
**0:31:51-0:31:57:**  of these projects, those indicators don't necessarily tell us everything we need to  
**0:31:57-0:32:04:**  know about the yield that will come from these projects as we move toward production.  
**0:32:04-0:32:11:**  Plant health vigor is really kind of where we like to focus on in terms of the short  
**0:32:11-0:32:17:**  term measurements that enable us to say that a project's being successful, a protocol has  
**0:32:17-0:32:22:**  been successful, or a protocol hasn't been successful based from a project by project  
**0:32:22-0:32:24:**  basis.  
**0:32:24-0:32:33:**  Can you manage this data collection or is this data collection managed by the farmer?  
**0:32:33-0:32:34:**  It's project by project.  
**0:32:34-0:32:41:**  And so, depending on the farm's capacity and time commitment to the project, they can manage  
**0:32:41-0:32:48:**  it themselves or we can provide that as a resource.  
**0:32:48-0:32:59:**  It's also worth noting that every farm has a different level of budget and time constraints  
**0:32:59-0:33:02:**  with regards to how much they want to put into these systems.  
**0:33:02-0:33:08:**  And so, some farms measure them more robustly and some farms, we don't measure them nearly  
**0:33:08-0:33:13:**  as robustly and we're looking for kind of some one or two key indicators for success  
**0:33:13-0:33:17:**  versus five to 10 on certain projects.  
**0:33:17-0:33:22:**  And just to give an example there, if it's a silvopasture system, then the grazer is  
**0:33:22-0:33:28:**  going to be much more interested in understanding cow days per acre as the system goes on than  
**0:33:28-0:33:29:**  we are.  
**0:33:29-0:33:34:**  And we're going to be much more interested in diameter breast height of the timber trees  
**0:33:34-0:33:38:**  or things like yield on the blackcurrants.  
**0:33:38-0:33:43:**  And so now you've got this design set out that you've worked with the farmer, you've  
**0:33:43-0:33:49:**  created the context and you've used your data to find out what's the best species, what's  
**0:33:49-0:33:50:**  the best system spacings, etc.  
**0:33:50-0:33:54:**  Now you're ready to go to the project development phase.  
**0:33:54-0:33:59:**  And so you said it works out in different ways depending on the skills and the capacity  
**0:33:59-0:34:03:**  and the infrastructure of the farmer, right?  
**0:34:03-0:34:07:**  Do you guys sometimes manage the whole implementation or is this something that you do usually out  
**0:34:07-0:34:10:**  does the farm usually take care of that?  
**0:34:10-0:34:17:**  We usually partner with the farm to bridge any required needs of that farm specifically.  
**0:34:17-0:34:25:**  And so that can range from us just providing protocols and technical services to us actually  
**0:34:25-0:34:34:**  providing all of the labor inputs and being the so-called foreman of that project.  
**0:34:34-0:34:41:**  At the end of the day, we're responsible for ensuring that the project meets the analytics  
**0:34:41-0:34:44:**  expectations that it set forth.  
**0:34:44-0:34:50:**  So for us, we have a vested interest in ensuring that that farm, whether or not we're the ones  
**0:34:50-0:34:57:**  managing the planting, are doing so in a fashion that enables them to be successful.  
**0:34:57-0:35:04:**  In Greece, in our context on Maisi Farm, it was very difficult to find things like  
**0:35:04-0:35:12:**  planting machines and mulching machines and even just wood chips as a general material.  
**0:35:12-0:35:16:**  And I saw on your website that you use, it seems that you use quite a lot of machines  
**0:35:16-0:35:18:**  to implement your systems.  
**0:35:18-0:35:21:**  Could you explain to us a bit some of these machines that you use?  
**0:35:21-0:35:23:**  And it's quite exciting for us.  
**0:35:23-0:35:25:**  Yeah, of course.  
**0:35:25-0:35:26:**  Happy to jump into that.  
**0:35:26-0:35:34:**  So in the United States, at least in the context that we're working with, agriculture looks  
**0:35:34-0:35:42:**  like broadacre, treeless landscapes with tilled soil.  
**0:35:42-0:35:47:**  And to phrase this in the positive, it's never been easier to plant trees because we're working  
**0:35:47-0:35:49:**  with a blank slate.  
**0:35:49-0:35:56:**  And a lot of the machines that have created that blank slate can also help to diversify  
**0:35:56-0:35:57:**  it.  
**0:35:57-0:36:04:**  So whether that's starting with a tree transplant or a water wheel transplant, it's a rain flow  
**0:36:04-0:36:12:**  implement to establish the crops through to, say, seeding cover crops such as rye and sudan  
**0:36:12-0:36:20:**  grass in place with a drill seeder and then mowing all of that above ground biomass and  
**0:36:20-0:36:27:**  raking it with a rotary rake that would usually be used to just kind of rake hay into windrows.  
**0:36:27-0:36:32:**  We can actually rake that hay up against the side of the tree rows and use that as mulch.  
**0:36:32-0:36:40:**  So using that in situ biomass to serve as mulch if wood chips are a more difficult option  
**0:36:40-0:36:41:**  to come by.  
**0:36:41-0:36:48:**  On the wood chip front, the main machinery that we use is called a row mulcher.  
**0:36:48-0:36:50:**  So a few brands to look up.  
**0:36:50-0:36:54:**  Lanco, L-A-N-C-O, and then Mill Creek.  
**0:36:54-0:37:02:**  So that it looks like a big trough, if you will, that's pulled behind a tractor and spits  
**0:37:02-0:37:07:**  out the bark mulch or wood chips or compost right out the side.  
**0:37:07-0:37:12:**  And that's an extremely efficacious way to add biomass to a system.  
**0:37:12-0:37:21:**  A lot of that biomass comes from either sawmills or existing forests in the United, or at least  
**0:37:21-0:37:22:**  in the Northeast United States.  
**0:37:22-0:37:27:**  There are a number of biomass power plants that burn wood chips for electricity just  
**0:37:27-0:37:30:**  because we have so much existing forest.  
**0:37:30-0:37:38:**  So diverting that, I guess, forest residue to agricultural lands from power generating  
**0:37:38-0:37:45:**  stations is a way that we add fertility and water retention and whatnot to farms.  
**0:37:45-0:37:51:**  So I've seen some of these machines, some of the time they take is like they can plant  
**0:37:51-0:37:55:**  six thousand trees in a day, for example, things like this.  
**0:37:55-0:38:01:**  And it seems that you'd be able to set up an agroforestry system and plant a hectare  
**0:38:01-0:38:05:**  in half a day in this case, even a very complex one with a lot of species.  
**0:38:05-0:38:13:**  I think it's important to note that while planting speed is important, I would say planting  
**0:38:13-0:38:17:**  quality is probably more important.  
**0:38:17-0:38:24:**  And oftentimes with tree projects, what ends up happening is sacrificing quality for just  
**0:38:24-0:38:27:**  getting trees in the ground.  
**0:38:27-0:38:33:**  In terms of laying out these systems and making sure that they're sub centimeter accurate,  
**0:38:33-0:38:39:**  making sure that all the materials and the protocols are in place to ensure a smooth  
**0:38:39-0:38:46:**  planting process, making sure everyone's trained when they're kind of planting the tree, how  
**0:38:46-0:38:53:**  to plant it, how not to J-root it, how deep to stick it into the ground.  
**0:38:53-0:38:58:**  All of those kind of protocols kind of get lumped in to the time it takes to make a project  
**0:38:58-0:39:00:**  happen.  
**0:39:00-0:39:06:**  And so while physically going with a tractor and a tree planter and sticking the tree in  
**0:39:06-0:39:14:**  the ground itself might be fast, the planning process, the training process, the materials  
**0:39:14-0:39:19:**  management and ensuring everything's set up for success is really where a lot of the time  
**0:39:19-0:39:23:**  goes to ensure that projects are successful.  
**0:39:23-0:39:35:**  And I think in terms of making sure that you're doing things right from the outset, you can  
**0:39:35-0:39:44:**  plant a system on seven acres within two days or within a day or a couple hours, depending  
**0:39:44-0:39:47:**  on what you're doing, the spacing, et cetera.  
**0:39:47-0:39:54:**  But ensuring that the spacing is perfect, ensuring that every stick or every root that  
**0:39:54-0:39:58:**  is going in the ground is done so with the exact same method.  
**0:39:58-0:40:02:**  That's really where the key is to ensure that projects are successful.  
**0:40:02-0:40:04:**  Cool.  
**0:40:04-0:40:06:**  And yeah, I just wanted to go a bit further.  
**0:40:06-0:40:10:**  I mean, now we've covered the planting and it's been really interesting, but once the  
**0:40:10-0:40:17:**  systems are planted, what kind of supports do you offer farmers on management techniques,  
**0:40:17-0:40:20:**  be it pruning or harvesting?  
**0:40:20-0:40:22:**  I mean, first of all, do you offer that kind of support?  
**0:40:22-0:40:27:**  And if you do, how is that deployed through time?  
**0:40:27-0:40:28:**  An excellent question.  
**0:40:28-0:40:33:**  Yes, we do offer that support.  
**0:40:33-0:40:35:**  Every farm is different with how we engage.  
**0:40:35-0:40:41:**  And so if the farm themselves is managing their own system and we're hands off, it's  
**0:40:41-0:40:46:**  very much like a technical service provider.  
**0:40:46-0:40:50:**  One of the things that we're in the process of building out and opening up our process  
**0:40:50-0:40:58:**  too is actually enabling our product from the analysis side to actually take care of  
**0:40:58-0:41:04:**  a lot of those educational resources that allow for them to understand different management  
**0:41:04-0:41:09:**  practices as well as for them to document what they're doing on the farm.  
**0:41:09-0:41:14:**  And so we haven't released that yet, but where we're going is being able to provide those  
**0:41:14-0:41:17:**  project development tools for farms.  
**0:41:17-0:41:23:**  So that way they can get access to best practices and protocols in the form of primers, reading  
**0:41:23-0:41:28:**  materials, videos, et cetera, but also to give them the tools to enable them to track  
**0:41:28-0:41:30:**  what they're doing on the farm.  
**0:41:30-0:41:33:**  I think that answers-  
**0:41:33-0:41:34:**  Yeah, that's great.  
**0:41:34-0:41:40:**  But that sets a second question, which is about best practices, because when Dimitri  
**0:41:40-0:41:44:**  and I were trying to figure out the best thing to do for our trees in Greece, you have a  
**0:41:44-0:41:46:**  lot of conflicting information.  
**0:41:46-0:41:49:**  Even within the small agroforestry world, there's a lot of stuff going on.  
**0:41:49-0:41:54:**  There's a lot of experimentation and it's not always that easy to know what is the best  
**0:41:54-0:41:55:**  thing to do.  
**0:41:55-0:42:00:**  So I was wondering, how have you guys managed to access best practice?  
**0:42:00-0:42:05:**  And I mean, have you found certain key experts that you have trust in and that then you'd  
**0:42:05-0:42:08:**  implement their, let's say, techniques and philosophy?  
**0:42:08-0:42:11:**  Or again, are you going more towards the academic route?  
**0:42:11-0:42:13:**  I'm really curious about that.  
**0:42:13-0:42:17:**  It's a both-and.  
**0:42:17-0:42:19:**  Every crop is different.  
**0:42:19-0:42:25:**  So there's people who have expertise in managing that crop for 20, 30, 40 years.  
**0:42:25-0:42:29:**  And there's a lot to be learned from both the conventional management of that crop,  
**0:42:29-0:42:35:**  but also the people who have innovated and both looking at it in terms of the results  
**0:42:35-0:42:41:**  of productivity, yield, et cetera, but also looking at it in terms of what the trade-offs  
**0:42:41-0:42:42:**  are.  
**0:42:42-0:42:48:**  And so for us, where we aggregate best practices is both looking at the things that have been  
**0:42:48-0:42:53:**  successful in the past for all those crops, the innovators, as well as the people who  
**0:42:53-0:42:58:**  have done it from a conventional perspective, but then also looking at it in terms of where  
**0:42:58-0:43:03:**  people want to go and giving them the options to choose how they want to do it because there  
**0:43:03-0:43:05:**  are so many options.  
**0:43:05-0:43:12:**  Some of the best practices in terms of planting chestnuts involve using chemical sprays.  
**0:43:12-0:43:15:**  Some involve using mulch.  
**0:43:15-0:43:16:**  Some involve using weed mats.  
**0:43:16-0:43:21:**  And so being able to provide the options and then being able to showcase who does what  
**0:43:21-0:43:26:**  and the outcomes that have resulted from that is really key.  
**0:43:26-0:43:33:**  So being less so preaching about what protocol is best, more so providing the best options  
**0:43:33-0:43:41:**  that are known within the crop itself and the knowledge base of that crop.  
**0:43:41-0:43:48:**  And triangulating, say, a four-acre small-scale holistic apple producers protocol with that  
**0:43:48-0:43:55:**  of a 200-acre organic apple orchard in the Pacific Northwest.  
**0:43:55-0:44:03:**  And then looking at what machinery and capabilities a farm actually has and modeling everything  
**0:44:03-0:44:07:**  pretty exhaustively and then making recommendations from there.  
**0:44:07-0:44:15:**  Yeah, I'd say one of the areas where we've put some effort into, and this goes back to  
**0:44:15-0:44:23:**  a conversation earlier about research and where data and insights can come from, is  
**0:44:23-0:44:33:**  that there are folks practicing agroforestry globally with different tools and equipment.  
**0:44:33-0:44:42:**  And so what we're thinking is really valuable is how can someone in Greece, for example,  
**0:44:42-0:44:51:**  learn from an insight from a producer in New York or Peru?  
**0:44:51-0:44:57:**  And to Harry's point about triangulation is to really start to get an understanding globally  
**0:44:57-0:45:04:**  that there are different sets of knowledge and different tools and resources and pieces  
**0:45:04-0:45:10:**  of equipment that can drive forward the outcome that we're trying to deliver, which goes back  
**0:45:10-0:45:19:**  to healthy landscapes, healthy food, and to make sure that that all gets connected all  
**0:45:19-0:45:26:**  the way through to the point where we're able to sit in a place of confidence and say, we  
**0:45:26-0:45:31:**  have a very clear understanding from an analysis perspective of what's needed.  
**0:45:31-0:45:38:**  We have a very detailed understanding of where to get the resources we need to be successful  
**0:45:38-0:45:45:**  on the farm and to be able to take that forward and be able to bring the capital into place  
**0:45:45-0:45:47:**  without creating any added stress.  
**0:45:47-0:45:55:**  I think a lot of this for us has been, what can we do to bring together communities to  
**0:45:55-0:46:01:**  collaborate or cooperate, if you will, and remove risks?  
**0:46:01-0:46:08:**  I think as we've reflected on our business and a lot of the conversations we've had over  
**0:46:08-0:46:17:**  time is that there are many, many perceived risks for a successful agroforestry operation.  
**0:46:17-0:46:30:**  And it takes a special kind of confidence to be willing to jump into that without having  
**0:46:30-0:46:31:**  answers.  
**0:46:31-0:46:37:**  And I know you've both attempted this and have been successful at it in Greece.  
**0:46:37-0:46:42:**  And if we think more globally, it's like, what can we do to steward that education forward  
**0:46:42-0:46:48:**  so that any agroforestry or globally, wherever they are, can learn from what's happened,  
**0:46:48-0:46:54:**  can see the research, can get access to the resources they need, and can find capital  
**0:46:54-0:46:57:**  without any nonsense?  
**0:46:57-0:47:02:**  And at a high level, that's what we are driving to accomplish.  
**0:47:02-0:47:08:**  Ethan, I'm getting seriously excited behind my computer right now.  
**0:47:08-0:47:11:**  It's one of those things like, ooh, everyone should be smiling.  
**0:47:11-0:47:16:**  I smile when I say stuff like that, but I'm biased.  
**0:47:16-0:47:23:**  I want to add one more important point to this, which is best practices are only as  
**0:47:23-0:47:27:**  good as what the farm wants to implement.  
**0:47:27-0:47:35:**  And so while we can come up with ideas of what makes sense and have options for them,  
**0:47:35-0:47:43:**  at the end of the day, they might want to choose a weed mat instead of using a rotary  
**0:47:43-0:47:50:**  rake for raked hay because it makes more sense for the amount of time that they want to spend  
**0:47:50-0:47:52:**  in using equipment on their farm.  
**0:47:52-0:47:58:**  And so I think a really pivotal part of this is being able to understand what the farm  
**0:47:58-0:48:08:**  and the farm manager wants to do, not just what we think is best for the farm.  
**0:48:08-0:48:09:**  Thanks so much for this.  
**0:48:09-0:48:11:**  It's super clear.  
**0:48:11-0:48:16:**  There's one thing maybe kind of taking a step up in the other direction because it probably  
**0:48:16-0:48:21:**  comes before implementation, but I just wanted to be clear about the whole financing aspect.  
**0:48:21-0:48:26:**  And I mean, there's other podcasts with investing in regenerative agriculture that really go  
**0:48:26-0:48:29:**  into the detail of the whole investment bit.  
**0:48:29-0:48:34:**  So we won't go there necessarily, but just understanding from the farmer's perspective,  
**0:48:34-0:48:36:**  what that relationship means.  
**0:48:36-0:48:39:**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**0:48:39-0:48:51:**  So every farm is different, but if you think about trees in agricultural production systems,  
**0:48:51-0:48:53:**  they act a lot like infrastructure.  
**0:48:53-0:48:59:**  And so when you plant a tree on a farm, that tree doesn't yield for a certain amount of  
**0:48:59-0:49:06:**  years and then it starts yielding and it provides kind of this relatively stable kind of asset  
**0:49:06-0:49:10:**  that sits on the farm and adds value over time.  
**0:49:10-0:49:18:**  The kind of key to unlocking the financing of that, in the research that we did in being  
**0:49:18-0:49:21:**  able to do that kind of comes from two places.  
**0:49:21-0:49:27:**  One, looking at what people were doing in agriculture today that was limiting the scale  
**0:49:27-0:49:32:**  of transitioning landscapes to new production models.  
**0:49:32-0:49:36:**  A lot of that had to do with buying land.  
**0:49:36-0:49:43:**  And we felt that to enable farmers that own land, to enable investors that already own  
**0:49:43-0:49:48:**  land, to enable brands and buyers that have already a broad spectrum of a land footprint,  
**0:49:48-0:49:57:**  that having a strategy that required us to buy land was not necessarily the way to go.  
**0:49:57-0:50:03:**  So the second piece of that was learnings from the solar industry and what they did,  
**0:50:03-0:50:08:**  looking at how they were able to actually separate the ownership of solar panels from  
**0:50:08-0:50:12:**  the land itself and enable investment directly into those solar systems.  
**0:50:12-0:50:18:**  And so what we've built out in terms of financing is being able to invest into trees as assets  
**0:50:18-0:50:26:**  separate from the land on a long-term leasing basis while allowing for the farm to be managed  
**0:50:26-0:50:29:**  in terms of the understory as a separate thing.  
**0:50:29-0:50:35:**  So that way investors can invest into the trees directly on top of the land while still  
**0:50:35-0:50:41:**  enabling the farmers to manage that system the way in which they want to.  
**0:50:41-0:50:48:**  Kind of the way in which that breaks down into specifics, there's multiple parties involved.  
**0:50:48-0:50:50:**  The investors can invest into the trees.  
**0:50:50-0:50:56:**  The farmers can engage in a profit share in those trees as well as can get paid to manage  
**0:50:56-0:50:59:**  those trees from that third party.  
**0:50:59-0:51:02:**  It can also buy out that tree system over time.  
**0:51:02-0:51:06:**  The landowner who, so sometimes the farmer and the landowner are different if the land  
**0:51:06-0:51:07:**  is being leased by that farmer.  
**0:51:07-0:51:14:**  So if there's an extra landowner, that landowner can also participate in a revenue share in  
**0:51:14-0:51:21:**  that system through being able to comp lease rates in the short term to be able to get  
**0:51:21-0:51:24:**  a percentage of that profit over the long term.  
**0:51:24-0:51:31:**  And so what you end up with is a multi-party type of system where the farmers can manage  
**0:51:31-0:51:38:**  the system, get paid to manage the system, and over time can build equity in the system.  
**0:51:38-0:51:44:**  As well as, without having to buy land, we lower the amount of capital needed to get  
**0:51:44-0:51:50:**  exposure from an investment perspective into fruit, nut, and timber crops on land.  
**0:51:50-0:51:53:**  And that's kind of the basic framework for it.  
**0:51:53-0:51:59:**  Yeah, and adding to what Jeremy's pointing out there, I think it's important to point  
**0:51:59-0:52:05:**  out that we're looking at markets that are pretty stable.  
**0:52:05-0:52:13:**  And that things like fruits, nuts, and timber are fairly well understood from an economic  
**0:52:13-0:52:14:**  perspective.  
**0:52:14-0:52:23:**  And that we're not asking for something that's wildly misunderstood from an investment perspective.  
**0:52:23-0:52:30:**  I mean, in a very simple way to put that is people will continue to buy apples.  
**0:52:30-0:52:32:**  And so that's a crop we work with, for example.  
**0:52:32-0:52:41:**  And to Jeremy's point about solar, there were some pretty significant tools used in the  
**0:52:41-0:52:52:**  development of the solar industry that helped drive the investment industry into solar as  
**0:52:52-0:52:58:**  an asset class, particularly getting to the point where banks felt very comfortable.  
**0:52:58-0:53:04:**  And this is around things like the power purchase agreement, where you basically have a forward  
**0:53:04-0:53:12:**  contract on the electricity production prior to the solar array being installed.  
**0:53:12-0:53:21:**  Now to try and transfer that logic to agriculture, you want to be able to, for example, invest  
**0:53:21-0:53:28:**  in the trees before they're planted based off of the productivity of those trees and  
**0:53:28-0:53:31:**  the fruits, nuts, or timber that they'll produce.  
**0:53:31-0:53:40:**  Now granted, the time between electricity production and fruit production is much different,  
**0:53:40-0:53:43:**  but needless to say that the logic is similar.  
**0:53:43-0:53:51:**  And so from an investment perspective, what we're doing is connecting those dots and finding  
**0:53:51-0:53:59:**  the areas that have been successful in scaling up other industries, moving from the in solar  
**0:53:59-0:54:05:**  pilot projects into a more scale up phase and ultimately commercialization where you  
**0:54:05-0:54:10:**  have many, many projects, you have banks involved, and that there's a lot of these different  
**0:54:10-0:54:16:**  components going on from an industry perspective so that there's a robust business ecosystem.  
**0:54:16-0:54:17:**  And that's where we're moving.  
**0:54:17-0:54:26:**  There's a little bit of adding the kind of like oiling up the gears, if you will, so  
**0:54:26-0:54:29:**  that from an industry perspective, that can all take place.  
**0:54:29-0:54:35:**  And I think that's where we're moving pretty quickly within agroforestry and regenerative  
**0:54:35-0:54:42:**  agriculture as they're becoming much more hotly discussed opportunities in agriculture  
**0:54:42-0:54:47:**  and impacting investing and beyond.  
**0:54:47-0:54:49:**  You were talking about connecting dots.  
**0:54:49-0:54:54:**  And for me, maybe the last dots that I need to connect is understanding once the crop  
**0:54:54-0:54:59:**  is ready to harvest, how is the commercialization taking place?  
**0:54:59-0:55:01:**  And I'm assuming you also have a part to play in that.  
**0:55:01-0:55:02:**  Sure.  
**0:55:02-0:55:03:**  Yeah.  
**0:55:03-0:55:08:**  I mean, I know we had touched on this very briefly earlier of the importance of access  
**0:55:08-0:55:16:**  to markets and how we want to make sure that buyers are, commercial buyers are engaged  
**0:55:16-0:55:17:**  in the process.  
**0:55:17-0:55:25:**  Effectively, what you want is knowledge that once the crop is harvested, that somebody  
**0:55:25-0:55:33:**  is already committed to a purchasing price that is fair and that they're ready to receive  
**0:55:33-0:55:35:**  that product.  
**0:55:35-0:55:40:**  Well, back to what I was saying about the power purchase agreement.  
**0:55:40-0:55:46:**  There's an ongoing discussion in the ag world around something called the produce purchase  
**0:55:46-0:55:47:**  agreement.  
**0:55:47-0:55:54:**  Essentially, you buy the crop before the trees are planted at a set price for lack of a better  
**0:55:54-0:55:56:**  way to say it.  
**0:55:56-0:56:01:**  So that's one of the avenues that we're working on and really building relationships with  
**0:56:01-0:56:13:**  commercial buyers, whether those are consumer goods, brands, retailers, distributors, restaurants,  
**0:56:13-0:56:15:**  etc.  
**0:56:15-0:56:18:**  Even wineries or cideries.  
**0:56:18-0:56:22:**  Value add is an important component of this as well.  
**0:56:22-0:56:32:**  And so being able to connect a fully operable agroforestry system and its outputs, the fruits,  
**0:56:32-0:56:38:**  nuts and timber directly to the place where it's going to land, say, on your table as  
**0:56:38-0:56:44:**  the consumer, that everything in between is taken care of.  
**0:56:44-0:56:54:**  And we recognize pretty early with Propagate that asking our farmers to both be excellent  
**0:56:54-0:57:00:**  agroforestors, know everything from a technical perspective around the operations and maintenance  
**0:57:00-0:57:07:**  of their farm, to also be brilliant marketeers and know how to sell their product in every  
**0:57:07-0:57:15:**  corner of the planet and where it goes and to be able to negotiate on price and be able  
**0:57:15-0:57:20:**  to go to the banks and be able to negotiate really good financing deals and be able to  
**0:57:20-0:57:24:**  take on debt or equity for the development of other farms.  
**0:57:24-0:57:27:**  It's a very tall ask.  
**0:57:27-0:57:33:**  And now to add to it, we're asking our farm community, by the way, figure out how to sequester  
**0:57:33-0:57:38:**  carbon and how to build soil health and retain water.  
**0:57:38-0:57:45:**  You know, all of a sudden you're staring at this going, that's a lot.  
**0:57:45-0:57:49:**  Thanks for asking me to do everything.  
**0:57:49-0:57:57:**  And so from our perspective, if we can start to remove some of those challenges, particularly  
**0:57:57-0:58:00:**  around access to markets.  
**0:58:00-0:58:06:**  And so I'll give you an example, we're working with a large pasture raised egg company here  
**0:58:06-0:58:09:**  in the United States.  
**0:58:09-0:58:14:**  And they're very interested in agroforestry because there's so much ecological value,  
**0:58:14-0:58:18:**  because it delivers more profitability for the farms that they already work for.  
**0:58:18-0:58:26:**  And so there's a really clear incentive for this food company to work with the farmers  
**0:58:26-0:58:30:**  they already talk to on a daily basis.  
**0:58:30-0:58:33:**  And to build agroforestry into their operation.  
**0:58:33-0:58:38:**  And now we're working on a cost share program with them to help those farmers within their  
**0:58:38-0:58:42:**  supply chain transition to agroforestry.  
**0:58:42-0:58:44:**  And so there's an example.  
**0:58:44-0:58:55:**  Another example, we work with a beer company that makes a really awesome black currant  
**0:58:55-0:58:57:**  sour beer.  
**0:58:57-0:59:02:**  And it's one of those beers that you kind of wish you had like every day on a hot summer  
**0:59:02-0:59:03:**  day.  
**0:59:03-0:59:08:**  Yeah, you got to be careful because it's one of the good ones.  
**0:59:08-0:59:14:**  And so with that in mind, there's a clear opportunity for them to start to vertically  
**0:59:14-0:59:19:**  integrate into their own supply chain, the production of black currants.  
**0:59:19-0:59:23:**  And that beer happens to be one of their better selling beers.  
**0:59:23-0:59:30:**  So it's I think some of the marketing components around bringing buyers to the table and making  
**0:59:30-0:59:38:**  sure that the price per pound of the crop is delivered.  
**0:59:38-0:59:46:**  That you find the areas where there's a clear incentive or a clear opportunity that creates  
**0:59:46-0:59:49:**  a winning scenario.  
**0:59:49-0:59:53:**  And to be completely honest, that is not always true.  
**0:59:53-0:59:58:**  Sometimes there are contracts that get put in place that are not perfect.  
**0:59:58-1:00:01:**  And it's sort of the nature of business.  
**1:00:01-1:00:06:**  But also what we can do by bringing in long term partners and collaborators is finding  
**1:00:06-1:00:13:**  the opportunity to connect to your point, connect those dots in a way where people have  
**1:00:13-1:00:20:**  a vested interest in the ecological health and more importantly, the economic health  
**1:00:20-1:00:23:**  of the farm.  
**1:00:23-1:00:31:**  One of the aspects that you've talked a lot about just now and that has been actually  
**1:00:31-1:00:37:**  an overarching theme in this whole conversation we've been having that holds farmers back  
**1:00:37-1:00:44:**  the most is innovating new systems for innovating new systems on the farm is economic viability.  
**1:00:44-1:00:48:**  And as you said just now, that's especially the case for agroforestry.  
**1:00:48-1:00:53:**  So this is something we wanted to dig a bit deeper in with you guys, because we think  
**1:00:53-1:00:57:**  you have something really important to bring to the table here to this whole agroforestry  
**1:00:57-1:00:58:**  conversation.  
**1:00:58-1:01:04:**  And from your experience and from what you've been able to model and to understand, how  
**1:01:04-1:01:06:**  profitable is it?  
**1:01:06-1:01:09:**  How does it actually improve?  
**1:01:09-1:01:10:**  In what way?  
**1:01:10-1:01:13:**  And does it actually improve the farm's economic viability?  
**1:01:13-1:01:15:**  Of course.  
**1:01:15-1:01:20:**  So I guess to gauge profitability, there are a few different metrics that we have to look  
**1:01:20-1:01:21:**  at.  
**1:01:21-1:01:30:**  And this really dives into, I guess reasonably complex, but not unreasonably complex financial  
**1:01:30-1:01:32:**  modeling over 20 years.  
**1:01:32-1:01:37:**  Two of those really important metrics that we're looking at are the net present value  
**1:01:37-1:01:40:**  of a tree system and the internal rate of return.  
**1:01:40-1:01:49:**  So to make that a bit more accessible, the net present value is the aggregate of all  
**1:01:49-1:01:55:**  of the future net income from that crop, all of the future profits, say from right when  
**1:01:55-1:02:01:**  it starts yielding or actually right when it's installed through to when it's been in  
**1:02:01-1:02:06:**  production for say five to 10 plus years.  
**1:02:06-1:02:13:**  And to communicate that future value back to today's dollars, what we use is a process  
**1:02:13-1:02:23:**  called discounted cash flow, which phrases cash inflows in the future in today's dollars.  
**1:02:23-1:02:25:**  So happy to dive into that more.  
**1:02:25-1:02:30:**  It's a bit complex, but it's absolutely necessary in looking at multi-year profitability because  
**1:02:30-1:02:32:**  there is that time lag to yield.  
**1:02:32-1:02:41:**  Secondly, the internal rate of return, the best way to look at it is if you were to get  
**1:02:41-1:02:49:**  a loan from a bank to finance this system, what interest rate would essentially eat all  
**1:02:49-1:02:51:**  of your profits?  
**1:02:51-1:02:59:**  So if you borrowed from a bank to finance the system at 12 percent, then that's a pretty  
**1:02:59-1:03:02:**  high interest rate, at least in the United States.  
**1:03:02-1:03:09:**  And if you had a 12 percent IRR on your yields, you would end up with zero dollars in net  
**1:03:09-1:03:17:**  income because that all of that money to service your debt would be going to the bank.  
**1:03:17-1:03:23:**  So the higher the internal rate of return, the IRR, the higher the profitability.  
**1:03:23-1:03:27:**  Could you translate some of these tools and what they tell you for some of the different  
**1:03:27-1:03:28:**  systems that you're implementing?  
**1:03:28-1:03:34:**  Is it something that, as you said, the internal rate of return, is it interesting based on  
**1:03:34-1:03:36:**  the kind of funding the farmers can get?  
**1:03:36-1:03:41:**  Is it something that is the economic aspect, an argument that really gets to convince farmers  
**1:03:41-1:03:43:**  or not?  
**1:03:43-1:03:46:**  Yeah, it's a really good question.  
**1:03:46-1:03:55:**  And to bring the IRR point close to home with something Jeremy mentioned earlier around  
**1:03:55-1:04:00:**  the separation of the tree as an asset from the land.  
**1:04:00-1:04:09:**  One of the things in our economic modeling that became very clear is to increase the  
**1:04:09-1:04:19:**  IRR of a project, the only focusing on the trees as assets without the cost of purchasing  
**1:04:19-1:04:22:**  the real estate.  
**1:04:22-1:04:27:**  So remove the cost of the land that actually increases the IRR.  
**1:04:27-1:04:34:**  So to what Harry was pointing out a second ago around having a higher IRR, some of the  
**1:04:34-1:04:41:**  structural components are really important from an investment perspective so that both  
**1:04:41-1:04:53:**  our farm operators are profitable and as investors get engaged, that their return is delivered  
**1:04:53-1:04:57:**  in a much more exciting way.  
**1:04:57-1:05:03:**  And so that's where we really wanted to be able to pull strings on this design of the  
**1:05:03-1:05:06:**  investment or the structure of how this gets put together.  
**1:05:06-1:05:10:**  And we've talked a bit about some of that on the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture  
**1:05:10-1:05:12:**  podcast.  
**1:05:12-1:05:19:**  Anyhow, I wanted to point that out as one of the areas that's an important structural  
**1:05:19-1:05:26:**  factor for why we focus on that as an opportunity.  
**1:05:26-1:05:31:**  And then there's plenty to build on there, Harry or Jeremy, if you want to add to that.  
**1:05:31-1:05:33:**  Yeah, of course.  
**1:05:33-1:05:40:**  And just look in, I guess, on Ethan's point, separating the trees as assets from the land  
**1:05:40-1:05:43:**  itself enables much higher IRRs.  
**1:05:43-1:05:50:**  So at least in the United States, it's generally not viable to cash flow a mortgage with an  
**1:05:50-1:05:54:**  agricultural income, except in very rare scenarios.  
**1:05:54-1:05:58:**  That's just kind of the economic climate we're living in today.  
**1:05:58-1:06:07:**  And so IRRs can range from, say, 9 to 18 to 22 percent, depending on value add and vertical  
**1:06:07-1:06:08:**  integration.  
**1:06:08-1:06:16:**  So selling just straight elderberries, unprocessed, it doesn't do a whole lot just because the  
**1:06:16-1:06:23:**  lack of buyers and all of the margin there is really in selling a finished product such  
**1:06:23-1:06:24:**  as elderberry syrup.  
**1:06:24-1:06:27:**  However, blueberries are the opposite.  
**1:06:27-1:06:35:**  Having access to markets for fresh berries is really the go on that front.  
**1:06:35-1:06:45:**  Another important point to make is looking at all of this from a perspective where the  
**1:06:45-1:06:55:**  capital is available is a completely different paradigm than bootstrapping a system that  
**1:06:55-1:06:59:**  needs to cash flow itself year over year.  
**1:06:59-1:07:11:**  So you can have as high a 20 year IRR as you like, but if the capital isn't available to  
**1:07:11-1:07:19:**  start up that system, then that's I mean, a high IRR is all well and good, but the access  
**1:07:19-1:07:25:**  to financing and say equity financing is really the leverage point that we've landed on in  
**1:07:25-1:07:26:**  agroforestry.  
**1:07:26-1:07:34:**  I just want to build on that a little bit and I think it's important to note that you  
**1:07:34-1:07:40:**  can do a lot of things to lower the risk of a project, but that also oftentimes can lower  
**1:07:40-1:07:42:**  the return on a project.  
**1:07:42-1:07:47:**  Meaning if you have a single buyer that guarantees a price and you buy that product for, you  
**1:07:47-1:07:52:**  have them buy that product for five years, that might limit the amount of upside of a  
**1:07:52-1:07:57:**  project where you might have more than one contract, you might have five contracts that  
**1:07:57-1:08:00:**  are paying negotiated prices on an annual basis.  
**1:08:00-1:08:07:**  And so a big part of the equation is understanding at the farm gate, what level of risk is that  
**1:08:07-1:08:13:**  farm interested in for the end products that they're selling.  
**1:08:13-1:08:21:**  And between that and understanding the capital needs of what it takes to achieve those returns  
**1:08:21-1:08:27:**  is really key to understanding at a farm level what the return can be.  
**1:08:27-1:08:37:**  I think everyone always wants to know how profitable it is and to say it's context specific,  
**1:08:37-1:08:43:**  I want to make sure that it isn't an out on the question, but it is really a way of saying  
**1:08:43-1:08:48:**  that the returns can be incredibly high or the returns can be low and stable, much like  
**1:08:48-1:08:54:**  a commodity, and it's really about the approach on a farm level basis.  
**1:08:54-1:08:58:**  And I guess that's also you adapt the system.  
**1:08:58-1:09:03:**  For example, a timber system would have a much longer term kind of strategy, whereas  
**1:09:03-1:09:11:**  a very integrated system would be short term cash flow, possibly higher risk.  
**1:09:11-1:09:17:**  So it also depends based on the farmer, his needs, the context, and you will adapt the  
**1:09:17-1:09:22:**  agroforestry model, which will have an impact on the whole financial situation of the farm.  
**1:09:22-1:09:30:**  Yeah, maybe to bring us down to a specific example, selling trees on the stump is much  
**1:09:30-1:09:35:**  less value back to the farm than selling milled lumber.  
**1:09:35-1:09:42:**  And if the cost of milling that lumber with a custom miller on site is lower than the  
**1:09:42-1:09:48:**  value add that you get from the difference in selling that milled, it makes sense to  
**1:09:48-1:09:53:**  mill that on site and sell finished goods more so than it does to just sell it on the  
**1:09:53-1:09:54:**  stump.  
**1:09:54-1:09:59:**  Now on a project basis, some farms just might want to sell it on the stump and make a little  
**1:09:59-1:10:03:**  bit less money if they know that it's a little bit less work and a little bit less cost.  
**1:10:03-1:10:09:**  And so doing those types of analyses as to both what the farm is able to do and wants  
**1:10:09-1:10:18:**  to do compared with what the actual upside is of a farm product is part of the work.  
**1:10:18-1:10:23:**  And so you won't, just to bring it down a little level, and I understand that all of  
**1:10:23-1:10:27:**  these answers are context specific and depend on the farmer and apologies if I'm trying  
**1:10:27-1:10:36:**  to simplify things too much, but bring it down a level, you won't engage in a project  
**1:10:36-1:10:41:**  on a farm, do you have a standard of if it doesn't provide so much, a certain rate of  
**1:10:41-1:10:45:**  return or certain IOR, et cetera, you will not engage in that project?  
**1:10:45-1:10:50:**  Do you have an economic standard?  
**1:10:50-1:10:52:**  The short answer is no.  
**1:10:52-1:10:58:**  And the reason for that is some farms just want an ecological yield and don't necessarily  
**1:10:58-1:11:00:**  want an economic yield.  
**1:11:00-1:11:06:**  And so in those cases, it's still important for them to understand the cost of doing that  
**1:11:06-1:11:12:**  implementation and to try to showcase the data of where that value might be coming from.  
**1:11:12-1:11:19:**  For example, I'm looking at the yield of mulberry drops in chicken systems for feed value and  
**1:11:19-1:11:27:**  field where it might not be directly an investable return, but it's something that from an investment  
**1:11:27-1:11:32:**  perspective can be quantified in terms of the value that's being gained from that integrated  
**1:11:32-1:11:36:**  into their poultry production system.  
**1:11:36-1:11:42:**  So the short answer is we're agnostic to what the farm's goals are in integrating trees.  
**1:11:42-1:11:46:**  In terms of from an investment perspective, those are much more clear in terms of the  
**1:11:46-1:11:50:**  types of outcomes we're looking for on a farm basis.  
**1:11:50-1:11:55:**  And part of that is looking at the scale of the farm, the risk of the project in terms  
**1:11:55-1:12:01:**  of the manager and how experienced they are, and then the products that are being selected,  
**1:12:01-1:12:06:**  how confident we are in the markets to be able to fulfill the contracts that we're projecting  
**1:12:06-1:12:08:**  within the analysis.  
**1:12:08-1:12:13:**  And that what we look at in terms of financing is different than what we look at in terms  
**1:12:13-1:12:19:**  of service providing for agroforestry change.  
**1:12:19-1:12:23:**  And just to understand and push a bit more of this example.  
**1:12:23-1:12:29:**  So then you do have clients which are farms which aren't seeking external investments  
**1:12:29-1:12:33:**  and then just come to you for kind of technical expertise.  
**1:12:33-1:12:36:**  And so they'll be kind of investing themselves into the ecological benefits of their own  
**1:12:36-1:12:37:**  production.  
**1:12:37-1:12:39:**  Is that correct?  
**1:12:39-1:12:41:**  Exactly.  
**1:12:41-1:12:47:**  And say if you're going to plant trees, especially a large number of trees, and really just phrase  
**1:12:47-1:12:56:**  that as a cost to your operations, or just a cost or an asset on the balance sheet.  
**1:12:56-1:13:03:**  If that model spits out a negative return, it's important to know how much that's going  
**1:13:03-1:13:10:**  to cost and what would it take to move that into a positive return, either through just  
**1:13:10-1:13:15:**  really monetizing the ecosystem service benefits, whether that's formally through something  
**1:13:15-1:13:26:**  like payments for ecosystem services, or informally, I guess, through one route, say shade benefit  
**1:13:26-1:13:29:**  for livestock, but also just the enjoyment of the farm.  
**1:13:29-1:13:38:**  So how much money is someone willing to contribute to bring a system into existence that is otherwise  
**1:13:38-1:13:39:**  unprofitable?  
**1:13:39-1:13:45:**  And what would it take to make that profitable?  
**1:13:45-1:13:50:**  Agroforestry systems, when you're planting trees, naturally, you're starting to look  
**1:13:50-1:13:54:**  more into the medium and long term.  
**1:13:54-1:14:01:**  So how are the farmers adapting their strategies or how are you noticing farmers adapting their  
**1:14:01-1:14:03:**  medium and long term strategies on the farm?  
**1:14:03-1:14:09:**  Yeah, I mean, farmers contribute a huge amount to thinking about the management, as well  
**1:14:09-1:14:14:**  as thinking about the offtakes.  
**1:14:14-1:14:21:**  It's fascinating how much when they start to get engaged, how much farmers really start  
**1:14:21-1:14:26:**  to add value to the system beyond what we can actually add ourselves.  
**1:14:26-1:14:32:**  And they start to look at their own systems differently and get excited about what's possible  
**1:14:32-1:14:38:**  when they start to see different results, whether it be through farms initially feeling  
**1:14:38-1:14:41:**  like it might be complex to do hay between rows of trees and then eventually feeling  
**1:14:41-1:14:47:**  like, oh, this is easy, this is exciting, I might be able to do this more often and  
**1:14:47-1:14:50:**  it actually, I can understand it now.  
**1:14:50-1:14:55:**  Through to them engaging and calling buyers themselves and being able to understand where  
**1:14:55-1:14:56:**  they're going to sell that product.  
**1:14:56-1:14:58:**  It really is a range.  
**1:14:58-1:15:01:**  And that's in terms of the types of farmers we work with.  
**1:15:01-1:15:07:**  We work with farmers that are the most conservative or Mennonite or Amish communities through  
**1:15:07-1:15:09:**  to more progressive farmers.  
**1:15:09-1:15:16:**  And across the board, the farmers themselves, because they're problem solvers in their own  
**1:15:16-1:15:21:**  right, they're willing to get their hands dirty and dig in and understand the systems  
**1:15:21-1:15:28:**  and be willing to kind of find the places where they're most interested in adding value  
**1:15:28-1:15:30:**  for themselves.  
**1:15:30-1:15:37:**  With Dimitri, we've talked about this numerous times working on the land, is that we've talked  
**1:15:37-1:15:43:**  about this tension that there is between, on the one hand, ecology that drives you to  
**1:15:43-1:15:48:**  complexify systems and towards diversification.  
**1:15:48-1:15:53:**  And on the other hand, having to balance this with an economic logic that pushes you more  
**1:15:53-1:15:58:**  towards efficiency and standardization to allow for mechanization.  
**1:15:58-1:16:01:**  And it's like you're constantly walking on this tight rope.  
**1:16:01-1:16:05:**  And I was wondering, have you encountered this tension?  
**1:16:05-1:16:07:**  And if so, how do you manage it?  
**1:16:07-1:16:14:**  In short, I'll say delicately.  
**1:16:14-1:16:17:**  It's a really great deep dive to go into.  
**1:16:17-1:16:25:**  And it's, it's, it's we can, one of the ways to look at it is we can take a maximal approach  
**1:16:25-1:16:28:**  or a minimalist approach.  
**1:16:28-1:16:32:**  And adding a single species to a pasture increases biodiversity.  
**1:16:32-1:16:40:**  And if that species is economically profitable, then we can have our cake and eat it too.  
**1:16:40-1:16:47:**  And I'll just add that we work a certain amount of support species into the system.  
**1:16:47-1:16:56:**  So every, every 10th row might be hyperbiodiverse, such to provide those pollinator and fungal  
**1:16:56-1:17:00:**  benefits to the system.  
**1:17:00-1:17:03:**  And that's really just phrased as a cost.  
**1:17:03-1:17:10:**  But the more we can say, instead of just normal sunflowers or normal, normal, it's, it's Helianthus  
**1:17:10-1:17:14:**  divericatus, that's a woodland sunflower in the US.  
**1:17:14-1:17:21:**  The more we can switch to something like Jerusalem artichoke, Helianthus tuberosus, or from normal  
**1:17:21-1:17:27:**  shrub willow to say an ornamental willow and, and at least create the possibility for an  
**1:17:27-1:17:32:**  economic yield, then the more we can do that, the better.  
**1:17:32-1:17:38:**  And to kind of add to this, I think oftentimes, you know, we have to ask ourselves, what is  
**1:17:38-1:17:41:**  the ecological state that we're looking to achieve?  
**1:17:41-1:17:46:**  Is it ecological stability of a human managed system?  
**1:17:46-1:17:49:**  Or is it the biodiversity of a native forest?  
**1:17:49-1:17:58:**  And I think, you know, we agroforestry in many ways is a managed, managing complexity,  
**1:17:58-1:18:05:**  but it is still a human engaged system, where we're, we're not just leaving it to be and  
**1:18:05-1:18:07:**  turning it back into native forest.  
**1:18:07-1:18:14:**  And so I think we have to be somewhat honest with the fact that really it is humans goals  
**1:18:14-1:18:23:**  largely defining the system's context, and being able to provide ecological value in  
**1:18:23-1:18:33:**  certain cases may be at odds with, with, with being able to provide human value.  
**1:18:33-1:18:42:**  And a good example of this might be things like vol pressure in fields, things like being  
**1:18:42-1:18:49:**  able to ensure that we're not cultivating a deer habitat for within the fields.  
**1:18:49-1:18:58:**  And so part of designing the system is to design within the natural predator and prey  
**1:18:58-1:19:05:**  relationships that nature provides us, but also not being afraid of using certain approaches,  
**1:19:05-1:19:14:**  like removing biomass from the field in the fall and winter to decrease vol habitat, such  
**1:19:14-1:19:19:**  that we can ensure that the trees survive and potential vol damage.  
**1:19:19-1:19:26:**  It's that balance that's really key to ensure that the human outcomes are really being prioritized,  
**1:19:26-1:19:32:**  even though we are delicately managing ecological effects of what we're trying to accomplish  
**1:19:32-1:19:36:**  on the farm.  
**1:19:36-1:19:43:**  And again, are these decisions made by you or do you offer a, you know, a palette of  
**1:19:43-1:19:50:**  choices and consequences and then those, you know, investors or farmers make choices?  
**1:19:50-1:19:51:**  How does that happen?  
**1:19:51-1:19:59:**  It's a total palette and selection, you know, the, if a farm just wants to plant a single  
**1:19:59-1:20:06:**  tree, let's say they just want to plant a pecan orchard, then that is something that's  
**1:20:06-1:20:12:**  totally within what we do, though we work with them to help them understand the benefits  
**1:20:12-1:20:17:**  of integrating a pollinator row into that pecan orchard.  
**1:20:17-1:20:22:**  So that way they can come to understand what increasing diversity can do in terms of adding  
**1:20:22-1:20:23:**  value.  
**1:20:23-1:20:31:**  And we're not going to be very, how do I say this, we're not militant that that is the  
**1:20:31-1:20:35:**  solution that every farm needs to do because every farmer is different and they have different  
**1:20:35-1:20:37:**  goals.  
**1:20:37-1:20:42:**  And at the same time, we will provide them with the info that bats, for instance, provide  
**1:20:42-1:20:50:**  $22.9 billion worth of ecosystem services per year to farmers globally, specifically  
**1:20:50-1:20:52:**  in pest control.  
**1:20:52-1:21:01:**  And say in certain regions of, we'll say the global south, the tropical climates, it's  
**1:21:01-1:21:08:**  something like a 1% increase in bats amounts to a 10% decrease in malaria deaths.  
**1:21:08-1:21:14:**  So things like that that really hit home in terms of understanding the benefits of an  
**1:21:14-1:21:21:**  intact ecology is something we really bring into the farm design process.  
**1:21:21-1:21:27:**  On the same topic, one of the things I wanted to add is how the importance, especially when  
**1:21:27-1:21:34:**  looking at agroforestry of putting value on diversity as well, like for example, complexifying  
**1:21:34-1:21:40:**  tree lines, therefore providing different products that can have a value, et cetera.  
**1:21:40-1:21:46:**  But obviously this also has costs because more complex commercial strategy, more products  
**1:21:46-1:21:50:**  to sell will incur more costs or potentially could.  
**1:21:50-1:21:55:**  Yeah, I think an important concept that we like to kind of throw around is the concept  
**1:21:55-1:21:59:**  of structural biodiversity without compromising commercial productivity.  
**1:21:59-1:22:07:**  And so for example, if you're going to produce a product that needs to be machine harvested,  
**1:22:07-1:22:14:**  putting a tree within that row that's going to be a deterrent to being able to manage  
**1:22:14-1:22:22:**  that shrub crop is really not going to be a positive economic benefit to the farm, but  
**1:22:22-1:22:30:**  adding a row of trees next to a row of those shrub crops allows for you to have structural  
**1:22:30-1:22:35:**  biodiversity into that system without compromising that commercial productivity.  
**1:22:35-1:22:43:**  Essentially the predatory wasps that live in the rough, structurally diverse biomass  
**1:22:43-1:22:49:**  in one row will just fly over to the apple trees and lay their eggs in the caterpillars,  
**1:22:49-1:22:50:**  for instance.  
**1:22:50-1:22:54:**  The biodiversity doesn't necessarily need to be in the row of apples or blackcurrant  
**1:22:54-1:22:57:**  itself.  
**1:22:57-1:23:05:**  And there are some good data on the distance from certain species that you gain a benefit  
**1:23:05-1:23:09:**  in terms of pollinators or predatory insects within a system.  
**1:23:09-1:23:17:**  So part of it is ensuring that we're not putting the biodiversity so far away that it's in  
**1:23:17-1:23:24:**  many ways not really a benefit to the core crops, but keeping it far enough away so that  
**1:23:24-1:23:27:**  it doesn't impede commercial activity.  
**1:23:27-1:23:34:**  It's a huge topic, the whole complexity within agricultural systems and something that we  
**1:23:34-1:23:36:**  won't be able to completely break down in 10 minutes.  
**1:23:36-1:23:46:**  But we had one final question that we prepared for you and bringing this interview to an  
**1:23:46-1:23:47:**  end slowly.  
**1:23:47-1:23:53:**  What's been the biggest challenge as a company to reach your objectives of scaling agroforestry  
**1:23:53-1:23:59:**  or convincing or working with farmers to implement agroforestry?  
**1:23:59-1:24:03:**  It's a loaded question.  
**1:24:03-1:24:08:**  I have a simple answer.  
**1:24:08-1:24:12:**  It comes down to dollars and cents.  
**1:24:12-1:24:17:**  At the end of the day, we're adding valuable assets to farmland.  
**1:24:17-1:24:27:**  And the general rule of thumb is that permanent crops have far more value in terms of the  
**1:24:27-1:24:33:**  amount of value captured by the plant per acre comparatively to row crop production  
**1:24:33-1:24:35:**  systems or grass.  
**1:24:35-1:24:40:**  And so in adding that value, the case is made for itself.  
**1:24:40-1:24:47:**  Now putting all the pieces together needs to be in place before you can make that case.  
**1:24:47-1:24:50:**  But that's what we're doing.  
**1:24:50-1:24:57:**  And if we can put all the pieces together, the value of the crops themselves speak for  
**1:24:57-1:24:59:**  themselves.  
**1:24:59-1:25:05:**  So thank you so much for taking the time and for sharing everything that you've shared.  
**1:25:05-1:25:06:**  Of course.  
**1:25:06-1:25:07:**  And thanks for having us.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Tue, 31 May 2022 12:23:32)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:33:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:33-0:00:34:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:34-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:49:**  Hi everyone and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:49-0:00:51:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:51-0:00:55:**  Last week Dimitri and I travelled to the URAF conference in Sardinia.  
**0:00:55-0:00:59:**  We met many amazing people and had fascinating conversations on agroforestry.  
**0:00:59-0:01:03:**  These conferences are held every two years but if you have the chance we recommend travelling  
**0:01:03-0:01:05:**  to the next one.  
**0:01:05-0:01:09:**  In this short interview with the president of the European Agroforestry Federation, Patrick  
**0:01:09-0:01:14:**  Worms, he explains what the organisation does and its next steps.  
**0:01:14-0:01:19:**  We also discuss how we can build additional bridges between research and practitioners.  
**0:01:19-0:01:20:**  Enjoy.  
**0:01:20-0:01:23:**  Hello Patrick, welcome back on the podcast.  
**0:01:23-0:01:25:**  Thank you, it's a delight to be back.  
**0:01:25-0:01:30:**  To give a bit of context, we're here together in Sardinia in the city of Nuro for the URAF  
**0:01:30-0:01:36:**  2022 Agroforestry Conference and we thought it would be the perfect opportunity to present  
**0:01:36-0:01:38:**  the work of URAF to our listeners.  
**0:01:38-0:01:42:**  So could you tell us a bit about its history and its missions?  
**0:01:42-0:01:43:**  I'd be delighted to.  
**0:01:43-0:01:49:**  So I'm Patrick Worms and I'm the president of URAF and URAF stands for European Agroforestry  
**0:01:49-0:01:50:**  Federation.  
**0:01:50-0:01:56:**  And it was founded 10 years ago this year in France and it was the first ever European  
**0:01:56-0:02:01:**  organisation, European association, European federation if you like, that brought together  
**0:02:01-0:02:05:**  people interested in agroforestry from across the continent.  
**0:02:05-0:02:09:**  Its origins were mostly from the academic community who had rediscovered the importance  
**0:02:09-0:02:14:**  of trees on agricultural lands in the last 20 or 30 years and had started working on  
**0:02:14-0:02:19:**  it in individual European countries and then realised that they could be not only stronger  
**0:02:19-0:02:23:**  working at it together across European boundaries in terms of getting better scientific results  
**0:02:23-0:02:29:**  but also be able to influence and work with European policy makers in order to encourage  
**0:02:29-0:02:32:**  the adoption of agroforestry.  
**0:02:32-0:02:36:**  And today what do the main missions look like then or activities?  
**0:02:36-0:02:38:**  The main mission is really threefold.  
**0:02:38-0:02:42:**  First we are trying to encourage practitioners, meaning farmers and farmers association and  
**0:02:42-0:02:46:**  farmers groups to consider adding agroforestry to their toolkit.  
**0:02:46-0:02:51:**  Most farmers are well advised when it comes to the use of machinery or genetics or inputs  
**0:02:51-0:02:55:**  but they are less well advised when it comes to the use of trees and so we are working  
**0:02:55-0:03:00:**  together with the advisory community and the technical community to help them add that  
**0:03:00-0:03:04:**  particular knowledge base to their system.  
**0:03:04-0:03:07:**  We are a strong academic component and so we also do research.  
**0:03:07-0:03:11:**  We are involved in a couple of European funded research projects at the moment.  
**0:03:11-0:03:17:**  We want to try to digitise agroforestry advisory services for example.  
**0:03:17-0:03:23:**  And the third thing that we do is to try to influence legislation and regulatory systems  
**0:03:23-0:03:27:**  in Europe for your North American listeners.  
**0:03:27-0:03:34:**  You have the National Farm Bureau, here we have equivalent institutions but we have a  
**0:03:34-0:03:38:**  regulatory framework which is far more complex and far more onerous for farmers to respect  
**0:03:38-0:03:40:**  than you have in North America.  
**0:03:40-0:03:44:**  And that means that farmers who want to try agroforestry have to be wary of breaking some  
**0:03:44-0:03:48:**  rule that they may be ignoring and suddenly losing part of their subsidy payments.  
**0:03:48-0:03:52:**  So we work with policy makers to try to change that and we also work with policy makers at  
**0:03:52-0:03:54:**  a more conceptual level.  
**0:03:54-0:03:59:**  For example if you look at the big strategies that the European Union proposed last year,  
**0:03:59-0:04:05:**  the biodiversity strategy, the forestry strategy or the farm to fork strategy, each of them  
**0:04:05-0:04:09:**  make prominent mention of agroforestry as a result of the conversation we had with policy  
**0:04:09-0:04:12:**  makers at that level.  
**0:04:12-0:04:16:**  In our other interview we focused a lot on the policy level so I'll set this aside for  
**0:04:16-0:04:22:**  the moment and focusing more on building this connection between academia and projects on  
**0:04:22-0:04:24:**  the ground.  
**0:04:24-0:04:29:**  What exists today and if I'm a farmer and I want to benefit from this expertise that  
**0:04:29-0:04:32:**  we've witnessed during the World Conference, what can I do today?  
**0:04:32-0:04:36:**  The most luxurious way of getting involved, the Rolls-Royce solution as it were, is to  
**0:04:36-0:04:39:**  become part of a living lab network.  
**0:04:39-0:04:44:**  A living lab network is a network of farms, of communities or landscapes that have decided  
**0:04:44-0:04:48:**  to work closely together with research scientists in order to explore a particular facet of  
**0:04:48-0:04:51:**  agroforestry and thus transform their landscape.  
**0:04:51-0:04:52:**  That's the Rolls-Royce option.  
**0:04:52-0:04:56:**  If you don't have the Rolls-Royce option, the next option is to look at the Europe website  
**0:04:56-0:05:01:**  and inside the Europe website you will have references to all of the people inside individual  
**0:05:01-0:05:04:**  member states who are on national associations.  
**0:05:04-0:05:08:**  And again this is then a network of national academic institutions.  
**0:05:08-0:05:12:**  So if you're a farmer in Germany for example and you don't know who to talk to, get in  
**0:05:12-0:05:13:**  touch with the Europe website.  
**0:05:13-0:05:18:**  You will be directed to the DEFAP website and from there you can then get in touch with  
**0:05:18-0:05:23:**  the university that is close to you and at that university identify one or several individuals,  
**0:05:23-0:05:28:**  typically masters or PhD students, who would be happy to work with you to transform your  
**0:05:28-0:05:30:**  farming systems if only you had to measure what you do.  
**0:05:30-0:05:34:**  It can be intimidating for a farmer to reach out to academics but you think that's the  
**0:05:34-0:05:39:**  way to go and that it's easy and we should just send an email to the closest university  
**0:05:39-0:05:41:**  and get redirected?  
**0:05:41-0:05:44:**  It's just as intimidating for a young academic to talk to a farmer.  
**0:05:44-0:05:45:**  Who is a farmer?  
**0:05:45-0:05:48:**  A farmer is a master of his or her own destiny.  
**0:05:48-0:05:53:**  Dozens to hundreds, sometimes more hectares of land, decisions every single day that are  
**0:05:53-0:05:59:**  profoundly influenced by complex factors like weather and disease and price and commodities  
**0:05:59-0:06:01:**  and rules and regulations.  
**0:06:01-0:06:08:**  Farmers are not academics but the cognitive load, the amount of decision making, the complexity  
**0:06:08-0:06:14:**  of the decisions that have to be taken by a farmer are just as high and probably higher  
**0:06:14-0:06:16:**  than they are for an academic.  
**0:06:16-0:06:23:**  So when you have a PhD student or researcher coming on your farm, what you often see is  
**0:06:23-0:06:24:**  that it's a meeting of equals, right?  
**0:06:24-0:06:28:**  They all have their individual perspective, one is spending most of his time reading scientific  
**0:06:28-0:06:31:**  papers, the other one is spending most of his time figuring out how to run a farm but  
**0:06:31-0:06:35:**  they have the conversations are extremely rich and extremely fruitful because they're  
**0:06:35-0:06:40:**  both interested in the same things, they both have the same degree of curiosity but they  
**0:06:40-0:06:41:**  bring together complementary perspectives.  
**0:06:41-0:06:44:**  So by all means don't be afraid of doing that.  
**0:06:44-0:06:50:**  Okay, well that kind of answers the building new relationships but how about taking advantage  
**0:06:50-0:06:54:**  of the incredible amount of knowledge that's already been produced in previous research  
**0:06:54-0:06:57:**  programs and thinking of, for example, Ag Forward.  
**0:06:57-0:07:00:**  Are there any resources there that I would find practical as a farmer?  
**0:07:00-0:07:06:**  Yes, you will find these resources on the web obviously but how many farmers have time  
**0:07:06-0:07:09:**  in the evening to still spend a couple of hours doing research, I don't know.  
**0:07:09-0:07:13:**  So if you're a farmer who would be interested in having this but you don't have the time  
**0:07:13-0:07:16:**  to actually do the research yourself, the solution is actually exactly the same, get  
**0:07:16-0:07:19:**  in touch with the local university.  
**0:07:19-0:07:24:**  Very often a student will be only too happy to do the research for you in order to supply  
**0:07:24-0:07:28:**  you with the right advice and then in effect have your own librarian who is spending time  
**0:07:28-0:07:32:**  on the internet trying to find out which paper is applicable to you and whatnot.  
**0:07:32-0:07:36:**  So this is basically about making researchers work for you as a farmer, right?  
**0:07:36-0:07:40:**  Absolutely, you make the cows work for you, you make the trees work for you, you make  
**0:07:40-0:07:42:**  the plants work for you, you might as well make the researchers work for you.  
**0:07:42-0:07:43:**  Great.  
**0:07:43-0:07:45:**  No, I'm serious, right?  
**0:07:45-0:07:48:**  I mean you have to remember what a researcher tries to do.  
**0:07:48-0:07:53:**  A researcher, especially a researcher in agroecology or farming, has to work with a farmer in order  
**0:07:53-0:07:58:**  to get data, in order to understand what's going on and in order to educate him or herself.  
**0:07:58-0:08:01:**  That means that the farmer has the upper hand in that relationship.  
**0:08:01-0:08:03:**  You want to work on my farm, Mr. Researcher person?  
**0:08:03-0:08:09:**  Sure, but in exchange please help me answer this, this and that question.  
**0:08:09-0:08:10:**  Amazing.  
**0:08:10-0:08:15:**  What are the next steps for URAF in terms of the organization's both how it functions  
**0:08:15-0:08:20:**  and its missions, how do you see the next years coming up?  
**0:08:20-0:08:24:**  In terms of organization, we spent the last 10 years being exclusively driven by volunteers.  
**0:08:24-0:08:29:**  We had a volunteer board and we sometimes had staff that was dedicated to projects but  
**0:08:29-0:08:31:**  we never had a head office if you like.  
**0:08:31-0:08:36:**  So this year we are hiring a person who we'll call the Secretary General, full time staffer,  
**0:08:36-0:08:43:**  who's going to be based in Brussels and whose job is going to be to more intensively influence  
**0:08:43-0:08:46:**  the policy process and help us better manage the institution.  
**0:08:46-0:08:51:**  In terms of the objectives that URAF has, we all know, those of us who have been involved  
**0:08:51-0:08:54:**  with agroforestry for a while, that this is an extremely promising field of activity.  
**0:08:54-0:09:00:**  But I think we're all impatient to see more farmers practice it and more farmers adopt  
**0:09:00-0:09:02:**  it and more farmers trial it.  
**0:09:02-0:09:06:**  That is currently the case and those of us who work at the climate modeling side will  
**0:09:06-0:09:09:**  understand how the increasing urgency of that arises.  
**0:09:09-0:09:15:**  The resilience, the impact on resilience of agroforestry based systems is becoming increasingly  
**0:09:15-0:09:18:**  important as weather patterns change more and more.  
**0:09:18-0:09:26:**  So the urgency is growing and so in the next few years at URAF the work is really going  
**0:09:26-0:09:28:**  to be focused on three main axes.  
**0:09:28-0:09:35:**  One ensure that the policy and regulatory framework reduces the barriers to agroforestry  
**0:09:35-0:09:41:**  and makes more money and more technical support available to farmers who want to try agroforestry.  
**0:09:41-0:09:45:**  Second try to figure out a way of working with people who have an entree into every  
**0:09:45-0:09:50:**  farm, meaning the agrochemical companies, to help them integrate these kinds of agroecological  
**0:09:50-0:09:51:**  solutions to their toolkit.  
**0:09:51-0:09:54:**  After all they know how to make money from farmers, we don't.  
**0:09:54-0:09:59:**  So if we can work together with people who already have that expertise in marketing and  
**0:09:59-0:10:03:**  that expertise in talking to farmers it would be absolutely brilliant.  
**0:10:03-0:10:07:**  And the third would be to knit far closer relationships between practitioners and the  
**0:10:07-0:10:08:**  academics.  
**0:10:08-0:10:11:**  URAF is still mostly an academic institution.  
**0:10:11-0:10:16:**  It needs to become a practitioner institution in the same way that Copa Córzejka for example,  
**0:10:16-0:10:22:**  the network of farming organizations in Europe does have some academics but it's mostly a  
**0:10:22-0:10:25:**  practitioner institution.  
**0:10:25-0:10:32:**  URAF needs to be an institution that makes far more room for actual farmers.  
**0:10:32-0:10:35:**  You may then ask why we don't have more farmers here in New Orville.  
**0:10:35-0:10:37:**  Well it's spring, farmers are busy.  
**0:10:37-0:10:39:**  It's the wrong time to have farmers at a conference.  
**0:10:39-0:10:44:**  For the moment the organization of URAF seems to be a lot about sharing peer to peer between  
**0:10:44-0:10:51:**  researchers and I'm wondering can we think of evolving the organization towards more  
**0:10:51-0:10:56:**  peer to peer exchange even through farmers or do you think that the identity of URAF  
**0:10:56-0:11:01:**  is research and farmers need to organize in other types of organizations that can collaborate?  
**0:11:01-0:11:02:**  No absolutely not.  
**0:11:02-0:11:08:**  I think your assessment of what URAF is is skewed by the fact that we are at a scientific  
**0:11:08-0:11:12:**  conference so by definition you have mostly researchers but when you look at the people  
**0:11:12-0:11:18:**  who are involved in URAF at the level of the countries or the members you find that the  
**0:11:18-0:11:22:**  majority are actually practitioners and some of these practitioners are part of research  
**0:11:22-0:11:26:**  projects through Europe, horizon Europe projects or what have you but the vast majority are  
**0:11:26-0:11:31:**  just practitioners that are happy to talk to what they consider to be technical advisors  
**0:11:31-0:11:33:**  in order to improve their agroforestry system.  
**0:11:33-0:11:37:**  So that's already happening and we just need to ensure that it happens more and more.  
**0:11:37-0:11:42:**  Now URAF is a European federation so yes we have some individual members if you want to  
**0:11:42-0:11:46:**  give us 30 euros and become an individual member feel free I'll give you my account  
**0:11:46-0:11:51:**  number, well our account number but most of the time people join through their national  
**0:11:51-0:11:57:**  agroforestry or national farmer federation so in Germany for example it's DEFAF in England  
**0:11:57-0:12:01:**  it's the Woodland Trust in France there's a couple of associations of Slovakia as well  
**0:12:01-0:12:05:**  etc and that's how farmers, practitioners, students and anybody who's interested in fact  
**0:12:05-0:12:08:**  joins URAF and becomes a member of URAF.  
**0:12:08-0:12:10:**  Patrick thank you so much.  
**0:12:10-0:12:14:**  You're welcome it was a pleasure.  
**0:12:14-0:12:19:**  Thanks for listening if you want any additional information about URAF and the work please  
**0:12:19-0:12:23:**  visit their websites I'll add the link in the description we hope you enjoyed this short  
**0:12:23-0:12:41:**  episode.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (2022-01-16)  

**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  our soils and ecosystems?  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  a promising technique called agroforestry.  In order to find out how it can help us with these challenges, we'll be interviewing farmers,  
**0:00:35-0:00:40:**  scientists, and other experts to share with you their experiences, practical advice, and  scientific research.  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:50-0:00:56:**  I'm your host, Dimitri, and today we interviewed Scott and Sandy Williams from the Fields Restored  Farm in Illinois, USA.  Today we're going to approach agroforestry from a bit of a different direction.  
**0:01:02-0:01:08:**  We're going to look at how Scott and Sandy, who are actually landlords of quite a large  farm, are starting to work with their tenant farmer in order to implement a variety of  agroforestry practices, from silvopasture to intercropping and all the way to windbreak.  
**0:01:18-0:01:23:**  So it's very interesting to understand the dynamic between the farmer and the landlord  in order to put out ideas of conservation and to meet sustainability objectives whilst  maintaining the productivity needs of the farmer.  
**0:01:35-0:01:38:**  On the side of this, Scott and Sandy have also been planting a perennial woody polyculture  in collaboration with the Savannah Institute, which is a very innovative type of system  in which a huge diversity of crops are put together in a polyculture, an integrated fashion,  
**0:01:52-0:01:54:**  in order to produce for their local community.  So they're going to talk about both of these things, and it was a fascinating interview,  and I really hope you're going to enjoy it.  
**0:02:01-0:02:02:**  OK.  Hello, Scott and Sandra.  Thank you very much for coming on today, and welcome on the podcast.  
**0:02:11-0:02:12:**  That's great.  Well, I thought we could maybe start with having an understanding of how you came about,  how you ended up owning 500 acres in the first place.  
**0:02:25-0:02:27:**  Where does this land come from?  I'm curious.  Well, we're a sister and brother.  
**0:02:31-0:02:37:**  Our father owned 210 acres that was originally in his family.  And in order to preserve a farm that relatively small for, well, hopefully permanent agricultural  production, my sister and I decided we'd start looking for some additional acres nearby.  
**0:02:54-0:03:00:**  And after a year of looking, we were fortunate enough to find lots more acres than we wanted  originally, which was 167, but it was adjacent.  And so that was ideal.  
**0:03:07-0:03:12:**  We decided to add that to the family holdings.  And this was in the 1990s, mid 1990s.  And then some years later, our farm tenant told us about 50 acres he knew about because  
**0:03:23-0:03:28:**  the farmer renting that land said it was the most productive soil that he had.  And if we could purchase that, our farmer would pay us a higher rent per acre for it.  And so we did.  
**0:03:35-0:03:39:**  And thus the total of roughly 425 acres.  OK.  So it was an investment decision initially?  
**0:03:43-0:03:44:**  Yes.  Yes.  An investment decision in agricultural property to keep it in agricultural production.  
**0:03:52-0:03:53:**  Cool.  And so I'm curious about what's your relationship with the farmer that manages the land?  That's correct.  
**0:03:59-0:04:08:**  Do you frequently discuss with him and does he come to you for new management decisions  he has to make?  So how does the relationship go?  
**0:04:12-0:04:14:**  We see him several times a week.  So we're out there.  We're on the land a lot.  
**0:04:18-0:04:24:**  And so we interact and we don't sit down for formal meetings.  But each year in the negotiation of the rent of the lease renewal, we talk about pros and  cons and how the operation is going.  
**0:04:34-0:04:39:**  And then, you know, in the field during the week, we talk about how things are going.  So the relationship is really it's really excellent.  Oh, that's great.  
**0:04:44-0:04:54:**  Compared to other farm owner operator relationships one hears about, ours is ideal.  It's very cooperative.  And that's an important goal for us is to keep it that way.  
**0:05:00-0:05:07:**  And just so you know, we've been working with this farm family for more than 20 years now.  So we've worked with grandfather and then with son.  And now we're working with son and grandson.  
**0:05:15-0:05:23:**  So as farm operators, that's the business of them as farmers to work land that they  can rent.  That's very interesting.  
**0:05:25-0:05:30:**  Well, it's very good that you have such a good relationship with him, because I can  imagine that if you don't, or as you said, other people you may know who don't have that  good relationship, it can get quite complicated.  
**0:05:36-0:05:44:**  Yeah, and it could very well be that a traditional farm renter would not be very interested in  applying new processes and techniques.  And that's not the case for us.  
**0:05:50-0:05:52:**  So we're very fortunate there.  Nice.  And so if you don't mind me asking, what were your activities whilst on the side?  
**0:05:57-0:05:59:**  I mean, you weren't you weren't farming directly.  So before you started all this new adventure that we're going to talk about soon, what  were you doing?  
**0:06:06-0:06:08:**  Well, we were both working professionals.  So we had daytime jobs.  I happen to be a when we started this, I was a professional banker in Chicago, Illinois,  
**0:06:17-0:06:22:**  working you know, five days a week, five days a week at that and Scott worked for the University  of Illinois in Chicago also.  So we had separate jobs, but we that actually provided us the resources that we could afford  
**0:06:31-0:06:33:**  to purchase land.  Okay, and you were never tempted to start farming to, you know, get a before this in  the 20 years before this was there was it ever an option for you guys to start farming  
**0:06:48-0:06:49:**  ourselves?  No, not realistically, we're both we're both happy gardeners.  And I've been growing trees and shrubs and perennials myself for years, but never full  
**0:07:02-0:07:05:**  time.  Until what happened with until this new adventure, right?  Until, so tell me a bit how that got started?  
**0:07:13-0:07:19:**  How did you find inspiration and motivation to start an agricultural project?  Well, the first the first incentive was to help protect the family property and allow  it to maintain an agricultural production forever.  
**0:07:32-0:07:34:**  Of course, you can't guarantee that.  But one of the things that would help was if the property was larger than the original  farm, which would appeal to more farm tenants willing to work the land in partnership with  
**0:07:47-0:07:48:**  us.  So we achieved that.  But that was always an interest, an abiding family interest in conservation and land stewardship  
**0:07:58-0:08:01:**  and, and hanging on to it.  So it isn't turned into a shopping center or a housing development.  While we were interested in that, a young person we knew was in graduate school.  
**0:08:12-0:08:18:**  And in his graduate program, he learned about the Savannah Institute.  And he said, you've got to come here to campus and see what they're doing.  You would love to implement some of this on your farm.  
**0:08:26-0:08:27:**  So we did.  We visited there on the Champaign-Urbana campus of the University of Illinois and came home  and started talking about what we might implement on our farm.  
**0:08:39-0:08:48:**  Now that decision involved taking some land out of corn soybean rotation and out of the  rent the farmer was paying, which was an economic decision we had to face.  And then the decision of the cost of implementing what we were doing.  
**0:09:01-0:09:11:**  Prior to the focus on agroforestry, Dimitri, our focus was on perennial woody polyculture,  having plants growing that would produce food for human consumption that did not have to  be planted every year and would hopefully contribute to the environment and the ecological  
**0:09:24-0:09:36:**  diversity directly contrasted to corn and soybeans, which are very productive food operations,  but ecologically, practically one species deserts.  So we wanted to begin to bridge that divide.  
**0:09:48-0:09:56:**  And that's what we did with the 17 acres we took away from traditional and implemented  the projects that are going now.  Okay.  
**0:10:01-0:10:05:**  You mentioned that initially there was an interest in perennial polycultures.  Did that happen at the same time as your discovery of Savannah Institute and agroforestry practices,  et cetera?  
**0:10:13-0:10:14:**  Was that happening before?  No, they happened simultaneously.  We were interested in something that would improve the land overall.  
**0:10:24-0:10:30:**  And so we didn't want to, we weren't opposed to corn and soybean traditional rotation,  but obviously there's a risk to relying on just one or two crops completely and forever.  So our minds were open to it.  
**0:10:39-0:10:46:**  But at that time, the Savannah Institute was promoting perennial woody polyculture.  And so we jumped in on that in about 2015.  And that's still what we have, although it has, the terminology has evolved into agroforestry  
**0:10:59-0:11:05:**  kind of encompassing the term agroforestry encompassing a lot of what we've got with  perennial edible plants that produce edible fruits and nuts as well as trees in cropland.  Okay.  
**0:11:13-0:11:18:**  So we'll have to break this down a bit to have a clear idea.  So maybe you could define for us what is a perennial woody polyculture, and then we'll  describe that a bit.  
**0:11:26-0:11:31:**  And then we'll head into the more agroforestry side that seems to have also evolved with  it, which is all very interesting.  But of course, for us, the perennial woody polyculture is definitely a practice we're  
**0:11:37-0:11:39:**  very interested in, right?  It's something that we're about working with perennial crops and integrating them together.  So tell me a bit, what does it mean for you?  
**0:11:47-0:11:50:**  And what does it look like in the field?  It looks like strips of planted perennial food producing species like in our climate,  rhubarb and asparagus and currants and various berries.  
**0:12:07-0:12:12:**  And apple trees and hazelnuts.  Those are planted in rows spaced yards and yards apart with alleys of alfalfa growing  in between those rows.  
**0:12:24-0:12:31:**  So the alfalfa can be harvested and the farmer does and baled up and fed to his cattle during  the winter and our rows of these food crops are in narrow rows separated by 30 or more  feet.  
**0:12:45-0:12:48:**  And the rows follow the contour of the land.  So they're not straight rows.  They follow the contour of the land so that they hold moisture and also retain the soil  
**0:12:57-0:13:04:**  productivity that way and also in a way that the farmer can move his machinery through  to harvest the alfalfa that is his crop.  So it's kind of sharing what we wanted planted with what a farm operator can still plant  
**0:13:13-0:13:14:**  and harvest.  Wow, that's fascinating.  So just to visually make sure I understand it correctly, you've got a strip of a woody  
**0:13:24-0:13:32:**  polyculture full of food, berries, nuts and fruit, etc. about 30 yards long.  And you've got multiple of these separated by a few hundred yards within between alfalfa,  something like this, right?  
**0:13:39-0:13:41:**  That's very true, Dimitri.  If I can find a map and pull it up, I'll show you while we're talking about this.  But you've got the idea.  
**0:13:47-0:13:48:**  That's exactly how it looks.  And we also have trees in a windbreak kind of going around this property.  Yeah.  
**0:13:55-0:13:56:**  OK.  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.  And so it's very dense there.  
**0:14:00-0:14:06:**  I mean, all the inside this polyculture, things are quite close together, right?  The plants are quite dense.  In the single rows, yes, they're as close together as was recommended.  
**0:14:12-0:14:18:**  So a current bush might be two feet, a foot apart, right?  A foot or two feet apart going down the row, making the row.  And the berry bushes would be as close together as they need to be because they're going to  
**0:14:28-0:14:30:**  branch, right?  But they're in a row going along the contour of the land.  And then around the outside is more trees that are deciduous trees as well as evergreen  
**0:14:42-0:14:46:**  trees that produce a windbreak.  And some really fast growing poplar trees that are both windbreaks and raptor roosts.  So we had also in mind, along with the food production, a return to nature kind of because  
**0:15:01-0:15:03:**  we weren't going to put herbicides on.  We weren't going to put pesticides on and sort of to see how the land would regenerate  itself with all sorts of pollinators and birds and mammals and even other woodland creatures.  
**0:15:22-0:15:30:**  We're just curious to see how quickly nature would return to its natural state if we stopped  all the herbicides and stopped the single culture crop.  That's very interesting.  
**0:15:38-0:15:41:**  And I mean, you planted this six years ago, right?  That's when you, so you planted the whole field in one year.  Yes.  
**0:15:46-0:15:49:**  Wow, that's a lot of work.  17 acres of a polyculture is a lot of work.  It took a couple of days with a crew of about 10 people and, you know, a tractor and a planting  
**0:16:02-0:16:09:**  device that allowed these small seedlings to be plopped in the ground as the machine  rolled along.  That's very efficient to do it in a few days.  
**0:16:13-0:16:14:**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very nice.  
**0:16:16-0:16:22:**  And so, nowadays, how tall are the trees?  Well, the fast growing poplars are 35 or more feet tall.  You know, they grow many feet per year.  
**0:16:32-0:16:38:**  The hazelnuts are six feet tall and that's about where the, you know, two meters high.  That's probably where they'll stay.  And the berry bushes, they stay about waist high.  
**0:16:46-0:16:50:**  The apple trees are growing.  They're about two meters tall now.  And the hickory trees and the chestnut trees are about three meters high.  
**0:17:01-0:17:03:**  It took a long time to get established.  What a crazy amount of diversity.  I mean, I've seen the map before, so I've got a bit of an idea of how it's all laid  
**0:17:11-0:17:12:**  out.  Listeners haven't yet.  I'll probably try and share it with them.  
**0:17:14-0:17:18:**  But I mean, you mentioned that there was a big incentive with conservation.  Have you started seeing some results?  Because I can just imagine this landscape of you being in a place with just soy and  
**0:17:23-0:17:27:**  corn around, not much woody cover.  And then you've got a bit of an oasis that you've created.  Is that, am I seeing it in the wrong way?  
**0:17:33-0:17:40:**  You're not seeing it wrong, but the oasis is not quite the island unique that it could  be if we were in other areas where there's nothing but corn and soybeans for miles and  miles.  
**0:17:46-0:17:52:**  Soybeans are the predominant crops, but we're fortunate that the area we're in has some  woodlands and some rivers.  The whole area itself is fairly diverse.  
**0:18:00-0:18:01:**  Okay.  The corn that we planted this area on, you're right.  And I can tell you that the very first year that it wasn't corn and soybeans, butterflies  
**0:18:11-0:18:14:**  and insects returned.  Right away.  Wow.  
**0:18:16-0:18:19:**  Like the magic of a Walt Disney movie.  It was quick and praying mantis came in, which only feed on other insects.  And it's been pretty remarkable.  
**0:18:30-0:18:37:**  And even a diversity of birds, birds and we put up a couple of cameras and can capture  what comes across, right?  So little ground mammals like chipmunks and squirrels and that sort of stuff.  
**0:18:45-0:18:48:**  And then those that feed on them.  That's amazing.  So I wanted to maybe just zoom back a bit and understand what were your key motivations  
**0:18:53-0:18:55:**  and objectives with this plantation.  You mentioned conservation, of course.  What were the other ones that were your, what were your key objectives?  
**0:19:01-0:19:08:**  Well, in one sense, we planted a lot of different varieties and different species in order to  see what would grow best on the soil that we had.  So part of it was simple.  
**0:19:15-0:19:21:**  We weren't trying to get food necessarily, but we were interested in agricultural research.  We were familiar and associated very vaguely with the University of Illinois.  And we talked to several students there through their agricultural department and or college.  
**0:19:36-0:19:41:**  And if they wanted to run an experiment, we'd let them do that.  But some people did want to do experiments on how many insects do come back or what type  of fertilizer works best.  
**0:19:48-0:19:57:**  And can you use chicken fertilizer or no fertilizer, you know, and just on the plants that we had  there.  So there was the research aspect of it.  
**0:20:02-0:20:05:**  And we also have a strong educational interest.  You know, we'd like to share, like we're doing here, talking to you, we'd like to share with  people what they can do on land and how they can produce and grow a variety of plants and  
**0:20:20-0:20:27:**  species that are food producing that aren't as risky as a single crop.  Just aren't as risky over time as one single crop like all corn or all soybeans.  So in that sense, we were also interested in demonstrating to others what we were doing  
**0:20:39-0:20:42:**  so they could make some choices on their own properties.  Hmm.  Now, that's really interesting.  
**0:20:45-0:20:48:**  Our primary motivation was conservation.  OK.  And what about production in terms of having a crop that could also generate an income  
**0:20:56-0:20:57:**  for you?  Because, I mean, 17 acres with the type of system that you've described at maturity could  be quite valuable.  
**0:21:03-0:21:05:**  Yes, it could.  And we were happily surprised that we started getting raspberries the very first season.  And subsequent to that, the currents are more productive every year.  
**0:21:17-0:21:22:**  The blackberries are astoundingly productive.  After the third year, when we could start harvesting asparagus, we're getting all the  asparagus we can handle.  
**0:21:29-0:21:34:**  So it's growingly productive.  And we are able to sell what we grow, but it isn't financially profitable.  Hmm.  
**0:21:43-0:21:50:**  This project that we started, making money on it was never the goal.  It was a big investment to do all the plantings.  Hmm.  
**0:21:54-0:21:58:**  And that investment just grew for the first three years, right?  With no return because there was nothing much to harvest.  Yeah.  
**0:22:01-0:22:10:**  So we have harvested, like Scott said, increasing amounts of fruits and nuts, but still, it's  limited.  We sell those directly to chefs and cooks and restaurants in Northern Illinois and in  
**0:22:18-0:22:28:**  the Chicagoland area, but not enough of it to show any return, any return much on what  we invested.  So we sort of said to ourselves, well, what we invested has to be a sunk cost.  
**0:22:33-0:22:35:**  That's just going into the land.  That's just going into the land.  We'll take it out of our pockets.  
**0:22:39-0:22:47:**  We'll put it in these plants because our interest is conservation and a little bit of research  and education.  So we're not going to be making money at this.  
**0:22:52-0:22:53:**  Yeah.  Interesting.  So even in, let's say, in 10 years time when the system has reached a maturity of full  
**0:23:01-0:23:08:**  productiveness, even at that point, you're not expecting it to generate the revenue that  is enough to start paying back for that investment.  I mean, if you look at the cash flow throughout the lifetime of this system, which is going  
**0:23:15-0:23:19:**  to last many years.  Realistically, we would never sell enough berries and nuts to recover the initial cost  of the investment we made, let alone the cost of the land if you were talking about purchasing  
**0:23:33-0:23:35:**  that.  It's viable.  We do produce and we do sell.  
**0:23:41-0:23:45:**  Far more rewarding though has been the response from people when they see what we're able  to grow and share with them.  The popularity currently of farm to table produce has been very appealing to people.  
**0:23:56-0:24:04:**  So friends of ours from the city and the suburbs are very intrigued and fascinated by what  we're doing.  And so we're expanding their knowledge of the natural world and otherwise what they  
**0:24:11-0:24:15:**  just see on their grocery store shelves.  But we didn't do it to ultimately make a net profit.  Yeah, yeah.  
**0:24:23-0:24:24:**  And it makes sense.  And we're educating their children as well, right?  So we encourage families to come and come with your kids and pick berries, right?  
**0:24:32-0:24:39:**  Or pick some pumpkins or pick some gourds or pick hazelnuts and take it home and shuck  them yourself and see what it's like to eat a nut that you picked and now you know where  it comes from.  
**0:24:46-0:24:50:**  Because children don't learn that in school anymore.  And they don't know where the food that's in the grocery store comes from.  So it's fun for the parents and it's educational for both the parents and the kids to really  
**0:25:01-0:25:07:**  be able to be out there and do some picking.  That's very interesting.  And I can imagine also that this kind of, we've got a similar system here and maybe  
**0:25:15-0:25:23:**  a bit more simplified in Greece where we've got a polyculture on 10 acres, but in one  block in the sense it's just, we don't have intercropping with alfalfa or anything.  And visually it looks very different to what you're used to on agricultural terms.  
**0:25:36-0:25:43:**  And it's quite, people they get quite touched by it because it looks very, it looks like  there's a small forest that's emerging, but it's actually producing food.  If people are fascinated by producing food and just seeing it and picking a berry and  
**0:25:56-0:26:01:**  putting it in their mouths, that's a very different experience and a wonderful experience  for people today, both adults and children.  What are you growing on your 10 acres there in Greece, Dimitri?  
**0:26:11-0:26:19:**  It's we're growing figs, pomegranates, pistachios, almonds, and prickly pears.  So California type crops, Mediterranean crops.  Good for you.  
**0:26:26-0:26:27:**  Those wouldn't work where we are.  Yeah, sure it wouldn't.  So that's interesting.  
**0:26:35-0:26:40:**  What we've tried to make it, what we're aiming to see at our place is how much diversity  can we integrate?  You know, how can, so we've got, for example, a line of fig trees and then a line of pomegranates  
**0:26:46-0:26:47:**  and a line of fig trees.  So it's a bit more simplified, but we're trying to see how diverse can we go whilst being  profitable.  
**0:26:54-0:26:58:**  We started four years ago, so it's a bit young, the project.  How long does it take a fig tree before you'll actually reap some figs?  So the first figs will arrive at the second or third year.  
**0:27:07-0:27:11:**  Maybe even the second year can start if it has good growth.  But the first commercial crop, a significant commercial crop for a fast growing tree should  be around four or five years.  
**0:27:18-0:27:22:**  In a sense, it's quickly, it starts producing.  Pistachios would take for the first solid commercial crop can take seven, eight, nine  years.  
**0:27:27-0:27:28:**  Okay.  Figs would be more around four, five.  And I'm sure it's a, it's a, well, it's an issue in your case.  
**0:27:38-0:27:45:**  If you jumbled everything together and planted everything in the same row, harvesting would  become very inefficient.  Yeah.  
**0:27:47-0:27:48:**  Right.  You can track the diversity in, but it would be hard to get at stuff.  Exactly.  
**0:27:54-0:27:58:**  And is that, I mean, if you were to think about your system and then a farmer came to  see you and they were like, wow, this is just fantastic.  The list looks amazing, but I want to make a bit of money with this.  
**0:28:05-0:28:07:**  Would you, how would you change your system?  How would you adapt it to that farmer?  Would you, would you simplify things?  
**0:28:13-0:28:21:**  I would suggest that he integrate trees or perennial crops into rows within his existing  fields and harvested traditionally around those and, and learned about variety of crops  in between, through trial and error, or maybe seeing what we're doing or what appealed to  
**0:28:42-0:28:43:**  him personally.  You know, if he wants to grow raspberries, he should plant raspberries.  We can help now with what we've got to help people understand what grows.  
**0:28:55-0:29:00:**  You know, for instance, we had red raspberries and yellow raspberries and black raspberries  and they grew the first two or three years, but then they, but then they all died back.  They just all died back and we don't have those anymore to a great extent.  
**0:29:12-0:29:16:**  And that's just part of our climate, part of the soil where we are.  So you know, we could, we could easily tell a farmer, take these, these species, grow  this, but grow, grow that one thing then more abundantly and you will have, you could make  
**0:29:30-0:29:32:**  more off of your land.  You know, we planted, remember we planted our rows sort of 40 or 50 feet apart so that  a farm operator could also plant his rows of alfalfa and go through there with a machine  
**0:29:44-0:29:47:**  and harvest that, right?  Mow it down and bale it up.  Well, if we weren't with a farm operator and it was someone else and they wanted to plant  
**0:29:53-0:29:59:**  rows of, let's say, blackberries, they could plant them much closer together.  You could get more of the, of the fruit producing plants on this land than the way we've planted  it, right?  
**0:30:07-0:30:08:**  Of course.  Yeah.  That's interesting.  
**0:30:10-0:30:11:**  And then they'd make more money.  They could make money sooner and more money.  And you're harvesting everything by hand.  
**0:30:19-0:30:21:**  Yes, that's right.  There are things like blackberries and black raspberries and, and Juneberries.  They can't be harvested any other way.  
**0:30:30-0:30:35:**  And you know, it's plucking them one at a time and, uh,  Currents.  It's, it's, they may have ways of harvesting currents in Europe.  
**0:30:41-0:30:42:**  Yeah.  I was on a farm recently where we had these crops as well.  Then it was, uh, it was all by hand.  
**0:30:46-0:30:48:**  Took a while.  And it's good that it takes a good price on the market though.  You sell them well, but it's, uh,  
**0:30:56-0:31:01:**  Another option is to have, is to have the public come in and pick their own berries.  We haven't, we haven't looked into that yet.  We're not particularly interested in having people traipse around, but I can see that  
**0:31:09-0:31:15:**  they would want to, there would be, you could open your property up to people coming in  and picking their own berries.  And nuts and people like chestnuts or they like hazelnuts.  
**0:31:22-0:31:26:**  You know, you could have times of the year when, when they're ripe and let the public  come in and pick what they want in bags or sacks and, and sell it by the, by pounds.  Right.  
**0:31:33-0:31:34:**  Or by bushel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**0:31:36-0:31:42:**  I saw a farmer on the podcast that was doing this, um, um, from Redfern farm and they're  doing this pick.  We have visited their farm.  
**0:31:44-0:31:45:**  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Yeah.  
**0:31:47-0:31:53:**  They, they, they did a great job discovering that people would come in and pick their chestnuts  and they didn't have to pick them and bag them and try to sell them.  That was a great transformation for them.  
**0:32:01-0:32:02:**  Yeah.  Hmm.  And it's, it's like a dream really.  
**0:32:04-0:32:06:**  You get, you don't have to worry about harvesting.  Somebody comes to do it for you and pays you for it as well.  It's a, it's quite the ideal situation.  
**0:32:12-0:32:13:**  That's right.  And they had mature chestnut trees, which we don't have yet.  Okay.  
**0:32:19-0:32:20:**  Nice.  And this could be an opportunity for you in the future as well.  That's correct.  
**0:32:23-0:32:24:**  Yep.  Very nice.  And so I'm, I'm curious, how, how did you fund this project?  
**0:32:29-0:32:34:**  Did you fund it yourself or did you get a fund from, from an external fund to do so?  We paid for it ourselves.  Okay.  
**0:32:38-0:32:39:**  Nice.  Fortunately we could, and we want, we were that interested in doing something that would  last on the farm beyond our lifetimes.  
**0:32:50-0:32:57:**  The perennial aspect helps assure that planting trees, which will outlive us helps assure  that.  Um, but we decided we would make this investment.  
**0:33:03-0:33:05:**  We just made that commitment.  Okay.  Very nice.  
**0:33:07-0:33:09:**  And how did you learn all the skills?  Because it's, it's not easy to, you had jobs on the side.  I understood you you'd been doing some planting and some, uh, and some carrying of trees and  
**0:33:18-0:33:23:**  vegetables, et cetera, some gardening, but how did you then, you know, start such a,  because it is quite a big scale project.  It's not small.  
**0:33:26-0:33:31:**  Um, so how, how did that, uh, how did you learn the tricks of the trade and everything?  Well, we learned the planning plan, planting plan, and got the planting done through resources  of the Savannah Institute.  
**0:33:42-0:33:50:**  But in terms of managing and pruning and mulching and when to harvest, we've, we're continuing  to learn that as time goes by, we're learning more and more.  Those things that survived, they're thriving.  
**0:33:57-0:33:59:**  They're doing very well.  And so as we refill areas that weren't as successful, we're going to work with the things  that did very well and plant more of those.  
**0:34:10-0:34:14:**  But we, we consider ourselves very, very young into this.  Yeah.  And it's all lots of fun and fascinating and, and, and interesting.  
**0:34:21-0:34:28:**  And it has, it has required the past two seasons, um, more and more of our personal time.  And at this point now we're both retired from our day jobs.  So during the harvesting season, we have had the time personally to, to be there.  
**0:34:39-0:34:40:**  Right.  Because if you're picking raspberries or blackberries, you're picking every other day, right.  To get just the right ones at the right time.  
**0:34:48-0:34:55:**  So that's, that's a lot of, uh, time and energy, which, um, which we're doing more and more  of as, as the years go by.  Um, but we won't be able to do it forever either.  
**0:35:02-0:35:06:**  That's our next, that's our next, uh, transition.  Okay.  Very nice.  
**0:35:08-0:35:11:**  So it wasn't, it doesn't seem so overwhelming for you.  You kind of just went into it and learned everything you had to learn and cracked on  with it, right?  
**0:35:17-0:35:18:**  That's correct.  And it's, it's, it is beginning to reach the point where the labor of harvest is overwhelming  to us.  
**0:35:24-0:35:25:**  Okay.  And we're, we're, we're exploring other sources for that.  What are you exploring?  
**0:35:32-0:35:33:**  I'm curious.  Well, there's a, there's a religious group, a religion, um, called the Mennonites and  the Mennonites have pockets of populations throughout the United States.  
**0:35:48-0:35:57:**  And they've, they've started to build a community, um, near and around our farm.  And we began talking to them last season about coming in and doing the, the hand harvest  themselves, which of course we have to figure out how to pay them for their labor, uh, or  
**0:36:15-0:36:18:**  charge them for the crop that they take.  And since we haven't been doing that ourselves before, we have to figure that out this winter.  Hmm.  
**0:36:24-0:36:27:**  So it could turn into a you pick system.  Yeah.  They, they, yeah, it would, it would be you pick Dimitri, they would pick and then they  
**0:36:34-0:36:41:**  could resell them, uh, for whatever price they could get.  Or they could make product out of them, right?  If they were picking berries, they could make jam or jellies or whatever they wanted or  
**0:36:49-0:36:53:**  freeze and, and sell fresh or frozen.  Right.  As a, as a, as an operation.  
**0:36:56-0:36:57:**  Yeah.  For sure.  As a food producing operation.  
**0:36:59-0:37:02:**  We haven't answered that question yet, but we're asking it.  Yeah.  We're looking into it.  
**0:37:04-0:37:05:**  Okay.  Very nice.  And, um, I was curious about how you managed to mechanize everything and in the sense I'm  
**0:37:13-0:37:19:**  talking about the management now, do you guys have a tractor to, to, to keep to weed or  to till?  How do you, how do you manage the land?  
**0:37:23-0:37:33:**  We bought a small tractor that we use mostly to, to mow the areas that aren't in alfalfa  and just, you know, the, the, the paths and all along and the borders.  So mowing takes a good bit of time and we don't harvest anything mechanically.  
**0:37:45-0:37:48:**  So that's all by hand.  And we have spread mulch with the tractor and also by hand, you know, with it along  the row mulching along in there so that it keeps the weeds down and it, you know, adds  
**0:38:00-0:38:05:**  to the root, root growth of the plants that we care about.  We purchased a used mulch spreader with another farmer that helps that process.  And we share it.  
**0:38:15-0:38:21:**  But those are the two pieces of equipment, major pieces of equipment that we have.  Yeah.  Okay.  
**0:38:23-0:38:27:**  And, and you get the mulch, I guess it's wood chips that you buy in.  That's right.  Well, I think you'll like this part of the story.  
**0:38:33-0:38:43:**  Our farmer, our, our tenant farmer also had a beef feedlot, concentrated beef feeding  from the, you know, from the calf stage just to put weight on and then sell to the, to  the processing market.  
**0:38:52-0:39:01:**  Well, he bedded those cows on wood chips and he got the wood chips from a major department  store chain across the U.S. called Menards.  And the wood chips are the wooden pallets that they move material around on that a forklift  
**0:39:12-0:39:16:**  picks up those, those grids of wood.  We call them pallets.  And when those are wearing out, they became a nuisance to Menards and Menards would grind  
**0:39:26-0:39:31:**  them up and had nothing to do with those chips.  So this farmer said, well, I could take some of those chips.  And they said to him, if you'll take all of those chips, we'll deliver them to you for  
**0:39:40-0:39:44:**  free just to get, just to get rid of the nuisance.  Okay.  So he got the free wood chips.  
**0:39:47-0:39:51:**  He put them in the barns underneath the cows.  And this is a pretty intensive operation with, you know, lots of cows just standing together,  gaining weight all day long.  
**0:39:59-0:40:00:**  Yeah.  Herds of cows eating and getting fatter every day.  But while they're eating, they're producing manure and the manure is falling into the  
**0:40:07-0:40:08:**  wood chips.  So when it's time to clean out that barn and bring in some more cows, he had this, I call  it magic manure mulch that had developed with the fertilizer ingredients in it and the natural  
**0:40:22-0:40:29:**  plant material from the wood already ground up and beautiful and handleable.  And so we bought from him several truckloads of this material.  And we still have piles of that on the farm to spread as mulch when we can.  
**0:40:41-0:40:42:**  Okay.  Without doing it scientifically, there's absolutely no question.  The crops that get the benefit of this magic manure mulch are measurably more productive  
**0:40:53-0:40:54:**  than those that don't.  Yeah.  It makes a lot of sense.  
**0:40:56-0:40:57:**  Yeah.  It's natural fertilizer.  Right.  
**0:40:59-0:41:00:**  Yeah.  It's a great opportunity to recycle something that was a nuisance and a waste product in  another operation and works perfectly for us.  
**0:41:09-0:41:11:**  That makes a lot of sense.  That's very interesting.  Okay.  
**0:41:13-0:41:14:**  Nice.  So you're spreading the mulch with the mulcher, you're pruning by hand, harvesting by hand  and you're mowing in between the rows with the tractor.  
**0:41:25-0:41:26:**  Yes.  That's right.  Very nice.  
**0:41:29-0:41:30:**  Very nice.  And so I'm curious as to some of the, let's say, as new farmers, you started six years  ago actively in this.  
**0:41:41-0:41:47:**  What were some of the top lessons that you learned with these kinds of polyculture systems?  What would you have done differently?  What would you have changed in the design and the management?  
**0:41:52-0:41:57:**  What did you learn that you could tell others that want to implement similar systems?  The design was terrific.  We spent a lot of time with the Savannah Institute developing the design and what we wanted to  
**0:42:06-0:42:07:**  plant and where.  And that has worked out very, very well.  It was surprising to us to learn that some of those things did not thrive.  
**0:42:18-0:42:23:**  And so while we're busier and busier with the productive plants, some of the things  that we thought would do well have not.  And we wouldn't have known that if we hadn't planted it and tried it.  
**0:42:30-0:42:35:**  So I wouldn't call that a flaw, but I'd call it a lesson learned.  The first thing I would do different if I was starting this over, the first year we  didn't have corn and soybeans, we planted these alleys and these rows of crops.  
**0:42:47-0:42:53:**  We didn't do anything to kill off the weeds that were there or prevent the weeds from  coming in.  And so those invasive weeds have been a problem ever since.  
**0:42:59-0:43:05:**  Had we taken the time to destroy all of that.  We would have started with a cleaner soil base.  Instead, we still mow a lot to keep the weeds and the grasses down.  
**0:43:20-0:43:31:**  Another lesson, Dimitri, we planted hardy apple rootstock intending to graft more desirable  varieties of apples onto it when the rootstock was developed.  And the rootstock did well, but our grafting failed almost 100%.  
**0:43:44-0:43:53:**  So gradually I've been replacing those failures with bare rootstock already grafted apple  trees.  And I would strongly advise unless you're an expert grafter, and we didn't do it ourselves,  
**0:44:01-0:44:03:**  we had an expert grafter doing it with us.  I wouldn't mess with that.  I would go with the more expensive already grafted apple trees.  
**0:44:13-0:44:15:**  That was a lesson learned.  Yes, that's right.  And some of the trees that we tried, pawpaws and persimmons, did not prosper for us.  
**0:44:26-0:44:30:**  So we'll do more apples.  But we tried a lot to see what would work.  And I think anybody would have to do some of that.  
**0:44:39-0:44:44:**  And anybody who would do this, who wanted to plant fruit trees, you have to be patient.  We don't have any apple trees bearing fruit yet, right?  And we're in year six.  
**0:44:49-0:44:53:**  We don't have chestnuts bearing nuts yet, and we're in year six.  So you have to pick varieties that can yield you what you need in a timeline that's reasonable  for you.  
**0:45:02-0:45:03:**  You have to think about that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.  More time to mature and to produce.  
**0:45:08-0:45:10:**  And the variety selection is very important.  If you don't have a farm around that can demonstrate, that has gone through this process, this difficult  process of finding out what works, it's a huge extra research cost that you take on  
**0:45:25-0:45:26:**  your shoulders.  But it's also very helpful for the community around, as you mentioned.  Now there's information about what works, what doesn't.  
**0:45:33-0:45:37:**  And have you managed to work out why they don't work, the persimmons?  And you mentioned the pawpaws?  The only thing we can guess, rhubarb grows all over the Midwest.  
**0:45:47-0:45:52:**  I don't think it was originally native, but every old farm that has rhubarb, it's got  rhubarb forever.  It just keeps on thriving.  
**0:45:59-0:46:00:**  And our rhubarb didn't.  It never prospered.  It never grew well.  
**0:46:04-0:46:10:**  We think probably the soil there is just too dense, too heavy for it.  So we're going to try rhubarb again this spring, but in a different location.  Because once it's established, that's one of those perennial crops, it should last forever.  
**0:46:24-0:46:28:**  It seems to be a soil type differential, right?  It seems that our raspberries failed because they lost in competition to the weeds we didn't  get rid of before we planted, like I mentioned before.  
**0:46:37-0:46:41:**  But the blackberries didn't have that problem at all.  They're just fuller and thicker and more abundant every year.  So we're going to plant some more blackberries.  
**0:46:48-0:46:50:**  And adapt along the way.  Yeah, that's right.  And we're also going to change, we're going to try something we haven't tried before,  
**0:46:57-0:47:03:**  which is ornamental dogwood shrubs.  The twigs of which are colored bright red or bright yellow or orange.  And these can be harvested and sold to garden centers and decorative.  
**0:47:15-0:47:19:**  The twigs of those bushes grow up kind of like hands, right?  Like fingers.  And you can just cut them off into bunches.  
**0:47:26-0:47:29:**  And you can sell that to landscapers.  Nice.  Very interesting.  
**0:47:34-0:47:41:**  Any other big mistakes, things you would do differently, things you'd like to share?  Still curious to hear.  Well, I will just say that it helped us, it did help us a lot to have the Savannah Institute  
**0:47:50-0:47:56:**  or an organization nearby that had not only some information themselves, but they were  also a collective of other farmers, right?  That we could meet with or we could talk to or we could share with, you know, what we  
**0:48:04-0:48:05:**  were doing.  Like Redfern Farm and others, we would meet those people at gatherings.  And in a way also to be associated with an agricultural university.  
**0:48:17-0:48:23:**  Because it helps us to learn from those who come, even when they're doing different types  of experiments, right?  On different species or...  
**0:48:28-0:48:33:**  For instance, we planted 19 varieties of service berries, also called Juneberries.  And so one of the professors at the University of Illinois wanted to use that as one of her  experiments to see, you know, over time which ones grow the best and which ones don't.  
**0:48:44-0:48:48:**  And you can walk those rows and you can see now they're tall enough, you can see which  ones are bearing the most fruit and which varieties are not out of the 19.  So she's getting, she can have year after year after year longitudinal research there  
**0:49:01-0:49:04:**  based on the soil types that we have.  So that was a good thing.  It's been a good thing to be associated with an agricultural college.  
**0:49:13-0:49:16:**  The support of the Savannah Institute seems vital, huh?  And also going about the design and setting up this project from the start.  That's absolutely true.  
**0:49:24-0:49:32:**  Now going forward, the Savannah Institute's focus has been more in agroforestry, incorporating  trees into existing agricultural practices.  We are working with them on some research and demonstration projects, planting trees  
**0:49:42-0:49:48:**  in islands within the pasture or along the edges of the pasture.  And there we're very actively cooperating as partners where they've planted these trees  and are managing the process of watching this and comparing these various types and systems  
**0:50:06-0:50:14:**  and different types of protective tree tubes to see which ones are most effective and whether  different sizes of islands, whether trees planted as just sticks that should form their  own roots or already rooted seedlings is more productive.  
**0:50:27-0:50:33:**  You would guess that the rooted ones are, and they are, the non-root ones are cheaper,  but not as many of them make it.  We had a significant drought here this summer after many of these trees had been planted.  
**0:50:44-0:50:47:**  So they had a really rough year to get started.  You can't control the weather.  When we're all done here, hopefully we will have contributed to a more weather resistant  
**0:50:59-0:51:08:**  system and even on a micro scale to a more moderate system of weather with trees and  different things.  But the actual agroforestry projects, they're very new.  
**0:51:15-0:51:19:**  They just started in 2019.  So we're still assessing and measuring.  But with the Savannah Institute, we've hosted visit days for the public and interested neighbors  
**0:51:30-0:51:36:**  and farmers to come and walk through and learn about what we're doing here.  We don't have the answers yet.  We really don't have the answers to anything.  
**0:51:40-0:51:44:**  It's still very much a learning curve for us.  And it's been fun to have the chance to learn it.  But I will say, add to that, that other local farmers have come and have toured our property  
**0:51:53-0:51:58:**  and have then gone home and decided to do something different with their properties.  So whether it's adding a different type of crop, like a perennial crop or agroforestry  or building silvo pastures, trees added to pasture areas or planting along a stream bed,  
**0:52:14-0:52:19:**  because we've also done that, planting along a stream bed to hold the soil and prevent  soil erosion.  And so these farmers come and see that.  
**0:52:24-0:52:31:**  And then we know of at least two of them who came just this past summer and are now considering  doing some protective conservative agroforestry projects on their own properties.  That's fascinating.  
**0:52:40-0:52:43:**  That's really nice to be able to have that influence.  It's able to showcase.  And that's part of your objectives at the start, as you had mentioned.  
**0:52:50-0:52:51:**  That's exactly right.  I'm curious about the agroforestry because we talked a lot about your older system, your  polyculture.  
**0:52:58-0:53:00:**  And now from what I understand, you've got some younger systems.  So when you mentioned agroforestry around the pasture, could you explain to us a bit  more precisely, what does that mean?  
**0:53:09-0:53:12:**  What does it look like?  There are trees planted around the perimeter of one major pasture.  How big is the paddock?  
**0:53:18-0:53:20:**  It's been a pasture for a long time.  So trees all along the border, just outside the fence, planted in tubes.  So there's a row as far as you can see of tubes with the green leaves just beginning  
**0:53:33-0:53:35:**  to peek out of the top.  And then islands within the pasture, where small groups of trees to larger groups of  trees have been planted and fenced in to keep the cows out of them.  
**0:53:51-0:53:54:**  And the weeds in there have been killed.  And the trees each have a mat around them, a weed mat to help retain moisture and help  the young seedling get started.  
**0:54:03-0:54:12:**  So right now those look like pens of empty earth with tubes sticking out of them at various  places around in the middle of the pasture.  But when the trees have grown and the fence can be removed, these will provide shade for  
**0:54:21-0:54:23:**  the cattle.  And we know that cows prefer that if they can get some shape.  Where there are existing trees in the pasture, that's where you see the cows during the  
**0:54:33-0:54:36:**  summertime resting in the shade of those trees.  So instead of just having a big old empty grassland of pasture, we will eventually have  a beautiful grassland of pasture with islands of different kinds of trees within it, which  
**0:54:48-0:54:53:**  will be scenic to look at and beneficial to the cows.  And we'll be having varieties of trees that are always good.  Trees are always good.  
**0:54:59-0:55:03:**  I would say to anybody who's interested, plant trees.  I'm curious, what trees then?  For sure, but what trees have you decided to plant there in this pasture?  
**0:55:12-0:55:15:**  Again, fruit and nut trees or have you opted for?  No, it's native trees, a variety of trees planted in a different mosaic to see whether  they do better as single species within an island or a diverse group of species within  
**0:55:31-0:55:38:**  an island and which of those species do best planted out in the middle of a pasture.  They're deciduous hardwood.  Deciduous hardwood trees, yes.  
**0:55:42-0:55:51:**  Oak, maple, the trees that we have here, locust, willow, different trees.  Very interesting.  And that's in collaboration with the farmer that's got the cows, the tenors.  
**0:55:57-0:56:06:**  Yes, the farmer had to give up some pasture in order to plant these islands.  That was something we had to work out because when you look on a map, it looks like, oh  my gosh, all those islands, there isn't any grass left for the cows to eat.  
**0:56:16-0:56:20:**  It's very important for him to have pasture for the cows to eat.  But actually in measurement, it wasn't as significant an amount of acreage as it looks  like.  
**0:56:27-0:56:34:**  And, you know, we had to reduce our pasture rent for those islands that his cows couldn't  graze any longer.  And we're looking for nearby pasture to make available to him so that he hasn't lost what  
**0:56:46-0:56:48:**  he had before.  For every acre of pasture that he can't have, he loses a cow or two that he can have.  So that's his interest.  
**0:56:57-0:57:02:**  So we couldn't do that as extensively as we might have wanted, but we did it nonetheless  in a practical, realistic situation.  And we'll see how that works.  
**0:57:08-0:57:11:**  I think we took like a 30 acre pasture.  And with all the tree plantings that were fenced, that added up to about five acres.  So out of a 30 acre pasture, five acres came out for us to plant trees and to start this.  
**0:57:25-0:57:31:**  So he had to end his, I think he said with his current beef, he has a cow calf operation  that taking out five acres means five cows have to go.  So the grass can support five fewer cows.  
**0:57:40-0:57:45:**  So that's his cost to this.  And he makes that up because he doesn't pay for the five acres in rent to us.  So that's just how the economics and the production goes with that.  
**0:57:57-0:58:02:**  I'm curious about how does he feel about all of this tree planting?  And he or she, I don't know who makes the decisions there.  We have three generations, as we mentioned, and the youngest member seems rather agreeable  
**0:58:16-0:58:18:**  to all of this.  Almost intrigued.  The middle generation was not too keen on losing any pasture at all.  
**0:58:26-0:58:33:**  So we modified our plan, made it more palatable for him.  And I think we're in good shape there, but it remains to be seen when those trees are  large enough that the cows can start getting shade from them, which he'll like, we'll all  
**0:58:49-0:58:50:**  like.  But this is part of the planning.  And other things we accommodate them on as well.  
**0:58:57-0:58:58:**  And that's the give and take.  For instance, he wanted to take another piece of property and fence it in and it was just  open property.  
**0:59:05-0:59:10:**  And he wanted to create a field for a pasture field.  And we said, well, that's OK then.  That was sort of the give and take.  
**0:59:13-0:59:18:**  We have other pasture land and if they want to put a little pathway through there for  their vehicles, we said, OK, you can put a pathway through there.  So there's different things that you give and take on related, but not specifically  
**0:59:29-0:59:34:**  on that one pasture where we're doing the silvo tree planting.  OK.  Very nice.  
**0:59:36-0:59:43:**  And so are there any other systems that you're hiding from me, agroforestry plantations,  that you'd like to share with us?  Because we talked about the polyculture, we talked about the silvo pasture plantings.  
**0:59:52-0:59:53:**  What about the row crops?  Have you managed to convince your tenant to...  No, we haven't done that.  
**0:59:59-1:00:01:**  We have not done that.  That's a long term prospect.  Our farm tenant would like to have more acres to plant and psychologically taking any of  
**1:00:14-1:00:23:**  it away from him to try out rows of trees within the field is not something we're all  prepared to address just yet.  If we can locate some other acres for him to rent and plant on, then we could move ahead  
**1:00:33-1:00:38:**  with planting some rows of trees within the existing fields.  But we've held off on that just because we want to maintain a terrific relationship with  him.  
**1:00:46-1:00:47:**  That's a priority.  That is definitely the priority.  Because we could move a lot faster on planting every sort of agroforestry project conceivable  
**1:00:56-1:00:58:**  to man.  But the practical issue is the farmer still has to make a living off of what is there.  And we have to get along, all of us.  
**1:01:08-1:01:11:**  So the human factor is important too.  Yes, it seems very important.  We haven't mentioned it much, Dimitri, but we also did plant, as Sandy referenced, a  
**1:01:21-1:01:28:**  riparian buffer zone, which is some of the acres that came out of the pasture.  So we could protect a little creek that flows through there and demonstrate it to people.  When those plants have all established themselves, well then the cows can be allowed back in.  
**1:01:41-1:01:48:**  But when these trees are just seedlings or knee high, the cows would trample them and  chew them down to the ground.  So that's another long term.  
**1:01:53-1:01:54:**  We've done that.  That's there.  Right now I mow that to keep the weeds down between the rows of trees.  
**1:02:01-1:02:06:**  But in time that'll be established with various native trees and shrubs.  And we're really just in year one of that.  So over time we've done different things.  
**1:02:15-1:02:20:**  With this long term goal of conservation, how do you conserve the soil and not have  runoff down the creek?  Well, let's do a riparian buffer.  
**1:02:25-1:02:27:**  Let's plant it wisely.  Let's plant it smartly and let's look at how muddy the creek is with field runoff two years  ago versus next year and the years going forward.  
**1:02:38-1:02:46:**  So everything works hopefully to the advantage of conservation and maintaining and managing  a really good overall ecosystem.  Makes sense.  
**1:02:51-1:02:57:**  And I'm sure that's also something that as it visually expresses itself, your tenant  farmer will also surely develop or could develop a sensitivity to seeing it work and being  like, oh, wow, look, we're not losing so much soil here.  
**1:03:07-1:03:12:**  Well and also and the grass that does grow for the cattle is better quality grass.  See because those trees sink carbon right down into the soil all the time.  And that spreads, right, so that the ultimate grass that's coming up around the trees and  
**1:03:22-1:03:27:**  the whole pasture improves the soil quality and therefore improves the grass that the  cattle can feed off of.  So that benefits him.  
**1:03:31-1:03:37:**  The other thing that has been helpful for our overall relationship with the farmer is  when we've had visitor days, open to the public visitor days, and he sees other people come  and he sees, you know, those the dad and son see other farmers come look at what's happening  
**1:03:50-1:03:51:**  here.  And I think over time that sort of changed their minds a little bit.  You know, they could have thought we were nuts in the beginning, you know, six years  
**1:03:59-1:04:00:**  ago.  And well, Scott and Sandy Williams want to go do this, I guess, you know, they're the  owners, I guess we got to let them do it.  
**1:04:07-1:04:15:**  And we really don't, you know, and there could be lots of comments and opinions in the community.  But I think over time, as our farmers see visitors come and do some of these experiments,  and they see us out there all the time harvesting, right?  
**1:04:27-1:04:30:**  And then they see the public come visit.  And they really see the public come visit, right?  And walk these places and walk these roads.  
**1:04:36-1:04:42:**  And they realize that there is there isn't a community interest in in doing things a  little bit differently.  And I think that's helped.  
**1:04:45-1:04:53:**  They're becoming people ask them questions now, you know, in the local in the in town,  what's going on and they and they can, our farm operators can explain what's going on.  Hmm.  
**1:04:59-1:05:03:**  And there's a whole social adventure happening here as well.  Yeah, that's, that's kind of true.  And I would stress again, we were very, very lucky because our farm family was never opposed  
**1:05:12-1:05:13:**  to this.  They might not have been as excited about it as we were.  But there was never opposition.  
**1:05:18-1:05:25:**  And we started with them from the very beginning, selecting which 17 acres to take out of their  production and establish the perennial woody polyculture area on.  That was in advice, you know, in cooperation with with them.  
**1:05:36-1:05:42:**  I think they have been intrigued as we have to see how it is all working out.  But from the beginning, it's been a grand experiment.  And we're, I would stress over and over, we're very fortunate.  
**1:05:50-1:05:55:**  We were never, they were never opposing any of this.  It was always cooperative from the very beginning.  And I think as Sandy says, we've all enjoyed seeing the response from other people.  
**1:06:03-1:06:05:**  Hmm.  That's very, very interesting.  And the inspiration that it's creating as well.  
**1:06:11-1:06:15:**  And I'm curious what feedback other farmers that are coming to visit you are giving.  Well, all we know is that two of the farmers who visited on the public days, they're doing  something actively now with the Savannah Institute to do some agroforestry on their properties.  
**1:06:30-1:06:34:**  So we don't know what exactly they're going to do.  And you don't just drive in and say, hey, what are you doing here?  But that's as positive a feedback as there could possibly be.  
**1:06:41-1:06:42:**  Yeah.  Yeah, that's terrific.  Indeed.  
**1:06:45-1:06:49:**  And do you know which kind of systems they're implementing?  No, we don't know.  We only recently learned that the two of them are doing projects on their own property now.  
**1:06:56-1:06:57:**  So.  Hmm.  Okay.  
**1:06:59-1:07:03:**  And I'm curious, what about the, sorry, Sandy, I cut you there.  No, you didn't cut us off.  We cut you off.  
**1:07:07-1:07:16:**  We're also adding in this perennial woody polyculture area, a couple of plots of prairie  pollinator, grassland habitat.  There are in one place where it's pretty rocky and the things we had planted there weren't  
**1:07:28-1:07:30:**  doing so well.  We're going to let the native vegetation take that over.  And that's going to get planted in the spring.  
**1:07:36-1:07:45:**  But that isn't exactly agroforestry, but it's contributing again to the ecological diversity  there.  And we may plant within that grassland a few trees here and there to establish a savannah,  
**1:07:56-1:08:00:**  which is what the Savannah Institute is named after.  A savannah is basically a prairie with some trees.  So we'll be doing that as well.  
**1:08:06-1:08:10:**  But no, Dimitri, we're not keeping any secrets from you.  There's nothing we can admit intentionally.  I'm just too nosy.  
**1:08:16-1:08:17:**  It's OK.  We're all here to learn together.  This has been fun for us to implement and learn from mostly because we're learning.  
**1:08:28-1:08:29:**  We don't have the answers.  Like I said, we're engaged in the questioning process, but we're actually trying it.  We're planting things and getting our fingers dirty and learning.  
**1:08:41-1:08:45:**  If I can allow myself to say, you're learning on quite a big scale.  It's not small to plant 17 acres and surely probably thousands or tens of thousands of  different trees and shrubs and etc.  
**1:08:53-1:09:00:**  So it's really admirable to be wanting to learn and get your hands dirty on such a scale.  And so that so many people can learn from this.  And I really admire that.  
**1:09:04-1:09:11:**  It's quite possible that had we known in advance how large a scale it was, we might have done  a little less initially.  It's a very good thing that we're both retired now from our other jobs because if we weren't,  
**1:09:23-1:09:25:**  nothing would be getting picked.  So yeah, that's also true.  Come out and pick sometime, Dimitri.  
**1:09:29-1:09:30:**  Yeah.  Well, you know, listen, if I am ever in the United States and I really would like to go  soon because we're interviewing so many farmers there.  
**1:09:38-1:09:42:**  Maybe more than half of our listener base comes from the United States.  Okay.  Or just about half.  
**1:09:44-1:09:45:**  Plan a trip.  Plan a visit.  Yeah, for sure.  
**1:09:47-1:09:48:**  I appreciate that.  And I wanted to ask you one last question.  What about other landowners?  
**1:09:54-1:09:59:**  I mean, you're in a unique position as landowners that have this conservation objective in mind  and they're ready to make a compromise on the income that you're generating in order  for, you know, on the amount of rent that you're taking off of the land in order to  
**1:10:09-1:10:11:**  satisfy conservation objectives.  So you've developed an amazing sensitivity here and an amazing objective.  What about other landowners maybe that you know of that are your friends?  
**1:10:20-1:10:21:**  What do they think of your work?  Do they, are they inspired by it or do they just try to ignore it and not look too much?  Oh, they don't ignore it, Dimitri.  
**1:10:28-1:10:34:**  I would say without exaggerating that they are inspired by it.  Maybe not to the point of doing it themselves, but this sort of, this sort of mindset is  growing like crazy.  
**1:10:43-1:10:51:**  I imagine worldwide, but certainly in this country and everybody's intrigued by anything  that has echo in front of it or green in front of it, you know, or climate mediation in front  of it.  
**1:11:00-1:11:05:**  And so their, their eyes are open, but they don't understand what any of it means.  So when they can come and see what we've got or talk to us about what we're doing, well,  they think we're, they think we're grand and noble pioneers.  
**1:11:13-1:11:17:**  They think we're pioneers in environmental safety.  They think it's exciting.  Resuscitation and all that stuff.  
**1:11:21-1:11:22:**  Wow.  Well, you are kind of pioneers.  I mean, you may not think of yourselves as that, but not many people are doing what you're  
**1:11:27-1:11:31:**  doing in your region.  Well that's true.  We're one of, yeah, that's true.  
**1:11:33-1:11:37:**  I don't know of any other farm in our state that's doing it.  That is maybe the definition of a pioneer.  That's amazing.  
**1:11:44-1:11:45:**  That's great to hear.  Yeah, I think it's fascinating for our listeners to hear this story.  And as we said at the beginning, you know, you mentioned, you know, we're not farmers,  
**1:11:55-1:12:00:**  we're landowners that are engaging in different projects, but this is really, this is part  of the agricultural system.  Everywhere we have landowners and farmers, young farmers, old farmers, there's a big  
**1:12:07-1:12:13:**  system there, agricultural system and being able to inspire other landowners to lead the  way like you have is going to be part of this solution to create an agriculture that can  also be regenerative or conservational towards, you know, that can conserve our ecosystems  
**1:12:26-1:12:29:**  and last in time.  So that's what they mean by sustainable, Dimitri.  That's exactly right.  
**1:12:33-1:12:34:**  And you're right.  It is a system wide and a community wide system.  Very, very, very true.  
**1:12:41-1:12:43:**  That's what we believe.  I should tell a story about the restaurant.  Oh, yeah.  
**1:12:49-1:12:55:**  We had extra, this is, this was a, we've been selling our produce to a couple of chefs and  we had so much produce this year that our chef was overwhelmed, right?  He couldn't even freeze all the blackberries.  
**1:13:02-1:13:07:**  So, so there's a local little restaurant in our town in Illinois and this lady started  a shop that just, it makes desserts and sells them with drinks, meaning a dessert might  be a chocolate mousse cake and she'd sell that with a, with a spiked coffee, right?  
**1:13:24-1:13:31:**  So coffee and Bailey's Irish cream or coffee and scotch, or she'd make a key lime pie and  sell that with margaritas.  So that's the theme for her little restaurant.  
**1:13:36-1:13:38:**  So she also has two women who own it.  They also have sandwiches and stuff.  So I just walked in there one day cause we had extra Juneberries and I said, you know,  
**1:13:45-1:13:47:**  would you, are you interested?  Would you be interested in some direct from the farm?  Well, she was, and she took those Juneberries.  
**1:13:53-1:13:59:**  And so over time she has, she has taken an awful lot of blackberries.  She's taken hazelnuts.  She's taken pumpkins and she's made pumpkin pie, pumpkin soups.  
**1:14:08-1:14:13:**  She took the Juneberries and she made them into some sort of like cobbler and she sold  that in town at a, at an open house, you know, community fair.  And people were telling her they couldn't believe how well, how good they tasted and  
**1:14:22-1:14:25:**  they couldn't come from a farm because there's no farms around here.  And she said, no, they do come from a farm.  I know the farm owner.  
**1:14:29-1:14:36:**  So she's getting marketing and positive feedback out of the fact that she's making her desserts  with our produce.  So she's made pumpkin cream pie and pumpkin soup and she's made, she's taken our hazelnuts  
**1:14:44-1:14:48:**  and infused it into her vodka.  And she told me that that was extremely popular.  So now she can serve hazelnut infused vodka in her, in her restaurant bar area, along  
**1:15:00-1:15:02:**  with any sort of dessert that she makes.  So it's, it's catching on and it's fascinated me because she took all the pumpkins we could,  we could send her and we, we bought baking pumpkins.  
**1:15:13-1:15:14:**  Right.  And so, or that's what we grew, baking pumpkins.  And she said to me one day, she said, well, I have these two chefs.  
**1:15:21-1:15:23:**  They'll do whatever we want with pumpkins.  They just love them.  And you know, to cook with from a raw pumpkin is not an easy task.  
**1:15:27-1:15:29:**  That's a lot of, a lot of chef work.  A lot of cooking and baking work goes into that, but it's been so successful for her  from a, from a marketing standpoint, right?  
**1:15:37-1:15:43:**  From just a community footprint standpoint for her that she's, she's happily taken.  She's taken frozen berries now.  Hmm.  
**1:15:46-1:15:48:**  Amazing.  That's such an inspiring story.  Yeah.  
**1:15:50-1:15:53:**  You can do the same thing with your pomegranates.  Yeah.  Well, they're going to start, we didn't plant any berries, et cetera.  
**1:15:58-1:16:01:**  We've got our first prickly pears to sell, but the problem is that they're extremely  prickly.  So they're not, it's a, it's a kind of a bittersweet thing to offer to somebody unless you process  
**1:16:10-1:16:15:**  it yourself, but we're trying out different products now and, and we'll be going also  to, we're trying to find out where we can sell some of our products.  A lot of them go to the community we have back in France.  
**1:16:22-1:16:26:**  Um, and, um, because we've got, we lived there for many years, so we've got a lot of friends  and friends of friends, et cetera.  But, um, yeah, that's a good for you.  
**1:16:32-1:16:33:**  It's good.  We're in a similar process.  Yes, we are.  
**1:16:35-1:16:37:**  We're growing and learning.  That's exactly right.  Maybe that could be our motto.  
**1:16:40-1:16:41:**  Very nice.  Okay.  Scott and Sandy.  
**1:16:46-1:16:52:**  Thank you so much for coming on and for talking about your fascinating experience.  Um, and uh, yeah, really, really, really nice to hear all of this, all of your story.  Thank you for having us, Dimitri.

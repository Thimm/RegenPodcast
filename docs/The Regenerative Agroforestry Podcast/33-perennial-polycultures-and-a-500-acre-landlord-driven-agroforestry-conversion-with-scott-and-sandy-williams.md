### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sun, 16 Jan 2022 18:24:19)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:30:**  a promising technique called agroforestry.  
**0:00:30-0:00:35:**  In order to find out how it can help us with these challenges, we'll be interviewing farmers,  
**0:00:35-0:00:40:**  scientists, and other experts to share with you their experiences, practical advice, and  
**0:00:40-0:00:46:**  scientific research.  
**0:00:46-0:00:50:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:50-0:00:56:**  I'm your host, Dimitri, and today we interviewed Scott and Sandy Williams from the Fields Restored  
**0:00:56-0:00:58:**  Farm in Illinois, USA.  
**0:00:58-0:01:02:**  Today we're going to approach agroforestry from a bit of a different direction.  
**0:01:02-0:01:08:**  We're going to look at how Scott and Sandy, who are actually landlords of quite a large  
**0:01:08-0:01:13:**  farm, are starting to work with their tenant farmer in order to implement a variety of  
**0:01:13-0:01:18:**  agroforestry practices, from silvopasture to intercropping and all the way to windbreak.  
**0:01:18-0:01:23:**  So it's very interesting to understand the dynamic between the farmer and the landlord  
**0:01:23-0:01:30:**  in order to put out ideas of conservation and to meet sustainability objectives whilst  
**0:01:30-0:01:35:**  maintaining the productivity needs of the farmer.  
**0:01:35-0:01:38:**  On the side of this, Scott and Sandy have also been planting a perennial woody polyculture  
**0:01:38-0:01:44:**  in collaboration with the Savannah Institute, which is a very innovative type of system  
**0:01:44-0:01:52:**  in which a huge diversity of crops are put together in a polyculture, an integrated fashion,  
**0:01:52-0:01:54:**  in order to produce for their local community.  
**0:01:54-0:01:58:**  So they're going to talk about both of these things, and it was a fascinating interview,  
**0:01:58-0:02:01:**  and I really hope you're going to enjoy it.  
**0:02:01-0:02:02:**  OK.  
**0:02:02-0:02:03:**  Hello, Scott and Sandra.  
**0:02:03-0:02:11:**  Thank you very much for coming on today, and welcome on the podcast.  
**0:02:11-0:02:12:**  That's great.  
**0:02:12-0:02:20:**  Well, I thought we could maybe start with having an understanding of how you came about,  
**0:02:20-0:02:25:**  how you ended up owning 500 acres in the first place.  
**0:02:25-0:02:27:**  Where does this land come from?  
**0:02:27-0:02:28:**  I'm curious.  
**0:02:28-0:02:31:**  Well, we're a sister and brother.  
**0:02:31-0:02:37:**  Our father owned 210 acres that was originally in his family.  
**0:02:37-0:02:46:**  And in order to preserve a farm that relatively small for, well, hopefully permanent agricultural  
**0:02:46-0:02:54:**  production, my sister and I decided we'd start looking for some additional acres nearby.  
**0:02:54-0:03:00:**  And after a year of looking, we were fortunate enough to find lots more acres than we wanted  
**0:03:00-0:03:06:**  originally, which was 167, but it was adjacent.  
**0:03:06-0:03:07:**  And so that was ideal.  
**0:03:07-0:03:12:**  We decided to add that to the family holdings.  
**0:03:12-0:03:16:**  And this was in the 1990s, mid 1990s.  
**0:03:16-0:03:23:**  And then some years later, our farm tenant told us about 50 acres he knew about because  
**0:03:23-0:03:28:**  the farmer renting that land said it was the most productive soil that he had.  
**0:03:28-0:03:34:**  And if we could purchase that, our farmer would pay us a higher rent per acre for it.  
**0:03:34-0:03:35:**  And so we did.  
**0:03:35-0:03:39:**  And thus the total of roughly 425 acres.  
**0:03:39-0:03:40:**  OK.  
**0:03:40-0:03:43:**  So it was an investment decision initially?  
**0:03:43-0:03:44:**  Yes.  
**0:03:44-0:03:45:**  Yes.  
**0:03:45-0:03:52:**  An investment decision in agricultural property to keep it in agricultural production.  
**0:03:52-0:03:53:**  Cool.  
**0:03:53-0:03:58:**  And so I'm curious about what's your relationship with the farmer that manages the land?  
**0:03:58-0:03:59:**  That's correct.  
**0:03:59-0:04:08:**  Do you frequently discuss with him and does he come to you for new management decisions  
**0:04:08-0:04:09:**  he has to make?  
**0:04:09-0:04:12:**  So how does the relationship go?  
**0:04:12-0:04:14:**  We see him several times a week.  
**0:04:14-0:04:16:**  So we're out there.  
**0:04:16-0:04:18:**  We're on the land a lot.  
**0:04:18-0:04:24:**  And so we interact and we don't sit down for formal meetings.  
**0:04:24-0:04:31:**  But each year in the negotiation of the rent of the lease renewal, we talk about pros and  
**0:04:31-0:04:34:**  cons and how the operation is going.  
**0:04:34-0:04:39:**  And then, you know, in the field during the week, we talk about how things are going.  
**0:04:39-0:04:43:**  So the relationship is really it's really excellent.  
**0:04:43-0:04:44:**  Oh, that's great.  
**0:04:44-0:04:54:**  Compared to other farm owner operator relationships one hears about, ours is ideal.  
**0:04:54-0:04:55:**  It's very cooperative.  
**0:04:55-0:05:00:**  And that's an important goal for us is to keep it that way.  
**0:05:00-0:05:07:**  And just so you know, we've been working with this farm family for more than 20 years now.  
**0:05:07-0:05:11:**  So we've worked with grandfather and then with son.  
**0:05:11-0:05:15:**  And now we're working with son and grandson.  
**0:05:15-0:05:23:**  So as farm operators, that's the business of them as farmers to work land that they  
**0:05:23-0:05:24:**  can rent.  
**0:05:24-0:05:25:**  That's very interesting.  
**0:05:25-0:05:30:**  Well, it's very good that you have such a good relationship with him, because I can  
**0:05:30-0:05:34:**  imagine that if you don't, or as you said, other people you may know who don't have that  
**0:05:34-0:05:36:**  good relationship, it can get quite complicated.  
**0:05:36-0:05:44:**  Yeah, and it could very well be that a traditional farm renter would not be very interested in  
**0:05:44-0:05:48:**  applying new processes and techniques.  
**0:05:48-0:05:50:**  And that's not the case for us.  
**0:05:50-0:05:52:**  So we're very fortunate there.  
**0:05:52-0:05:53:**  Nice.  
**0:05:53-0:05:57:**  And so if you don't mind me asking, what were your activities whilst on the side?  
**0:05:57-0:05:59:**  I mean, you weren't you weren't farming directly.  
**0:05:59-0:06:05:**  So before you started all this new adventure that we're going to talk about soon, what  
**0:06:05-0:06:06:**  were you doing?  
**0:06:06-0:06:08:**  Well, we were both working professionals.  
**0:06:08-0:06:11:**  So we had daytime jobs.  
**0:06:11-0:06:17:**  I happen to be a when we started this, I was a professional banker in Chicago, Illinois,  
**0:06:17-0:06:22:**  working you know, five days a week, five days a week at that and Scott worked for the University  
**0:06:22-0:06:26:**  of Illinois in Chicago also.  
**0:06:26-0:06:31:**  So we had separate jobs, but we that actually provided us the resources that we could afford  
**0:06:31-0:06:33:**  to purchase land.  
**0:06:33-0:06:44:**  Okay, and you were never tempted to start farming to, you know, get a before this in  
**0:06:44-0:06:48:**  the 20 years before this was there was it ever an option for you guys to start farming  
**0:06:48-0:06:49:**  ourselves?  
**0:06:49-0:06:55:**  No, not realistically, we're both we're both happy gardeners.  
**0:06:55-0:07:02:**  And I've been growing trees and shrubs and perennials myself for years, but never full  
**0:07:02-0:07:05:**  time.  
**0:07:05-0:07:10:**  Until what happened with until this new adventure, right?  
**0:07:10-0:07:13:**  Until, so tell me a bit how that got started?  
**0:07:13-0:07:19:**  How did you find inspiration and motivation to start an agricultural project?  
**0:07:19-0:07:28:**  Well, the first the first incentive was to help protect the family property and allow  
**0:07:28-0:07:32:**  it to maintain an agricultural production forever.  
**0:07:32-0:07:34:**  Of course, you can't guarantee that.  
**0:07:34-0:07:41:**  But one of the things that would help was if the property was larger than the original  
**0:07:41-0:07:47:**  farm, which would appeal to more farm tenants willing to work the land in partnership with  
**0:07:47-0:07:48:**  us.  
**0:07:48-0:07:50:**  So we achieved that.  
**0:07:50-0:07:58:**  But that was always an interest, an abiding family interest in conservation and land stewardship  
**0:07:58-0:08:01:**  and, and hanging on to it.  
**0:08:01-0:08:07:**  So it isn't turned into a shopping center or a housing development.  
**0:08:07-0:08:12:**  While we were interested in that, a young person we knew was in graduate school.  
**0:08:12-0:08:18:**  And in his graduate program, he learned about the Savannah Institute.  
**0:08:18-0:08:22:**  And he said, you've got to come here to campus and see what they're doing.  
**0:08:22-0:08:26:**  You would love to implement some of this on your farm.  
**0:08:26-0:08:27:**  So we did.  
**0:08:27-0:08:34:**  We visited there on the Champaign-Urbana campus of the University of Illinois and came home  
**0:08:34-0:08:39:**  and started talking about what we might implement on our farm.  
**0:08:39-0:08:48:**  Now that decision involved taking some land out of corn soybean rotation and out of the  
**0:08:48-0:08:54:**  rent the farmer was paying, which was an economic decision we had to face.  
**0:08:54-0:09:01:**  And then the decision of the cost of implementing what we were doing.  
**0:09:01-0:09:11:**  Prior to the focus on agroforestry, Dimitri, our focus was on perennial woody polyculture,  
**0:09:11-0:09:16:**  having plants growing that would produce food for human consumption that did not have to  
**0:09:16-0:09:24:**  be planted every year and would hopefully contribute to the environment and the ecological  
**0:09:24-0:09:36:**  diversity directly contrasted to corn and soybeans, which are very productive food operations,  
**0:09:36-0:09:43:**  but ecologically, practically one species deserts.  
**0:09:43-0:09:48:**  So we wanted to begin to bridge that divide.  
**0:09:48-0:09:56:**  And that's what we did with the 17 acres we took away from traditional and implemented  
**0:09:56-0:09:59:**  the projects that are going now.  
**0:09:59-0:10:01:**  Okay.  
**0:10:01-0:10:05:**  You mentioned that initially there was an interest in perennial polycultures.  
**0:10:05-0:10:12:**  Did that happen at the same time as your discovery of Savannah Institute and agroforestry practices,  
**0:10:12-0:10:13:**  et cetera?  
**0:10:13-0:10:14:**  Was that happening before?  
**0:10:14-0:10:18:**  No, they happened simultaneously.  
**0:10:18-0:10:24:**  We were interested in something that would improve the land overall.  
**0:10:24-0:10:30:**  And so we didn't want to, we weren't opposed to corn and soybean traditional rotation,  
**0:10:30-0:10:37:**  but obviously there's a risk to relying on just one or two crops completely and forever.  
**0:10:37-0:10:39:**  So our minds were open to it.  
**0:10:39-0:10:46:**  But at that time, the Savannah Institute was promoting perennial woody polyculture.  
**0:10:46-0:10:49:**  And so we jumped in on that in about 2015.  
**0:10:49-0:10:59:**  And that's still what we have, although it has, the terminology has evolved into agroforestry  
**0:10:59-0:11:05:**  kind of encompassing the term agroforestry encompassing a lot of what we've got with  
**0:11:05-0:11:12:**  perennial edible plants that produce edible fruits and nuts as well as trees in cropland.  
**0:11:12-0:11:13:**  Okay.  
**0:11:13-0:11:18:**  So we'll have to break this down a bit to have a clear idea.  
**0:11:18-0:11:25:**  So maybe you could define for us what is a perennial woody polyculture, and then we'll  
**0:11:25-0:11:26:**  describe that a bit.  
**0:11:26-0:11:31:**  And then we'll head into the more agroforestry side that seems to have also evolved with  
**0:11:31-0:11:33:**  it, which is all very interesting.  
**0:11:33-0:11:37:**  But of course, for us, the perennial woody polyculture is definitely a practice we're  
**0:11:37-0:11:39:**  very interested in, right?  
**0:11:39-0:11:45:**  It's something that we're about working with perennial crops and integrating them together.  
**0:11:45-0:11:47:**  So tell me a bit, what does it mean for you?  
**0:11:47-0:11:50:**  And what does it look like in the field?  
**0:11:50-0:12:02:**  It looks like strips of planted perennial food producing species like in our climate,  
**0:12:02-0:12:07:**  rhubarb and asparagus and currants and various berries.  
**0:12:07-0:12:12:**  And apple trees and hazelnuts.  
**0:12:12-0:12:21:**  Those are planted in rows spaced yards and yards apart with alleys of alfalfa growing  
**0:12:21-0:12:24:**  in between those rows.  
**0:12:24-0:12:31:**  So the alfalfa can be harvested and the farmer does and baled up and fed to his cattle during  
**0:12:31-0:12:43:**  the winter and our rows of these food crops are in narrow rows separated by 30 or more  
**0:12:43-0:12:45:**  feet.  
**0:12:45-0:12:48:**  And the rows follow the contour of the land.  
**0:12:48-0:12:50:**  So they're not straight rows.  
**0:12:50-0:12:57:**  They follow the contour of the land so that they hold moisture and also retain the soil  
**0:12:57-0:13:04:**  productivity that way and also in a way that the farmer can move his machinery through  
**0:13:04-0:13:06:**  to harvest the alfalfa that is his crop.  
**0:13:06-0:13:13:**  So it's kind of sharing what we wanted planted with what a farm operator can still plant  
**0:13:13-0:13:14:**  and harvest.  
**0:13:14-0:13:17:**  Wow, that's fascinating.  
**0:13:17-0:13:24:**  So just to visually make sure I understand it correctly, you've got a strip of a woody  
**0:13:24-0:13:32:**  polyculture full of food, berries, nuts and fruit, etc. about 30 yards long.  
**0:13:32-0:13:38:**  And you've got multiple of these separated by a few hundred yards within between alfalfa,  
**0:13:38-0:13:39:**  something like this, right?  
**0:13:39-0:13:41:**  That's very true, Dimitri.  
**0:13:41-0:13:45:**  If I can find a map and pull it up, I'll show you while we're talking about this.  
**0:13:45-0:13:47:**  But you've got the idea.  
**0:13:47-0:13:48:**  That's exactly how it looks.  
**0:13:48-0:13:54:**  And we also have trees in a windbreak kind of going around this property.  
**0:13:54-0:13:55:**  Yeah.  
**0:13:55-0:13:56:**  OK.  
**0:13:56-0:13:58:**  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.  
**0:13:58-0:14:00:**  And so it's very dense there.  
**0:14:00-0:14:06:**  I mean, all the inside this polyculture, things are quite close together, right?  
**0:14:06-0:14:08:**  The plants are quite dense.  
**0:14:08-0:14:12:**  In the single rows, yes, they're as close together as was recommended.  
**0:14:12-0:14:18:**  So a current bush might be two feet, a foot apart, right?  
**0:14:18-0:14:24:**  A foot or two feet apart going down the row, making the row.  
**0:14:24-0:14:28:**  And the berry bushes would be as close together as they need to be because they're going to  
**0:14:28-0:14:30:**  branch, right?  
**0:14:30-0:14:36:**  But they're in a row going along the contour of the land.  
**0:14:36-0:14:42:**  And then around the outside is more trees that are deciduous trees as well as evergreen  
**0:14:42-0:14:46:**  trees that produce a windbreak.  
**0:14:46-0:14:52:**  And some really fast growing poplar trees that are both windbreaks and raptor roosts.  
**0:14:52-0:15:01:**  So we had also in mind, along with the food production, a return to nature kind of because  
**0:15:01-0:15:03:**  we weren't going to put herbicides on.  
**0:15:03-0:15:09:**  We weren't going to put pesticides on and sort of to see how the land would regenerate  
**0:15:09-0:15:22:**  itself with all sorts of pollinators and birds and mammals and even other woodland creatures.  
**0:15:22-0:15:30:**  We're just curious to see how quickly nature would return to its natural state if we stopped  
**0:15:30-0:15:37:**  all the herbicides and stopped the single culture crop.  
**0:15:37-0:15:38:**  That's very interesting.  
**0:15:38-0:15:41:**  And I mean, you planted this six years ago, right?  
**0:15:41-0:15:45:**  That's when you, so you planted the whole field in one year.  
**0:15:45-0:15:46:**  Yes.  
**0:15:46-0:15:49:**  Wow, that's a lot of work.  
**0:15:49-0:15:53:**  17 acres of a polyculture is a lot of work.  
**0:15:53-0:16:02:**  It took a couple of days with a crew of about 10 people and, you know, a tractor and a planting  
**0:16:02-0:16:09:**  device that allowed these small seedlings to be plopped in the ground as the machine  
**0:16:09-0:16:10:**  rolled along.  
**0:16:10-0:16:13:**  That's very efficient to do it in a few days.  
**0:16:13-0:16:14:**  Yeah.  
**0:16:14-0:16:15:**  Yeah.  
**0:16:15-0:16:16:**  Very nice.  
**0:16:16-0:16:22:**  And so, nowadays, how tall are the trees?  
**0:16:22-0:16:29:**  Well, the fast growing poplars are 35 or more feet tall.  
**0:16:29-0:16:32:**  You know, they grow many feet per year.  
**0:16:32-0:16:38:**  The hazelnuts are six feet tall and that's about where the, you know, two meters high.  
**0:16:38-0:16:42:**  That's probably where they'll stay.  
**0:16:42-0:16:46:**  And the berry bushes, they stay about waist high.  
**0:16:46-0:16:50:**  The apple trees are growing.  
**0:16:50-0:16:52:**  They're about two meters tall now.  
**0:16:52-0:17:01:**  And the hickory trees and the chestnut trees are about three meters high.  
**0:17:01-0:17:03:**  It took a long time to get established.  
**0:17:03-0:17:06:**  What a crazy amount of diversity.  
**0:17:06-0:17:11:**  I mean, I've seen the map before, so I've got a bit of an idea of how it's all laid  
**0:17:11-0:17:12:**  out.  
**0:17:12-0:17:13:**  Listeners haven't yet.  
**0:17:13-0:17:14:**  I'll probably try and share it with them.  
**0:17:14-0:17:18:**  But I mean, you mentioned that there was a big incentive with conservation.  
**0:17:18-0:17:20:**  Have you started seeing some results?  
**0:17:20-0:17:23:**  Because I can just imagine this landscape of you being in a place with just soy and  
**0:17:23-0:17:27:**  corn around, not much woody cover.  
**0:17:27-0:17:30:**  And then you've got a bit of an oasis that you've created.  
**0:17:30-0:17:33:**  Is that, am I seeing it in the wrong way?  
**0:17:33-0:17:40:**  You're not seeing it wrong, but the oasis is not quite the island unique that it could  
**0:17:40-0:17:45:**  be if we were in other areas where there's nothing but corn and soybeans for miles and  
**0:17:45-0:17:46:**  miles.  
**0:17:46-0:17:52:**  Soybeans are the predominant crops, but we're fortunate that the area we're in has some  
**0:17:52-0:17:57:**  woodlands and some rivers.  
**0:17:57-0:18:00:**  The whole area itself is fairly diverse.  
**0:18:00-0:18:01:**  Okay.  
**0:18:01-0:18:05:**  The corn that we planted this area on, you're right.  
**0:18:05-0:18:11:**  And I can tell you that the very first year that it wasn't corn and soybeans, butterflies  
**0:18:11-0:18:14:**  and insects returned.  
**0:18:14-0:18:15:**  Right away.  
**0:18:15-0:18:16:**  Wow.  
**0:18:16-0:18:19:**  Like the magic of a Walt Disney movie.  
**0:18:19-0:18:26:**  It was quick and praying mantis came in, which only feed on other insects.  
**0:18:26-0:18:30:**  And it's been pretty remarkable.  
**0:18:30-0:18:37:**  And even a diversity of birds, birds and we put up a couple of cameras and can capture  
**0:18:37-0:18:38:**  what comes across, right?  
**0:18:38-0:18:45:**  So little ground mammals like chipmunks and squirrels and that sort of stuff.  
**0:18:45-0:18:48:**  And then those that feed on them.  
**0:18:48-0:18:49:**  That's amazing.  
**0:18:49-0:18:53:**  So I wanted to maybe just zoom back a bit and understand what were your key motivations  
**0:18:53-0:18:55:**  and objectives with this plantation.  
**0:18:55-0:18:58:**  You mentioned conservation, of course.  
**0:18:58-0:19:01:**  What were the other ones that were your, what were your key objectives?  
**0:19:01-0:19:08:**  Well, in one sense, we planted a lot of different varieties and different species in order to  
**0:19:08-0:19:12:**  see what would grow best on the soil that we had.  
**0:19:12-0:19:15:**  So part of it was simple.  
**0:19:15-0:19:21:**  We weren't trying to get food necessarily, but we were interested in agricultural research.  
**0:19:21-0:19:28:**  We were familiar and associated very vaguely with the University of Illinois.  
**0:19:28-0:19:36:**  And we talked to several students there through their agricultural department and or college.  
**0:19:36-0:19:41:**  And if they wanted to run an experiment, we'd let them do that.  
**0:19:41-0:19:46:**  But some people did want to do experiments on how many insects do come back or what type  
**0:19:46-0:19:48:**  of fertilizer works best.  
**0:19:48-0:19:57:**  And can you use chicken fertilizer or no fertilizer, you know, and just on the plants that we had  
**0:19:57-0:19:58:**  there.  
**0:19:58-0:20:02:**  So there was the research aspect of it.  
**0:20:02-0:20:05:**  And we also have a strong educational interest.  
**0:20:05-0:20:10:**  You know, we'd like to share, like we're doing here, talking to you, we'd like to share with  
**0:20:10-0:20:20:**  people what they can do on land and how they can produce and grow a variety of plants and  
**0:20:20-0:20:27:**  species that are food producing that aren't as risky as a single crop.  
**0:20:27-0:20:34:**  Just aren't as risky over time as one single crop like all corn or all soybeans.  
**0:20:34-0:20:39:**  So in that sense, we were also interested in demonstrating to others what we were doing  
**0:20:39-0:20:42:**  so they could make some choices on their own properties.  
**0:20:42-0:20:43:**  Hmm.  
**0:20:43-0:20:45:**  Now, that's really interesting.  
**0:20:45-0:20:48:**  Our primary motivation was conservation.  
**0:20:48-0:20:50:**  OK.  
**0:20:50-0:20:56:**  And what about production in terms of having a crop that could also generate an income  
**0:20:56-0:20:57:**  for you?  
**0:20:57-0:21:01:**  Because, I mean, 17 acres with the type of system that you've described at maturity could  
**0:21:01-0:21:03:**  be quite valuable.  
**0:21:03-0:21:05:**  Yes, it could.  
**0:21:05-0:21:12:**  And we were happily surprised that we started getting raspberries the very first season.  
**0:21:12-0:21:17:**  And subsequent to that, the currents are more productive every year.  
**0:21:17-0:21:22:**  The blackberries are astoundingly productive.  
**0:21:22-0:21:27:**  After the third year, when we could start harvesting asparagus, we're getting all the  
**0:21:27-0:21:29:**  asparagus we can handle.  
**0:21:29-0:21:34:**  So it's growingly productive.  
**0:21:34-0:21:42:**  And we are able to sell what we grow, but it isn't financially profitable.  
**0:21:42-0:21:43:**  Hmm.  
**0:21:43-0:21:50:**  This project that we started, making money on it was never the goal.  
**0:21:50-0:21:53:**  It was a big investment to do all the plantings.  
**0:21:53-0:21:54:**  Hmm.  
**0:21:54-0:21:58:**  And that investment just grew for the first three years, right?  
**0:21:58-0:22:00:**  With no return because there was nothing much to harvest.  
**0:22:00-0:22:01:**  Yeah.  
**0:22:01-0:22:10:**  So we have harvested, like Scott said, increasing amounts of fruits and nuts, but still, it's  
**0:22:10-0:22:11:**  limited.  
**0:22:11-0:22:18:**  We sell those directly to chefs and cooks and restaurants in Northern Illinois and in  
**0:22:18-0:22:28:**  the Chicagoland area, but not enough of it to show any return, any return much on what  
**0:22:28-0:22:29:**  we invested.  
**0:22:29-0:22:33:**  So we sort of said to ourselves, well, what we invested has to be a sunk cost.  
**0:22:33-0:22:35:**  That's just going into the land.  
**0:22:35-0:22:37:**  That's just going into the land.  
**0:22:37-0:22:39:**  We'll take it out of our pockets.  
**0:22:39-0:22:47:**  We'll put it in these plants because our interest is conservation and a little bit of research  
**0:22:47-0:22:49:**  and education.  
**0:22:49-0:22:52:**  So we're not going to be making money at this.  
**0:22:52-0:22:53:**  Yeah.  
**0:22:53-0:22:54:**  Interesting.  
**0:22:54-0:23:01:**  So even in, let's say, in 10 years time when the system has reached a maturity of full  
**0:23:01-0:23:08:**  productiveness, even at that point, you're not expecting it to generate the revenue that  
**0:23:08-0:23:11:**  is enough to start paying back for that investment.  
**0:23:11-0:23:15:**  I mean, if you look at the cash flow throughout the lifetime of this system, which is going  
**0:23:15-0:23:19:**  to last many years.  
**0:23:19-0:23:27:**  Realistically, we would never sell enough berries and nuts to recover the initial cost  
**0:23:27-0:23:33:**  of the investment we made, let alone the cost of the land if you were talking about purchasing  
**0:23:33-0:23:35:**  that.  
**0:23:35-0:23:37:**  It's viable.  
**0:23:37-0:23:41:**  We do produce and we do sell.  
**0:23:41-0:23:45:**  Far more rewarding though has been the response from people when they see what we're able  
**0:23:45-0:23:49:**  to grow and share with them.  
**0:23:49-0:23:56:**  The popularity currently of farm to table produce has been very appealing to people.  
**0:23:56-0:24:04:**  So friends of ours from the city and the suburbs are very intrigued and fascinated by what  
**0:24:04-0:24:06:**  we're doing.  
**0:24:06-0:24:11:**  And so we're expanding their knowledge of the natural world and otherwise what they  
**0:24:11-0:24:15:**  just see on their grocery store shelves.  
**0:24:15-0:24:22:**  But we didn't do it to ultimately make a net profit.  
**0:24:22-0:24:23:**  Yeah, yeah.  
**0:24:23-0:24:24:**  And it makes sense.  
**0:24:24-0:24:26:**  And we're educating their children as well, right?  
**0:24:26-0:24:32:**  So we encourage families to come and come with your kids and pick berries, right?  
**0:24:32-0:24:39:**  Or pick some pumpkins or pick some gourds or pick hazelnuts and take it home and shuck  
**0:24:39-0:24:44:**  them yourself and see what it's like to eat a nut that you picked and now you know where  
**0:24:44-0:24:46:**  it comes from.  
**0:24:46-0:24:50:**  Because children don't learn that in school anymore.  
**0:24:50-0:24:55:**  And they don't know where the food that's in the grocery store comes from.  
**0:24:55-0:25:01:**  So it's fun for the parents and it's educational for both the parents and the kids to really  
**0:25:01-0:25:07:**  be able to be out there and do some picking.  
**0:25:07-0:25:08:**  That's very interesting.  
**0:25:08-0:25:15:**  And I can imagine also that this kind of, we've got a similar system here and maybe  
**0:25:15-0:25:23:**  a bit more simplified in Greece where we've got a polyculture on 10 acres, but in one  
**0:25:23-0:25:30:**  block in the sense it's just, we don't have intercropping with alfalfa or anything.  
**0:25:30-0:25:36:**  And visually it looks very different to what you're used to on agricultural terms.  
**0:25:36-0:25:43:**  And it's quite, people they get quite touched by it because it looks very, it looks like  
**0:25:43-0:25:50:**  there's a small forest that's emerging, but it's actually producing food.  
**0:25:50-0:25:56:**  If people are fascinated by producing food and just seeing it and picking a berry and  
**0:25:56-0:26:01:**  putting it in their mouths, that's a very different experience and a wonderful experience  
**0:26:01-0:26:06:**  for people today, both adults and children.  
**0:26:06-0:26:11:**  What are you growing on your 10 acres there in Greece, Dimitri?  
**0:26:11-0:26:19:**  It's we're growing figs, pomegranates, pistachios, almonds, and prickly pears.  
**0:26:19-0:26:25:**  So California type crops, Mediterranean crops.  
**0:26:25-0:26:26:**  Good for you.  
**0:26:26-0:26:27:**  Those wouldn't work where we are.  
**0:26:27-0:26:32:**  Yeah, sure it wouldn't.  
**0:26:32-0:26:35:**  So that's interesting.  
**0:26:35-0:26:40:**  What we've tried to make it, what we're aiming to see at our place is how much diversity  
**0:26:40-0:26:41:**  can we integrate?  
**0:26:41-0:26:46:**  You know, how can, so we've got, for example, a line of fig trees and then a line of pomegranates  
**0:26:46-0:26:47:**  and a line of fig trees.  
**0:26:47-0:26:53:**  So it's a bit more simplified, but we're trying to see how diverse can we go whilst being  
**0:26:53-0:26:54:**  profitable.  
**0:26:54-0:26:58:**  We started four years ago, so it's a bit young, the project.  
**0:26:58-0:27:03:**  How long does it take a fig tree before you'll actually reap some figs?  
**0:27:03-0:27:07:**  So the first figs will arrive at the second or third year.  
**0:27:07-0:27:11:**  Maybe even the second year can start if it has good growth.  
**0:27:11-0:27:16:**  But the first commercial crop, a significant commercial crop for a fast growing tree should  
**0:27:16-0:27:18:**  be around four or five years.  
**0:27:18-0:27:22:**  In a sense, it's quickly, it starts producing.  
**0:27:22-0:27:26:**  Pistachios would take for the first solid commercial crop can take seven, eight, nine  
**0:27:26-0:27:27:**  years.  
**0:27:27-0:27:28:**  Okay.  
**0:27:28-0:27:32:**  Figs would be more around four, five.  
**0:27:32-0:27:38:**  And I'm sure it's a, it's a, well, it's an issue in your case.  
**0:27:38-0:27:45:**  If you jumbled everything together and planted everything in the same row, harvesting would  
**0:27:45-0:27:46:**  become very inefficient.  
**0:27:46-0:27:47:**  Yeah.  
**0:27:47-0:27:48:**  Right.  
**0:27:48-0:27:53:**  You can track the diversity in, but it would be hard to get at stuff.  
**0:27:53-0:27:54:**  Exactly.  
**0:27:54-0:27:58:**  And is that, I mean, if you were to think about your system and then a farmer came to  
**0:27:58-0:28:01:**  see you and they were like, wow, this is just fantastic.  
**0:28:01-0:28:05:**  The list looks amazing, but I want to make a bit of money with this.  
**0:28:05-0:28:07:**  Would you, how would you change your system?  
**0:28:07-0:28:11:**  How would you adapt it to that farmer?  
**0:28:11-0:28:13:**  Would you, would you simplify things?  
**0:28:13-0:28:21:**  I would suggest that he integrate trees or perennial crops into rows within his existing  
**0:28:21-0:28:34:**  fields and harvested traditionally around those and, and learned about variety of crops  
**0:28:34-0:28:42:**  in between, through trial and error, or maybe seeing what we're doing or what appealed to  
**0:28:42-0:28:43:**  him personally.  
**0:28:43-0:28:51:**  You know, if he wants to grow raspberries, he should plant raspberries.  
**0:28:51-0:28:55:**  We can help now with what we've got to help people understand what grows.  
**0:28:55-0:29:00:**  You know, for instance, we had red raspberries and yellow raspberries and black raspberries  
**0:29:00-0:29:07:**  and they grew the first two or three years, but then they, but then they all died back.  
**0:29:07-0:29:12:**  They just all died back and we don't have those anymore to a great extent.  
**0:29:12-0:29:16:**  And that's just part of our climate, part of the soil where we are.  
**0:29:16-0:29:22:**  So you know, we could, we could easily tell a farmer, take these, these species, grow  
**0:29:22-0:29:30:**  this, but grow, grow that one thing then more abundantly and you will have, you could make  
**0:29:30-0:29:32:**  more off of your land.  
**0:29:32-0:29:38:**  You know, we planted, remember we planted our rows sort of 40 or 50 feet apart so that  
**0:29:38-0:29:44:**  a farm operator could also plant his rows of alfalfa and go through there with a machine  
**0:29:44-0:29:47:**  and harvest that, right?  
**0:29:47-0:29:48:**  Mow it down and bale it up.  
**0:29:48-0:29:53:**  Well, if we weren't with a farm operator and it was someone else and they wanted to plant  
**0:29:53-0:29:59:**  rows of, let's say, blackberries, they could plant them much closer together.  
**0:29:59-0:30:06:**  You could get more of the, of the fruit producing plants on this land than the way we've planted  
**0:30:06-0:30:07:**  it, right?  
**0:30:07-0:30:08:**  Of course.  
**0:30:08-0:30:09:**  Yeah.  
**0:30:09-0:30:10:**  That's interesting.  
**0:30:10-0:30:11:**  And then they'd make more money.  
**0:30:11-0:30:16:**  They could make money sooner and more money.  
**0:30:16-0:30:19:**  And you're harvesting everything by hand.  
**0:30:19-0:30:21:**  Yes, that's right.  
**0:30:21-0:30:28:**  There are things like blackberries and black raspberries and, and Juneberries.  
**0:30:28-0:30:30:**  They can't be harvested any other way.  
**0:30:30-0:30:35:**  And you know, it's plucking them one at a time and, uh,  
**0:30:35-0:30:36:**  Currents.  
**0:30:36-0:30:41:**  It's, it's, they may have ways of harvesting currents in Europe.  
**0:30:41-0:30:42:**  Yeah.  
**0:30:42-0:30:44:**  I was on a farm recently where we had these crops as well.  
**0:30:44-0:30:46:**  Then it was, uh, it was all by hand.  
**0:30:46-0:30:48:**  Took a while.  
**0:30:48-0:30:51:**  And it's good that it takes a good price on the market though.  
**0:30:51-0:30:56:**  You sell them well, but it's, uh,  
**0:30:56-0:31:01:**  Another option is to have, is to have the public come in and pick their own berries.  
**0:31:01-0:31:05:**  We haven't, we haven't looked into that yet.  
**0:31:05-0:31:09:**  We're not particularly interested in having people traipse around, but I can see that  
**0:31:09-0:31:15:**  they would want to, there would be, you could open your property up to people coming in  
**0:31:15-0:31:18:**  and picking their own berries.  
**0:31:18-0:31:22:**  And nuts and people like chestnuts or they like hazelnuts.  
**0:31:22-0:31:26:**  You know, you could have times of the year when, when they're ripe and let the public  
**0:31:26-0:31:32:**  come in and pick what they want in bags or sacks and, and sell it by the, by pounds.  
**0:31:32-0:31:33:**  Right.  
**0:31:33-0:31:34:**  Or by bushel.  
**0:31:34-0:31:35:**  Yeah.  
**0:31:35-0:31:36:**  Yeah.  
**0:31:36-0:31:42:**  I saw a farmer on the podcast that was doing this, um, um, from Redfern farm and they're  
**0:31:42-0:31:43:**  doing this pick.  
**0:31:43-0:31:44:**  We have visited their farm.  
**0:31:44-0:31:45:**  Yeah.  
**0:31:45-0:31:46:**  Well, there you go.  
**0:31:46-0:31:47:**  Yeah.  
**0:31:47-0:31:53:**  They, they, they did a great job discovering that people would come in and pick their chestnuts  
**0:31:53-0:31:58:**  and they didn't have to pick them and bag them and try to sell them.  
**0:31:58-0:32:01:**  That was a great transformation for them.  
**0:32:01-0:32:02:**  Yeah.  
**0:32:02-0:32:03:**  Hmm.  
**0:32:03-0:32:04:**  And it's, it's like a dream really.  
**0:32:04-0:32:06:**  You get, you don't have to worry about harvesting.  
**0:32:06-0:32:09:**  Somebody comes to do it for you and pays you for it as well.  
**0:32:09-0:32:12:**  It's a, it's quite the ideal situation.  
**0:32:12-0:32:13:**  That's right.  
**0:32:13-0:32:18:**  And they had mature chestnut trees, which we don't have yet.  
**0:32:18-0:32:19:**  Okay.  
**0:32:19-0:32:20:**  Nice.  
**0:32:20-0:32:22:**  And this could be an opportunity for you in the future as well.  
**0:32:22-0:32:23:**  That's correct.  
**0:32:23-0:32:24:**  Yep.  
**0:32:24-0:32:25:**  Very nice.  
**0:32:25-0:32:29:**  And so I'm, I'm curious, how, how did you fund this project?  
**0:32:29-0:32:34:**  Did you fund it yourself or did you get a fund from, from an external fund to do so?  
**0:32:34-0:32:37:**  We paid for it ourselves.  
**0:32:37-0:32:38:**  Okay.  
**0:32:38-0:32:39:**  Nice.  
**0:32:39-0:32:44:**  Fortunately we could, and we want, we were that interested in doing something that would  
**0:32:44-0:32:50:**  last on the farm beyond our lifetimes.  
**0:32:50-0:32:57:**  The perennial aspect helps assure that planting trees, which will outlive us helps assure  
**0:32:57-0:32:58:**  that.  
**0:32:58-0:33:03:**  Um, but we decided we would make this investment.  
**0:33:03-0:33:05:**  We just made that commitment.  
**0:33:05-0:33:06:**  Okay.  
**0:33:06-0:33:07:**  Very nice.  
**0:33:07-0:33:09:**  And how did you learn all the skills?  
**0:33:09-0:33:13:**  Because it's, it's not easy to, you had jobs on the side.  
**0:33:13-0:33:18:**  I understood you you'd been doing some planting and some, uh, and some carrying of trees and  
**0:33:18-0:33:23:**  vegetables, et cetera, some gardening, but how did you then, you know, start such a,  
**0:33:23-0:33:25:**  because it is quite a big scale project.  
**0:33:25-0:33:26:**  It's not small.  
**0:33:26-0:33:31:**  Um, so how, how did that, uh, how did you learn the tricks of the trade and everything?  
**0:33:31-0:33:39:**  Well, we learned the planning plan, planting plan, and got the planting done through resources  
**0:33:39-0:33:42:**  of the Savannah Institute.  
**0:33:42-0:33:50:**  But in terms of managing and pruning and mulching and when to harvest, we've, we're continuing  
**0:33:50-0:33:55:**  to learn that as time goes by, we're learning more and more.  
**0:33:55-0:33:57:**  Those things that survived, they're thriving.  
**0:33:57-0:33:59:**  They're doing very well.  
**0:33:59-0:34:06:**  And so as we refill areas that weren't as successful, we're going to work with the things  
**0:34:06-0:34:10:**  that did very well and plant more of those.  
**0:34:10-0:34:14:**  But we, we consider ourselves very, very young into this.  
**0:34:14-0:34:15:**  Yeah.  
**0:34:15-0:34:21:**  And it's all lots of fun and fascinating and, and, and interesting.  
**0:34:21-0:34:28:**  And it has, it has required the past two seasons, um, more and more of our personal time.  
**0:34:28-0:34:34:**  And at this point now we're both retired from our day jobs.  
**0:34:34-0:34:39:**  So during the harvesting season, we have had the time personally to, to be there.  
**0:34:39-0:34:40:**  Right.  
**0:34:40-0:34:44:**  Because if you're picking raspberries or blackberries, you're picking every other day, right.  
**0:34:44-0:34:48:**  To get just the right ones at the right time.  
**0:34:48-0:34:55:**  So that's, that's a lot of, uh, time and energy, which, um, which we're doing more and more  
**0:34:55-0:34:57:**  of as, as the years go by.  
**0:34:57-0:35:02:**  Um, but we won't be able to do it forever either.  
**0:35:02-0:35:06:**  That's our next, that's our next, uh, transition.  
**0:35:06-0:35:07:**  Okay.  
**0:35:07-0:35:08:**  Very nice.  
**0:35:08-0:35:11:**  So it wasn't, it doesn't seem so overwhelming for you.  
**0:35:11-0:35:15:**  You kind of just went into it and learned everything you had to learn and cracked on  
**0:35:15-0:35:17:**  with it, right?  
**0:35:17-0:35:18:**  That's correct.  
**0:35:18-0:35:23:**  And it's, it's, it is beginning to reach the point where the labor of harvest is overwhelming  
**0:35:23-0:35:24:**  to us.  
**0:35:24-0:35:25:**  Okay.  
**0:35:25-0:35:31:**  And we're, we're, we're exploring other sources for that.  
**0:35:31-0:35:32:**  What are you exploring?  
**0:35:32-0:35:33:**  I'm curious.  
**0:35:33-0:35:42:**  Well, there's a, there's a religious group, a religion, um, called the Mennonites and  
**0:35:42-0:35:48:**  the Mennonites have pockets of populations throughout the United States.  
**0:35:48-0:35:57:**  And they've, they've started to build a community, um, near and around our farm.  
**0:35:57-0:36:05:**  And we began talking to them last season about coming in and doing the, the hand harvest  
**0:36:05-0:36:15:**  themselves, which of course we have to figure out how to pay them for their labor, uh, or  
**0:36:15-0:36:18:**  charge them for the crop that they take.  
**0:36:18-0:36:23:**  And since we haven't been doing that ourselves before, we have to figure that out this winter.  
**0:36:23-0:36:24:**  Hmm.  
**0:36:24-0:36:27:**  So it could turn into a you pick system.  
**0:36:27-0:36:28:**  Yeah.  
**0:36:28-0:36:34:**  They, they, yeah, it would, it would be you pick Dimitri, they would pick and then they  
**0:36:34-0:36:41:**  could resell them, uh, for whatever price they could get.  
**0:36:41-0:36:43:**  Or they could make product out of them, right?  
**0:36:43-0:36:49:**  If they were picking berries, they could make jam or jellies or whatever they wanted or  
**0:36:49-0:36:53:**  freeze and, and sell fresh or frozen.  
**0:36:53-0:36:54:**  Right.  
**0:36:54-0:36:56:**  As a, as a, as an operation.  
**0:36:56-0:36:57:**  Yeah.  
**0:36:57-0:36:58:**  For sure.  
**0:36:58-0:36:59:**  As a food producing operation.  
**0:36:59-0:37:02:**  We haven't answered that question yet, but we're asking it.  
**0:37:02-0:37:03:**  Yeah.  
**0:37:03-0:37:04:**  We're looking into it.  
**0:37:04-0:37:05:**  Okay.  
**0:37:05-0:37:06:**  Very nice.  
**0:37:06-0:37:13:**  And, um, I was curious about how you managed to mechanize everything and in the sense I'm  
**0:37:13-0:37:19:**  talking about the management now, do you guys have a tractor to, to, to keep to weed or  
**0:37:19-0:37:20:**  to till?  
**0:37:20-0:37:23:**  How do you, how do you manage the land?  
**0:37:23-0:37:33:**  We bought a small tractor that we use mostly to, to mow the areas that aren't in alfalfa  
**0:37:33-0:37:38:**  and just, you know, the, the, the paths and all along and the borders.  
**0:37:38-0:37:45:**  So mowing takes a good bit of time and we don't harvest anything mechanically.  
**0:37:45-0:37:48:**  So that's all by hand.  
**0:37:48-0:37:54:**  And we have spread mulch with the tractor and also by hand, you know, with it along  
**0:37:54-0:38:00:**  the row mulching along in there so that it keeps the weeds down and it, you know, adds  
**0:38:00-0:38:05:**  to the root, root growth of the plants that we care about.  
**0:38:05-0:38:14:**  We purchased a used mulch spreader with another farmer that helps that process.  
**0:38:14-0:38:15:**  And we share it.  
**0:38:15-0:38:21:**  But those are the two pieces of equipment, major pieces of equipment that we have.  
**0:38:21-0:38:22:**  Yeah.  
**0:38:22-0:38:23:**  Okay.  
**0:38:23-0:38:27:**  And, and you get the mulch, I guess it's wood chips that you buy in.  
**0:38:27-0:38:28:**  That's right.  
**0:38:28-0:38:33:**  Well, I think you'll like this part of the story.  
**0:38:33-0:38:43:**  Our farmer, our, our tenant farmer also had a beef feedlot, concentrated beef feeding  
**0:38:43-0:38:50:**  from the, you know, from the calf stage just to put weight on and then sell to the, to  
**0:38:50-0:38:52:**  the processing market.  
**0:38:52-0:39:01:**  Well, he bedded those cows on wood chips and he got the wood chips from a major department  
**0:39:01-0:39:05:**  store chain across the U.S. called Menards.  
**0:39:05-0:39:12:**  And the wood chips are the wooden pallets that they move material around on that a forklift  
**0:39:12-0:39:16:**  picks up those, those grids of wood.  
**0:39:16-0:39:18:**  We call them pallets.  
**0:39:18-0:39:26:**  And when those are wearing out, they became a nuisance to Menards and Menards would grind  
**0:39:26-0:39:31:**  them up and had nothing to do with those chips.  
**0:39:31-0:39:35:**  So this farmer said, well, I could take some of those chips.  
**0:39:35-0:39:40:**  And they said to him, if you'll take all of those chips, we'll deliver them to you for  
**0:39:40-0:39:44:**  free just to get, just to get rid of the nuisance.  
**0:39:44-0:39:45:**  Okay.  
**0:39:45-0:39:47:**  So he got the free wood chips.  
**0:39:47-0:39:51:**  He put them in the barns underneath the cows.  
**0:39:51-0:39:57:**  And this is a pretty intensive operation with, you know, lots of cows just standing together,  
**0:39:57-0:39:59:**  gaining weight all day long.  
**0:39:59-0:40:00:**  Yeah.  
**0:40:00-0:40:03:**  Herds of cows eating and getting fatter every day.  
**0:40:03-0:40:07:**  But while they're eating, they're producing manure and the manure is falling into the  
**0:40:07-0:40:08:**  wood chips.  
**0:40:08-0:40:14:**  So when it's time to clean out that barn and bring in some more cows, he had this, I call  
**0:40:14-0:40:22:**  it magic manure mulch that had developed with the fertilizer ingredients in it and the natural  
**0:40:22-0:40:29:**  plant material from the wood already ground up and beautiful and handleable.  
**0:40:29-0:40:35:**  And so we bought from him several truckloads of this material.  
**0:40:35-0:40:41:**  And we still have piles of that on the farm to spread as mulch when we can.  
**0:40:41-0:40:42:**  Okay.  
**0:40:42-0:40:46:**  Without doing it scientifically, there's absolutely no question.  
**0:40:46-0:40:53:**  The crops that get the benefit of this magic manure mulch are measurably more productive  
**0:40:53-0:40:54:**  than those that don't.  
**0:40:54-0:40:55:**  Yeah.  
**0:40:55-0:40:56:**  It makes a lot of sense.  
**0:40:56-0:40:57:**  Yeah.  
**0:40:57-0:40:58:**  It's natural fertilizer.  
**0:40:58-0:40:59:**  Right.  
**0:40:59-0:41:00:**  Yeah.  
**0:41:00-0:41:05:**  It's a great opportunity to recycle something that was a nuisance and a waste product in  
**0:41:05-0:41:09:**  another operation and works perfectly for us.  
**0:41:09-0:41:11:**  That makes a lot of sense.  
**0:41:11-0:41:12:**  That's very interesting.  
**0:41:12-0:41:13:**  Okay.  
**0:41:13-0:41:14:**  Nice.  
**0:41:14-0:41:21:**  So you're spreading the mulch with the mulcher, you're pruning by hand, harvesting by hand  
**0:41:21-0:41:25:**  and you're mowing in between the rows with the tractor.  
**0:41:25-0:41:26:**  Yes.  
**0:41:26-0:41:28:**  That's right.  
**0:41:28-0:41:29:**  Very nice.  
**0:41:29-0:41:30:**  Very nice.  
**0:41:30-0:41:40:**  And so I'm curious as to some of the, let's say, as new farmers, you started six years  
**0:41:40-0:41:41:**  ago actively in this.  
**0:41:41-0:41:47:**  What were some of the top lessons that you learned with these kinds of polyculture systems?  
**0:41:47-0:41:49:**  What would you have done differently?  
**0:41:49-0:41:52:**  What would you have changed in the design and the management?  
**0:41:52-0:41:57:**  What did you learn that you could tell others that want to implement similar systems?  
**0:41:57-0:41:59:**  The design was terrific.  
**0:41:59-0:42:06:**  We spent a lot of time with the Savannah Institute developing the design and what we wanted to  
**0:42:06-0:42:07:**  plant and where.  
**0:42:07-0:42:12:**  And that has worked out very, very well.  
**0:42:12-0:42:18:**  It was surprising to us to learn that some of those things did not thrive.  
**0:42:18-0:42:23:**  And so while we're busier and busier with the productive plants, some of the things  
**0:42:23-0:42:26:**  that we thought would do well have not.  
**0:42:26-0:42:30:**  And we wouldn't have known that if we hadn't planted it and tried it.  
**0:42:30-0:42:35:**  So I wouldn't call that a flaw, but I'd call it a lesson learned.  
**0:42:35-0:42:40:**  The first thing I would do different if I was starting this over, the first year we  
**0:42:40-0:42:47:**  didn't have corn and soybeans, we planted these alleys and these rows of crops.  
**0:42:47-0:42:53:**  We didn't do anything to kill off the weeds that were there or prevent the weeds from  
**0:42:53-0:42:54:**  coming in.  
**0:42:54-0:42:59:**  And so those invasive weeds have been a problem ever since.  
**0:42:59-0:43:05:**  Had we taken the time to destroy all of that.  
**0:43:05-0:43:11:**  We would have started with a cleaner soil base.  
**0:43:11-0:43:20:**  Instead, we still mow a lot to keep the weeds and the grasses down.  
**0:43:20-0:43:31:**  Another lesson, Dimitri, we planted hardy apple rootstock intending to graft more desirable  
**0:43:31-0:43:38:**  varieties of apples onto it when the rootstock was developed.  
**0:43:38-0:43:44:**  And the rootstock did well, but our grafting failed almost 100%.  
**0:43:44-0:43:53:**  So gradually I've been replacing those failures with bare rootstock already grafted apple  
**0:43:53-0:43:54:**  trees.  
**0:43:54-0:44:01:**  And I would strongly advise unless you're an expert grafter, and we didn't do it ourselves,  
**0:44:01-0:44:03:**  we had an expert grafter doing it with us.  
**0:44:03-0:44:05:**  I wouldn't mess with that.  
**0:44:05-0:44:13:**  I would go with the more expensive already grafted apple trees.  
**0:44:13-0:44:15:**  That was a lesson learned.  
**0:44:15-0:44:16:**  Yes, that's right.  
**0:44:16-0:44:26:**  And some of the trees that we tried, pawpaws and persimmons, did not prosper for us.  
**0:44:26-0:44:30:**  So we'll do more apples.  
**0:44:30-0:44:34:**  But we tried a lot to see what would work.  
**0:44:34-0:44:39:**  And I think anybody would have to do some of that.  
**0:44:39-0:44:44:**  And anybody who would do this, who wanted to plant fruit trees, you have to be patient.  
**0:44:44-0:44:47:**  We don't have any apple trees bearing fruit yet, right?  
**0:44:47-0:44:49:**  And we're in year six.  
**0:44:49-0:44:53:**  We don't have chestnuts bearing nuts yet, and we're in year six.  
**0:44:53-0:45:01:**  So you have to pick varieties that can yield you what you need in a timeline that's reasonable  
**0:45:01-0:45:02:**  for you.  
**0:45:02-0:45:03:**  You have to think about that.  
**0:45:03-0:45:05:**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.  
**0:45:05-0:45:08:**  More time to mature and to produce.  
**0:45:08-0:45:10:**  And the variety selection is very important.  
**0:45:10-0:45:17:**  If you don't have a farm around that can demonstrate, that has gone through this process, this difficult  
**0:45:17-0:45:25:**  process of finding out what works, it's a huge extra research cost that you take on  
**0:45:25-0:45:26:**  your shoulders.  
**0:45:26-0:45:30:**  But it's also very helpful for the community around, as you mentioned.  
**0:45:30-0:45:33:**  Now there's information about what works, what doesn't.  
**0:45:33-0:45:37:**  And have you managed to work out why they don't work, the persimmons?  
**0:45:37-0:45:39:**  And you mentioned the pawpaws?  
**0:45:39-0:45:47:**  The only thing we can guess, rhubarb grows all over the Midwest.  
**0:45:47-0:45:52:**  I don't think it was originally native, but every old farm that has rhubarb, it's got  
**0:45:52-0:45:54:**  rhubarb forever.  
**0:45:54-0:45:59:**  It just keeps on thriving.  
**0:45:59-0:46:00:**  And our rhubarb didn't.  
**0:46:00-0:46:02:**  It never prospered.  
**0:46:02-0:46:04:**  It never grew well.  
**0:46:04-0:46:10:**  We think probably the soil there is just too dense, too heavy for it.  
**0:46:10-0:46:16:**  So we're going to try rhubarb again this spring, but in a different location.  
**0:46:16-0:46:24:**  Because once it's established, that's one of those perennial crops, it should last forever.  
**0:46:24-0:46:28:**  It seems to be a soil type differential, right?  
**0:46:28-0:46:33:**  It seems that our raspberries failed because they lost in competition to the weeds we didn't  
**0:46:33-0:46:37:**  get rid of before we planted, like I mentioned before.  
**0:46:37-0:46:41:**  But the blackberries didn't have that problem at all.  
**0:46:41-0:46:45:**  They're just fuller and thicker and more abundant every year.  
**0:46:45-0:46:48:**  So we're going to plant some more blackberries.  
**0:46:48-0:46:50:**  And adapt along the way.  
**0:46:50-0:46:53:**  Yeah, that's right.  
**0:46:53-0:46:57:**  And we're also going to change, we're going to try something we haven't tried before,  
**0:46:57-0:47:03:**  which is ornamental dogwood shrubs.  
**0:47:03-0:47:08:**  The twigs of which are colored bright red or bright yellow or orange.  
**0:47:08-0:47:15:**  And these can be harvested and sold to garden centers and decorative.  
**0:47:15-0:47:19:**  The twigs of those bushes grow up kind of like hands, right?  
**0:47:19-0:47:20:**  Like fingers.  
**0:47:20-0:47:26:**  And you can just cut them off into bunches.  
**0:47:26-0:47:29:**  And you can sell that to landscapers.  
**0:47:29-0:47:32:**  Nice.  
**0:47:32-0:47:34:**  Very interesting.  
**0:47:34-0:47:41:**  Any other big mistakes, things you would do differently, things you'd like to share?  
**0:47:41-0:47:42:**  Still curious to hear.  
**0:47:42-0:47:50:**  Well, I will just say that it helped us, it did help us a lot to have the Savannah Institute  
**0:47:50-0:47:56:**  or an organization nearby that had not only some information themselves, but they were  
**0:47:56-0:48:00:**  also a collective of other farmers, right?  
**0:48:00-0:48:04:**  That we could meet with or we could talk to or we could share with, you know, what we  
**0:48:04-0:48:05:**  were doing.  
**0:48:05-0:48:10:**  Like Redfern Farm and others, we would meet those people at gatherings.  
**0:48:10-0:48:17:**  And in a way also to be associated with an agricultural university.  
**0:48:17-0:48:23:**  Because it helps us to learn from those who come, even when they're doing different types  
**0:48:23-0:48:25:**  of experiments, right?  
**0:48:25-0:48:28:**  On different species or...  
**0:48:28-0:48:33:**  For instance, we planted 19 varieties of service berries, also called Juneberries.  
**0:48:33-0:48:38:**  And so one of the professors at the University of Illinois wanted to use that as one of her  
**0:48:38-0:48:44:**  experiments to see, you know, over time which ones grow the best and which ones don't.  
**0:48:44-0:48:48:**  And you can walk those rows and you can see now they're tall enough, you can see which  
**0:48:48-0:48:53:**  ones are bearing the most fruit and which varieties are not out of the 19.  
**0:48:53-0:49:01:**  So she's getting, she can have year after year after year longitudinal research there  
**0:49:01-0:49:04:**  based on the soil types that we have.  
**0:49:04-0:49:06:**  So that was a good thing.  
**0:49:06-0:49:13:**  It's been a good thing to be associated with an agricultural college.  
**0:49:13-0:49:16:**  The support of the Savannah Institute seems vital, huh?  
**0:49:16-0:49:23:**  And also going about the design and setting up this project from the start.  
**0:49:23-0:49:24:**  That's absolutely true.  
**0:49:24-0:49:32:**  Now going forward, the Savannah Institute's focus has been more in agroforestry, incorporating  
**0:49:32-0:49:37:**  trees into existing agricultural practices.  
**0:49:37-0:49:42:**  We are working with them on some research and demonstration projects, planting trees  
**0:49:42-0:49:48:**  in islands within the pasture or along the edges of the pasture.  
**0:49:48-0:49:56:**  And there we're very actively cooperating as partners where they've planted these trees  
**0:49:56-0:50:06:**  and are managing the process of watching this and comparing these various types and systems  
**0:50:06-0:50:14:**  and different types of protective tree tubes to see which ones are most effective and whether  
**0:50:14-0:50:22:**  different sizes of islands, whether trees planted as just sticks that should form their  
**0:50:22-0:50:27:**  own roots or already rooted seedlings is more productive.  
**0:50:27-0:50:33:**  You would guess that the rooted ones are, and they are, the non-root ones are cheaper,  
**0:50:33-0:50:36:**  but not as many of them make it.  
**0:50:36-0:50:44:**  We had a significant drought here this summer after many of these trees had been planted.  
**0:50:44-0:50:47:**  So they had a really rough year to get started.  
**0:50:47-0:50:52:**  You can't control the weather.  
**0:50:52-0:50:59:**  When we're all done here, hopefully we will have contributed to a more weather resistant  
**0:50:59-0:51:08:**  system and even on a micro scale to a more moderate system of weather with trees and  
**0:51:08-0:51:10:**  different things.  
**0:51:10-0:51:15:**  But the actual agroforestry projects, they're very new.  
**0:51:15-0:51:19:**  They just started in 2019.  
**0:51:19-0:51:22:**  So we're still assessing and measuring.  
**0:51:22-0:51:30:**  But with the Savannah Institute, we've hosted visit days for the public and interested neighbors  
**0:51:30-0:51:36:**  and farmers to come and walk through and learn about what we're doing here.  
**0:51:36-0:51:38:**  We don't have the answers yet.  
**0:51:38-0:51:40:**  We really don't have the answers to anything.  
**0:51:40-0:51:44:**  It's still very much a learning curve for us.  
**0:51:44-0:51:47:**  And it's been fun to have the chance to learn it.  
**0:51:47-0:51:53:**  But I will say, add to that, that other local farmers have come and have toured our property  
**0:51:53-0:51:58:**  and have then gone home and decided to do something different with their properties.  
**0:51:58-0:52:05:**  So whether it's adding a different type of crop, like a perennial crop or agroforestry  
**0:52:05-0:52:14:**  or building silvo pastures, trees added to pasture areas or planting along a stream bed,  
**0:52:14-0:52:19:**  because we've also done that, planting along a stream bed to hold the soil and prevent  
**0:52:19-0:52:22:**  soil erosion.  
**0:52:22-0:52:24:**  And so these farmers come and see that.  
**0:52:24-0:52:31:**  And then we know of at least two of them who came just this past summer and are now considering  
**0:52:31-0:52:38:**  doing some protective conservative agroforestry projects on their own properties.  
**0:52:38-0:52:40:**  That's fascinating.  
**0:52:40-0:52:43:**  That's really nice to be able to have that influence.  
**0:52:43-0:52:45:**  It's able to showcase.  
**0:52:45-0:52:50:**  And that's part of your objectives at the start, as you had mentioned.  
**0:52:50-0:52:51:**  That's exactly right.  
**0:52:51-0:52:57:**  I'm curious about the agroforestry because we talked a lot about your older system, your  
**0:52:57-0:52:58:**  polyculture.  
**0:52:58-0:53:00:**  And now from what I understand, you've got some younger systems.  
**0:53:00-0:53:06:**  So when you mentioned agroforestry around the pasture, could you explain to us a bit  
**0:53:06-0:53:09:**  more precisely, what does that mean?  
**0:53:09-0:53:12:**  What does it look like?  
**0:53:12-0:53:17:**  There are trees planted around the perimeter of one major pasture.  
**0:53:17-0:53:18:**  How big is the paddock?  
**0:53:18-0:53:20:**  It's been a pasture for a long time.  
**0:53:20-0:53:26:**  So trees all along the border, just outside the fence, planted in tubes.  
**0:53:26-0:53:33:**  So there's a row as far as you can see of tubes with the green leaves just beginning  
**0:53:33-0:53:35:**  to peek out of the top.  
**0:53:35-0:53:44:**  And then islands within the pasture, where small groups of trees to larger groups of  
**0:53:44-0:53:51:**  trees have been planted and fenced in to keep the cows out of them.  
**0:53:51-0:53:54:**  And the weeds in there have been killed.  
**0:53:54-0:54:00:**  And the trees each have a mat around them, a weed mat to help retain moisture and help  
**0:54:00-0:54:03:**  the young seedling get started.  
**0:54:03-0:54:12:**  So right now those look like pens of empty earth with tubes sticking out of them at various  
**0:54:12-0:54:15:**  places around in the middle of the pasture.  
**0:54:15-0:54:21:**  But when the trees have grown and the fence can be removed, these will provide shade for  
**0:54:21-0:54:23:**  the cattle.  
**0:54:23-0:54:28:**  And we know that cows prefer that if they can get some shape.  
**0:54:28-0:54:33:**  Where there are existing trees in the pasture, that's where you see the cows during the  
**0:54:33-0:54:36:**  summertime resting in the shade of those trees.  
**0:54:36-0:54:43:**  So instead of just having a big old empty grassland of pasture, we will eventually have  
**0:54:43-0:54:48:**  a beautiful grassland of pasture with islands of different kinds of trees within it, which  
**0:54:48-0:54:53:**  will be scenic to look at and beneficial to the cows.  
**0:54:53-0:54:58:**  And we'll be having varieties of trees that are always good.  
**0:54:58-0:54:59:**  Trees are always good.  
**0:54:59-0:55:03:**  I would say to anybody who's interested, plant trees.  
**0:55:03-0:55:06:**  I'm curious, what trees then?  
**0:55:06-0:55:12:**  For sure, but what trees have you decided to plant there in this pasture?  
**0:55:12-0:55:15:**  Again, fruit and nut trees or have you opted for?  
**0:55:15-0:55:23:**  No, it's native trees, a variety of trees planted in a different mosaic to see whether  
**0:55:23-0:55:31:**  they do better as single species within an island or a diverse group of species within  
**0:55:31-0:55:38:**  an island and which of those species do best planted out in the middle of a pasture.  
**0:55:38-0:55:40:**  They're deciduous hardwood.  
**0:55:40-0:55:42:**  Deciduous hardwood trees, yes.  
**0:55:42-0:55:51:**  Oak, maple, the trees that we have here, locust, willow, different trees.  
**0:55:51-0:55:52:**  Very interesting.  
**0:55:52-0:55:57:**  And that's in collaboration with the farmer that's got the cows, the tenors.  
**0:55:57-0:56:06:**  Yes, the farmer had to give up some pasture in order to plant these islands.  
**0:56:06-0:56:11:**  That was something we had to work out because when you look on a map, it looks like, oh  
**0:56:11-0:56:16:**  my gosh, all those islands, there isn't any grass left for the cows to eat.  
**0:56:16-0:56:20:**  It's very important for him to have pasture for the cows to eat.  
**0:56:20-0:56:26:**  But actually in measurement, it wasn't as significant an amount of acreage as it looks  
**0:56:26-0:56:27:**  like.  
**0:56:27-0:56:34:**  And, you know, we had to reduce our pasture rent for those islands that his cows couldn't  
**0:56:34-0:56:36:**  graze any longer.  
**0:56:36-0:56:46:**  And we're looking for nearby pasture to make available to him so that he hasn't lost what  
**0:56:46-0:56:48:**  he had before.  
**0:56:48-0:56:54:**  For every acre of pasture that he can't have, he loses a cow or two that he can have.  
**0:56:54-0:56:57:**  So that's his interest.  
**0:56:57-0:57:02:**  So we couldn't do that as extensively as we might have wanted, but we did it nonetheless  
**0:57:02-0:57:06:**  in a practical, realistic situation.  
**0:57:06-0:57:08:**  And we'll see how that works.  
**0:57:08-0:57:11:**  I think we took like a 30 acre pasture.  
**0:57:11-0:57:17:**  And with all the tree plantings that were fenced, that added up to about five acres.  
**0:57:17-0:57:25:**  So out of a 30 acre pasture, five acres came out for us to plant trees and to start this.  
**0:57:25-0:57:31:**  So he had to end his, I think he said with his current beef, he has a cow calf operation  
**0:57:31-0:57:37:**  that taking out five acres means five cows have to go.  
**0:57:37-0:57:40:**  So the grass can support five fewer cows.  
**0:57:40-0:57:45:**  So that's his cost to this.  
**0:57:45-0:57:50:**  And he makes that up because he doesn't pay for the five acres in rent to us.  
**0:57:50-0:57:57:**  So that's just how the economics and the production goes with that.  
**0:57:57-0:58:02:**  I'm curious about how does he feel about all of this tree planting?  
**0:58:02-0:58:09:**  And he or she, I don't know who makes the decisions there.  
**0:58:09-0:58:16:**  We have three generations, as we mentioned, and the youngest member seems rather agreeable  
**0:58:16-0:58:18:**  to all of this.  
**0:58:18-0:58:19:**  Almost intrigued.  
**0:58:19-0:58:26:**  The middle generation was not too keen on losing any pasture at all.  
**0:58:26-0:58:33:**  So we modified our plan, made it more palatable for him.  
**0:58:33-0:58:42:**  And I think we're in good shape there, but it remains to be seen when those trees are  
**0:58:42-0:58:49:**  large enough that the cows can start getting shade from them, which he'll like, we'll all  
**0:58:49-0:58:50:**  like.  
**0:58:50-0:58:53:**  But this is part of the planning.  
**0:58:53-0:58:57:**  And other things we accommodate them on as well.  
**0:58:57-0:58:58:**  And that's the give and take.  
**0:58:58-0:59:04:**  For instance, he wanted to take another piece of property and fence it in and it was just  
**0:59:04-0:59:05:**  open property.  
**0:59:05-0:59:10:**  And he wanted to create a field for a pasture field.  
**0:59:10-0:59:11:**  And we said, well, that's OK then.  
**0:59:11-0:59:13:**  That was sort of the give and take.  
**0:59:13-0:59:18:**  We have other pasture land and if they want to put a little pathway through there for  
**0:59:18-0:59:22:**  their vehicles, we said, OK, you can put a pathway through there.  
**0:59:22-0:59:29:**  So there's different things that you give and take on related, but not specifically  
**0:59:29-0:59:34:**  on that one pasture where we're doing the silvo tree planting.  
**0:59:34-0:59:35:**  OK.  
**0:59:35-0:59:36:**  Very nice.  
**0:59:36-0:59:43:**  And so are there any other systems that you're hiding from me, agroforestry plantations,  
**0:59:43-0:59:45:**  that you'd like to share with us?  
**0:59:45-0:59:52:**  Because we talked about the polyculture, we talked about the silvo pasture plantings.  
**0:59:52-0:59:53:**  What about the row crops?  
**0:59:53-0:59:57:**  Have you managed to convince your tenant to...  
**0:59:57-0:59:59:**  No, we haven't done that.  
**0:59:59-1:00:01:**  We have not done that.  
**1:00:01-1:00:07:**  That's a long term prospect.  
**1:00:07-1:00:14:**  Our farm tenant would like to have more acres to plant and psychologically taking any of  
**1:00:14-1:00:23:**  it away from him to try out rows of trees within the field is not something we're all  
**1:00:23-1:00:26:**  prepared to address just yet.  
**1:00:26-1:00:33:**  If we can locate some other acres for him to rent and plant on, then we could move ahead  
**1:00:33-1:00:38:**  with planting some rows of trees within the existing fields.  
**1:00:38-1:00:45:**  But we've held off on that just because we want to maintain a terrific relationship with  
**1:00:45-1:00:46:**  him.  
**1:00:46-1:00:47:**  That's a priority.  
**1:00:47-1:00:49:**  That is definitely the priority.  
**1:00:49-1:00:56:**  Because we could move a lot faster on planting every sort of agroforestry project conceivable  
**1:00:56-1:00:58:**  to man.  
**1:00:58-1:01:05:**  But the practical issue is the farmer still has to make a living off of what is there.  
**1:01:05-1:01:08:**  And we have to get along, all of us.  
**1:01:08-1:01:11:**  So the human factor is important too.  
**1:01:11-1:01:15:**  Yes, it seems very important.  
**1:01:15-1:01:21:**  We haven't mentioned it much, Dimitri, but we also did plant, as Sandy referenced, a  
**1:01:21-1:01:28:**  riparian buffer zone, which is some of the acres that came out of the pasture.  
**1:01:28-1:01:35:**  So we could protect a little creek that flows through there and demonstrate it to people.  
**1:01:35-1:01:41:**  When those plants have all established themselves, well then the cows can be allowed back in.  
**1:01:41-1:01:48:**  But when these trees are just seedlings or knee high, the cows would trample them and  
**1:01:48-1:01:50:**  chew them down to the ground.  
**1:01:50-1:01:53:**  So that's another long term.  
**1:01:53-1:01:54:**  We've done that.  
**1:01:54-1:01:56:**  That's there.  
**1:01:56-1:02:01:**  Right now I mow that to keep the weeds down between the rows of trees.  
**1:02:01-1:02:06:**  But in time that'll be established with various native trees and shrubs.  
**1:02:06-1:02:09:**  And we're really just in year one of that.  
**1:02:09-1:02:15:**  So over time we've done different things.  
**1:02:15-1:02:20:**  With this long term goal of conservation, how do you conserve the soil and not have  
**1:02:20-1:02:21:**  runoff down the creek?  
**1:02:21-1:02:25:**  Well, let's do a riparian buffer.  
**1:02:25-1:02:27:**  Let's plant it wisely.  
**1:02:27-1:02:33:**  Let's plant it smartly and let's look at how muddy the creek is with field runoff two years  
**1:02:33-1:02:38:**  ago versus next year and the years going forward.  
**1:02:38-1:02:46:**  So everything works hopefully to the advantage of conservation and maintaining and managing  
**1:02:46-1:02:50:**  a really good overall ecosystem.  
**1:02:50-1:02:51:**  Makes sense.  
**1:02:51-1:02:57:**  And I'm sure that's also something that as it visually expresses itself, your tenant  
**1:02:57-1:03:03:**  farmer will also surely develop or could develop a sensitivity to seeing it work and being  
**1:03:03-1:03:07:**  like, oh, wow, look, we're not losing so much soil here.  
**1:03:07-1:03:12:**  Well and also and the grass that does grow for the cattle is better quality grass.  
**1:03:12-1:03:17:**  See because those trees sink carbon right down into the soil all the time.  
**1:03:17-1:03:22:**  And that spreads, right, so that the ultimate grass that's coming up around the trees and  
**1:03:22-1:03:27:**  the whole pasture improves the soil quality and therefore improves the grass that the  
**1:03:27-1:03:30:**  cattle can feed off of.  
**1:03:30-1:03:31:**  So that benefits him.  
**1:03:31-1:03:37:**  The other thing that has been helpful for our overall relationship with the farmer is  
**1:03:37-1:03:43:**  when we've had visitor days, open to the public visitor days, and he sees other people come  
**1:03:43-1:03:50:**  and he sees, you know, those the dad and son see other farmers come look at what's happening  
**1:03:50-1:03:51:**  here.  
**1:03:51-1:03:56:**  And I think over time that sort of changed their minds a little bit.  
**1:03:56-1:03:59:**  You know, they could have thought we were nuts in the beginning, you know, six years  
**1:03:59-1:04:00:**  ago.  
**1:04:00-1:04:05:**  And well, Scott and Sandy Williams want to go do this, I guess, you know, they're the  
**1:04:05-1:04:07:**  owners, I guess we got to let them do it.  
**1:04:07-1:04:15:**  And we really don't, you know, and there could be lots of comments and opinions in the community.  
**1:04:15-1:04:23:**  But I think over time, as our farmers see visitors come and do some of these experiments,  
**1:04:23-1:04:27:**  and they see us out there all the time harvesting, right?  
**1:04:27-1:04:30:**  And then they see the public come visit.  
**1:04:30-1:04:33:**  And they really see the public come visit, right?  
**1:04:33-1:04:36:**  And walk these places and walk these roads.  
**1:04:36-1:04:42:**  And they realize that there is there isn't a community interest in in doing things a  
**1:04:42-1:04:43:**  little bit differently.  
**1:04:43-1:04:45:**  And I think that's helped.  
**1:04:45-1:04:53:**  They're becoming people ask them questions now, you know, in the local in the in town,  
**1:04:53-1:04:58:**  what's going on and they and they can, our farm operators can explain what's going on.  
**1:04:58-1:04:59:**  Hmm.  
**1:04:59-1:05:03:**  And there's a whole social adventure happening here as well.  
**1:05:03-1:05:05:**  Yeah, that's, that's kind of true.  
**1:05:05-1:05:12:**  And I would stress again, we were very, very lucky because our farm family was never opposed  
**1:05:12-1:05:13:**  to this.  
**1:05:13-1:05:17:**  They might not have been as excited about it as we were.  
**1:05:17-1:05:18:**  But there was never opposition.  
**1:05:18-1:05:25:**  And we started with them from the very beginning, selecting which 17 acres to take out of their  
**1:05:25-1:05:31:**  production and establish the perennial woody polyculture area on.  
**1:05:31-1:05:36:**  That was in advice, you know, in cooperation with with them.  
**1:05:36-1:05:42:**  I think they have been intrigued as we have to see how it is all working out.  
**1:05:42-1:05:46:**  But from the beginning, it's been a grand experiment.  
**1:05:46-1:05:50:**  And we're, I would stress over and over, we're very fortunate.  
**1:05:50-1:05:55:**  We were never, they were never opposing any of this.  
**1:05:55-1:05:57:**  It was always cooperative from the very beginning.  
**1:05:57-1:06:03:**  And I think as Sandy says, we've all enjoyed seeing the response from other people.  
**1:06:03-1:06:05:**  Hmm.  
**1:06:05-1:06:08:**  That's very, very interesting.  
**1:06:08-1:06:11:**  And the inspiration that it's creating as well.  
**1:06:11-1:06:15:**  And I'm curious what feedback other farmers that are coming to visit you are giving.  
**1:06:15-1:06:22:**  Well, all we know is that two of the farmers who visited on the public days, they're doing  
**1:06:22-1:06:30:**  something actively now with the Savannah Institute to do some agroforestry on their properties.  
**1:06:30-1:06:34:**  So we don't know what exactly they're going to do.  
**1:06:34-1:06:38:**  And you don't just drive in and say, hey, what are you doing here?  
**1:06:38-1:06:41:**  But that's as positive a feedback as there could possibly be.  
**1:06:41-1:06:42:**  Yeah.  
**1:06:42-1:06:44:**  Yeah, that's terrific.  
**1:06:44-1:06:45:**  Indeed.  
**1:06:45-1:06:49:**  And do you know which kind of systems they're implementing?  
**1:06:49-1:06:51:**  No, we don't know.  
**1:06:51-1:06:56:**  We only recently learned that the two of them are doing projects on their own property now.  
**1:06:56-1:06:57:**  So.  
**1:06:57-1:06:58:**  Hmm.  
**1:06:58-1:06:59:**  Okay.  
**1:06:59-1:07:03:**  And I'm curious, what about the, sorry, Sandy, I cut you there.  
**1:07:03-1:07:05:**  No, you didn't cut us off.  
**1:07:05-1:07:07:**  We cut you off.  
**1:07:07-1:07:16:**  We're also adding in this perennial woody polyculture area, a couple of plots of prairie  
**1:07:16-1:07:19:**  pollinator, grassland habitat.  
**1:07:19-1:07:28:**  There are in one place where it's pretty rocky and the things we had planted there weren't  
**1:07:28-1:07:30:**  doing so well.  
**1:07:30-1:07:34:**  We're going to let the native vegetation take that over.  
**1:07:34-1:07:36:**  And that's going to get planted in the spring.  
**1:07:36-1:07:45:**  But that isn't exactly agroforestry, but it's contributing again to the ecological diversity  
**1:07:45-1:07:47:**  there.  
**1:07:47-1:07:56:**  And we may plant within that grassland a few trees here and there to establish a savannah,  
**1:07:56-1:08:00:**  which is what the Savannah Institute is named after.  
**1:08:00-1:08:05:**  A savannah is basically a prairie with some trees.  
**1:08:05-1:08:06:**  So we'll be doing that as well.  
**1:08:06-1:08:10:**  But no, Dimitri, we're not keeping any secrets from you.  
**1:08:10-1:08:15:**  There's nothing we can admit intentionally.  
**1:08:15-1:08:16:**  I'm just too nosy.  
**1:08:16-1:08:17:**  It's OK.  
**1:08:17-1:08:19:**  We're all here to learn together.  
**1:08:19-1:08:28:**  This has been fun for us to implement and learn from mostly because we're learning.  
**1:08:28-1:08:29:**  We don't have the answers.  
**1:08:29-1:08:35:**  Like I said, we're engaged in the questioning process, but we're actually trying it.  
**1:08:35-1:08:41:**  We're planting things and getting our fingers dirty and learning.  
**1:08:41-1:08:45:**  If I can allow myself to say, you're learning on quite a big scale.  
**1:08:45-1:08:51:**  It's not small to plant 17 acres and surely probably thousands or tens of thousands of  
**1:08:51-1:08:53:**  different trees and shrubs and etc.  
**1:08:53-1:09:00:**  So it's really admirable to be wanting to learn and get your hands dirty on such a scale.  
**1:09:00-1:09:02:**  And so that so many people can learn from this.  
**1:09:02-1:09:04:**  And I really admire that.  
**1:09:04-1:09:11:**  It's quite possible that had we known in advance how large a scale it was, we might have done  
**1:09:11-1:09:15:**  a little less initially.  
**1:09:15-1:09:23:**  It's a very good thing that we're both retired now from our other jobs because if we weren't,  
**1:09:23-1:09:25:**  nothing would be getting picked.  
**1:09:25-1:09:27:**  So yeah, that's also true.  
**1:09:27-1:09:29:**  Come out and pick sometime, Dimitri.  
**1:09:29-1:09:30:**  Yeah.  
**1:09:30-1:09:34:**  Well, you know, listen, if I am ever in the United States and I really would like to go  
**1:09:34-1:09:38:**  soon because we're interviewing so many farmers there.  
**1:09:38-1:09:42:**  Maybe more than half of our listener base comes from the United States.  
**1:09:42-1:09:43:**  Okay.  
**1:09:43-1:09:44:**  Or just about half.  
**1:09:44-1:09:45:**  Plan a trip.  
**1:09:45-1:09:46:**  Plan a visit.  
**1:09:46-1:09:47:**  Yeah, for sure.  
**1:09:47-1:09:48:**  I appreciate that.  
**1:09:48-1:09:52:**  And I wanted to ask you one last question.  
**1:09:52-1:09:54:**  What about other landowners?  
**1:09:54-1:09:59:**  I mean, you're in a unique position as landowners that have this conservation objective in mind  
**1:09:59-1:10:04:**  and they're ready to make a compromise on the income that you're generating in order  
**1:10:04-1:10:09:**  for, you know, on the amount of rent that you're taking off of the land in order to  
**1:10:09-1:10:11:**  satisfy conservation objectives.  
**1:10:11-1:10:17:**  So you've developed an amazing sensitivity here and an amazing objective.  
**1:10:17-1:10:20:**  What about other landowners maybe that you know of that are your friends?  
**1:10:20-1:10:21:**  What do they think of your work?  
**1:10:21-1:10:27:**  Do they, are they inspired by it or do they just try to ignore it and not look too much?  
**1:10:27-1:10:28:**  Oh, they don't ignore it, Dimitri.  
**1:10:28-1:10:34:**  I would say without exaggerating that they are inspired by it.  
**1:10:34-1:10:41:**  Maybe not to the point of doing it themselves, but this sort of, this sort of mindset is  
**1:10:41-1:10:43:**  growing like crazy.  
**1:10:43-1:10:51:**  I imagine worldwide, but certainly in this country and everybody's intrigued by anything  
**1:10:51-1:10:59:**  that has echo in front of it or green in front of it, you know, or climate mediation in front  
**1:10:59-1:11:00:**  of it.  
**1:11:00-1:11:05:**  And so their, their eyes are open, but they don't understand what any of it means.  
**1:11:05-1:11:10:**  So when they can come and see what we've got or talk to us about what we're doing, well,  
**1:11:10-1:11:13:**  they think we're, they think we're grand and noble pioneers.  
**1:11:13-1:11:17:**  They think we're pioneers in environmental safety.  
**1:11:17-1:11:18:**  They think it's exciting.  
**1:11:18-1:11:21:**  Resuscitation and all that stuff.  
**1:11:21-1:11:22:**  Wow.  
**1:11:22-1:11:24:**  Well, you are kind of pioneers.  
**1:11:24-1:11:27:**  I mean, you may not think of yourselves as that, but not many people are doing what you're  
**1:11:27-1:11:31:**  doing in your region.  
**1:11:31-1:11:32:**  Well that's true.  
**1:11:32-1:11:33:**  We're one of, yeah, that's true.  
**1:11:33-1:11:37:**  I don't know of any other farm in our state that's doing it.  
**1:11:37-1:11:43:**  That is maybe the definition of a pioneer.  
**1:11:43-1:11:44:**  That's amazing.  
**1:11:44-1:11:45:**  That's great to hear.  
**1:11:45-1:11:51:**  Yeah, I think it's fascinating for our listeners to hear this story.  
**1:11:51-1:11:55:**  And as we said at the beginning, you know, you mentioned, you know, we're not farmers,  
**1:11:55-1:12:00:**  we're landowners that are engaging in different projects, but this is really, this is part  
**1:12:00-1:12:03:**  of the agricultural system.  
**1:12:03-1:12:07:**  Everywhere we have landowners and farmers, young farmers, old farmers, there's a big  
**1:12:07-1:12:13:**  system there, agricultural system and being able to inspire other landowners to lead the  
**1:12:13-1:12:20:**  way like you have is going to be part of this solution to create an agriculture that can  
**1:12:20-1:12:26:**  also be regenerative or conservational towards, you know, that can conserve our ecosystems  
**1:12:26-1:12:29:**  and last in time.  
**1:12:29-1:12:32:**  So that's what they mean by sustainable, Dimitri.  
**1:12:32-1:12:33:**  That's exactly right.  
**1:12:33-1:12:34:**  And you're right.  
**1:12:34-1:12:38:**  It is a system wide and a community wide system.  
**1:12:38-1:12:41:**  Very, very, very true.  
**1:12:41-1:12:43:**  That's what we believe.  
**1:12:43-1:12:47:**  I should tell a story about the restaurant.  
**1:12:47-1:12:49:**  Oh, yeah.  
**1:12:49-1:12:55:**  We had extra, this is, this was a, we've been selling our produce to a couple of chefs and  
**1:12:55-1:12:59:**  we had so much produce this year that our chef was overwhelmed, right?  
**1:12:59-1:13:02:**  He couldn't even freeze all the blackberries.  
**1:13:02-1:13:07:**  So, so there's a local little restaurant in our town in Illinois and this lady started  
**1:13:07-1:13:15:**  a shop that just, it makes desserts and sells them with drinks, meaning a dessert might  
**1:13:15-1:13:24:**  be a chocolate mousse cake and she'd sell that with a, with a spiked coffee, right?  
**1:13:24-1:13:31:**  So coffee and Bailey's Irish cream or coffee and scotch, or she'd make a key lime pie and  
**1:13:31-1:13:33:**  sell that with margaritas.  
**1:13:33-1:13:36:**  So that's the theme for her little restaurant.  
**1:13:36-1:13:38:**  So she also has two women who own it.  
**1:13:38-1:13:40:**  They also have sandwiches and stuff.  
**1:13:40-1:13:45:**  So I just walked in there one day cause we had extra Juneberries and I said, you know,  
**1:13:45-1:13:47:**  would you, are you interested?  
**1:13:47-1:13:49:**  Would you be interested in some direct from the farm?  
**1:13:49-1:13:53:**  Well, she was, and she took those Juneberries.  
**1:13:53-1:13:59:**  And so over time she has, she has taken an awful lot of blackberries.  
**1:13:59-1:14:01:**  She's taken hazelnuts.  
**1:14:01-1:14:08:**  She's taken pumpkins and she's made pumpkin pie, pumpkin soups.  
**1:14:08-1:14:13:**  She took the Juneberries and she made them into some sort of like cobbler and she sold  
**1:14:13-1:14:18:**  that in town at a, at an open house, you know, community fair.  
**1:14:18-1:14:22:**  And people were telling her they couldn't believe how well, how good they tasted and  
**1:14:22-1:14:25:**  they couldn't come from a farm because there's no farms around here.  
**1:14:25-1:14:27:**  And she said, no, they do come from a farm.  
**1:14:27-1:14:29:**  I know the farm owner.  
**1:14:29-1:14:36:**  So she's getting marketing and positive feedback out of the fact that she's making her desserts  
**1:14:36-1:14:38:**  with our produce.  
**1:14:38-1:14:44:**  So she's made pumpkin cream pie and pumpkin soup and she's made, she's taken our hazelnuts  
**1:14:44-1:14:48:**  and infused it into her vodka.  
**1:14:48-1:14:51:**  And she told me that that was extremely popular.  
**1:14:51-1:15:00:**  So now she can serve hazelnut infused vodka in her, in her restaurant bar area, along  
**1:15:00-1:15:02:**  with any sort of dessert that she makes.  
**1:15:02-1:15:09:**  So it's, it's catching on and it's fascinated me because she took all the pumpkins we could,  
**1:15:09-1:15:13:**  we could send her and we, we bought baking pumpkins.  
**1:15:13-1:15:14:**  Right.  
**1:15:14-1:15:17:**  And so, or that's what we grew, baking pumpkins.  
**1:15:17-1:15:21:**  And she said to me one day, she said, well, I have these two chefs.  
**1:15:21-1:15:23:**  They'll do whatever we want with pumpkins.  
**1:15:23-1:15:24:**  They just love them.  
**1:15:24-1:15:27:**  And you know, to cook with from a raw pumpkin is not an easy task.  
**1:15:27-1:15:29:**  That's a lot of, a lot of chef work.  
**1:15:29-1:15:34:**  A lot of cooking and baking work goes into that, but it's been so successful for her  
**1:15:34-1:15:37:**  from a, from a marketing standpoint, right?  
**1:15:37-1:15:43:**  From just a community footprint standpoint for her that she's, she's happily taken.  
**1:15:43-1:15:45:**  She's taken frozen berries now.  
**1:15:45-1:15:46:**  Hmm.  
**1:15:46-1:15:48:**  Amazing.  
**1:15:48-1:15:49:**  That's such an inspiring story.  
**1:15:49-1:15:50:**  Yeah.  
**1:15:50-1:15:53:**  You can do the same thing with your pomegranates.  
**1:15:53-1:15:54:**  Yeah.  
**1:15:54-1:15:58:**  Well, they're going to start, we didn't plant any berries, et cetera.  
**1:15:58-1:16:01:**  We've got our first prickly pears to sell, but the problem is that they're extremely  
**1:16:01-1:16:02:**  prickly.  
**1:16:02-1:16:10:**  So they're not, it's a, it's a kind of a bittersweet thing to offer to somebody unless you process  
**1:16:10-1:16:15:**  it yourself, but we're trying out different products now and, and we'll be going also  
**1:16:15-1:16:18:**  to, we're trying to find out where we can sell some of our products.  
**1:16:18-1:16:22:**  A lot of them go to the community we have back in France.  
**1:16:22-1:16:26:**  Um, and, um, because we've got, we lived there for many years, so we've got a lot of friends  
**1:16:26-1:16:28:**  and friends of friends, et cetera.  
**1:16:28-1:16:32:**  But, um, yeah, that's a good for you.  
**1:16:32-1:16:33:**  It's good.  
**1:16:33-1:16:34:**  We're in a similar process.  
**1:16:34-1:16:35:**  Yes, we are.  
**1:16:35-1:16:37:**  We're growing and learning.  
**1:16:37-1:16:38:**  That's exactly right.  
**1:16:38-1:16:40:**  Maybe that could be our motto.  
**1:16:40-1:16:41:**  Very nice.  
**1:16:41-1:16:42:**  Okay.  
**1:16:42-1:16:46:**  Scott and Sandy.  
**1:16:46-1:16:52:**  Thank you so much for coming on and for talking about your fascinating experience.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 17:34:36)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:47:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:52:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we interviewed a special guest and that's Darren Dougherty.  
**0:00:52-0:00:59:**  For many of you he will not need an introduction but for others, Darren is a leading consultant  
**0:00:59-0:01:04:**  and designer in regenerative agriculture working on thousands of projects around the world,  
**0:01:04-0:01:10:**  currently leading the way with the Rigrarians platform and his Rex trainings which we'll  
**0:01:10-0:01:13:**  talk about in this interview.  
**0:01:13-0:01:20:**  Darren has had an extraordinary experience working on many, many different projects,  
**0:01:20-0:01:26:**  many different pieces of land, on many different contexts all around the world, designing,  
**0:01:26-0:01:27:**  planning and etc.  
**0:01:27-0:01:32:**  And so his opinion about trees on landscapes and agroforestry is really important to us  
**0:01:32-0:01:38:**  in order to understand a bit better how we can make it work, where did it work, where  
**0:01:38-0:01:45:**  not and what it takes for a farm to implement these types of systems successfully.  
**0:01:45-0:01:51:**  This episode has a special focus on education, training and planning as well as quite a lot  
**0:01:51-0:01:52:**  of psychology in it.  
**0:01:52-0:01:58:**  We don't focus so much on the technical agronomy but it's very important for us to deal with  
**0:01:58-0:02:04:**  these bigger picture issues and some of the context that goes around planting trees because  
**0:02:04-0:02:05:**  they're really important.  
**0:02:05-0:02:07:**  So we hope you enjoy.  
**0:02:07-0:02:12:**  So yeah, I thought that we usually start like this with our guests.  
**0:02:12-0:02:18:**  If you could give us a little intro as to how you got into agriculture and how you got  
**0:02:18-0:02:21:**  started on this path really.  
**0:02:21-0:02:26:**  With a bit towards how I got into agroforestry as well?  
**0:02:26-0:02:30:**  I think general agriculture to start off with and then we'll little by little head into  
**0:02:30-0:02:32:**  the forestry layer of...  
**0:02:32-0:02:33:**  Yeah, cool.  
**0:02:33-0:02:38:**  Because I started, I probably started with forestry before I started with agriculture.  
**0:02:38-0:02:39:**  So...  
**0:02:39-0:02:41:**  No, start there then, perfect.  
**0:02:41-0:02:48:**  You know, I don't see much of a difference between agriculture and agroforestry.  
**0:02:48-0:02:54:**  In fact, my sort of vision of agriculture is agroforestry that the two have to go together.  
**0:02:54-0:03:00:**  And that's really born out of some of my earliest memories growing up on my grandparents farm  
**0:03:00-0:03:06:**  because my dad was killed in Vietnam when I was a baby in the war there.  
**0:03:06-0:03:13:**  I was only just four months old and my mum was very young and we were already living  
**0:03:13-0:03:19:**  at my grandparents farm, so my maternal grandparents.  
**0:03:19-0:03:23:**  So that was a very mixed farm.  
**0:03:23-0:03:29:**  Not classic I suppose for Australia because a lot of Australian farms are, well they're  
**0:03:29-0:03:30:**  mixed.  
**0:03:30-0:03:34:**  Like when you say a mixed farm in Australia, it means you grow wheat and you grow sheep.  
**0:03:34-0:03:41:**  Or you grow a cereal crop and you grow cattle, which we did, but we also had a lot of forests.  
**0:03:41-0:03:43:**  My grandfather grew up in the Depression.  
**0:03:43-0:03:54:**  He was born in 1915 and before he went to college per se, he, during the Depression  
**0:03:54-0:03:59:**  as sort of like a 15, 16 year old, there was no jobs.  
**0:03:59-0:04:00:**  He couldn't afford school or whatever.  
**0:04:00-0:04:04:**  So he cut wood and he cut forests and did that.  
**0:04:04-0:04:07:**  And I've got some great photos of him when he was about 19.  
**0:04:07-0:04:12:**  He was really ripped because they just used saws and axes back then.  
**0:04:12-0:04:13:**  Old school, yeah.  
**0:04:13-0:04:15:**  I've never been as ripped as he was.  
**0:04:15-0:04:24:**  But anyway, he, so at our farm we had four blocks of forest on the farm.  
**0:04:24-0:04:29:**  One was a plantation that we put in.  
**0:04:29-0:04:32:**  One was, which was a eucalypt plantation.  
**0:04:32-0:04:38:**  Another lot that we, the other three lots were all regrowth, which were a coppice and  
**0:04:38-0:04:41:**  standards sort of set up.  
**0:04:41-0:04:49:**  And I remember spending a lot of time going out there when I was, you know, as small as  
**0:04:49-0:04:55:**  you could be to hold an axe, which is in our case probably four or five, and going out  
**0:04:55-0:04:58:**  there and thinning trees.  
**0:04:58-0:05:02:**  You know, whether it's just a bit of a, you know, a little coppice coming up in the paddock  
**0:05:02-0:05:08:**  of the eucalyptus, stray eucalyptus growing in the paddock or in a case here or whatever.  
**0:05:08-0:05:14:**  And then progressing to, you know, stuff when I was 14, 15, 16, a bit big, you know, a lot  
**0:05:14-0:05:15:**  bigger.  
**0:05:15-0:05:19:**  But the other thing which I pride myself on even today is I split a lot of wood for my  
**0:05:19-0:05:20:**  Nana.  
**0:05:20-0:05:26:**  So we had a wood stove in the house and it was always on, didn't matter how hot it was,  
**0:05:26-0:05:31:**  it was on and we always had a soup on the stove and all of that.  
**0:05:31-0:05:40:**  So one of my biggest things that I enjoyed as a young person was cutting wood and splitting  
**0:05:40-0:05:45:**  it and making the perfect stack and my Nana coming out and patting me on the head, you  
**0:05:45-0:05:47:**  know, all that sort of thing.  
**0:05:47-0:05:55:**  You know, it was sort of probably my first OCD moment where you've got the, you know,  
**0:05:55-0:05:59:**  I still do that today, I love winter, I love splitting wood.  
**0:05:59-0:06:00:**  I'm really good at it.  
**0:06:00-0:06:04:**  It's one of the things that I'm actually best at, is splitting wood.  
**0:06:04-0:06:09:**  Really not designing farms, splitting wood, splitting wood, you know, cold, Darren to  
**0:06:09-0:06:13:**  split your word at your home is very efficient and it does a very nice stack.  
**0:06:13-0:06:15:**  I do fantastic kindling.  
**0:06:15-0:06:20:**  I like, you know, I can split an inch wide.  
**0:06:20-0:06:23:**  So there's an inch piece I can split in the middle of that.  
**0:06:23-0:06:27:**  So bloody good I am, but anyway, no one gets to see it.  
**0:06:27-0:06:28:**  It's just me.  
**0:06:28-0:06:30:**  So you'll just have to work for it.  
**0:06:30-0:06:37:**  Now I've got a very nice Austrian splitting axe and yeah, I'm pretty into all that, but  
**0:06:37-0:06:39:**  that's my little sideline.  
**0:06:39-0:06:40:**  That's the forester inside you.  
**0:06:40-0:06:42:**  Yeah, that's, well, yeah, maybe.  
**0:06:42-0:06:43:**  Yeah.  
**0:06:43-0:06:45:**  But I love doing all of that sort of thing.  
**0:06:45-0:06:51:**  And it was great because it was free, you know, coppers timber that just keeps growing  
**0:06:51-0:06:58:**  back and often when I talk about the forestry layer now as a farm planner agroforestor,  
**0:06:58-0:07:04:**  so you know, make the cop that we should be making the coppers economy really central  
**0:07:04-0:07:05:**  to what we do.  
**0:07:05-0:07:09:**  Cause I see that coppers is such a brilliant thing.  
**0:07:09-0:07:14:**  How good is it that you can chop something down, use it.  
**0:07:14-0:07:20:**  It sucks more carbon down than what you would use in burning it when it regrows and it great  
**0:07:20-0:07:21:**  regrows for nothing.  
**0:07:21-0:07:25:**  And it's like, okay, don't have to plant a thing again.  
**0:07:25-0:07:27:**  It's you don't have to do all of that.  
**0:07:27-0:07:31:**  So it's just like, it can go forever.  
**0:07:31-0:07:32:**  Which is awesome.  
**0:07:32-0:07:34:**  So yeah, that's fantastic.  
**0:07:34-0:07:39:**  So there's a lot of, there's a lot that goes in for that for me in the way that I think  
**0:07:39-0:07:42:**  and yeah, there's a lot.  
**0:07:42-0:07:48:**  I like, I like the perpetuality of things and that's really built out of that time as  
**0:07:48-0:07:53:**  a young fella, as a, you know, my formative years.  
**0:07:53-0:07:59:**  And how did you, I mean, at the moment, what is your activity?  
**0:07:59-0:08:04:**  Like what, what, what are you doing at the moment on in this agricultural space?  
**0:08:04-0:08:05:**  What's your role?  
**0:08:05-0:08:14:**  So 30 years after, well 32 years this year, after shifting into the organics movement,  
**0:08:14-0:08:20:**  I was, I left school, traveled, got into hospitality.  
**0:08:20-0:08:26:**  And then after doing that for four or five years, I started managing an organic store,  
**0:08:26-0:08:30:**  organic food store that was in 1989.  
**0:08:30-0:08:34:**  And I then ran that for a couple of years.  
**0:08:34-0:08:43:**  And then in 1993, I started our farm planning consultancy, which I've been doing since 1993.  
**0:08:43-0:08:55:**  And so where I'm at now after doing however many thousands of farm plans and teaching  
**0:08:55-0:09:04:**  tens of thousands of people farm planning of various different guises, I now run a,  
**0:09:04-0:09:09:**  with my friend and colleague Georgie Pavlov, the Rigurians workplace.  
**0:09:09-0:09:15:**  And that's a sort of a, that's a digital platform that we opened in 2017.  
**0:09:15-0:09:24:**  And we really facilitate conversations and facilitate learning and professional development  
**0:09:24-0:09:29:**  between, well between producers around the world.  
**0:09:29-0:09:35:**  We've got about 75 different countries and about 3000 people that we work with.  
**0:09:35-0:09:37:**  And that's growing all the time.  
**0:09:37-0:09:43:**  So as you would know, Dimitri, we were talking before we started, that's a really quality  
**0:09:43-0:09:47:**  space and people come there for professional development.  
**0:09:47-0:09:54:**  And that's awesome that we can link, you know, a grazier in Somaliland with one in Russia,  
**0:09:54-0:09:57:**  with one in India, with one in South America and so on.  
**0:09:57-0:09:58:**  You know, it's just an amazing thing.  
**0:09:58-0:10:05:**  So we, a lot of what I do is about joining people together who otherwise, so I watch  
**0:10:05-0:10:13:**  all the conversations and I go, ah, you need to talk with this person.  
**0:10:13-0:10:18:**  I can't recommend this enough to our listeners because I've just joined the Rigurians platform  
**0:10:18-0:10:23:**  maybe a month ago and the quality of information on there is fantastic.  
**0:10:23-0:10:29:**  I mean, lots of very professional farmers and practitioners, consultants sharing on  
**0:10:29-0:10:33:**  in depth topics from, you know, soil fertility all the way to water management.  
**0:10:33-0:10:35:**  I've been really impressed.  
**0:10:35-0:10:38:**  So I recommend the listeners to check it out.  
**0:10:38-0:10:39:**  Thank you.  
**0:10:39-0:10:41:**  Yeah, it's been great.  
**0:10:41-0:10:43:**  And it's also, it's all based on the Rigurians platform.  
**0:10:43-0:10:48:**  So the workplace is, the Rigurians workplace is our digital platform.  
**0:10:48-0:10:56:**  And then within that, we, it's kind of, well, the workplace platform as it were, is a Facebook  
**0:10:56-0:10:57:**  product.  
**0:10:57-0:11:04:**  So Facebook developed this platform in late 2016 and they invited us.  
**0:11:04-0:11:07:**  We've got to, you know, you don't normally get a letter from Facebook.  
**0:11:07-0:11:10:**  And they said, hey, would you like to come and join?  
**0:11:10-0:11:11:**  I was like, really?  
**0:11:11-0:11:12:**  Is this spam?  
**0:11:12-0:11:16:**  Anyway, we've got this letter from Facebook saying, we've got this new platform and we'd  
**0:11:16-0:11:18:**  like you to try.  
**0:11:18-0:11:23:**  So we jumped on and interestingly, we were in the middle of teaching our first online  
**0:11:23-0:11:31:**  REX program, which is our longitudinal online program that we run, farm planning program.  
**0:11:31-0:11:32:**  And we're about halfway through it.  
**0:11:32-0:11:37:**  And I said to the, as you do, you know, we're all getting along with things.  
**0:11:37-0:11:42:**  And I said to the, to the, I think we had 120 people on the course and I said, hey,  
**0:11:42-0:11:44:**  we've just joined this new platform.  
**0:11:44-0:11:46:**  Would you like to have a look at it?  
**0:11:46-0:11:49:**  And at the end of this course, we're thinking of switching over.  
**0:11:49-0:11:57:**  So anyway, within, I think it was in one week, 95 to a hundred of those people had just jumped  
**0:11:57-0:11:58:**  on.  
**0:11:58-0:12:04:**  And they all said, no, we want to be here now we're in Slack in the program Slack.  
**0:12:04-0:12:07:**  And people just jumped straight over.  
**0:12:07-0:12:09:**  Okay, I think we're here now.  
**0:12:09-0:12:13:**  We're not going to wait till here, which is not really the way to run a course, but that  
**0:12:13-0:12:14:**  was how it ran.  
**0:12:14-0:12:15:**  But we set it up.  
**0:12:15-0:12:19:**  So it's all in the Regrarian's platform layers, just to make the distinction.  
**0:12:19-0:12:26:**  And that's our 10 layer platform that we've developed, which is climate, geography, water,  
**0:12:26-0:12:34:**  access, forestry, buildings, fencing, soils, economy, and energy.  
**0:12:34-0:12:38:**  And so, you know, when we have all of these conversations, like you might do on an old  
**0:12:38-0:12:42:**  style forum, we've actually got them all in these groups.  
**0:12:42-0:12:47:**  So just like Facebook groups, except this is, Facebook developed this platform as an  
**0:12:47-0:12:49:**  intranet for companies.  
**0:12:49-0:12:56:**  And it's based on what Facebook were using for a decade to manage their own internal  
**0:12:56-0:12:57:**  process.  
**0:12:57-0:12:59:**  So they had their own Facebook inside of Facebook, as it were.  
**0:12:59-0:13:01:**  So it's a really good architecture.  
**0:13:01-0:13:03:**  And it's worked really, really well for us.  
**0:13:03-0:13:05:**  We couldn't be more pleased with it.  
**0:13:05-0:13:10:**  And we're on the workplace for good program as well, which means that as a nonprofit,  
**0:13:10-0:13:12:**  we get the whole thing for free.  
**0:13:12-0:13:13:**  So that's great as well.  
**0:13:13-0:13:14:**  Yeah.  
**0:13:14-0:13:18:**  I think we've skipped a little step though, because, and that's my fault.  
**0:13:18-0:13:25:**  But how did you go, how did you end up creating this workspace and operating in this way?  
**0:13:25-0:13:30:**  I mean, what were the steps throughout your career that led you to now have the role of  
**0:13:30-0:13:32:**  a facilitator, a connector?  
**0:13:32-0:13:34:**  Well, I've always been a connector.  
**0:13:34-0:13:40:**  So when I was running the organic greengrocer, a lot of my role was buying food.  
**0:13:40-0:13:48:**  So we'd go out and connect with all of these organic farmers in the late 80s, early 90s.  
**0:13:48-0:13:56:**  And as I've said a number of times on different podcasts, once the conversation got beyond,  
**0:13:56-0:14:01:**  oh, you're selling this, I want that sort of thing, that immediate conversation, it  
**0:14:01-0:14:07:**  then got to, hey, tell me what the guy down the road or the woman down the road is doing  
**0:14:07-0:14:09:**  about how are they growing their potatoes?  
**0:14:09-0:14:14:**  Because I want to know, because they weren't talking to each other necessarily, but they  
**0:14:14-0:14:16:**  were using me as a bit of an intermediary.  
**0:14:16-0:14:20:**  And then beyond that, I started to say, hey, you should meet, you know, this person's growing  
**0:14:20-0:14:25:**  apples if you met them, and you talked about how they're doing it and connecting people  
**0:14:25-0:14:29:**  who are organic and biodynamic people who were just starting out.  
**0:14:29-0:14:32:**  So they were in a transition to organic or biodynamic.  
**0:14:32-0:14:37:**  And then, you know, teaming them up somehow with people who are a bit more advanced than  
**0:14:37-0:14:40:**  and same with livestock and all sorts of things.  
**0:14:40-0:14:44:**  So that's where my consulting career and you know what you're asking, that's where it all  
**0:14:44-0:14:45:**  started.  
**0:14:45-0:14:52:**  It's always been that an element of my consulting has been about connecting people, you know,  
**0:14:52-0:14:59:**  because you can't, I mean, there's some consultants out there who kind of practices if they know  
**0:14:59-0:15:04:**  everything and which is really annoying and egotistical.  
**0:15:04-0:15:08:**  And I think really when my friend Brock Dolman said, you know, we've got to get out of the  
**0:15:08-0:15:14:**  ecosystem and into the ecosystem, that really rang true for me, because that was really  
**0:15:14-0:15:16:**  the way that we were running anyway.  
**0:15:16-0:15:20:**  You know, you've got to realise what you don't know, or know what you don't know.  
**0:15:20-0:15:24:**  And I'd always practice that because of my upbringing.  
**0:15:24-0:15:28:**  And so what that meant was, well, if I don't know something, then someone does.  
**0:15:28-0:15:31:**  And so I need to make that connection.  
**0:15:31-0:15:34:**  So all through my consulting career, that's been the case.  
**0:15:34-0:15:41:**  But then I didn't have really a digital framework in which to really make that, enable that  
**0:15:41-0:15:43:**  and or an IT platform.  
**0:15:43-0:15:48:**  And that's when the workplace came to me, because I've tried forums, you know, anybody,  
**0:15:48-0:15:55:**  I mean, I was an early adopter on the internet, I first got the internet, I think in 95, 96.  
**0:15:55-0:16:02:**  I've still got my first modem, I'll leave it on my desk at home as a sort of a reminder  
**0:16:02-0:16:11:**  when the internet shit and you go, oh God, it was 9.6 kilobits per second or whatever.  
**0:16:11-0:16:18:**  So as a reminder, but you know, back then it was forums, it was email lists, it was  
**0:16:18-0:16:19:**  really crap.  
**0:16:19-0:16:23:**  And it was really hard and slow to interact.  
**0:16:23-0:16:30:**  But then when you come forward to these fantastic new platforms, which allow you to tag people  
**0:16:30-0:16:33:**  and create all these groups and so on.  
**0:16:33-0:16:38:**  You know, there's Hivebright, and there's a few others that are out there as well, that  
**0:16:38-0:16:39:**  enable you to do that.  
**0:16:39-0:16:40:**  And they're fantastic.  
**0:16:40-0:16:44:**  They just enable, well, I'll put it to you this way.  
**0:16:44-0:16:50:**  When we were really, really singing, like doing lots of farm plans and lots of development  
**0:16:50-0:16:58:**  back in the late 90s, early noughties, we were doing 100 to 120, 150 jobs a year, projects  
**0:16:58-0:17:04:**  a year, with a big crew, super busy, just doing lots and lots of work, planting lots  
**0:17:04-0:17:13:**  of trees, doing lots of farm development, fencing, trees, dams, houses, roads, all that  
**0:17:13-0:17:14:**  stuff.  
**0:17:14-0:17:18:**  It was a really big lot of work.  
**0:17:18-0:17:28:**  And these days, I'm able to handle about three times that amount, thanks to the IT platform  
**0:17:28-0:17:29:**  that I've got.  
**0:17:29-0:17:33:**  Now I'm not managing project managing, but I think if I was, I'd still be able to do  
**0:17:33-0:17:40:**  probably double what I was back then because the IT platforms are just that much more sophisticated  
**0:17:40-0:17:41:**  and enabling.  
**0:17:41-0:17:46:**  But, you know, even then we don't even bother with that because people just, you just connect  
**0:17:46-0:17:51:**  one and two and you just let them go for it, as opposed to you having the heavy fingers  
**0:17:51-0:17:52:**  in every pie.  
**0:17:52-0:17:57:**  So IT is a really big part of the whole conversation.  
**0:17:57-0:18:05:**  We talk to farmers a lot about what IT they've got so that they can just do better, be more  
**0:18:05-0:18:06:**  efficient.  
**0:18:06-0:18:10:**  We've just had an interview with the president of the French Agroforestry Association, sorry,  
**0:18:10-0:18:15:**  the director of the French Agroforestry Association, Fabien Bélaguet, and he was explaining to  
**0:18:15-0:18:18:**  us how they're using tools.  
**0:18:18-0:18:23:**  It's a tool called Land Files, and it's basically connecting farmers between them so that instead  
**0:18:23-0:18:28:**  of a consultant coming on and telling them what to do and then going off, they're creating  
**0:18:28-0:18:33:**  work groups, communication groups, where the farmers are training each other.  
**0:18:33-0:18:39:**  And that's a pattern we also saw with Rowan Reid, who's also trying to operate in this  
**0:18:39-0:18:45:**  way, where it's kind of a bottom up empowerment and education rather than a top down consultant  
**0:18:45-0:18:47:**  comes in and tells you what to do.  
**0:18:47-0:18:50:**  Which is really hard if you don't have the IT platform.  
**0:18:50-0:18:54:**  So yeah, what was that called, the French mod?  
**0:18:54-0:18:56:**  So he's called Fabien Bélaguet.  
**0:18:56-0:19:02:**  I can send you, it's our last episode, it'll force you to check out our website.  
**0:19:02-0:19:05:**  Thank you.  
**0:19:05-0:19:08:**  And it's the French Agroforestry Association.  
**0:19:08-0:19:12:**  No, no, what was the software that they were using?  
**0:19:12-0:19:13:**  You said that?  
**0:19:13-0:19:14:**  It's Land Files.  
**0:19:14-0:19:15:**  Land Files, yeah.  
**0:19:15-0:19:16:**  I'll take that.  
**0:19:16-0:19:21:**  Yeah, yeah, so I'm not sure what's the software, but basically the project is called Land Files  
**0:19:21-0:19:23:**  and it's doing exactly this, but yeah, something to check out.  
**0:19:23-0:19:26:**  I'll check it out.  
**0:19:26-0:19:30:**  So you're not doing consultancies anymore?  
**0:19:30-0:19:35:**  Not very much, no.  
**0:19:35-0:19:45:**  It's so often unnecessary because of our REX program.  
**0:19:45-0:19:51:**  So the REX program was, back when I was teaching permaculture courses, which I stopped doing  
**0:19:51-0:19:59:**  in 2014, from about 2012, I started to get really frustrated with the whole permaculture  
**0:19:59-0:20:00:**  design course.  
**0:20:00-0:20:10:**  It's a great course and it's a really good entree into agroecology and better ways of  
**0:20:10-0:20:11:**  living.  
**0:20:11-0:20:13:**  Don't get me wrong, it's really powerful from that perspective.  
**0:20:13-0:20:17:**  But for me personally, it just started to be really limited.  
**0:20:17-0:20:24:**  And by that stage I developed the Regrarians platform and so I developed my own thing.  
**0:20:24-0:20:27:**  So it was sort of like I needed to move on into that.  
**0:20:27-0:20:33:**  So in that crossover time when I was still doing PDCs and I developed the Regrarians  
**0:20:33-0:20:42:**  platform, it became clear to me that, and also what we were doing in the PDCs I was  
**0:20:42-0:20:45:**  teaching, I was teaching doing a design a day.  
**0:20:45-0:20:50:**  So ordinarily in the classic PDC you do a design at the end.  
**0:20:50-0:20:56:**  So you build up, build up, build up, and then in the last day or five days or whatever you'll  
**0:20:56-0:21:02:**  produce a design in a group and then you'll present it and so on.  
**0:21:02-0:21:08:**  Because of my development of the Regrarians platform, I actually started to do that with  
**0:21:08-0:21:09:**  the PDC.  
**0:21:09-0:21:15:**  And I was using the Mollison order so if it was the first day it was introduction we didn't  
**0:21:15-0:21:21:**  do anything but then I'd do concepts and themes in design or methods of design.  
**0:21:21-0:21:27:**  I'd start to get people to build maps and then when we got to the water or trees and  
**0:21:27-0:21:33:**  interactions I started to treat them as layers and I encourage people to bring their own  
**0:21:33-0:21:35:**  plans along.  
**0:21:35-0:21:39:**  Because people come to these things ultimately at a self-interest, you know they've got their  
**0:21:39-0:21:42:**  own properties or they've got their own stuff they want to do.  
**0:21:42-0:21:45:**  So that's where it really started in that period.  
**0:21:45-0:21:51:**  And then when I started to run the REX programs face to face we started to do that as well  
**0:21:51-0:21:55:**  but it was more formalized around the Regrarians platform.  
**0:21:55-0:22:00:**  Then when we started to do the online version of that it was all about people bringing,  
**0:22:00-0:22:09:**  for us facilitating again a process by which they went through each layer and they gradually  
**0:22:09-0:22:15:**  built according to the priorities that they had in life and what their land was telling  
**0:22:15-0:22:21:**  them that they should prioritize how to build their own farm plan and just help them to  
**0:22:21-0:22:22:**  do that.  
**0:22:22-0:22:25:**  So teach them how to fish not do the fishing for them.  
**0:22:25-0:22:31:**  And that's what you're really doing in a consultancy a lot of the time.  
**0:22:31-0:22:36:**  The owners of the property who will be the managers of the property with their families  
**0:22:36-0:22:44:**  over time they're abdicating that responsibility over to somebody else and I've done a lot  
**0:22:44-0:22:46:**  of that I just don't believe it's the right way to do it.  
**0:22:46-0:22:51:**  It's much better and it's much more empowering it's much more participatory.  
**0:22:51-0:22:56:**  My time spent in aid work really proved that as well there's so much aid work that I've  
**0:22:56-0:23:03:**  done in the mid 2000s in Vietnam and then in Sri Lanka and other places where it was  
**0:23:03-0:23:09:**  all really super participatory and it was just so much better than the classic Western  
**0:23:09-0:23:10:**  way.  
**0:23:10-0:23:15:**  You know it's sort of like Westerners go in and do aid and they do it highly participatory  
**0:23:15-0:23:19:**  but when they go out and do it with themselves they don't do it which was always my comment  
**0:23:19-0:23:26:**  with the aid organizations which were funded by governments typically I'd say well how  
**0:23:26-0:23:34:**  can your AG department like the USDA they'd go over to wherever and they'd be highly participatory  
**0:23:34-0:23:39:**  and it's all fantastic engagement and then you go back to the US where I've worked a  
**0:23:39-0:23:46:**  lot and they've done any of that I say hang on people are people everywhere just because  
**0:23:46-0:23:51:**  they're in a developing situation doesn't mean that they need a different approach.  
**0:23:51-0:23:56:**  People at home need exactly the same approach and so that's the way we've run ever since  
**0:23:56-0:24:03:**  and that's been really powerful and I'm glad to hear that others are doing the same because  
**0:24:03-0:24:06:**  it just makes sense and it's so much easier and you can deal with people.  
**0:24:06-0:24:10:**  There's nothing like self-interest you know.  
**0:24:10-0:24:16:**  Yeah I know there's a pattern coming out here and it's interesting to see such let's say  
**0:24:16-0:24:23:**  experienced practitioners that are converging to a similar conclusion and it must say a  
**0:24:23-0:24:28:**  lot about the way that we need to be because you know when you're looking at creating regenerative  
**0:24:28-0:24:33:**  agricultural systems which involve a much higher complexity which one of the barriers  
**0:24:33-0:24:38:**  to entry is knowledge you know we need to have technical support and the thing is how  
**0:24:38-0:24:45:**  do we provide that technical support and it seems to be coming out that you know we can  
**0:24:45-0:24:49:**  provide it it's possible to provide it and you know correct me if I'm wrong it's possible  
**0:24:49-0:24:55:**  to provide it by these networks through these platforms with peer interaction facilitated  
**0:24:55-0:24:59:**  by a person for example like yourself or like other more experienced you know people that  
**0:24:59-0:25:05:**  are five ten years up the ladder facilitating and coordinating a bit and you know giving  
**0:25:05-0:25:06:**  tips.  
**0:25:06-0:25:10:**  I think that's a good point I've made that often myself is that it's really good to connect  
**0:25:10-0:25:16:**  people who are only a couple of years ahead of you because of the you know the pains fresher  
**0:25:16-0:25:21:**  the mistakes are fresher the experiences are fresher and you know whereas someone who's  
**0:25:21-0:25:26:**  30 years ahead yeah it's really valuable but well times have changed since they were going  
**0:25:26-0:25:31:**  through a development phase because that whole startup phase you know if you if you've got  
**0:25:31-0:25:36:**  to a point of maturity and success you're not in startup anymore unless you've had some  
**0:25:36-0:25:41:**  major disruption of which is called or major change in enterprise which has caused you  
**0:25:41-0:25:47:**  to go back into startup but you're way beyond that so it's really helpful to have a meshing  
**0:25:47-0:25:52:**  of all of those characters together.  
**0:25:52-0:25:54:**  Yeah sounds good.  
**0:25:54-0:25:57:**  Listen I thought that maybe our listeners are getting eager for us to talk about trees  
**0:25:57-0:26:06:**  so well I was talking to to Harry Green from Propagate Ventures and we were naturally a  
**0:26:06-0:26:12:**  gossiping about you and he told me that your favorite layer is the forestry layer it's  
**0:26:12-0:26:18:**  something that apparently you mentioned quite a bit and on your book I was also quite well  
**0:26:18-0:26:22:**  like there was when you looked at the for example the copying and standards section  
**0:26:22-0:26:26:**  on the in the forestry layer you talk about you know this being the backbone of the farm  
**0:26:26-0:26:30:**  you started mentioning a bit at the beginning but I thought that maybe we could start by  
**0:26:30-0:26:34:**  you giving us an introduction to that you know why a tree is so important for you on  
**0:26:34-0:26:41:**  the farm landscape and why is it a backbone?  
**0:26:41-0:26:46:**  Well if you go into a landscape some people would argue that there's different backbones  
**0:26:46-0:26:51:**  I mean you might if you're lying down well when the backbone might be the soil and you  
**0:26:51-0:26:58:**  know because everything starts there but my friend Graham Hand says who's a holistic manager  
**0:26:58-0:27:06:**  a holistic management consultant he mentions that you know the soil is nothing without  
**0:27:06-0:27:14:**  plants because plants are the interface between the energy source the sun and this mineral  
**0:27:14-0:27:22:**  body that will be earth and plants are this living connection between the two and so regardless  
**0:27:22-0:27:30:**  of whether it's a grassland or a woody grassland or a closed forest or something in between  
**0:27:30-0:27:36:**  plants have a really key role to play and when I look at our platform and I go to the  
**0:27:36-0:27:43:**  forestry layer well for us that's all living organisms so it's not just flora it's also  
**0:27:43-0:27:49:**  fauna it's also fungi it's bacteria and so on it's and we really think all right well  
**0:27:49-0:27:55:**  how do they all integrate together and so being a backbone well you know if you look  
**0:27:55-0:28:00:**  into a landscape there's a couple of things that you look at one is the shape of it so  
**0:28:00-0:28:06:**  if you've got this bare bones plane well then it's pretty boring it's just that but it is  
**0:28:06-0:28:10:**  what it's the it's the shape of the land that really tells you what it is it's the shape  
**0:28:10-0:28:15:**  of the land and and the sky and that's pretty well all you've got is there any water in  
**0:28:15-0:28:19:**  it or whatever but that's that's basically all it is if it's just and it's just grass  
**0:28:19-0:28:25:**  right so you then go and if you've got that kind of landscape and then you go and put  
**0:28:25-0:28:31:**  trees into it or shrubs into it some woody plants in a structured way well in the landscape  
**0:28:31-0:28:35:**  if you look at the you know you can have a flood plain landscape here and then right  
**0:28:35-0:28:41:**  next door you've got one that's all wide spaced agroforestry or savannah plantings or you  
**0:28:41-0:28:46:**  know whatever it is it starts to get a dimension to it which it didn't have before and then  
**0:28:46-0:28:53:**  that from a backbone perspective and our backbone is our structure that's what holds us up right  
**0:28:53-0:29:00:**  and when I look at that kind of archetypal approach of integrating trees in different  
**0:29:00-0:29:08:**  assemblies in different layouts in onto a property then it defines the shape of how  
**0:29:08-0:29:15:**  we get around it also becomes a home to organisms which weren't there before and then they become  
**0:29:15-0:29:22:**  vectors for all kinds of variables and activities which weren't occurring before because you  
**0:29:22-0:29:27:**  just had grassland or you had cropland or something else which makes it pretty well  
**0:29:27-0:29:34:**  boring really boring to look at and not as diverse as it could be when it comes to a  
**0:29:34-0:29:43:**  whole range of different options whether that's the biodiversity that it invites and hosts  
**0:29:43-0:29:50:**  or whether it's the different income options and production options that you also can leverage  
**0:29:50-0:29:58:**  from that and if that goes on to be you know if you bring agriculture right down to it  
**0:29:58-0:30:05:**  regardless of what your production output is you're in the biomass business and it's  
**0:30:05-0:30:12:**  the state of different biomass that you produce Andrew Stewart who's a very close friend of  
**0:30:12-0:30:18:**  Rowan Reed I don't know if you've interviewed Rowan but yeah so they're really close mates  
**0:30:18-0:30:23:**  and Andrew's an agro forester he's just been nominated for the Bob Hawke Landcare Award  
**0:30:23-0:30:32:**  which is fantastic anyway his farm the way he classifies his farming output is he produces  
**0:30:32-0:30:40:**  X amount of wool but then he produces X amount of pine logs X amount of honey X amount of  
**0:30:40-0:30:45:**  bush foods and so on so it's but you know what it all is it's all different types and  
**0:30:45-0:30:52:**  layers of biomass which enable his kids to make a living off the farm and his wife to  
**0:30:52-0:30:58:**  make a living off of what is a relatively small farm so and so his productivity because  
**0:30:58-0:31:07:**  of that backbone of extra flora really makes a big difference to the bottom line of that  
**0:31:07-0:31:16:**  and that is a backbone because if you you know we always need wood we always need honey  
**0:31:16-0:31:23:**  we always need this that and the other all of these products so when you start to build  
**0:31:23-0:31:32:**  those things in they're always there and they can be managed in perpetuity which is obviously  
**0:31:32-0:31:37:**  fantastic there's nothing annual about it anymore I mean when I talk about the energy  
**0:31:37-0:31:44:**  layer for example or so you know one of the policies as I call it is that that people  
**0:31:44-0:31:49:**  need to start behaving like they're perennials not annuals because we are perennials right  
**0:31:49-0:31:56:**  we're a perennial organism we might have 70 80 90 100 years on this planet but so do a  
**0:31:56-0:32:03:**  lot of trees right that's the lifespan of some trees much more than some shrubs and  
**0:32:03-0:32:08:**  so on they're so we are perennials so why do we have to behave like annuals all the  
**0:32:08-0:32:14:**  time it makes no sense and that's you know it's a really big learning I think for us  
**0:32:14-0:32:20:**  to as we understand our role in our in the ecology especially in better quality agro  
**0:32:20-0:32:27:**  ecologies will then of course we're going to be thinking about how can we be more perennial  
**0:32:27-0:32:32:**  and that perenniality also goes from generation to generation just like all perennial species  
**0:32:32-0:32:39:**  do whereas annuals behave like teenagers going to nightclubs you know they spend their pay  
**0:32:39-0:32:45:**  straight away and they hope they you know they hope for the luck that they get you know  
**0:32:45-0:32:54:**  they're awfully opportunistic so have trees been an inherent part to to all your designs  
**0:32:54-0:32:58:**  when we're looking at you know the designs that you put in practice I'd love to for us  
**0:32:58-0:33:02:**  it's always nice to kind of zoom into practical examples to enable our listeners to kind of  
**0:33:02-0:33:08:**  get a feel for for what it is on the ground and you know I'm curious because in some context  
**0:33:08-0:33:13:**  maybe it's it doesn't necessarily work I don't know but has it has it always been an inherent  
**0:33:13-0:33:20:**  part of of your designs I think so I think people well yeah when you use the key key  
**0:33:20-0:33:26:**  point or keyword there my designs right so my designs when they're my designs when I'm  
**0:33:26-0:33:31:**  the consultant and I'm in charge bloody earth there's trees there you know okay because  
**0:33:31-0:33:37:**  and people when I offer when I when I had that sort of service that I was offering and  
**0:33:37-0:33:42:**  still do occasionally you know if I've got a particularly interesting project which you  
**0:33:42-0:33:48:**  know needs that kind of attention then I'll have a crack at it but most people will come  
**0:33:48-0:33:56:**  to me like I've got I would say my reputation is as a water guy and a tree guy right and  
**0:33:56-0:34:03:**  as a livestock guy so really water and agroforestry you might say a livestock oriented agroforestry  
**0:34:03-0:34:10:**  is probably what I'm best known for and a keyline guy in terms of how I pull it all  
**0:34:10-0:34:17:**  together so so that's my context that's my world view on how things can be but your enterprise  
**0:34:17-0:34:23:**  might be something quite different and you know you may not wake up in the morning thinking  
**0:34:23-0:34:31:**  about trees you might be a a weak person you might be a sheep person you might be a emu  
**0:34:31-0:34:37:**  person I don't know whatever you are you're not me so and this is the really big thing  
**0:34:37-0:34:44:**  I suppose when you're when you're taking the more of a holistic approach with people especially  
**0:34:44-0:34:49:**  through the lens of holistic management is that you're allowing other people to exhibit  
**0:34:49-0:34:57:**  their own and to determine their own self-determined their own context what are they what do they  
**0:34:57-0:35:01:**  want their property to or their their project to look like or their landscape to look like  
**0:35:01-0:35:08:**  etc now within all of that because of the way we work with people we certainly go through  
**0:35:08-0:35:12:**  and say you know what kind of landscape do you want do you want to have here do you want  
**0:35:12-0:35:16:**  to have it so that because some people really just like the look they get very excited about  
**0:35:16-0:35:22:**  having wall to wall cereal crops and they just that's what and you know I've met a few  
**0:35:22-0:35:28:**  people like that I mean Harry Harry Weir in New Zealand who invented techno grazing  
**0:35:28-0:35:35:**  he's yeah he doesn't see the role of a tree on his property he sees true beauty in his  
**0:35:35-0:35:42:**  techno grazing boring bloody fence landscape and that's what he gets off on but I don't  
**0:35:42-0:35:48:**  know if most people like that people like the idea of having a bit more dimension to  
**0:35:48-0:35:55:**  it and if you if you sort of and this is where we go we say look here's the palette of all  
**0:35:55-0:36:01:**  of the things that you can do sort of like a checkerboard or toolbox as someone say of  
**0:36:01-0:36:09:**  all the bits that you can make a farm do or make an agroecology do it's up to you to make  
**0:36:09-0:36:14:**  that assembly but it's not up to me to tell you what to do of course but it's really I  
**0:36:14-0:36:23:**  mean I still say gee wouldn't it be nice if you had them like this or this you know and  
**0:36:23-0:36:31:**  just sort of and sometimes it's low lowest hanging fruit but then it like I remember  
**0:36:31-0:36:36:**  years ago working with some cereal producers in northern Victoria which is where I live  
**0:36:36-0:36:42:**  here and there's lots of floodplains about about 30 40 kilometres north of where I am  
**0:36:42-0:36:48:**  here which is where we are here is quite hilly but as you go towards the Murray River it's  
**0:36:48-0:36:54:**  it's dead flat and a lot of cereals produced and it's just wall to wall cereal and it's  
**0:36:54-0:37:01:**  either wall to wall cereal or wall to wall sheep there's not much going on and some I  
**0:37:01-0:37:08:**  remember working with people years ago and talking about introducing farm forestry into  
**0:37:08-0:37:15:**  agroforestry into their operations and a big amount of reluctance and we said well why  
**0:37:15-0:37:22:**  don't you because every farm's got some land which is of a lower capability well when I  
**0:37:22-0:37:30:**  say every just about every farm has land which has different capabilities it might be that  
**0:37:30-0:37:35:**  you've got a stream or a water course running through the property for example or there  
**0:37:35-0:37:41:**  might be a stony area or you know this there's different things that are on the on the place  
**0:37:41-0:37:45:**  and you go to people will you know do you actually get anything out of that have you  
**0:37:45-0:37:50:**  actually done the if you don't when you do the gross margins on that have you determined  
**0:37:50-0:37:55:**  how much you actually make on that and when you start scratching at that you go well maybe  
**0:37:55-0:38:00:**  that's a good spot where you could go and put a block of trees in and hey you might  
**0:38:00-0:38:07:**  even be able to get a grant to do it or you know you just so that was a way of doing that  
**0:38:07-0:38:12:**  you might go well gee we only need to put in five percent of your property in trees  
**0:38:12-0:38:18:**  and that's all you actually need to do and to be quite like if if you look at it from  
**0:38:18-0:38:22:**  a limiting factor you go gee shelter is a limiting factor to production here you've  
**0:38:22-0:38:28:**  got a bare place there's lots of you know suddenly on all whatever the winds that are  
**0:38:28-0:38:33:**  and they're actually a drag on production if you put in safe you know wide spaced alleys  
**0:38:33-0:38:39:**  or this that or the other or some shelter belts and they only have to be 200 meters  
**0:38:39-0:38:45:**  apart well you can barely see them but they're there and you know you'll have that forever  
**0:38:45-0:38:49:**  and that'll be a legacy that you bring so there's lots of different ways that you can  
**0:38:49-0:38:54:**  package that conversation but still it's up to it's up to the individual as to whether  
**0:38:54-0:39:00:**  they push the go button on that at all naturally but you know for me this conversation it's  
**0:39:00-0:39:04:**  kind of making me think a lot about a conversation that we had with other guests on the podcast  
**0:39:04-0:39:08:**  and some guests are saying you know plant trees for conservation and then whatever you  
**0:39:08-0:39:15:**  reap afterwards in terms of wood timber production etc as a bonus and some other players usually  
**0:39:15-0:39:19:**  in smaller landscape places they're saying you cannot plant trees because there's an  
**0:39:19-0:39:24:**  economic crop and plant the trees that provide an economic crop you can't make too many compromises  
**0:39:24-0:39:30:**  in terms of ecology or ecosystem services because it's not going to convince farmers  
**0:39:30-0:39:34:**  and we need to be you know we need to focus here and to make the best use of our small  
**0:39:34-0:39:40:**  landscape for example so there's a notion of scale possibly but what's your take on  
**0:39:40-0:39:45:**  that I mean do you plant trees for economy is it an ideal to say you're really planting  
**0:39:45-0:39:50:**  timber trees for example for some serious economic return what's your experience yeah  
**0:39:50-0:39:58:**  well we were involved in the in the 1990s I was the chairman of the box iron box iron  
**0:39:58-0:40:04:**  bark farm forestry network and we got the big there was a hundred and thirty million  
**0:40:04-0:40:12:**  dollar federal government program here farm forestry program and our group got 850 grand  
**0:40:12-0:40:18:**  of that it was the biggest single grant of any farm forestry network in Australia and  
**0:40:18-0:40:25:**  the the fundamental reason for that was a to fund I think it was three farm forestry  
**0:40:25-0:40:31:**  extension offices but the up at the first part of that platform of that program was  
**0:40:31-0:40:40:**  to develop a feasibility study to determine if farm forestry was viable in the sub 600  
**0:40:40-0:40:48:**  millimeter rainfall area of where we are because here and other places of the world 600 650  
**0:40:48-0:40:56:**  millimeters and even really 750 millimeters is seen as a sort of a bottom level of rainfall  
**0:40:56-0:41:02:**  that you need to have productive on farm or just plantation forestry at all you just don't  
**0:41:02-0:41:14:**  get the main annual increment on let's say more common commercial species yeah so so  
**0:41:14-0:41:19:**  we looked at it a bit differently because we we'd seen some plantations that were put  
**0:41:19-0:41:26:**  in in the 1980s by the what was the precursor to the land care movement here in Australia  
**0:41:26-0:41:31:**  and that all started in this part of the world in central Victoria and we'd gone out and  
**0:41:31-0:41:36:**  looked at some of these plantings and done the assessment on their main annual increment  
**0:41:36-0:41:41:**  and what we were going actually these aren't too bad and when you looked at then the value  
**0:41:41-0:41:49:**  of those species because these weren't in the category of main commercial species that  
**0:41:49-0:41:55:**  if you went down to the timber store these weren't species that were available there  
**0:41:55-0:42:04:**  because they just weren't in plantations salt pine and fast really fast growing quite light  
**0:42:04-0:42:10:**  eucalypts lower density eucalypts these are high these are some of the densest timbers  
**0:42:10-0:42:16:**  in the world that we're talking about you know 1300 to 1700 kilograms per or 1600 kilograms  
**0:42:16-0:42:24:**  to the cubic meter and their case years and stuff that was used over time in really heavy  
**0:42:24-0:42:31:**  construction you know stuff that's f32 I don't know what your strength ratings are over there  
**0:42:31-0:42:36:**  but really you know the strongest beam timbers that you can get in the world right okay over  
**0:42:36-0:42:44:**  span so super high engineering values yes slower grown but if put through silvicultural  
**0:42:44-0:42:54:**  practices that we knew about you could grow quite short factories using particular silvicultural  
**0:42:54-0:43:02:**  processes which would give you a yield from 25 to 35 which you know if I go and talk to  
**0:43:02-0:43:07:**  someone in northern Europe about a 35 year rotation they go well whoever has that it's  
**0:43:07-0:43:15:**  like 150 to 200 if you're lucky yeah but here because of pine and fast growing eucalypts  
**0:43:15-0:43:24:**  etc I mean you start talking 25 years and it's like you're a fossil so you know so we  
**0:43:24-0:43:28:**  started to do that and we put that through the length we got a professional forester  
**0:43:28-0:43:37:**  of really high experience to lead the feasibility study and they came out and said well if you  
**0:43:37-0:43:44:**  mill if you do the silviculture yourself on farm and still pay for that like still pay  
**0:43:44-0:43:53:**  yourself and you so you do the silviculture and then you do the and then you thin to production  
**0:43:53-0:43:57:**  because a lot of these species are really good for firewood so you know you'll generally  
**0:43:57-0:44:05:**  just get a break even on the thinning and then if you mill the trees at the end on farm  
**0:44:05-0:44:10:**  using on farm mills like lucas mills and whatnot which we you know we have some great mills  
**0:44:10-0:44:17:**  here in Australia then you'll get a return of between I think it was about 13 to 17 percent  
**0:44:17-0:44:24:**  per annum which is way higher than what you would get from most forms of ordinary agriculture  
**0:44:24-0:44:30:**  like you know producing sheep or producing crops or whatever else so that was really  
**0:44:30-0:44:34:**  compelling and so you know when people said oh you can't make any money about it all going  
**0:44:34-0:44:43:**  well actually here's a you know really conservative feasibility study and yes you have to do work  
**0:44:43-0:44:51:**  but even so there's a pretty compelling commercial case notwithstanding like at that stage the  
**0:44:51-0:44:56:**  carbon conversation was pretty new it was only starting to come on but we were saying  
**0:44:56-0:45:01:**  that so well you in future it's likely there'll be carbon credit arrangements which would  
**0:45:01-0:45:09:**  add to this layer of income and secondly then there's all of the ecosystem services that  
**0:45:09-0:45:15:**  would be provided whether they're shelter for your crops or whatever which we already  
**0:45:15-0:45:19:**  knew the pastoral and veterinary institute down past where Rowan Reid lives in Hamilton  
**0:45:19-0:45:27:**  they proved years ago that as they had in New Zealand as well that you know that integrating  
**0:45:27-0:45:36:**  trees into different landscapes pastoral or cropping landscapes had a definite yielding  
**0:45:36-0:45:44:**  increase so when you started to layer that together there was a pretty good uptake plus  
**0:45:44-0:45:49:**  a lot of programs and when you that classic thing of getting key farmers who people take  
**0:45:49-0:45:55:**  notice of because there's nothing like a farmer showing something off I've never been a fan  
**0:45:55-0:46:00:**  of demonstration farms which have been owned by the government or whatever because people  
**0:46:00-0:46:07:**  go or rich people because people go in and go well gee they they all you know rural people  
**0:46:07-0:46:13:**  generally will always say first off why they can't do something that's general around the  
**0:46:13-0:46:19:**  world I've seen so if it's a farmer who's just like them and they know is just like  
**0:46:19-0:46:23:**  them because they've been in the district for a while and if you can find that person  
**0:46:23-0:46:28:**  that they're a real key person in in getting adoption you can get a couple of those early  
**0:46:28-0:46:33:**  adopter types innovator types and they have a crack and they do it well and they demonstrate  
**0:46:33-0:46:38:**  and they get people to do field days and all of that sort of thing then you can start to  
**0:46:38-0:46:45:**  get some broader adoption which is you know part what this program was successful in doing  
**0:46:45-0:46:51:**  I mean it wasn't as successful as we'd like it to be but it was a dam site more successful  
**0:46:51-0:46:56:**  I mean you go you drive around the landscape 20 odd years later 25 years later and there's  
**0:46:56-0:47:02:**  a lot more trees that have been purposely planted from a farm for farm forestry purposes  
**0:47:02-0:47:06:**  than there were before which is great you know.  
**0:47:06-0:47:11:**  And have you seen that well that's a fascinating example and I'll ask you for the for the resources  
**0:47:11-0:47:12:**  to that.  
**0:47:12-0:47:17:**  Yeah sure it's all on the workplace so I can link that to you yeah and one of the original  
**0:47:17-0:47:23:**  farm forestry offices that we that that program employed is also a member of the workplace  
**0:47:23-0:47:25:**  so yeah.  
**0:47:25-0:47:31:**  Nice fantastic another reason to get on the workplace everybody full of amazing people  
**0:47:31-0:47:36:**  to talk to but have you seen that across the world as well in the sense you've traveled  
**0:47:36-0:47:41:**  a lot you've talked to people or like from all continents doing regenerative agriculture  
**0:47:41-0:47:46:**  and etc is that a is that something that you hear of do you think there's a compelling  
**0:47:46-0:47:50:**  case at the moment for trees economically I mean this is a huge generalization but.  
**0:47:50-0:47:58:**  No no and that's a good question recently I did a presentation for the organic vitico  
**0:47:58-0:48:05:**  of sorry the regenerative viticulture symposium which was hosted by Torres the familiar Torres  
**0:48:05-0:48:12:**  in Catalunya in Liberia and one of the things I did on that like they wanted me in that  
**0:48:12-0:48:18:**  presentation to sort of show what was the state of the regenerative agriculture whatever  
**0:48:18-0:48:25:**  that means around the world integrated agriculture you might call it and I agroforestry and I  
**0:48:25-0:48:32:**  kind of went through and I used the mind map sort of graphic process to sort of say alright  
**0:48:32-0:48:40:**  well here's Asia here's Oceania I mean Australia New Zealand here's North America South America  
**0:48:40-0:48:45:**  Central America you know I just went continent by continent and looked at from my observation  
**0:48:45-0:48:52:**  at least what are the key expressions of regenerative agriculture and it's not and the agroforestry  
**0:48:52-0:48:59:**  part is not as big in some places as it is in others and then even when you look if you  
**0:48:59-0:49:10:**  look at North America for example there's parts where it's kind of there but a lot of  
**0:49:10-0:49:17:**  especially in the more humid parts of the United States for example or Canada a lot  
**0:49:17-0:49:25:**  of their agroforestry practice is more silver pastural it's about managing existing timber  
**0:49:25-0:49:30:**  because their landscape is humid so it's already you know it doesn't you just have to turn  
**0:49:30-0:49:36:**  your back or you know take livestock off and then trees just come up it's just that's because  
**0:49:36-0:49:45:**  it's a humid savory would say a non-griddle landscape so it wants to be forest right so  
**0:49:45-0:49:54:**  by that token agroforestry as an expression is silver pasture right it's really managing  
**0:49:54-0:49:59:**  the stems that are already there or that are emerging as opposed to plantation stuff which  
**0:49:59-0:50:05:**  is perhaps what we do more of here in Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand is an interesting  
**0:50:05-0:50:13:**  one because it's very humid and forest wants to come but a lot of the kinds of trees like  
**0:50:13-0:50:19:**  there's an antipathy towards the kind of succession that occurs in New Zealand because it starts  
**0:50:19-0:50:25:**  off with a lot of shrubbery and it doesn't get to the tree layer it takes too long whereas  
**0:50:25-0:50:30:**  here in Australia it gets to the tree you know eucalypts come up really quickly in the  
**0:50:30-0:50:34:**  succession so you don't have to wait so long and the same in the United States you know  
**0:50:34-0:50:38:**  you don't there's lots of you know the first emergent vegetation is stuff that you can  
**0:50:38-0:50:45:**  use whereas in New Zealand it's shrubbery you have to wait for some time until the succession  
**0:50:45-0:50:53:**  so they'll accelerate that succession by planting all sorts of stuff so in terms of like I said  
**0:50:53-0:50:58:**  you know the way people express themselves in different places is all very different  
**0:50:58-0:51:05:**  there's people like it drives me crazy when I go to places like California which is so  
**0:51:05-0:51:12:**  similar to where I am here climate wise and so on and you talk about trees and people  
**0:51:12-0:51:17:**  just just think why aren't they tree planting crews everywhere I mean the plate the hills  
**0:51:17-0:51:23:**  are so bare and barren and exposed and it's just like what are you doing here and I keep  
**0:51:23-0:51:30:**  going back there and I just keep being disappointed by by no action on that front because the  
**0:51:30-0:51:35:**  landscapes are just yeah people are improving grasslands here and there but that was a savannah  
**0:51:35-0:51:43:**  landscape like it was either full-scale forest or it was savannah with those beautiful live  
**0:51:43-0:51:48:**  oak evergreen oaks that they have over there and it's like why wouldn't you want that back  
**0:51:48-0:51:53:**  I mean you drive around parts of California and you can see pockets of where it's these  
**0:51:53-0:51:59:**  it's like Iberia you know it's like them the montado or the daisa systems or parts of north  
**0:51:59-0:52:06:**  africa other places where you've got this gorgeous parkland of widely spaced oak trees  
**0:52:06-0:52:11:**  and grasslands and whatnot underneath and it's like why don't you want that why don't  
**0:52:11-0:52:21:**  you actually do that yeah it's like but they don't yeah it's like wow okay so it really  
**0:52:21-0:52:30:**  depends on where you are I think it's tied into well I've just finished reading Simon  
**0:52:30-0:52:39:**  Winchester's latest book called Land and he's a great writer his other book of his is a  
**0:52:39-0:52:44:**  real favorite of mine The Man Who Loved China he's written a lot of books he's a pretty  
**0:52:44-0:52:55:**  well-known author in in a sort of ethnobiological space and so on an anthropological space anyway  
**0:52:55-0:53:02:**  but he was talking about a fascination of mine which leads to this point is that depending  
**0:53:02-0:53:09:**  on your ethnicity but also the fact that you know the land rush in places like the United  
**0:53:09-0:53:15:**  States and to an extent Australia was based on the enclosure acts of Britain so the enclosure  
**0:53:15-0:53:22:**  acts obviously if you're familiar with that was started in the 1500s it was when they  
**0:53:22-0:53:28:**  basically got rid of the commons so there was no common land anymore and the lords and  
**0:53:28-0:53:34:**  so on started to carve the land up and that's where the corollary of that was that the original  
**0:53:34-0:53:42:**  enclosures were living fences so it was actually it created the archetypal hedgerow systems  
**0:53:42-0:53:50:**  which are so fantastic and so beneficial to the ecologies of England and other places  
**0:53:50-0:53:56:**  where it's established and but it was the property-owning part of that that and the  
**0:53:56-0:54:04:**  subdivision part of that that when people left particularly England and to an extent  
**0:54:04-0:54:10:**  Ireland and all other one they they went with them well what preceded them was English was  
**0:54:10-0:54:16:**  largely English law and English property rights and all of that and the English expectation  
**0:54:16-0:54:25:**  that improvement meant no trees yeah yeah right so in order for you to be able to get  
**0:54:25-0:54:31:**  you know this has been the problem here in Australia we've had mass extinction here and  
**0:54:31-0:54:38:**  mass deforestation because you couldn't get the title for your land the freehold title  
**0:54:38-0:54:44:**  for your land until you improved it and improvement meant you had to remove all the trees and  
**0:54:44-0:54:51:**  so when you've got that deeply embedded part of your culture that when that's deeply embedded  
**0:54:51-0:54:59:**  as part of the the culture will then when you don't see trees in the same way and I  
**0:54:59-0:55:07:**  think there's there's a you might say almost an epigenetic disdain for for trees in some  
**0:55:07-0:55:13:**  ways in in rural parts of the world because of that so it really depends on what your  
**0:55:13-0:55:20:**  ethnicity is and what country you landed in as to what legal frameworks were there that  
**0:55:20-0:55:26:**  enabled you to then carry on so if you go to parts of the world which are which are  
**0:55:26-0:55:33:**  Spanish or French well even the way they subdivided land is very different yes the French and  
**0:55:33-0:55:41:**  Spanish in particular they subdivided the land in long strips whereas the British did  
**0:55:41-0:55:47:**  it in squares and so you know that all that all impacts how you actually work with the  
**0:55:47-0:55:52:**  landscape when you're in Greece I mean Greece is basically made up of tiny little postage  
**0:55:52-0:55:59:**  stamps of land it's also you know it started off as something bigger but with every every  
**0:55:59-0:56:04:**  generation that's been cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut and so a big land holder has got  
**0:56:04-0:56:08:**  a piece over there and a piece over there there's nothing that's actually continuous  
**0:56:08-0:56:14:**  very careful so that'll so that'll really impact how you then will develop your land  
**0:56:14-0:56:19:**  it's all very fascinating from that perspective and something that when I go to different  
**0:56:19-0:56:25:**  places I I pay attention to and I often will ask people what's your heritage what's your  
**0:56:25-0:56:30:**  cultural heritage and you can see that if someone's been on a piece of land for some  
**0:56:30-0:56:41:**  time especially people who see people who come to courses and at this stage generally  
**0:56:41-0:56:46:**  people who come to my courses are usually innovator early adopter types so they're self  
**0:56:46-0:56:53:**  learners they're self-activated learners as people so it's not like they haven't heard  
**0:56:53-0:56:57:**  of best practices because they've already been on the internet for a long time they've  
**0:56:57-0:57:01:**  done a lot of reading they've gone to a lot of workshops you know all that stuff but if  
**0:57:01-0:57:07:**  you go to their landscape and they haven't done anything about the tree layer then it  
**0:57:07-0:57:11:**  probably then you've got to scratch a little deeper as to why that's the case right you  
**0:57:11-0:57:16:**  know what I mean yeah yeah that's very interesting yeah you don't usually we don't usually hear  
**0:57:16-0:57:23:**  that aspect I mean at least I haven't often heard about you know how deep it can go and  
**0:57:23-0:57:29:**  I find that a really interesting approach and a sense of sensitivity that's necessary  
**0:57:29-0:57:33:**  to have clearly in order to understand the context and why somebody would want or not  
**0:57:33-0:57:42:**  want to plant trees but I wanted to show you yeah yeah one thing that I I'm a pretty coarse  
**0:57:42-0:57:50:**  sort of fellow but when I get down to it I say well when you I've had a few of those  
**0:57:50-0:57:55:**  experiences myself you go walking I remember I was in England years ago and it was November  
**0:57:55-0:58:01:**  so it was really really dark moonless night and was I was in deep forest and I thought  
**0:58:01-0:58:08:**  and you just start to get scared well I did and I don't scare easily but I did I was walking  
**0:58:08-0:58:15:**  by myself you know where's the boogeyman right now that's that's not natural for me when  
**0:58:15-0:58:19:**  I walk around at night I love it I'm just soaking it up listening to sounds and stuff  
**0:58:19-0:58:25:**  but I actually felt scared and I thought well okay thought about it later after I scurried  
**0:58:25-0:58:34:**  on home my iPhone wasn't bright enough you know but but then I thought about it too at  
**0:58:34-0:58:39:**  another vulnerable moment we've all that well hopefully nearly everyone's done this if you've  
**0:58:39-0:58:45:**  gone out and you're taking a you're doing a poo in the in out outside you know you're  
**0:58:45-0:58:50:**  out in the woods somewhere and you need to go and you squat down and you hear something  
**0:58:50-0:58:59:**  you hear a twig go and you're hyper alert and you know like we say go and what why is  
**0:58:59-0:59:04:**  it that we say go behind a tree I mean the tree might be this big what sort of protection  
**0:59:04-0:59:09:**  is going behind that tree going to give you in terms of privacy or whatever else what  
**0:59:09-0:59:15:**  is it and I think that goes way back I'd love to be going into places like Africa which  
**0:59:15-0:59:21:**  I haven't spent anywhere near enough time in and say to people who are still living  
**0:59:21-0:59:26:**  relatively close to nature when you go and take a crap in the woods because they've got  
**0:59:26-0:59:34:**  animals there that can take you out and we all come from there so what's the linkage  
**0:59:34-0:59:41:**  between that and why is it then would we then I as a you know humans all over the world  
**0:59:41-0:59:45:**  have removed predators from the landscape and that's that's one thing and the other  
**0:59:45-0:59:51:**  thing that we've done is we've created we've used fire to reduce woody vegetation we don't  
**0:59:51-0:59:56:**  want to we haven't typically removed all of it but we've used fire to remove a lot of  
**0:59:56-1:00:01:**  it and I think that's so we can see and feel safe and so that when you go out in the woods  
**1:00:01-1:00:06:**  and you have a and you go and have a crap that's you being at a very vulnerable position  
**1:00:06-1:00:13:**  because when you're halfway through it you're not moving very quickly right you know so  
**1:00:13-1:00:21:**  I just find that very I find those moments as a human giving us a really close link to  
**1:00:21-1:00:27:**  where we've come from and and and I think about that in terms of our linkage with the  
**1:00:27-1:00:33:**  landscape the the the floristic landscape the woody landscape that we're a part of and  
**1:00:33-1:00:37:**  how dense that is and how we feel at that moment I think yeah I think pretty strongly  
**1:00:37-1:00:43:**  about that there's probably a there's probably a thesis there I don't know if I could go  
**1:00:43-1:00:50:**  to a I never went to university but imagining going going up to your forestry professor  
**1:00:50-1:01:02:**  and say here's my thesis I'm shitting in the woods and I feel shit scared anyway someone's  
**1:01:02-1:01:07:**  probably already done it you know looking at this this kind of social this personal  
**1:01:07-1:01:12:**  context it links quite well to where I wanted to take this next because you know to give  
**1:01:12-1:01:16:**  a bit of context to the listeners you're you're a farm planner you've developed tools and  
**1:01:16-1:01:24:**  methodologies in order to enable people to make the right decisions for their farm and  
**1:01:24-1:01:29:**  you know in agroforestry we're often talking it you know it's not just about planting as  
**1:01:29-1:01:34:**  many trees as you can it's about planting the right tree at the right place and then  
**1:01:34-1:01:38:**  on the side there's and making sure it grows which is another agronomic question but let's  
**1:01:38-1:01:45:**  not go there at the moment and so therefore you know what are the design tools and methodologies  
**1:01:45-1:01:51:**  that we have as farmers that you could you could you know present to plant the right  
**1:01:51-1:01:56:**  tree at the right time sorry the right tree at the right place apologies well and this  
**1:01:56-1:01:59:**  is making the assumption that you want to do it in the first place and then the next  
**1:01:59-1:02:04:**  step from that is all right well so so you've come to the plate and you said okay I've got  
**1:02:04-1:02:08:**  I've got this piece of land I've either had it for a long time or I'm new to it either  
**1:02:08-1:02:15:**  or I've got I'm looking at a tree change right I'm looking at integrating trees into this  
**1:02:15-1:02:26:**  landscape well the first question I would ask is in terms of what to plant is ask myself  
**1:02:26-1:02:31:**  well what what grows in the region and that that that leads you on a bit of a field of  
**1:02:31-1:02:36:**  discovery where you might you know look around your area and start to see what people are  
**1:02:36-1:02:40:**  growing already on their different on their different places so you can get a sense of  
**1:02:40-1:02:45:**  what will you know you think oh gee I'd love to grow a lemon orchard or something like  
**1:02:45-1:02:50:**  that will do you know is it too frosty for lemons or or is it too frosty for some for  
**1:02:50-1:02:54:**  some timber species that you're looking at you know what are you're always looking at  
**1:02:54-1:02:59:**  what the capabilities are in that way that's the way I do it anyway like if I'm going to  
**1:02:59-1:03:04:**  a new area I start to look around immediately at the vegetation and I've got a pretty big  
**1:03:04-1:03:09:**  big botanical knowledge so that and that that to me is really fascinating as part of the  
**1:03:09-1:03:15:**  game of it all is sort of going okay ah right that'll grow so you start to do the old analog  
**1:03:15-1:03:19:**  thing where you go oh that will grow I know that those two or those five species have  
**1:03:19-1:03:27:**  similar requirements you know you know whether they can tolerate wet soils or drought or  
**1:03:27-1:03:34:**  whatever stony whatever it is frost hot blah blah so that's a good starting point the other  
**1:03:34-1:03:40:**  thing is what sort of production are you in for are you looking because you know when  
**1:03:40-1:03:45:**  I based on your last point the thing that I thought was missing in that point was how  
**1:03:45-1:03:51:**  much time do you have because you know that all these things to get them to where you  
**1:03:51-1:03:55:**  want them to get to means that you've got to spend time on it and how much time have  
**1:03:55-1:04:06:**  you got to spend in your week or year to allocate to that so that's an addition so so so therefore  
**1:04:06-1:04:14:**  are you looking at a particular regime of non non non forest of non timber products  
**1:04:14-1:04:21:**  or are you looking at timber products either or whatever so what are you trying to go for  
**1:04:21-1:04:26:**  there and then all right so you've got that broad regime and you might have 50 species  
**1:04:26-1:04:34:**  that are sort of mapped out there and then the next step from that I think is to go and  
**1:04:34-1:04:39:**  look at the kind of platform that we've developed where you'll go and so what I've just spoken  
**1:04:39-1:04:42:**  about there is where you're looking at the climate layer you're going okay what what  
**1:04:42-1:04:46:**  are my climate climatic characteristics and then I'm looking at the geography layer so  
**1:04:46-1:04:52:**  I'm looking at what's the landscape capability what are its characteristics how wet how dry  
**1:04:52-1:04:59:**  how wet you know all of that stuff how hot how cold all of that and how that interacts  
**1:04:59-1:05:05:**  with the landscape those two going through those two layers will then have you come down  
**1:05:05-1:05:13:**  to looking at all right well what shape is your land got where are those zones you know  
**1:05:13-1:05:20:**  do you have rocky zones do you have really fertile zones you might go on so all right  
**1:05:20-1:05:26:**  well I've got this really fertile zone and it's well drained and I really like the idea  
**1:05:26-1:05:31:**  of planting olives high production olives but I also want to use that for other crop  
**1:05:31-1:05:38:**  purposes or pastoral purposes so you might go wider spacing on the olives therefore or  
**1:05:38-1:05:43:**  whatever it is I've got a I've got a higher rise here which has still got relatively deep  
**1:05:43-1:05:50:**  soil and I've got really deep soil with a metre of drainage no problem and I really  
**1:05:50-1:05:57:**  like the idea of having avocados all that sort of thing but then you go well gee actually  
**1:05:57-1:06:00:**  I don't have enough time to do all of that I've only got x amount of time I don't want  
**1:06:00-1:06:05:**  to be doing a non a non timber product I'm looking more at doing a team of product because  
**1:06:05-1:06:13:**  timber products timber managing timber plantations takes less time than than managing non timber  
**1:06:13-1:06:18:**  plant planting so you go well I'm going to have a different integration I might just  
**1:06:18-1:06:22:**  focus on my flow lines in the property which you know you determined by looking at your  
**1:06:22-1:06:29:**  geography the layout of the place I might have some higher landscapes which are quite  
**1:06:29-1:06:36:**  bare and exposed ridges and so on they might be a good place to go and put some plantings  
**1:06:36-1:06:43:**  of you know full canopy closure block plantings and so on but then I've got alleys and stuff  
**1:06:43-1:06:47:**  I've got roads that I'm building through the place and you go gee it'd be nice to have  
**1:06:47-1:06:52:**  some trees that which define that and I might do those in a particular way so that I might  
**1:06:52-1:06:58:**  plant them a bit more densely so that I can take out every two or three over time manage  
**1:06:58-1:07:04:**  the coppice that comes off that or I might turn them into chestnuts or oaks or you know  
**1:07:04-1:07:07:**  you start to really open that up and that's where it's important to go and look at the  
**1:07:07-1:07:12:**  world of what people are doing and engaging you know like forums of the type that we've  
**1:07:12-1:07:17:**  got so you can sort of put the question say hey what do you think about this but also  
**1:07:17-1:07:22:**  go around and look at what other people are doing in your area and beyond so that you  
**1:07:22-1:07:30:**  can decide what's going to go where so a it's a capability thing but b it's also your so  
**1:07:30-1:07:37:**  when I look at capability that's your capability and the land's capability and then you're  
**1:07:37-1:07:43:**  also looking at how it all fits together what's the integration because agroforestry is about  
**1:07:43-1:07:49:**  integration ultimately so it's about how you're going to fit in agricultural systems which  
**1:07:49-1:07:57:**  are you know livestock and crops and so on in with horticultural systems potentially  
**1:07:57-1:08:04:**  which is often when you're talking about the non wood the non timber forest products and  
**1:08:04-1:08:08:**  then you've got the forest sorry the timber product stuff which you're putting in there  
**1:08:08-1:08:14:**  as well so how are they all going to fit together and how well can I do all of this with the  
**1:08:14-1:08:19:**  human resources time etc that I've got and that's how we sort of look at pulling it all  
**1:08:19-1:08:24:**  together there's so many so much layering that goes on here and that's why you know  
**1:08:24-1:08:30:**  the the platform that we use is really good for that because so much of you know when  
**1:08:30-1:08:37:**  you when you study the when you put put the landscape through say a key line geographic  
**1:08:37-1:08:44:**  analysis which divides the landscape into ridges into valleys and then to primary land  
**1:08:44-1:08:51:**  units once you do that then that together with the development of some of the water  
**1:08:51-1:08:57:**  resources and roads road networks and water harvesting networks once you put those things  
**1:08:57-1:09:02:**  together then the position of where trees will go will actually follow all of those  
**1:09:02-1:09:08:**  those lines so they'll follow the the lines of the geography they'll follow the lines  
**1:09:08-1:09:14:**  of the water and they'll follow the lines of access and then from that yeah and then  
**1:09:14-1:09:19:**  from that will follow the lines of where you put fencing and and so on so that's something  
**1:09:19-1:09:24:**  that I wanted us to maybe elaborate a bit more on this when you look at your at the  
**1:09:24-1:09:29:**  scale of permanence that you've adapted from humans if I understand correctly and you've  
**1:09:29-1:09:34:**  clearly there's an order of kind of of of priority if you could say it in that way I'm  
**1:09:34-1:09:39:**  sure you've got a better way to say it yeah I say priority yeah a priority so there's  
**1:09:39-1:09:44:**  of course climate defines everything geography very difficult to change and then you have  
**1:09:44-1:09:50:**  water and then access and then forestry so why is water and access above forestry when  
**1:09:50-1:09:54:**  you're looking at what does that imply for for the design methodology what does that  
**1:09:54-1:10:02:**  mean for a farmer well I've been battling with this one a bit lately because I've been  
**1:10:02-1:10:07:**  having a conversation with Alan Sowry and Jody Butterfield about this with the development  
**1:10:07-1:10:13:**  of their own or the continual development of holistic land planning, holistic management  
**1:10:13-1:10:19:**  land planning as a framework and a lot of holistic management people thanks to myself  
**1:10:19-1:10:26:**  and others like Ian Chapman have embedded the the yeoman's or the keyline scale of permanence  
**1:10:26-1:10:34:**  into their land planning and that's not how Sowry, Alan and Jody have and others have  
**1:10:34-1:10:41:**  sort of seen the best fit they don't see because and it all depends and this is a context thing  
**1:10:41-1:10:48:**  so if you're a graze if you're a grazier then where do trees fit in all of this well they  
**1:10:48-1:10:54:**  don't right if you're a hardcore grazier then trees don't you know we're going to grow adapted  
**1:10:54-1:11:00:**  at we're going to grow animals which are adapted to grasslands right and when you look at that  
**1:11:00-1:11:07:**  methodology of farm planning or land planning it really it actually puts fencing and puts  
**1:11:07-1:11:15:**  the fencing and water layers together right they use planning circles so they'll say all  
**1:11:15-1:11:20:**  right well water point water point water point water point there'll be a circumference around  
**1:11:20-1:11:25:**  that water point which is the maximum distance that animals should have to walk to and from  
**1:11:25-1:11:31:**  that water point otherwise their production will decrease and so you fence around that  
**1:11:31-1:11:38:**  right and you have these sort of cells which go from that now now that's okay yeah if that's  
**1:11:38-1:11:42:**  how you want to roll that's how you want to roll we look at things a bit more integratively  
**1:11:42-1:11:52:**  and so we'll say okay well there's a role for looking at all of these different layers  
**1:11:52-1:12:00:**  together so you'll start so obviously climate and geography you can't do much about so they  
**1:12:00-1:12:06:**  create what i call the rules of the game yeah and they are the constitutional or foundation  
**1:12:06-1:12:11:**  layers that's how i call them because they are just that then you get the water layer  
**1:12:11-1:12:19:**  well water is the great enabler um so and keyline as yeoman's described the keyline  
**1:12:19-1:12:26:**  plan was he described it as the control of water because when you control water whether  
**1:12:26-1:12:31:**  it's like for me it starts at the raindrop what are you doing as soon as that because  
**1:12:31-1:12:37:**  the moment that raindrop hits the land surface that's when all the action happens right and  
**1:12:37-1:12:43:**  it's either bad action or it's really great action right so and you're the manager so  
**1:12:43-1:12:49:**  what are you doing about that is it hitting a canopy of of leaves and then cascading through  
**1:12:49-1:12:55:**  that canopy of leaves and catalyzing a whole series of processes is it coming down and  
**1:12:55-1:13:03:**  landing on bare soil is it coming onto a grassland that's got a mat of litter on the soil surface  
**1:13:03-1:13:09:**  yeah there's all different options there but you as a manager can take make choices about  
**1:13:09-1:13:17:**  about how that interaction will occur right and so that's a really key parameter but then  
**1:13:17-1:13:24:**  you get down to well i need water to to for myself in storage i need it for livestock  
**1:13:24-1:13:28:**  so i needed it so i need some source of water so i need to acknowledge what the sources  
**1:13:28-1:13:33:**  of water are because if i don't then it's going to make it make agricultural production  
**1:13:33-1:13:44:**  um of a of of any profitable agricultural production um difficult to to continue so  
**1:13:44-1:13:49:**  it is that's why it's there so it may all be there and therefore you don't have to worry  
**1:13:49-1:13:55:**  about it but it's positioning um especially if you start reticulating water with pipes  
**1:13:55-1:14:01:**  and all of that sort of thing that positioning of where those pipes all get reticulated will  
**1:14:01-1:14:08:**  then create a line right yeah and that line the position of that will have to generally  
**1:14:08-1:14:15:**  be based on landscape shape right on the on the on the on the geography so as soon as  
**1:14:15-1:14:19:**  you put that in then you go okay well something else is probably going to follow that line  
**1:14:19-1:14:26:**  right it may well be access so access and water are i think probably the most closely  
**1:14:26-1:14:36:**  linked layers um and then you've got um and then you've got uh so the forestry layer then  
**1:14:36-1:14:42:**  well often will follow that although the forestry layer is a bit of a funny one because it will  
**1:14:42-1:14:53:**  also have its own linkage to landscape so often for example you'll look at um putting  
**1:14:53-1:14:58:**  it well the first places that that forestry will often be integrated will be around the  
**1:14:58-1:15:04:**  edges to define the place and that's the first place to put shelter for example well this  
**1:15:04-1:15:09:**  is the way i look at it anyway because you'll have this artificial boundary called the property  
**1:15:09-1:15:16:**  boundary um depending on the scale of the property of course um which is an obvious  
**1:15:16-1:15:26:**  place to mark with trees and it protects and it encloses there's that word enclosure but  
**1:15:26-1:15:31:**  it's an obvious place to put something the other obvious place to put something are on  
**1:15:31-1:15:36:**  flow lines so where you've got water flow permanent water flow or or ephemeral flow  
**1:15:36-1:15:40:**  through your land often that's a limiting factor because you get seasonal inundation  
**1:15:40-1:15:46:**  and so on and so that's a limit that's a land capability limit and so to get land protection  
**1:15:46-1:15:52:**  and to make it take advantage of that of those seasonal or perennial flows it's a really  
**1:15:52-1:15:59:**  good place to and these are what i call biological corridors often so you can link the hills  
**1:15:59-1:16:07:**  with with the sea because the sea and the hills are linked by drainage lines so they're  
**1:16:07-1:16:12:**  only natural that if you and and if they have poorer capability it seems natural to me that  
**1:16:12-1:16:18:**  you would go and put trees into that system right as a and then they just happen to divide  
**1:16:18-1:16:23:**  the landscape up because you've got ridge valley ridge valley ridge valley so you've  
**1:16:23-1:16:29:**  got that that means you can you know you you can start to divide the landscape up by virtue  
**1:16:29-1:16:34:**  of these geographic lines and it makes it easy for you then to make decisions about  
**1:16:34-1:16:43:**  where things go it's just a matter of what those species complexes are going to be there  
**1:16:43-1:16:46:**  and then you got and then you got the rest of the landscape yeah right the ridges and  
**1:16:46-1:16:50:**  that's where you you know you might look at a whole right you know whether that's going  
**1:16:50-1:16:55:**  to be production stuff because you're a tree person or it's going to be stuff which is  
**1:16:55-1:17:01:**  more supporting what you do which is probably the more classic agroforestry approach where  
**1:17:01-1:17:06:**  you you know you're spacing trees out widely as a shelter or as an amenity planting and  
**1:17:06-1:17:15:**  so on interesting it's it's like adapting design in to the to the to what the landscape  
**1:17:15-1:17:24:**  is is calling out sure it's it's nearly biomimicry in a way with an adaptation to our to satisfy  
**1:17:24-1:17:31:**  our needs and our economy yeah and it's interesting when when we look at the way aboriginal people  
**1:17:31-1:17:38:**  in this country managed their landscapes through the use of fire in particular that's where  
**1:17:38-1:17:45:**  they left trees are not that different to where to how I just described the layout so  
**1:17:45-1:17:52:**  interesting yeah it is well because I think they understood that and still do understand  
**1:17:52-1:17:57:**  that flow lines for example are the conduits they're the connect they're the natural connections  
**1:17:57-1:18:05:**  they're the that's where that's all the nutrients flows in water so of course they're nutrient  
**1:18:05-1:18:13:**  corridors so why wouldn't you have the full floristic expression which then allows the  
**1:18:13-1:18:19:**  full biodiversity expression to actually be in those same lines right and then connect  
**1:18:19-1:18:26:**  the forest with the or connect the the hills with the ocean I had a bit of a of a challenge  
**1:18:26-1:18:32:**  understanding why the economy layer is at the bottom and to explain myself it's interesting  
**1:18:32-1:18:37:**  that you know when we look at setting up a farm business which we've done at Massey Farm  
**1:18:37-1:18:43:**  the economy is is what at the end of the day just as much as the soil I mean and they're  
**1:18:43-1:18:50:**  connected in in in very complex ways of course but the economy is also what defines our success  
**1:18:50-1:18:56:**  on that landscape or not in terms of a family in terms of a family farm and so the economy  
**1:18:56-1:19:02:**  layer has a lot in my opinion it has a lot of weight there and I was wondering why you  
**1:19:02-1:19:07:**  decided to put in number 10 and why it's not a consideration that's number nine apologies  
**1:19:07-1:19:14:**  yeah yeah yeah number 10 is energy do my homework good enough yeah that's okay well look I think  
**1:19:14-1:19:20:**  this is the problem I may may have not done enough explanation on this I mean our our  
**1:19:20-1:19:27:**  platform yes while it was adapted from yeoman's eight scale of eight layer or eight factor  
**1:19:27-1:19:32:**  scale of permanence is not a scale of permanence it's got elements to that and you can certainly  
**1:19:32-1:19:37:**  look at it that way but I look at more of his checklist and I think that with every  
**1:19:37-1:19:44:**  within every layer that you go you will consider every other layer so just because I've happened  
**1:19:44-1:19:53:**  to pay homage to PA yeomans by retaining his first eight as it were because there's a natural  
**1:19:53-1:19:58:**  logic to that I think in terms of the if you apply the scale of permanence and the way  
**1:19:58-1:20:04:**  that you will generally plan a farm out as I just said but so there's that part there's  
**1:20:04-1:20:11:**  the respect and homage but then there's also with my addition of economy and energy layers  
**1:20:11-1:20:15:**  when you look at when you go and look at the whole platform again you look at it as being  
**1:20:15-1:20:21:**  a checklist and you go okay well if I'm looking at the forestry layer I'm thinking about climate  
**1:20:21-1:20:24:**  I'm thinking about geography I'm thinking about water I'm thinking about access I'm  
**1:20:24-1:20:28:**  thinking about economy I'm thinking about energy I'm thinking about so you know so it  
**1:20:28-1:20:32:**  doesn't matter if I'm putting in a fence I'm thinking about economy I'm thinking about  
**1:20:32-1:20:38:**  it yeah you know so it doesn't matter it's not linear it's all integrated so it's just  
**1:20:38-1:20:46:**  more or less trying to have it so that we at least have a platform that considers as  
**1:20:46-1:20:58:**  much as we can because I in my in my search for platforms be it permaculture holistic  
**1:20:58-1:21:06:**  management whole farm planning on it goes in all of these different methodologies that  
**1:21:06-1:21:11:**  I've seen out there they don't they don't catch it all holistic management doesn't do  
**1:21:11-1:21:15:**  anything doesn't say anything in its land planning about how you integrate trees into  
**1:21:15-1:21:19:**  the landscape it's got nothing about that yeoman scale of permanence had nothing to  
**1:21:19-1:21:27:**  do about the economy or energy it had nothing to do with with legal issues or your own personal  
**1:21:27-1:21:35:**  context and so on permaculture it's it's you know it is what it is it had missing gaps  
**1:21:35-1:21:41:**  as far as I could tell as well particularly when it came I mean it's very community based  
**1:21:41-1:21:53:**  as opposed to individually centered and so on and a lot of its economic well the kind  
**1:21:53-1:22:00:**  of economic principles that it would support I suppose are often more to the left of center  
**1:22:00-1:22:07:**  than to the right of center so they're often more community based and then being individual  
**1:22:07-1:22:13:**  enterprise based and so on so so people will feel like and that's perfectly fine if that's  
**1:22:13-1:22:19:**  your context and then so what I've tried to do on what and that's what we tried to do  
**1:22:19-1:22:27:**  as a as a community is try to have it so that people have a broader range of options as  
**1:22:27-1:22:35:**  opposed to just following one church as it were being poly polytheistic not monotheistic  
**1:22:35-1:22:45:**  okay and I'm curious to know how holistic management because it's something that you  
**1:22:45-1:22:50:**  work a lot with as well from what I understood how does that fit into again a farmer is making  
**1:22:50-1:22:55:**  trying to make decisions as to what trees to plant what tree to plant at what place  
**1:22:55-1:23:02:**  how does holistic management help him to achieve that goal well the first thing that holistic  
**1:23:02-1:23:08:**  management invites you to do is develop your own individual context so what you as an individual  
**1:23:08-1:23:16:**  so like I said that's a very big distinction I would say from permaculture per se where  
**1:23:16-1:23:23:**  they work really well together and and permaculture holistic management and key line are really  
**1:23:23-1:23:29:**  good buddies as planning frameworks I think but I think what people have got to do is  
**1:23:29-1:23:35:**  sort of break down their natural tendency to follow one religion as opposed to multi  
**1:23:35-1:23:40:**  multiple religions and that's just the human tendency because if you've been raised in  
**1:23:40-1:23:45:**  any of the abriamic faiths for example and there's only one God right and there's only  
**1:23:45-1:23:52:**  one way to worship it or he or she or whatever it is so you know again there's a psychological  
**1:23:52-1:23:57:**  social psychological underpinning to the way that we decide about how we're going to follow  
**1:23:57-1:24:05:**  things and so we thought you know we're a biodynamic farmer you know what I mean yeah  
**1:24:05-1:24:12:**  so when we look at holistic management the first thing that I think has us consider is  
**1:24:12-1:24:17:**  what is our context what's the context of us you know what what are our core motivations  
**1:24:17-1:24:24:**  but then how they link in to the people that are around us you know usually our loved ones  
**1:24:24-1:24:29:**  our family and so on and what's and ask them the same question what's their context that  
**1:24:29-1:24:37:**  then has you if you have the right inquiry yeah I should go back a moment holistic management's  
**1:24:37-1:24:45:**  greatest coverage with people is the grazing community it's not with the forestry community  
**1:24:45-1:24:51:**  or the business community or anything like that so and if you look at the permaculture  
**1:24:51-1:24:58:**  community a lot of people in permaculture just happen to be more into horticulture because  
**1:24:58-1:25:03:**  of the perennial nature the perennial woody nature of it and where it was born and all  
**1:25:03-1:25:12:**  of the rest of it so so most people are into that so therefore for a lot of them the consideration  
**1:25:12-1:25:19:**  is straight away for the grazing plan so like there's no there's no holistic management  
**1:25:19-1:25:28:**  forestry plan at this stage even the conversations we've been having about the the land planning  
**1:25:28-1:25:33:**  in holistic management is being that it's being changed from holistic land planning  
**1:25:33-1:25:40:**  to holistic land planning for livestock so there's nothing that I can see on the horizon  
**1:25:40-1:25:46:**  which is saying holistic land planning for agroforestry but if that's your thing but  
**1:25:46-1:25:51:**  if that's your thing then the holistic management framework in terms of its decision making  
**1:25:51-1:25:56:**  framework which is sort of asking a series of questions economic and otherwise and its  
**1:25:56-1:26:03:**  financial planning frameworks and so on can all help you can all aid you to make better  
**1:26:03-1:26:11:**  decisions about about what you will plant where and why it's probably more the why questions  
**1:26:11-1:26:18:**  and the what questions and try and help you make sure that you're asking the right questions  
**1:26:18-1:26:23:**  about your economy on all of this which you know largely the permaculture space doesn't  
**1:26:23-1:26:26:**  look at I mean there's no there's nothing in the permaculture principles which talks  
**1:26:26-1:26:32:**  about your personal economy yeah right so yeah you can use those principles but there's  
**1:26:32-1:26:41:**  no permaculture financial planning framework for example right so that's where I think  
**1:26:41-1:26:47:**  again you know it's it's really useful to use permaculture principles key line the key  
**1:26:47-1:26:52:**  line plan and holistic management together it's it's you know you're picking you know  
**1:26:52-1:26:57:**  you pick your best best options to do the best things and bring that together as an  
**1:26:57-1:27:03:**  amalgam which in it cases it's like agroforestry itself I mean you're trying to assemble a  
**1:27:03-1:27:08:**  hole here yeah and there'll be a bit of this that you use and a bit of that and yeah so  
**1:27:08-1:27:16:**  holistic management I think is the best framework that I've come come across as far as answering  
**1:27:16-1:27:21:**  those and especially those initial guiding questions yeah about what are your motivations  
**1:27:21-1:27:26:**  and all of the rest and then then then you go from there and start to pick and choose  
**1:27:26-1:27:31:**  your methodologies which which will advance you further you know when you when you're  
**1:27:31-1:27:38:**  talking now about this integration agroforestry but also what what you clearly what's clearly  
**1:27:38-1:27:42:**  observable in the scale of permanence all these different elements need to work together  
**1:27:42-1:27:46:**  and the forestry and then there's you and as you call it the climate of the mind and  
**1:27:46-1:27:51:**  there's there's a lot of social context it needs to come together to create a business  
**1:27:51-1:27:57:**  that is when looking at a farm that is economically viable and ecologically regenerative at this  
**1:27:57-1:28:01:**  point we can't even say sustainable but doesn't that somehow seem like an insurmountable  
**1:28:01-1:28:07:**  task it's it requires so much complexity have you seen it in practice like happened where  
**1:28:07-1:28:13:**  there's a farm is just boom and just created this and here we are yeah they're really they're  
**1:28:13-1:28:26:**  really rare and what they require is an enormous amount of discipline there's usually yeah  
**1:28:26-1:28:32:**  this this is one of the things that I suppose I've I've been in my sort of post permaculture  
**1:28:32-1:28:37:**  period because permaculture you know really is funded is founded on idealism a lot of  
**1:28:37-1:28:42:**  this stuff is and then even yeoman's stuff was funded on founded on some form of idealism  
**1:28:42-1:28:49:**  then yeoman's was a wealthy relatively he was a self-made guy who'd made a lot of money  
**1:28:49-1:28:56:**  during the war and so on and bought a few farms and he expressed himself as a lot of  
**1:28:56-1:29:03:**  people have done over the years over thousands of years that the best way to express their  
**1:29:03-1:29:08:**  their wealth was to go and buy an estate and to develop those estates and and have managers  
**1:29:08-1:29:13:**  on there and bring their friends out and you know all that sort of stuff so he's he's just  
**1:29:13-1:29:17:**  as so often has happened in in the broader regenerative agriculture movement if you look  
**1:29:17-1:29:24:**  at a lot of the leaders of it the leading figures they're wealthy men so and often self-made  
**1:29:24-1:29:30:**  men and really driven men and that's where that's how they've been able to do that they've  
**1:29:30-1:29:37:**  been able to self subsidize their own endeavors and to prove a point and you know so they're  
**1:29:37-1:29:44:**  they're really they're you know they're individually highly driven people right and then you get  
**1:29:44-1:29:49:**  to the rest of us and I think this is where you're getting to and that's what I try and  
**1:29:49-1:29:53:**  remind people to say look you know I work really closely with Joel Salatin for example  
**1:29:53-1:29:57:**  he's a great friend and people look at what he's doing and what his family's doing and  
**1:29:57-1:30:05:**  they've done an amazing job but what they've achieved is as a is based on a whole range  
**1:30:05-1:30:14:**  of different reasons I mean their religiosity their ethnic background how the their work  
**1:30:14-1:30:23:**  ethic which is all closely intertwined and and their outlook on life you know they don't  
**1:30:23-1:30:28:**  they don't play sport for example you know then so you look at people here in Australia  
**1:30:28-1:30:33:**  for example or elsewhere you know football and cricket and different games are really  
**1:30:33-1:30:40:**  important in community life but they all take or golf all take up time or being social animals  
**1:30:40-1:30:45:**  right going catching up fishing recreation and stuff you look at the Salitans they don't  
**1:30:45-1:30:50:**  do much of that if they do it they do a lot of it on their own farm they hunt on their  
**1:30:50-1:30:54:**  farm they you know only relatively recently have afforded themselves the license to go  
**1:30:54-1:31:03:**  and take vacations so you know that those choices are reflected in the way that that  
**1:31:03-1:31:10:**  their places happen to have been developed but other people like me I like to go to the  
**1:31:10-1:31:14:**  football on the weekend when I or there's other people who are very involved in local  
**1:31:14-1:31:18:**  community life and so on so that's going to take away time that you've got from being  
**1:31:18-1:31:26:**  a land manager yeah so there's time well that's right which exactly so that's going to knock  
**1:31:26-1:31:31:**  off the amount of complexity and variability that you can then deal with so that's that's  
**1:31:31-1:31:37:**  a really big part of what we try and capture early is just how much this why I made the  
**1:31:37-1:31:41:**  point before how much time do you have yeah because if you don't have the time then don't  
**1:31:41-1:31:48:**  do it or downgrade your like if you you know if you're looking again at the forestry integration  
**1:31:48-1:31:54:**  into your into your system then just plant trees and shrubs and stuff and just do it  
**1:31:54-1:32:01:**  for biodiversity purposes and maybe a bit of firewood if you're lucky a saw log or two  
**1:32:01-1:32:07:**  because you won't don't bother trying to get the really high you know you get into Rowan  
**1:32:07-1:32:12:**  Reads and you look at what he's doing or an Andrew Stewart's or any of these sort of you  
**1:32:12-1:32:19:**  know really high high operating farms they don't get that just because of luck they get  
**1:32:19-1:32:24:**  it because a lot of bloody hard work and really strategic dedication has gone but that that's  
**1:32:24-1:32:29:**  at the cost of other well not cost but they haven't been able to do a lot of other things  
**1:32:29-1:32:37:**  in their life that others have chosen to do so that's that's where you're at and that's  
**1:32:37-1:32:42:**  where holistic management seems this is something that we've suffered from at Massey Farm and  
**1:32:42-1:32:45:**  we did not do enough planning at the beginning this is why we're drilling into the whole  
**1:32:45-1:32:51:**  planning side right now with you because you are a planning a farm planning educator and  
**1:32:51-1:32:56:**  you have a lot of experience in this so I can't stress enough for our experience how  
**1:32:56-1:33:02:**  how much we have suffered from this lack of planning and and how much we would have you  
**1:33:02-1:33:07:**  know clarifying our context our personal needs you know it's also very personal experience  
**1:33:07-1:33:10:**  like what do I want to do with my life what do I want to dedicate time to how much time  
**1:33:10-1:33:15:**  to want to give to this and that as you've just explained really well and and then when  
**1:33:15-1:33:19:**  you get engaged with a piece of land and with the project you you can't get out you're all  
**1:33:19-1:33:27:**  in kind of thing so it's it took me a while because I'm a natural innovator and that's  
**1:33:27-1:33:33:**  where it comes down to you to acknowledgement of your own personality type of whatnot which  
**1:33:33-1:33:39:**  is something I have developed over time to acknowledge but I that's what I accelerate  
**1:33:39-1:33:46:**  now when I'm dealing with people in our programs is not only understand what you want but understand  
**1:33:46-1:33:53:**  who you are so do you have a propensity to want to innovate all of the time all right  
**1:33:53-1:34:00:**  well if you have that propensity then realize what that what the implications of that are  
**1:34:00-1:34:06:**  because you know being high as I call it high on innovation all the time can cripple you  
**1:34:06-1:34:12:**  because you've got to actually have the discipline to not be you know yes be innovative but do  
**1:34:12-1:34:17:**  it do it the right amount like companies only you know the best companies in the world only  
**1:34:17-1:34:22:**  innovate to will only spend about five to ten percent of their of their income on innovation  
**1:34:22-1:34:29:**  and there's you know because if they go any higher than that then then it cripples them  
**1:34:29-1:34:36:**  it's just not economic so there's reasons for that right so I remember years ago we're  
**1:34:36-1:34:43:**  in the United States and a couple came up to us and I know about that about the same  
**1:34:43-1:34:51:**  age as us and the woman came up and said I'm so tired my my hut they were permaculturists  
**1:34:51-1:34:58:**  and you know chasing this what I would call on my asthma of outcomes you know everything  
**1:34:58-1:35:08:**  you've got to have every animal every tree you know this sort of utopian ideal and it's  
**1:35:08-1:35:15:**  trying to keep up with that complexity meant though over the top on innovation all the  
**1:35:15-1:35:20:**  time and the woman's they've been doing it for 20 years and all that said I'm really  
**1:35:20-1:35:25:**  tired I've been you know I just can't keep up like she'd realized earlier than her husband  
**1:35:25-1:35:33:**  had and she was the yeah I just caught up with her and I thought yeah yeah and I've  
**1:35:33-1:35:38:**  you know I've been the same I've had to deal with that myself but luckily I've pretty well  
**1:35:38-1:35:43:**  put that genie in the bottle and it's hard to because you get excited I mean the natural  
**1:35:43-1:35:48:**  excitement is about how you'd like a place to look and be expressed and it's an expression  
**1:35:48-1:35:56:**  of yourself and so on and yeah if you don't have the capability will then you don't so  
**1:35:56-1:36:05:**  be be at home with that if the best you can do is have a really great shelter belt and  
**1:36:05-1:36:10:**  it's you know it doesn't being pruned as well as you like and stuff I mean it's often the  
**1:36:10-1:36:14:**  thing you know people's ego comes in again here where you have people over and you start  
**1:36:14-1:36:20:**  making excuses for why things aren't as they are as they could be especially when you're  
**1:36:20-1:36:25:**  in this broader space when you know everyone's so high on how everything can be so bloody  
**1:36:25-1:36:30:**  fantastic I mean they look interesting but because they you know you look at all the  
**1:36:30-1:36:35:**  gods in this space whether it's some of the newer gods like Richard Perkins or whether  
**1:36:35-1:36:42:**  you look at some of the older gods like a Joe Salatin or otherwise or a Rowan Reed or  
**1:36:42-1:36:47:**  any number of people in this space and you go there and you go oh my god you know this  
**1:36:47-1:36:54:**  everything's so bloody fantastic and then there's me and I just can't I can't just I'm  
**1:36:54-1:36:59:**  just not that I'm just not that good well maybe it's not that you're not that good it's  
**1:36:59-1:37:04:**  maybe just making other choices in your life to do other things maybe you're a better father  
**1:37:04-1:37:07:**  maybe maybe you're a better you know you've got more time for other things maybe you spent  
**1:37:07-1:37:13:**  you see your mum more often you know you spend more time with your kids than some of these  
**1:37:13-1:37:19:**  folks do maybe they pull it off who knows you know but you know we're all into and that's  
**1:37:19-1:37:23:**  that's where I get back to again you know don't don't put yourself under so much pressure  
**1:37:23-1:37:31:**  because if you do you'll you may well be very disappointed in yourself which is not a good  
**1:37:31-1:37:39:**  feeling for sure that's very interesting I think that's a really nice way to to finish  
**1:37:39-1:37:46:**  the interview some important considerations have come out here of you know what decisions  
**1:37:46-1:37:51:**  to make for your farm how to what kind of farmer to be what kind of agroforestry to  
**1:37:51-1:38:00:**  be and I think that's these are the this is the starting point I think for a farmer that's  
**1:38:00-1:38:04:**  transitioning or for a farmer that's it's getting started from scratch and buying piece  
**1:38:04-1:38:10:**  of land it's it's a starting point well I think I think even a beaver would say don't  
**1:38:10-1:38:22:**  bite off more than you can chew you know I actually really want to do the recs training  
**1:38:22-1:38:29:**  and maybe next one starts on August the second August the second okay and how do how do we  
**1:38:29-1:38:35:**  find out more about it if we want to join well you go to regrarian.org and if you look  
**1:38:35-1:38:43:**  on our web page there's a really big sign that says recs fantastic obviously it'll make  
**1:38:43-1:38:50:**  it really easy for you that's the best okay yeah perfect yeah it starts on the it starts  
**1:38:50-1:39:00:**  on the second of August in the in your time zone so and then our time zone it's on the  
**1:39:00-1:39:06:**  third of August to the same day okay and it runs for 13 weeks continuous weeks there's  
**1:39:06-1:39:11:**  a webinar on the Tuesday or Monday depending on where you are and then another one so that's  
**1:39:11-1:39:18:**  like the layer where we introduced that that week's layer and then we and then on the on  
**1:39:18-1:39:22:**  the latter part of the week we have another one which is a Q&A where we check in and check  
**1:39:22-1:39:28:**  in on the task work that you've submitted and all of that sort of thing or any other  
**1:39:28-1:39:36:**  questions it's pretty open what's the pricing and that's also it's 95 US a month for 12  
**1:39:36-1:39:42:**  months because it's you get two 13-week programs in that period okay because it's again it's  
**1:39:42-1:39:50:**  it's it's it's us responding to what people's capabilities are because we've done enough  
**1:39:50-1:39:54:**  courses to know that even 13 weeks you know spending six hours a week which is the sort  
**1:39:54-1:40:00:**  of ultimate amount at least that you should be spending people just can't do that so we  
**1:40:00-1:40:05:**  say I'll do the first recs and you might just focus on getting your context sorted and getting  
**1:40:05-1:40:10:**  your maps sorted and you know focus on some of the key layers maybe where your pipes are  
**1:40:10-1:40:15:**  or this that or the other depending on what your interests are and then do the next one  
**1:40:15-1:40:19:**  later in the year and then you might say oh this is where I'm going to look at my because  
**1:40:19-1:40:23:**  I've spent the time looking at my land because we've taught you how to look at your land  
**1:40:23-1:40:28:**  differently and so on that's where you might interesting I'll be better equipped to start  
**1:40:28-1:40:33:**  making decisions about where trees will go or you know this that or different soil treatments  
**1:40:33-1:40:39:**  and so on even trick even how you're gonna set things up for yourself financially and  
**1:40:39-1:40:44:**  otherwise so yeah it's a longitudinal process and this is where I was saying earlier about  
**1:40:44-1:40:48:**  you're a perennial and you know our programs are perennial that's why we've got a 12 month  
**1:40:48-1:40:54:**  program okay and once you've done that 12 month program then you're you remain a member  
**1:40:54-1:41:00:**  for life of our of our workplace and the planner level so you can witness every recs that we  
**1:41:00-1:41:06:**  ever do in the future okay if you want to participate in it fully and have us involved  
**1:41:06-1:41:13:**  in our high level of engagement will then you have to pay but yeah we want we want people  
**1:41:13-1:41:19:**  who are who have become our alumni to then come and support others who come before them

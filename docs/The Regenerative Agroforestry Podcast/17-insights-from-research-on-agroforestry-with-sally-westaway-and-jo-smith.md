### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sun, 07 Mar 2021 18:45:31)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:47:**  Hi everyone and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:49:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:49-0:00:52:**  Today we have the pleasure of sharing with you an interview with Sally Westerway and  
**0:00:52-0:00:53:**  Joe Smith.  
**0:00:53-0:00:57:**  Both of them worked until recently at the Organic Research Centre in the UK and have  
**0:00:57-0:01:02:**  done research on two farms that we have already featured on the podcast, Wakelands and Tolhurst  
**0:01:02-0:01:03:**  Organics.  
**0:01:03-0:01:07:**  It's great to get a slightly different perspective on agroforestry and understand what scientific  
**0:01:07-0:01:10:**  research on the topic looks like.  
**0:01:10-0:01:13:**  Sally and Joe do a great job at bringing some nuance to the conversation on topics such  
**0:01:13-0:01:19:**  as productivity or diversity of agroforestry systems and they do so in very practical terms.  
**0:01:19-0:01:20:**  Enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:20-0:01:22:**  Hi Sally, hi Joe, welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:22-0:01:24:**  Hi Etienne, nice to be here.  
**0:01:24-0:01:30:**  I was thinking we could start with a brief introduction of who you are, a bit about how  
**0:01:30-0:01:33:**  you got interested in agroforestry.  
**0:01:33-0:01:34:**  Maybe Sally you want to start?  
**0:01:34-0:01:35:**  Yeah sure.  
**0:01:35-0:01:37:**  So I'm Sally Westerway.  
**0:01:37-0:01:43:**  I worked at the Organic Research Centre for about seven years in total as an agroforestry  
**0:01:43-0:01:48:**  researcher and I came from a bit of a diverse background, sort of a bit of plant ecology  
**0:01:48-0:01:54:**  and a bit of organic horticulture, so growing vegetables organically.  
**0:01:54-0:01:59:**  And they sort of came together really in agroforestry, the woodland ecology that I was working on  
**0:01:59-0:02:02:**  and the organic horticulture.  
**0:02:02-0:02:06:**  And my first project was looking at hedges and how to incorporate hedges into a farming  
**0:02:06-0:02:11:**  system and then I moved on from there to work on various different aspects of agroforestry.  
**0:02:11-0:02:15:**  I've now actually left the Organic Research Centre and I'm back in horticulture.  
**0:02:15-0:02:18:**  Hi everyone, yeah so I'm Joe Smith.  
**0:02:18-0:02:23:**  I also worked at the Organic Research Centre, worked closely with Sally and I was there  
**0:02:23-0:02:30:**  for 10 years coming from a PhD investigating agroenvironment scheme options and their effects  
**0:02:30-0:02:33:**  on earthworms and other soil organisms.  
**0:02:33-0:02:39:**  I always had an interest in organic farming and organic systems and agroforestry just  
**0:02:39-0:02:45:**  seemed kind of like the pinnacle of agroecological methods because it could kind of deliver productivity  
**0:02:45-0:02:49:**  whilst at the same time kind of helping with protection of the environment.  
**0:02:49-0:02:55:**  So I was there for 10 years with Sally we built up the Agroforestry Research Program  
**0:02:55-0:03:02:**  and worked closely with farmers who were kind of pioneering in terms of developing agroforestry  
**0:03:02-0:03:05:**  in the UK.  
**0:03:05-0:03:12:**  Well yeah it actually, we decided to interview you as well as a kind of following up on the  
**0:03:12-0:03:20:**  episodes we did with Ian Tallhurst and David from Wakelands Farm and it was really interesting  
**0:03:20-0:03:25:**  we got their kind of practical farm manager take on things and we thought it would be  
**0:03:25-0:03:32:**  great to have a bit more about the scientific data because both of them actually mentioned  
**0:03:32-0:03:36:**  their collaboration with the Organic Research Centre.  
**0:03:36-0:03:41:**  Maybe you want to give us a bit of an overview of your work on both of these farms?  
**0:03:41-0:03:48:**  Sure, yeah so well from the very start of my time at ORC I worked very closely with  
**0:03:48-0:03:57:**  Martin Wolf who set up Wakelands Agroforestry over 25 years ago now and he also worked at  
**0:03:57-0:04:02:**  the Organic Research Centre as a scientific advisor.  
**0:04:02-0:04:08:**  So we did several projects up there, it's a really great system, it's probably unique  
**0:04:08-0:04:16:**  in terms of diversity and also maturity, there's not many agroforestry systems in the UK to  
**0:04:16-0:04:18:**  work with to choose from.  
**0:04:18-0:04:23:**  In terms of working with Tolly, well the Organic Research Centre had worked with Tolly on various  
**0:04:23-0:04:30:**  projects for a long time, he's a key figure in at the Organic Research Centre but he was  
**0:04:30-0:04:37:**  also very interested in wood, he loves timber, he built a timber boat and he was very keen  
**0:04:37-0:04:44:**  to have trees within his vegetable growing system and so we worked with him and also  
**0:04:44-0:04:50:**  with Woodland Trust to set up an agroforestry system there integrating the vegetable growing  
**0:04:50-0:04:51:**  with trees.  
**0:04:51-0:04:57:**  Yeah and I sort of dovetailed I guess a bit on some of the work that Joe was involved  
**0:04:57-0:05:03:**  in which was more in the planted agroforestry systems and looking at the management of the  
**0:05:03-0:05:08:**  existing trees on the farms and the hedges and trying to find ways to make those economic  
**0:05:08-0:05:14:**  for the farmer and bring them back into the farming system and we did some work on that  
**0:05:14-0:05:19:**  at both Wakelands and at Tolhurst as well as other different farms and I think Tolly  
**0:05:19-0:05:22:**  has probably mentioned in his podcast a bit about the woodchip work that we did there  
**0:05:22-0:05:24:**  as well, looking at the Ramia woodchip.  
**0:05:24-0:05:30:**  Yeah he did actually and that gives us so much to talk about today.  
**0:05:30-0:05:37:**  One of the first themes I wanted to kind of discuss with you today is the one of interactions  
**0:05:37-0:05:42:**  between crops in the agroforestry systems.  
**0:05:42-0:05:47:**  As we integrate different crops, you know, many farmers have concerns of maybe competition  
**0:05:47-0:05:51:**  between your main crop and the trees that you're going to plant but also on the other  
**0:05:51-0:05:58:**  side often you know agroforestry is promoted for its ecosystem services and helping the  
**0:05:58-0:06:04:**  production of the main crop so I was thinking that maybe through your research maybe you  
**0:06:04-0:06:09:**  had come across this theme and researched it and you know obviously here the aim isn't  
**0:06:09-0:06:17:**  to go for massive generalizations about agroforestry but I was just curious to see if you had done  
**0:06:17-0:06:21:**  some in-depth research on some of these interactions.  
**0:06:21-0:06:26:**  Yeah we've had several projects looking at this because obviously it is of real importance  
**0:06:26-0:06:33:**  to farmers and you know the classic edge effect is you see that around most fields whereby  
**0:06:33-0:06:38:**  yields are lower at the edge and it can be for a whole number of reasons including shade  
**0:06:38-0:06:43:**  and you know kind of rabbits coming out and nibbling the crops and so it's quite hard  
**0:06:43-0:06:46:**  to disentangle all of those effects.  
**0:06:46-0:06:52:**  But we did some nice work in my early years working with Martin and it was in the mixed  
**0:06:52-0:06:57:**  timber and apple tree system so it's a system whereby there's seven different species of  
**0:06:57-0:07:04:**  trees and also apple trees and they're all mixed in together and the trees are managed  
**0:07:04-0:07:12:**  for timber so they're big trees, tall trees and Martin had noticed that the crops adjacent  
**0:07:12-0:07:18:**  to the Italian older seem to be taller than kind of adjacent to the other trees and he  
**0:07:18-0:07:23:**  was wondering whether that translated into any differences in crop yields and so one  
**0:07:23-0:07:29:**  summer we went out with the plot combine and harvested five meter length strips of the  
**0:07:29-0:07:35:**  cereals adjacent to the different tree species and measured crop yields and we were looking  
**0:07:35-0:07:41:**  at spring wheat, winter wheat and oats.  
**0:07:41-0:07:46:**  We didn't find any effective tree species on crop yields but what we found was at the  
**0:07:46-0:07:54:**  edge of the alleys, the crop alleys which are about 10 to 12 meter wide, we saw a decline  
**0:07:54-0:07:59:**  in crop yield which we kind of expected compared to the centre of the alleys.  
**0:07:59-0:08:04:**  What was quite interesting was that for the two wheats, the spring wheat and winter wheats,  
**0:08:04-0:08:08:**  the yields at the edge of the alley were about half what they were in the centre but for  
**0:08:08-0:08:15:**  the oats that decline in yield was only 25% so it just seems that oats is a kind of more  
**0:08:15-0:08:20:**  competitive species compared to the wheats and so it's something that you know farms  
**0:08:20-0:08:24:**  can bear in mind that there might be cereals, there might be crops that are better suited  
**0:08:24-0:08:30:**  for those kind of more shady conditions and actually there's some research going on in  
**0:08:30-0:08:37:**  France, in Spain at the University of Aix-Médure looking at that idea of kind of developing  
**0:08:37-0:08:44:**  crop varieties which are more suitable for those shady conditions in agroforestry.  
**0:08:44-0:08:50:**  And so there's differences between different types of crops, did you also test different  
**0:08:50-0:08:54:**  varieties of the same crop like different oats or different wheats?  
**0:08:54-0:08:58:**  Not in that experiment, no.  
**0:08:58-0:09:07:**  We did, well it was quite a complicated one but we did look at different varieties but  
**0:09:07-0:09:15:**  nothing really to pull out in terms of differences in the work we did at Wakelands anyway. But  
**0:09:15-0:09:19:**  some of the other work we did at Wakelands was in the short rotation coppice systems  
**0:09:19-0:09:25:**  and there's two systems at Wakelands, so one is a willow short rotation coppice and the  
**0:09:25-0:09:30:**  other is hazel and they're both coppiced to provide wood chip, primarily to go into wood  
**0:09:30-0:09:36:**  chip boiler to heat the farmhouse but the willow is harvested on a two-year rotation  
**0:09:36-0:09:41:**  and the hazel is harvested on a five-year rotation. We did some cereal trials in the  
**0:09:41-0:09:46:**  willow and what we found was where the willow had been coppiced that year so it was kind  
**0:09:46-0:09:52:**  of a more open sunny environment, it just meant that the crops did better than adjacent  
**0:09:52-0:09:57:**  to where the willow hadn't been harvested and was kind of two years old and creating  
**0:09:57-0:10:03:**  more shade. So again that kind of opens up another option for farmers that they can kind  
**0:10:03-0:10:10:**  of match the crop with the point in the rotation of the tree and so those crops which need  
**0:10:10-0:10:16:**  the kind of more open conditions could be grown after the trees have just been harvested  
**0:10:16-0:10:19:**  and whereas those perhaps which are okay in more shady conditions can be grown later in  
**0:10:19-0:10:22:**  the tree harvest rotation.  
**0:10:22-0:10:27:**  So obviously in the second experiment shade is what's you know was the variable. I don't  
**0:10:27-0:10:33:**  know if you actually had a scientific conclusion but maybe as a supposition if it's not the  
**0:10:33-0:10:40:**  case. In the case of oats is it that they were more shade tolerant or was it on an other  
**0:10:40-0:10:42:**  aspect do you think that they did better?  
**0:10:42-0:10:47:**  Really hard to say because it you know it's not necessarily just the shade or the lack  
**0:10:47-0:10:54:**  of shade where the tree's been coppiced because obviously you know there's so many interactions  
**0:10:54-0:10:58:**  with water with what's going on below ground you know whether the roots are growing back  
**0:10:58-0:11:04:**  growing have died back after you've cut the trees above ground. So we you know you can't  
**0:11:04-0:11:08:**  well we didn't attempt to pull apart those different interactions.  
**0:11:08-0:11:13:**  And so maybe you know not from directly from your experiment but I'm guessing maybe from  
**0:11:13-0:11:19:**  your knowledge and in more of the agroforestry literature the main do you think the main  
**0:11:19-0:11:24:**  competitions are in terms of water than in terms of roots and fertility?  
**0:11:24-0:11:29:**  Yeah I mean in northern Europe I would say shade was probably the biggest biggest issue  
**0:11:29-0:11:35:**  but you know we did kind of see evidence that things change from year to year depending  
**0:11:35-0:11:43:**  on rainfall and timing of rain as well so and when we looked at kind of microclimate  
**0:11:43-0:11:47:**  differences between the agroforestry and the open field which was right next door we found  
**0:11:47-0:11:54:**  kind of higher soil moisture in in the agroforestry and that's probably related to wind speeds  
**0:11:54-0:11:58:**  we found higher wind speeds in the open field and so obviously you know more wind would  
**0:11:58-0:12:04:**  dry out the soil in the open fields and so you know there's kind of all those interactions  
**0:12:04-0:12:10:**  which are yeah quite difficult to generalize about because year on year you've got differences  
**0:12:10-0:12:13:**  in the climate.  
**0:12:13-0:12:17:**  And also I guess the trees are growing so every year is different the tree is different  
**0:12:17-0:12:21:**  every year it's not an annual crop where you're growing the same sort of similar crop every  
**0:12:21-0:12:25:**  year but it's a tree that's changing and growing over time.  
**0:12:25-0:12:30:**  But it's fascinating because it's so complex and there's so many variables and I imagine  
**0:12:30-0:12:39:**  it must be so hard to really get to like rigorous conclusions about these things because what  
**0:12:39-0:12:44:**  I feel often is you know there's a lot of big claims that are being circulated and you  
**0:12:44-0:12:49:**  know on agroforestry in general and we probably you know contribute to that to a certain extent  
**0:12:49-0:12:56:**  but once you start you know having scientifically rigorous conversations it's so hard to make  
**0:12:56-0:12:57:**  these claims isn't it?  
**0:12:57-0:13:05:**  Yeah it really is and you know both at Wakelands and at Tollies they're working farms you know  
**0:13:05-0:13:09:**  they weren't set up as scientific experiments in terms of having replicates and controls  
**0:13:09-0:13:16:**  and you know tightly controlled systems and so you know there's also kind of the interaction  
**0:13:16-0:13:22:**  with different management practices going on and they can even change from year to year  
**0:13:22-0:13:25:**  you know they might want to plow at a certain time but because they've been busy elsewhere  
**0:13:25-0:13:30:**  it gets delayed and so on so but it's real life and I guess that's you know that's the  
**0:13:30-0:13:35:**  beauty of working in real systems and working with farmers it's you know making sure things  
**0:13:35-0:13:39:**  work in real life rather than under those kind of tightly controlled systems.  
**0:13:39-0:13:44:**  But it's already very interesting that you were able to kind of study the the coppice  
**0:13:44-0:13:49:**  system and demonstrate that positive impact because I guess that's a really useful tool  
**0:13:49-0:13:56:**  for a lot of farmers it's such a efficient way of managing biomass and pruning and that  
**0:13:56-0:14:01:**  looks like it's a really promising avenue for you know synchronizing that with different  
**0:14:01-0:14:02:**  crop rotations.  
**0:14:02-0:14:08:**  Yeah definitely I think the coppice system is works really well in agroforestry systems  
**0:14:08-0:14:16:**  because you can manage the tree canopy a lot a lot better and in terms of timing I mean  
**0:14:16-0:14:22:**  that the willow is harvested every two years whereas the hazel is every five years and  
**0:14:22-0:14:26:**  you know that gives you different options again in terms of management and how you work  
**0:14:26-0:14:31:**  your rotations in between. I mean at weightless the alleys are quite narrow they tend to 12  
**0:14:31-0:14:36:**  meters whereas most silver arable systems we see now are more like 24 and so I think  
**0:14:36-0:14:41:**  you know those shade effects probably you know not so important in these in these kind  
**0:14:41-0:14:45:**  of wider alleys because the trees don't ever really get that that high you know they're  
**0:14:45-0:14:49:**  kind of two to three meters high maximum.  
**0:14:49-0:14:55:**  Is there anything else you'd like to say about interactions? Sorry if I'm I'm trying really  
**0:14:55-0:14:59:**  hard to not ask two generalist questions and make a fool out of myself but please feel  
**0:14:59-0:15:05:**  free to I don't know to add anything or correct me if yeah.  
**0:15:05-0:15:13:**  I think just kind of coming back to the microclimate and this idea of having lower soil moisture  
**0:15:13-0:15:20:**  in the in the open field I mean one thing that did come up is that actually that I mean  
**0:15:20-0:15:25:**  the guys who work at Wakefield, Paul and Mark who work on the land they found kind of one  
**0:15:25-0:15:30:**  of the downsides of the higher soil moisture in the agroforestry system is that they couldn't  
**0:15:30-0:15:35:**  get onto the land at the right time because it took longer to dry out and you know it's  
**0:15:35-0:15:39:**  lower wind speeds in the agroforestry and the soil kind of stayed wetter for longer  
**0:15:39-0:15:44:**  earlier in the year and so that's kind of one of the kind of negative effects I guess  
**0:15:44-0:15:50:**  is you know it holds the water longer than an open field.  
**0:15:50-0:15:55:**  But did they also kind of was there a positive effect as well of having long moisture for  
**0:15:55-0:15:58:**  longer in the summer as well or was it just negative?  
**0:15:58-0:16:03:**  Yeah the positive effect I guess was seen in the well when we were looking at it it  
**0:16:03-0:16:08:**  was looking at the fertility building lay so you know there was kind of higher productivity  
**0:16:08-0:16:12:**  in the agroforestry because the moisture was in in the system longer and so that would  
**0:16:12-0:16:18:**  be kind of the positive effect but I think you know it's not always positive there's  
**0:16:18-0:16:25:**  sometimes kind of negative implications of the differences in the microclimate.  
**0:16:25-0:16:30:**  That's fascinating yeah I never thought about of too much moisture as a potential problem  
**0:16:30-0:16:35:**  for entering with machines really interesting.  
**0:16:35-0:16:38:**  Sally is there anything you want to add on this topic?  
**0:16:38-0:16:43:**  No I think Jo's just about covered most of that I mean yeah it's complicated and pulling  
**0:16:43-0:16:49:**  it apart is difficult and I guess that's where we need more research is over time over  
**0:16:49-0:16:53:**  a significant amount of time as well where you're following the system through and looking  
**0:16:53-0:16:57:**  at how things change as time goes on.  
**0:16:57-0:17:05:**  There was something that Martin kind of triggered in the last few years was trying to manage  
**0:17:05-0:17:12:**  the shade in the timber tree systems and victories and he was fascinated by this idea of quality  
**0:17:12-0:17:17:**  pollarding wasn't he Sally and trying to kind of maintain the trees in the kind of peak  
**0:17:17-0:17:24:**  productivity stage whilst also kind of managing the shading from the canopy so he started  
**0:17:24-0:17:28:**  pollarding some of the trees in that mixed system.  
**0:17:28-0:17:33:**  Yeah we didn't manage to collect much data on them did we but we didn't it would be interesting  
**0:17:33-0:17:34:**  to look at that.  
**0:17:34-0:17:39:**  Exactly and I think that's maybe a really promising area for research going forward  
**0:17:39-0:17:43:**  is because you know a lot of trees used to be pollarded in the UK you know very much  
**0:17:43-0:17:49:**  working trees but we've kind of lost that tradition I know in areas of France you know  
**0:17:49-0:17:54:**  almost every tree you see is pollarded or managed to a certain extent and you know we  
**0:17:54-0:17:58:**  just don't see it in the UK other than kind of for their cultural values you know you  
**0:17:58-0:18:02:**  see these trees that were pollarded in the past and recognized for their biodiversity  
**0:18:02-0:18:08:**  value and their cultural value and I guess it's just it's not easy to build it into a  
**0:18:08-0:18:13:**  kind of working farm anymore in terms of having the machinery to do it and not relying on  
**0:18:13-0:18:18:**  kind of people going out there with a chainsaw and you know it's being very manual so I think  
**0:18:18-0:18:24:**  that you know maybe that's one avenue for research and it's a way that farmers can manage  
**0:18:24-0:18:29:**  the shade in those kind of big tree systems.  
**0:18:29-0:18:35:**  Yeah definitely but since we're on the topic of future research because it's so complex  
**0:18:35-0:18:40:**  and the interactions are so hard to pinpoint you know to one element how do you see the  
**0:18:40-0:18:45:**  future of research do you think it's kind of that that's not you know it's pointless  
**0:18:45-0:18:49:**  to try and demonstrate these positive interactions or do you see ways where you can have that  
**0:18:49-0:18:54:**  data because you'll always be doing that on farms that are not designed for experiments  
**0:18:54-0:18:58:**  and you'll always be faced the constraints we just discussed?  
**0:18:58-0:19:02:**  I don't know I know not at all I think I think we need to just build up the evidence base  
**0:19:02-0:19:07:**  you need the sort of big data approach where data is coming from various different places  
**0:19:07-0:19:14:**  and you can feed it all in and then you can extrapolate from that and there's a lot of  
**0:19:14-0:19:19:**  modelling around agroforestry which Jo may say more about than me but I think a lot of  
**0:19:19-0:19:23:**  the time those models are quite data poor so if we can increase the quality of the data  
**0:19:23-0:19:28:**  going into those models then we can increase the sort of like quality of the data that's  
**0:19:28-0:19:32:**  available to farmers to predict what might happen if they put trees on their land.  
**0:19:32-0:19:39:**  Yeah I mean there's a lot of modelling there in routine led by Christian de Praese in Montpellier  
**0:19:39-0:19:42:**  I mean they've been working on the high-safe model for a long time now and it is looking  
**0:19:42-0:19:48:**  at those really detailed interactions between the trees and the crops and they've also done  
**0:19:48-0:19:53:**  great work down there below ground digging big big pits to see what's happening with  
**0:19:53-0:20:00:**  the roots and yeah kind of measuring the trees as they grow and so those kind of experimental  
**0:20:00-0:20:05:**  platforms where you've got the replicates and you've got these trees that have been  
**0:20:05-0:20:11:**  monitored now for 20 years or so that's all building up the evidence I guess it is then  
**0:20:11-0:20:16:**  just seeing how it works in real life on real farms which is the interesting part as well.  
**0:20:16-0:20:21:**  I think as interest increases and more people are planting as well you're getting more opportunities  
**0:20:21-0:20:27:**  to collect data as well more opportunities to sort of like have information that's for  
**0:20:27-0:20:31:**  wider relevance so it's not just based on one or two farms but just on farms across  
**0:20:31-0:20:36:**  a wider geographic area. I think we're really missing financial data as well which is the  
**0:20:36-0:20:42:**  other sort of key bit of information that I guess a lot of farmers want to know about  
**0:20:42-0:20:46:**  when they're thinking about setting up an agroforestry system is how much it's going  
**0:20:46-0:20:51:**  to cost them and how much they're potentially going to get back so that's another thing  
**0:20:51-0:20:56:**  I think where it would be good to have more information and collect that in a little bit  
**0:20:56-0:21:00:**  more of a strategic manner as well. That's definitely something we felt with Dimitri  
**0:21:00-0:21:06:**  when we started working on agroforestry and one of the reasons for starting the podcast  
**0:21:06-0:21:12:**  although it's never so easy in a podcast format to be really you know having a rigorous  
**0:21:12-0:21:16:**  you know collection of numbers and really getting to the bottom of things but I'd agree  
**0:21:16-0:21:23:**  with you that from a kind of farmer perspective that would be really helpful. Okay thanks  
**0:21:23-0:21:28:**  for that. Really interesting to understand that basically we can kind of overcome these  
**0:21:28-0:21:33:**  complexities of the living world by having you know enough farms and data and collecting  
**0:21:33-0:21:37:**  the clues little by little and that sounds really interesting and looking forward to  
**0:21:37-0:21:44:**  that. One of the other big themes I think that often comes with discussing agroforestry  
**0:21:44-0:21:50:**  and that's you know also came in our episodes with Wakelands and Tallest Organics is this  
**0:21:50-0:21:58:**  idea of diversity. You know some advantages are said to come with diversifying productions  
**0:21:58-0:22:04:**  but we also know that there's some practical constraints with having diversified productions  
**0:22:04-0:22:10:**  and I was wondering if you had in your research studied a bit of the impact of diversity whether  
**0:22:10-0:22:17:**  it be you know biodiversity or just diversifying productions on the farm production. I mean  
**0:22:17-0:22:23:**  Wakelands obviously is probably one of the most diverse systems out there and we did  
**0:22:23-0:22:30:**  some nice work as part of a European project looking at apple production and specifically  
**0:22:30-0:22:40:**  organic apple production and the aim was trying to reduce copper which is used to reduce scab  
**0:22:40-0:22:46:**  and the project we well the work that we did and how it fed into it was can we use an agroforestry  
**0:22:46-0:22:56:**  approach to grow apples that don't need so much copper to control scab levels and in  
**0:22:56-0:23:01:**  this mixed timber and apple tree system at Wakelands we were basically comparing that  
**0:23:01-0:23:07:**  system with an organic orchard nearby and looking at levels of scab and it's something  
**0:23:07-0:23:12:**  that Martin said which has always stuck with me it's like the worst place to grow apples  
**0:23:12-0:23:18:**  isn't in an orchard because you have all these problems with pests and diseases and so he  
**0:23:18-0:23:24:**  was growing his apples in mixed in amongst these timber trees and so what you do is you  
**0:23:24-0:23:28:**  get a pair of apple trees and then you get pairs of seven other timber species and then  
**0:23:28-0:23:34:**  you get your next pair of apple trees and I think he had I think there was probably  
**0:23:34-0:23:40:**  about 20 odd different varieties as well so they're all mixed in together and we're comparing  
**0:23:40-0:23:45:**  levels of scab on this kind of really diverse system compared to an organic orchard and  
**0:23:45-0:23:50:**  we found actually that the levels of scab in the agroforestry were less than half what  
**0:23:50-0:23:54:**  they were in the orchard and there's again there's probably a few different reasons why  
**0:23:54-0:24:00:**  that might be but I think key to that was the diversity and so you've got you know lots  
**0:24:00-0:24:04:**  of different species as well as you've got your apples in there so you know you've got  
**0:24:04-0:24:12:**  your apple trees which are separated from the next apple trees by you know 10 different  
**0:24:12-0:24:15:**  trees in between so they're kind of sprinkled throughout the system and then you've got  
**0:24:15-0:24:21:**  your different varieties as well some of which were more susceptible to scab than others  
**0:24:21-0:24:24:**  so it's you know it's a case of don't put all your eggs in one basket don't put all  
**0:24:24-0:24:27:**  your apples in one basket when it comes to choosing your varieties and choosing your  
**0:24:27-0:24:29:**  different species.  
**0:24:29-0:24:35:**  So you're saying that diversity works both by choosing a diversity of varieties of apples  
**0:24:35-0:24:39:**  and also then including them in a variety of trees then like this double layer?  
**0:24:39-0:24:44:**  Exactly so the different species of trees are like a barrier you know both a physical  
**0:24:44-0:24:48:**  one and you know having the different species and so they wouldn't be spreading the scab  
**0:24:48-0:24:54:**  from tree to tree which is what you'd often get in in orchards but then you know with  
**0:24:54-0:24:58:**  with the different varieties you know one one year you might get one variety which seems  
**0:24:58-0:25:02:**  to get hit quite hard and next year it might be a different variety but because you didn't  
**0:25:02-0:25:06:**  have kind of blocks of single varieties and you had so many different varieties mixed  
**0:25:06-0:25:09:**  together that spread of scab was much lower.  
**0:25:09-0:25:15:**  Wow well it's great to you know it's the assumption isn't it when we when we defend  
**0:25:15-0:25:20:**  diversity and plant diversity but it's good to know that it actually works.  
**0:25:20-0:25:26:**  Yeah I mean the I suppose the other side of that is how practical is that if you're trying  
**0:25:26-0:25:33:**  to scale it up I mean it worked well at Wakelands because you know the apples can feed into  
**0:25:33-0:25:37:**  veg box systems and it's something that Tolly's also doing he's growing apples as  
**0:25:37-0:25:41:**  well as part of his mix and he's obviously got a veg box system there and he's got  
**0:25:41-0:25:47:**  the little shop there as well so you know you can you can also tell the story behind  
**0:25:47-0:25:51:**  why you've got all these different varieties but then if you're trying to sell to wholesale  
**0:25:51-0:25:57:**  or you're trying to scale it up you know you need more of the same variety to make  
**0:25:57-0:26:01:**  it worthwhile. The other option the other issue obviously is when you come to harvest  
**0:26:01-0:26:06:**  you know they're coming to they're ripe at different times or they're ready to  
**0:26:06-0:26:09:**  harvest at different times so you know that that then means you're harvesting over a  
**0:26:09-0:26:14:**  longer period than if you had maybe only two or three varieties so you know there are management  
**0:26:14-0:26:20:**  implications of having that diversity and I think it's kind of choosing you know choosing  
**0:26:20-0:26:24:**  what's best for the system I guess in terms of how you go about harvesting and what you  
**0:26:24-0:26:30:**  do with those as an end product. So I don't know if you've heard of Stephen Briggs and  
**0:26:30-0:26:38:**  his apple agroforestry system in the UK? Yeah we actually had him on the podcast a few episodes  
**0:26:38-0:26:43:**  ago so we're kind of we're just you know drilling into your whole network of English  
**0:26:43-0:26:51:**  agroforestry farmers. So you know he was inspired by by Wakelands but he went with apples as  
**0:26:51-0:26:57:**  his you know his his tree crop. He's got different varieties there as well which is really nice  
**0:26:57-0:27:02:**  but he's planted them in blocks and so they're easier to harvest. He's got obviously a lot  
**0:27:02-0:27:08:**  more apple trees and so he's got the bulk as well and so he's kind of taken parts taken  
**0:27:08-0:27:12:**  inspiration from Wakelands but scaled it up and to a different system but one that perhaps  
**0:27:12-0:27:18:**  works better at that larger scale. Sure I think there's a theme we always come back  
**0:27:18-0:27:24:**  to Dimitri because it was something that we are really faced to on the ground is always  
**0:27:24-0:27:30:**  balancing you know practical management and diversity and I don't know you were talking  
**0:27:30-0:27:35:**  about varieties but I think there's a lot of work to see how you know we can introduce  
**0:27:35-0:27:42:**  a variety of trees without really complexifying too much the operation and maybe having like  
**0:27:42-0:27:48:**  smaller blocks with hedges and kind of managing to bring in like a diversity of trees but  
**0:27:48-0:27:52:**  not maybe in the tree line but like smaller hedges around. I mean there's a lot of discussions  
**0:27:52-0:27:59:**  around that and there's a lot to to innovate and yeah it's a really exciting and vital  
**0:27:59-0:28:03:**  question I think. That you have to think about growth rate of the trees as well if you're  
**0:28:03-0:28:08:**  managing for coppice products and you plant a diverse mix which we did on the farm where  
**0:28:08-0:28:14:**  we were based you plant a diverse mix of tree species for your coppice production if some  
**0:28:14-0:28:19:**  of them grow at different rates to the others then you have a problem when it comes to harvesting  
**0:28:19-0:28:24:**  around practicality so we planted willow which shot away and then you have to sort of pick  
**0:28:24-0:28:29:**  your way through the willow and harvest them separately and you can't mechanize it as easily  
**0:28:29-0:28:37:**  as well. Yeah so do you think the best would be to just have like a row of single species  
**0:28:37-0:28:42:**  but then maybe alternating these rows to have that diversity across the rows? Yeah I mean  
**0:28:42-0:28:46:**  we're thinking about this at the minute on the market garden where I work where we have  
**0:28:46-0:28:51:**  high winds we're planting shelterbelts but we want to keep the shelterbelts diverse but  
**0:28:51-0:28:55:**  we don't want to make management problems for ourselves in the future so yeah keeping  
**0:28:55-0:29:00:**  single rows of single species but then having multiple species within like within the row  
**0:29:00-0:29:07:**  is how we're approaching it. I suppose having kind of different teams of similar species  
**0:29:07-0:29:11:**  and just thinking I mean the willow you know you could have different species of willow  
**0:29:11-0:29:15:**  and assuming that they would all grow at a similar rate and you know then mix up the  
**0:29:15-0:29:21:**  other species which grow at a different rate and perhaps trying to be a bit clever with  
**0:29:21-0:29:27:**  kind of teams of different species. Yeah no totally I mean because the diversity is definitely  
**0:29:27-0:29:31:**  linked to resilience as well isn't it because if you get if you just plant one species and  
**0:29:31-0:29:35:**  then you get a disease come in that wipes them out then you haven't got anything else  
**0:29:35-0:29:40:**  to back up. No I just I mean talking about diversity I mean we did also do some work  
**0:29:40-0:29:47:**  on biodiversity at Wakelands and again kind of comparing it comparing Wakelands agroforestry  
**0:29:47-0:29:53:**  with the organic orchard and I mean things are never straightforward I think when we  
**0:29:53-0:29:58:**  when we start looking in detail and so it was quite a mixed picture in terms of the  
**0:29:58-0:30:06:**  effect on pollinators and natural enemies and we found kind of higher wasps high abundances  
**0:30:06-0:30:14:**  of parasitic and predator wasps at Wakelands but actually higher numbers of bees in the  
**0:30:14-0:30:20:**  orchard and actually when you start to think about it you know at the orchard there's a  
**0:30:20-0:30:25:**  lot more apple trees compared to Wakelands there's a lot more flowering resource both  
**0:30:25-0:30:32:**  in the apple trees and in the understory which was kind of it was a grassy flower or sward  
**0:30:32-0:30:37:**  underneath the trees compared to Wakelands which has obviously got your trees but then  
**0:30:37-0:30:42:**  you had cereals growing in the alleys so you know there's more kind of bees and stuff in  
**0:30:42-0:30:47:**  the orchard compared to Wakelands but then when we looked within Wakelands comparing  
**0:30:47-0:30:56:**  it was actually a PhD project comparing bumblebees solitary bees and hoverflies between the short  
**0:30:56-0:31:03:**  rotation coppice willow system and the neighbouring open field there are more insects in the agroforestry  
**0:31:03-0:31:08:**  so it's kind of you know a lot of that is what are you comparing are you comparing agroforestry  
**0:31:08-0:31:14:**  to an open field are you comparing it to a the kind of tree control the orchard so yeah  
**0:31:14-0:31:23:**  somewhere in between and there's really nice study it was the RSPB so the bird people came  
**0:31:23-0:31:29:**  and did some recording at Wakelands and I think they recorded kind of 40 odd species  
**0:31:29-0:31:34:**  but what they found was it's a real mixture of different categories of birds so they had  
**0:31:34-0:31:38:**  the kind of typical farmland birds there but they also had birds which are characteristic  
**0:31:38-0:31:44:**  of woodlands as well and so you know that in terms of the habitats that the agroforestry  
**0:31:44-0:31:48:**  provided it seems to be offering things to both woodland species and to those kind of  
**0:31:48-0:31:50:**  farmland birds as well.  
**0:31:50-0:31:57:**  It's good to say we looked at plant species as well at the tollies over a number of years  
**0:31:57-0:32:04:**  in his agroforestry system and actually when you picked into the detail of the species  
**0:32:04-0:32:08:**  data that you were collecting there was a high number of species overall but the long-term  
**0:32:08-0:32:12:**  beetle bank which was present before the trees were planted actually had the highest diversity  
**0:32:12-0:32:17:**  of any of the understory habitats so you were getting that high diversity with the beetle  
**0:32:17-0:32:21:**  bank without the trees at all.  
**0:32:21-0:32:27:**  You mean before they planted any trees they still left a strip with just flowers or what  
**0:32:27-0:32:28:**  were they comparing to?  
**0:32:28-0:32:35:**  Yes a beetle bank it's sort of a strip of perennial grasses and flowers for beetles  
**0:32:35-0:32:42:**  it doesn't contain any trees but it's a habitat strip for various different reasons people  
**0:32:42-0:32:46:**  will plant, farmers will plant them but the trees were planted into the beetle bank one  
**0:32:46-0:32:51:**  of the rows of trees that he planted as his agroforestry system was planted into the beetle  
**0:32:51-0:32:57:**  bank and the other ones were planted into various different rows so they sowed some  
**0:32:57-0:33:02:**  wildflower mix under one row I think and some cut flowers and some rhubarb and various other  
**0:33:02-0:33:07:**  crops underneath them but in amongst that there was other species as well and we monitored  
**0:33:07-0:33:10:**  the species diversity going forward at the beginning when the trees were planted and  
**0:33:10-0:33:16:**  then going forward as well and the long term beetle bank had the highest diversity overall  
**0:33:16-0:33:21:**  I think it maintained that as well and then we saw so some of the sown species as well  
**0:33:21-0:33:27:**  some of the legumes that were sown the fertility building legumes got out competed over time  
**0:33:27-0:33:32:**  as well and the numbers of those reduced as well but the beetle bank stayed quite high  
**0:33:32-0:33:36:**  so I guess that's you have to be a bit careful about what you're attributing your benefit  
**0:33:36-0:33:40:**  to because it wasn't really the trees necessarily because the beetle bank was quite diverse  
**0:33:40-0:33:44:**  in the first place so you could say that the you could lump them all together and say that  
**0:33:44-0:33:49:**  diversity was high under the trees but then if you pick it apart and look at the beetle  
**0:33:49-0:33:52:**  bank you've actually got the high diversity in the beetle bank itself without the trees  
**0:33:52-0:33:55:**  there at all does that make sense?  
**0:33:55-0:34:02:**  That makes a lot of sense yeah really interesting and yeah another example of how nuanced we  
**0:34:02-0:34:10:**  have to be about you know correlating unproblematically agroforestry and biodiversity going back to  
**0:34:10-0:34:14:**  what you were saying Joe I guess in of itself it's interesting that there's an increase  
**0:34:14-0:34:19:**  in diversity of birds I think I don't know if there's any research on that but I guess  
**0:34:19-0:34:23:**  the other question afterwards it'd be really interesting to see the impact of that high  
**0:34:23-0:34:30:**  diversity on production maybe on reducing pest pressures and hopefully that's also research  
**0:34:30-0:34:33:**  that's going to go forward and that'll be really interesting.  
**0:34:33-0:34:38:**  No I mean I think as we don't have any research on it specifically but just a general diversification  
**0:34:38-0:34:43:**  of farm incomes I think is important to mention as well so it's not just about biodiversity  
**0:34:43-0:34:48:**  but it's about diversity of diversification systems and I guess some of the work that  
**0:34:48-0:34:54:**  we did on looking at looking at whether you can be self-sufficient in fuel and fertility  
**0:34:54-0:34:59:**  and from your own trees feeds into that you've got another resource coming out of your system  
**0:34:59-0:35:03:**  that you can use to increase the resilience overall.  
**0:35:03-0:35:11:**  And it could be that you're not harvesting that product every year but it's there in  
**0:35:11-0:35:17:**  times of need if you see what I mean so one thing I'm thinking about is tree fodder and  
**0:35:17-0:35:21:**  you know you've got trees in the environment and you've got livestock and actually it's  
**0:35:21-0:35:26:**  in those years the really dry years when the grass is really not performing but your trees  
**0:35:26-0:35:30:**  are still green and that they might be the years that you're relying on your trees to  
**0:35:30-0:35:34:**  provide feed for your animals.  
**0:35:34-0:35:43:**  Another interesting topic is productivity and whether agroforestry systems are more  
**0:35:43-0:35:51:**  productive or not and I know I read a bit in your research that you were measuring LER  
**0:35:51-0:35:56:**  and weight cleanse I think at least and it'd be great if you could explain to us a bit  
**0:35:56-0:36:03:**  you know what it is and how you go about measuring it and some of the findings on that topic.  
**0:36:03-0:36:08:**  Yeah sure so I guess LER is sort of useful it's useful in giving you that sort of overall  
**0:36:08-0:36:14:**  overview of how productive your system could be in theory it compares the basically compares  
**0:36:14-0:36:20:**  the productivity of the two different crops doesn't have to be an agroforestry system  
**0:36:20-0:36:25:**  it could be an intercropping system as well but of two different crops growing together  
**0:36:25-0:36:29:**  against the productivity of them if they were grown in two separate fields so sort of as  
**0:36:29-0:36:36:**  monocultures I guess and it gives you a value I mean the calculation is the yield from one  
**0:36:36-0:36:42:**  crop divided by the yield from the monoculture of that crop the yield of the intercrop divided  
**0:36:42-0:36:47:**  by the yield of the monoculture plus the yield of the second crop when it's grown as an intercrop  
**0:36:47-0:36:52:**  divided by the yield of the monoculture you might want to cut that bit out that's a bit  
**0:36:52-0:36:56:**  of a problem but basically it gives you it gives you a figure and if it's if it's greater  
**0:36:56-0:37:03:**  than one then your intercrop is more productive than your equivalent crops would be grown  
**0:37:03-0:37:11:**  separately. It's the thing that I think is slightly misleading about it is that it depends  
**0:37:11-0:37:17:**  on what you use as an input figure so you can and a lot of the work that we did at Wakelands  
**0:37:17-0:37:23:**  we used an overall biomass figure so you're comparing your biomass of for example your  
**0:37:23-0:37:30:**  lay so a lay cut in the alley and the biomass of the willow which is the agroforestry crop  
**0:37:30-0:37:36:**  with the biomass of the willow set growing separately as a monoculture or the lay grown  
**0:37:36-0:37:41:**  separately as a monoculture but biomass of willow is not necessarily equivalent to the  
**0:37:41-0:37:46:**  biomass of the pasture crop so when you put them together you'll end up with a positive  
**0:37:46-0:37:52:**  result we did end up with a positive result and the LERs at Wakelands calculated in a  
**0:37:52-0:38:00:**  variety of different ways were all positive which is great but I suppose to make it more  
**0:38:00-0:38:05:**  useful you maybe look at energetic value which I think we did in one case when we were looking  
**0:38:05-0:38:11:**  at LERs at Wakelands or possibly even your value so the value of the crop so the value  
**0:38:11-0:38:17:**  in terms of economic return I guess on the crop because your willow wood chip won't be  
**0:38:17-0:38:23:**  equivalent to a kilo of willow wood chip won't be equivalent to a kilo of wheat grain for  
**0:38:23-0:38:28:**  example so your biomass is not very comparable so it's a useful measure but I think you have  
**0:38:28-0:38:31:**  to be a bit careful about how you interpret the results I suppose is what I'm saying and  
**0:38:31-0:38:35:**  then make sure that the data that you're feeding into it is relevant as well.  
**0:38:35-0:38:40:**  Okay yeah now that's an interesting point actually of finding that common denominator  
**0:38:40-0:38:46:**  but I guess it's the tricky bit with the economic value would then be that there's so many variables  
**0:38:46-0:38:51:**  and how you can commercialize the apple or completely or completely it's just I suppose  
**0:38:51-0:38:56:**  I feel a little bit when you when you sort of say well LERs of one point all greater  
**0:38:56-0:39:02:**  than one you've got agroforestry systems that are more productive but then it's like I said  
**0:39:02-0:39:07:**  it depends on on what that production is and how useful that production is because if that  
**0:39:07-0:39:13:**  production doesn't actually translate into a useful product or a product that can be  
**0:39:13-0:39:19:**  sold by the farmer for example then it doesn't or can be used by the farmer it doesn't necessarily  
**0:39:19-0:39:25:**  mean that the system overall is 10% more productive or 20% or 40% more productive.  
**0:39:25-0:39:29:**  The system at Wakelands with the short rotation coppers is kind of a good example of that  
**0:39:29-0:39:36:**  whereby like Sally says it had a positive LER but actually in terms of value if you  
**0:39:36-0:39:41:**  sell wood chip it had this you know it's very low value compared to selling the cereal crop  
**0:39:41-0:39:47:**  and but because the the wood chip was actually used on the farm to replace heating oil so  
**0:39:47-0:39:52:**  you know there's no need to buy in heating oil it actually makes the economics stack  
**0:39:52-0:39:57:**  up much more favorably so you're saving a lot of money by not spending on heating oil  
**0:39:57-0:40:02:**  and using homegrown wood chip as well and that kind of balanced out the the kind of  
**0:40:02-0:40:10:**  loss of cereal. And the LER was calculated at Wakelands using a tool called the public  
**0:40:10-0:40:17:**  goods tool as well which looks at the entire farm system and it was quite a basic calculation  
**0:40:17-0:40:23:**  but the positive LER for that I think was more indicative of overall production because  
**0:40:23-0:40:29:**  the actual the units that went into that were metabolizable energy so you're looking at  
**0:40:29-0:40:32:**  the energy that's coming out of the products and you're looking at everything so the whole  
**0:40:32-0:40:36:**  system so all of the different agroforestry systems and all of the products coming off  
**0:40:36-0:40:46:**  the farm as well so I guess yeah that's maybe a little bit more representative of what's  
**0:40:46-0:40:50:**  going on but then because it's looking at the whole system and it's only looking at  
**0:40:50-0:40:53:**  one year in a snapshot there's problems with that as well.  
**0:40:53-0:40:59:**  We looked at the LER of the willow system over two years and in one year it was 1.4  
**0:40:59-0:41:05:**  and the following year it's 1.1 and again that was kind of impacted by the weather and  
**0:41:05-0:41:10:**  so it just shows you that from year to year you can have that variation and what would  
**0:41:10-0:41:15:**  be nice is to look at it over the whole period of the tree rotation so 20 years you know  
**0:41:15-0:41:20:**  20 years plus and obviously you'll see that change as the trees get bigger and the trees  
**0:41:20-0:41:22:**  mature.  
**0:41:22-0:41:26:**  I think the sort of looking at it year on year is actually quite interesting in itself  
**0:41:26-0:41:30:**  though because then you can see what's making that change happen and those two years where  
**0:41:30-0:41:37:**  the LER was calculated in the willow system one was very dry and in the dry year the agroforestry  
**0:41:37-0:41:42:**  system overall performed a lot better than the monocultures didn't it so you can sort  
**0:41:42-0:41:45:**  of then start to pick out your interactions and where things are happening in a positive  
**0:41:45-0:41:50:**  or a negative way so it gives you rather than just being a snapshot having two years data  
**0:41:50-0:41:53:**  gives you a little bit more information but you're right if you could have it over a longer  
**0:41:53-0:41:59:**  period of time and it was modeled as well wasn't it at Wakeland over a longer period  
**0:41:59-0:42:03:**  and again you had a positive LER then but it was based on the biomass of the systems  
**0:42:03-0:42:04:**  as well.  
**0:42:04-0:42:13:**  Yeah but do you from the different farms that you've seen and studied do you still see a  
**0:42:13-0:42:18:**  real opportunity in terms of increased productivity you know obviously as you said it depends  
**0:42:18-0:42:23:**  how you define productivity but kind of going beyond the metric do you think there's something  
**0:42:23-0:42:27:**  interesting there or do you think it's just not the right angle of looking at it?  
**0:42:27-0:42:31:**  I think it's a really interesting question and I think the jury's out I think systems  
**0:42:31-0:42:37:**  like Stephen Briggs where you've got that definite product you've got the apples and  
**0:42:37-0:42:43:**  you've got the arable crops as well that's it's an easier question to answer but some  
**0:42:43-0:42:49:**  I mean and then some agroforestry systems are just windbreaks so if you've got a windbreak  
**0:42:49-0:42:53:**  you've got land out of production for the windbreak and is that offset then by the increase  
**0:42:53-0:43:00:**  in production I don't think we necessarily know the answer to that yet but I guess agroforestry  
**0:43:00-0:43:06:**  systems themselves are so varied and whichever agroforestry system you design you're taking  
**0:43:06-0:43:13:**  a certain area out of production so for the trees until the trees start to become productive  
**0:43:13-0:43:17:**  if they are going to become productive in the end I guess that's one of the things that's  
**0:43:17-0:43:22:**  motivated me is to try and make sure that those trees can be productive and can be seen  
**0:43:22-0:43:28:**  as part of the farming system because there's already a lot of trees in the UK anyway not  
**0:43:28-0:43:32:**  so much over in the east of the country in the arable big arable areas but certainly  
**0:43:32-0:43:37:**  in the west there's already a lot of trees on farms which aren't necessarily currently  
**0:43:37-0:43:41:**  used as part of the productive farming system so they're already there but they're not being  
**0:43:41-0:43:45:**  sort of integrated into the farming system so if you can bring those trees into the farming  
**0:43:45-0:43:51:**  system and then add on additional trees in a way that you're thinking about how you can  
**0:43:51-0:43:55:**  maximize your production I think that's the way to go about designing an agroforestry  
**0:43:55-0:44:01:**  system because you do have additional benefits from the agroforestry system if you design  
**0:44:01-0:44:10:**  it right but the actual overall production I think to get to hit positive on that and  
**0:44:10-0:44:14:**  hit positive overall productions is more tricky I think and it depends on what you're using  
**0:44:14-0:44:16:**  your trees for.  
**0:44:16-0:44:21:**  Yeah and I guess it's such a good reminder that using big words like productivity doesn't  
**0:44:21-0:44:26:**  mean anything like it's always in a context depending on you know what are you trying  
**0:44:26-0:44:31:**  to aim for and I guess that's what's exciting as studies come out then we'll just have a  
**0:44:31-0:44:36:**  clear idea of the different possibilities and then it's up to every farmer to really  
**0:44:36-0:44:41:**  define what they're trying to achieve but yeah thanks for nuancing that again like another  
**0:44:41-0:44:47:**  claim because we often hear the terms over yielding polycultures and stacking productions  
**0:44:47-0:44:52:**  and all these things but it definitely looks much more complex and less straightforward  
**0:44:52-0:44:55:**  that you can sometimes think.  
**0:44:55-0:44:59:**  I think it's a really good point that you know that Sally made and quite a lot of our  
**0:44:59-0:45:05:**  work at the Organic Research Centre was looking at you know in the UK there are a lot of trees  
**0:45:05-0:45:11:**  in the environment whether it's woodlands, trees or hedges and for many farmers there  
**0:45:11-0:45:16:**  are a burden, there are costs you know to manage and particularly to work on the hedges  
**0:45:16-0:45:22:**  was looking at okay we know they do have benefits you know providing shelter and as a windbreak  
**0:45:22-0:45:26:**  good for biodiversity but actually it's a cost for the farmer to manage them year on  
**0:45:26-0:45:31:**  year. They can't remove them, they're you know they're prevented from removing them  
**0:45:31-0:45:38:**  by law so actually can we make them a positive part of the farm system and manage them to  
**0:45:38-0:45:44:**  give a product and I mean we were looking at them for wood chip and for producing wood  
**0:45:44-0:45:50:**  chip and we did some work on our farm in Newbury comparing different management techniques  
**0:45:50-0:45:56:**  and you know the financial elements of doing that.  
**0:45:56-0:46:01:**  Yeah and then if you can I mean because we also planted additional hedges at Elm Farm  
**0:46:01-0:46:05:**  with the intention of then managing them for biofuel because the species mix in traditional  
**0:46:05-0:46:11:**  hedges in the UK is quite often not optimal for biomass production. You've got sort of  
**0:46:11-0:46:18:**  thorn species which are slower growing and mesh together a bit more and harder to manage  
**0:46:18-0:46:26:**  on copy cycles and I think then if you can combine that sort of need for your biomass  
**0:46:26-0:46:34:**  on your farm with some planting of agroforestry rows or new hedgerows for the production of  
**0:46:34-0:46:42:**  that biomass and also for other purposes as well. So for example for windbreaks then you're  
**0:46:42-0:46:49:**  looking at a system that sits together as a whole or for other wood chip production  
**0:46:49-0:46:52:**  for other purposes as well so for rami or wood chip production and that's certainly  
**0:46:52-0:46:56:**  something that we're looking at the moment on the market garden that I'm working at.  
**0:46:56-0:47:02:**  We're planting trees with the intention of coxing them for wood chip production.  
**0:47:02-0:47:07:**  What's changing or what kind of new ideas or new management techniques are coming forward  
**0:47:07-0:47:12:**  to enable farmers to use these existing trees then because I'm assuming that if they were  
**0:47:12-0:47:19:**  in doing so is that there's obvious practical challenges in terms of doing it in a time  
**0:47:19-0:47:25:**  efficient manner and are there new approaches to hedges that enable using that biomass in  
**0:47:25-0:47:32:**  a cost effective way? I think it's partly a need for new and more efficient methods  
**0:47:32-0:47:39:**  but it's also partly a mindset change as well so seeing them as a resource rather than as  
**0:47:39-0:47:43:**  Jo mentioned seeing them as something that is sort of a bit of a pain and you have to  
**0:47:43-0:47:50:**  manage so starting to change your mindset to seeing that those hedgerows is potentially  
**0:47:50-0:47:57:**  a resource for your farm and then I think coupled with that there is some logistical  
**0:47:57-0:48:02:**  challenges as well particularly where there's wire in the hedge and that has to be cut out  
**0:48:02-0:48:07:**  and you haven't got good access as well I think for management but they can be overcome.  
**0:48:07-0:48:12:**  I think we did various machinery trials looking at different methods for management of hedgerows  
**0:48:12-0:48:18:**  using bi-cobscen using sort of different scales and I think all of those logistical challenges  
**0:48:18-0:48:24:**  can be overcome and if you've got a ready market or you can use the wood chip yourself  
**0:48:24-0:48:28:**  then the economics can stack up but it is that sort of mindset change I think.  
**0:48:28-0:48:35:**  Some of it's having access to the machinery wasn't it Sally and all the machinery exists  
**0:48:35-0:48:41:**  and it's there it's just yeah sometimes having access to it so the kind of more forestry  
**0:48:41-0:48:48:**  specific machinery was the kind of biggest issue in terms of haulage getting it to the  
**0:48:48-0:48:54:**  right site but then there's a scale in between which is more kind of farm scale and got a  
**0:48:54-0:49:01:**  nice example of a contractor who used to work with Martin who had tree shears that weren't  
**0:49:01-0:49:06:**  so expensive and it was kind of more of a farm scale rather than a forest scale piece  
**0:49:06-0:49:10:**  of kit and you know the economics stacked up for that as well so it's kind of getting  
**0:49:10-0:49:14:**  the appropriate scale for the farm.  
**0:49:14-0:49:17:**  Yeah I think weight cleanse was always a good example as well I always used weight cleanse  
**0:49:17-0:49:26:**  as an example when talking to farmers about how they had these sort of barriers to managing  
**0:49:26-0:49:32:**  their hedges or cutting their trees down because weight cleanse did everything on really quite  
**0:49:32-0:49:39:**  a small scale and managed to make it work and so yeah I think they just had a sort of  
**0:49:39-0:49:45:**  hand fed chipper they probably still do which they chipped all the material in stacked it  
**0:49:45-0:49:49:**  up and put a cup of that side a day or two to feed it through the chipper and yeah like  
**0:49:49-0:49:54:**  Joe said there was the guy with the tree shears on hand who I think has been doing some work  
**0:49:54-0:50:00:**  with them recently as well or they've got a tractor mounted circular saw as well which  
**0:50:00-0:50:05:**  they use for management so there are ways to get around these management issues and  
**0:50:05-0:50:09:**  yeah if you've got lots of hedge it is worth or lots of trees to cut it is worth getting  
**0:50:09-0:50:15:**  in bigger kit and bigger machinery but it doesn't have to be that way.  
**0:50:15-0:50:21:**  Tolly managed his hedges as well and his trees on farm just using a local tree surgeon.  
**0:50:21-0:50:27:**  I guess there's the opportunity also for farmers to work together isn't there and you know  
**0:50:27-0:50:31:**  so if you're getting in a big piece of kit it's like working with the neighbors to give  
**0:50:31-0:50:36:**  it enough hedge or trees to keep it busy so working together.  
**0:50:36-0:50:37:**  Yeah.  
**0:50:37-0:50:44:**  Yeah and I'm wondering since you know well you've had experience studying hedges does  
**0:50:44-0:50:53:**  the state of research now enable us to kind of claim that hedges really bring environmental  
**0:50:53-0:50:59:**  or ecosystem services to the production or do you still think you need to be able to  
**0:50:59-0:51:05:**  defend them from like a production angle for them to be valued by farmers?  
**0:51:05-0:51:09:**  I think that's a really good question because there's actually a lot more research on hedges  
**0:51:09-0:51:13:**  than there is on agroforestry and you can almost use them as a proxy for agroforestry  
**0:51:13-0:51:20:**  systems and there's quite a lot of evidence on the ecosystem service provision of hedgerows  
**0:51:20-0:51:27:**  from various different ecosystem services from water management to sort of providing  
**0:51:27-0:51:35:**  a habitat for biodiversity, beneficial biodiversity on the farm through to sort of crop protection,  
**0:51:35-0:51:39:**  wind protection for livestock as well.  
**0:51:39-0:51:43:**  There's a whole wealth of research out there that basically demonstrates that hedges are  
**0:51:43-0:51:44:**  a good thing.  
**0:51:44-0:51:50:**  But I think despite that not all farmers kind of see the benefits of that so particularly  
**0:51:50-0:51:55:**  over in the arable east where Wakelands is you know farmers can't remove the hedges but  
**0:51:55-0:52:00:**  they're keeping them as small as they possibly can so they're basically cutting them right  
**0:52:00-0:52:04:**  back so they're only like a meter square box.  
**0:52:04-0:52:09:**  So they're not delivering those biodiversity benefits or the other benefits because they're  
**0:52:09-0:52:12:**  just this little this little kind of linear feature.  
**0:52:12-0:52:17:**  So I think despite recognition of the ecosystem services that hedges provide there's still  
**0:52:17-0:52:24:**  a case for building in the productivity angle as well and actually you know if we're talking  
**0:52:24-0:52:29:**  about homegrown energy surely that is perhaps something we should be looking at anyway.  
**0:52:29-0:52:34:**  And we're not proposing really that farmers would manage all of the hedges on the farm  
**0:52:34-0:52:39:**  in that way and it's more about kind of creating a mosaic of different stages of regrowth and  
**0:52:39-0:52:44:**  different types of hedges you know some hedges might be laid instead of coppiced and others  
**0:52:44-0:52:49:**  would be more traditionally managed as a hedgerow.  
**0:52:49-0:52:55:**  And so you know in a way it could be seen as a means to enhancing biodiversity because  
**0:52:55-0:52:59:**  you've got these different types of hedge habitats so it's not just kind of one type  
**0:52:59-0:53:06:**  of hedge you've got different characters in the different hedge regrowth stages.  
**0:53:06-0:53:12:**  And sadly since you say that there's you know so much more research on hedges could you  
**0:53:12-0:53:20:**  tell us briefly what are the most well established or documented benefits that hedges bring?  
**0:53:20-0:53:23:**  Again that depends where you are in the country I mean the first thing that popped into my  
**0:53:23-0:53:29:**  head there was some of the work that's been done at Bangor University looking at the impacts  
**0:53:29-0:53:31:**  of shelter.  
**0:53:31-0:53:33:**  So they've got a is it Bangor?  
**0:53:33-0:53:39:**  Yeah, it's the electric sheep Jo, they've got an electric sheep with a sort of weather  
**0:53:39-0:53:42:**  station in it that they've been moving around and putting next to hedges and out in the  
**0:53:42-0:53:50:**  field and you can sort of see the benefits of the shelter on the welfare of the sheep  
**0:53:50-0:54:00:**  and that sort of animal welfare then translates into increased live weight I guess is it or  
**0:54:00-0:54:08:**  not the birth of lambs livestock's not my area but it's good for the sheep basically.  
**0:54:08-0:54:12:**  So that's the first thing that popped into my head but then in other parts of the country  
**0:54:12-0:54:20:**  I think over in the east you've got maybe sort of like watercourse management sorry  
**0:54:20-0:54:22:**  and other benefits as well.  
**0:54:22-0:54:29:**  Yeah really interesting I think for the livestock it seems pretty obvious again it might depend  
**0:54:29-0:54:34:**  on where you are but even in the mountainous area where I'm working at the moment and the  
**0:54:34-0:54:42:**  farmer I'm working with he's taken out like old walls to make bigger fields and he still  
**0:54:42-0:54:48:**  isn't that approach of trying to make his work easier with his tractor but on the other  
**0:54:48-0:54:52:**  side I was asking him like well why did you leave the hazelnuts and he was like yeah that's  
**0:54:52-0:54:57:**  absolutely crucial shelter for the animals and he's definitely not taking out the trees  
**0:54:57-0:55:02:**  because it's such a high value for him and on the higher altitudes where they were never  
**0:55:02-0:55:08:**  really hedges they're now starting to plant them for shelter for the animals and the heat  
**0:55:08-0:55:15:**  waves so even from a kind of practical experiential basis I think there's yeah there's a clear  
**0:55:15-0:55:16:**  benefit there.  
**0:55:16-0:55:22:**  Yeah I think the benefit for biodiversity is obviously quite massive in agricultural  
**0:55:22-0:55:28:**  areas as well you know not just as a resource but also as a corridor allowing animals to  
**0:55:28-0:55:34:**  kind of move across agricultural areas and being able to get from habitat to habitat  
**0:55:34-0:55:36:**  basically.  
**0:55:36-0:55:40:**  But I assume that could be a challenge as well because you know for example if you're  
**0:55:40-0:55:45:**  transforming your land into a deer corridor you know that could also bring some challenges  
**0:55:45-0:55:48:**  I could see some farmers being maybe worried about that.  
**0:55:48-0:55:52:**  Well that's another opportunity I mean that was a nice thing at Wakelands so they had  
**0:55:52-0:56:01:**  the muntjac deer at Wakelands the little deer invasive and yeah it was a pest and then Martin  
**0:56:01-0:56:06:**  saw it as an opportunity worked with a local gamekeeper who would come and shoot the deer  
**0:56:06-0:56:13:**  and make them into pies and sausages and sell them in the local deli and so you know we  
**0:56:13-0:56:18:**  should perhaps again it comes down to mindset but perhaps think about this as another product  
**0:56:18-0:56:25:**  of agroforestry another potential and another part of the kind of livestock system maybe  
**0:56:25-0:56:31:**  but yes you're right I mean there's you know there's agroforestry and kind of increasing  
**0:56:31-0:56:37:**  trees in the landscape do bring with them potential pest problems.  
**0:56:37-0:56:42:**  I know one of the problems Stephen Briggs had and I'm sure he said about it was having  
**0:56:42-0:56:48:**  pigeons using his apple trees as posts and breaking the apple trees yeah and at Wakelands  
**0:56:48-0:56:54:**  I mean there were hares but it was lovely to see the hares I mean they're quite a rare  
**0:56:54-0:57:00:**  species now and the deer as well not so many squirrels I mean that's the other thing that  
**0:57:00-0:57:06:**  people are concerned about when planting particularly hazelnuts is you know increasing grey squirrel  
**0:57:06-0:57:10:**  numbers but there's never really a problem at Wakelands.  
**0:57:10-0:57:14:**  I love the example you just gave about you know hunting the deer and making pies out  
**0:57:14-0:57:21:**  of them like they're a great example of using the problem and turning it into a solution.  
**0:57:21-0:57:27:**  We kind of touched upon woodchips as fuel a bit but I wanted to come back to woodchips  
**0:57:27-0:57:33:**  in general because I know Sally that you've been doing some research on woodchips at Tall  
**0:57:33-0:57:40:** hurst organics and I know how important woodchips are for for Tolly over there and maybe you  
**0:57:40-0:57:46:**  want to you know walk us through your experiments there and some of your findings.  
**0:57:46-0:57:53:**  So we just sort of finished those trials at the end of last year it was over a three year  
**0:57:53-0:57:58:**  period although we actually snuck in an extra year at Tolly's because we had a trial trial  
**0:57:58-0:58:04:**  there before we started the bigger trial and so we had four years worth of trials at Tolly's  
**0:58:04-0:58:09:**  and then we also did a trial on the Ramia woodchips at Wakelands as well which was really  
**0:58:09-0:58:13:**  interesting and it complemented the trial at Tolly's quite well because we had the single  
**0:58:13-0:58:20:**  species woodchip there from the short rotation coppice agroforestry systems and we also had  
**0:58:20-0:58:27:**  a trial on a conventional arable farm so nearby where he used woodchip from his hedge rows  
**0:58:27-0:58:35:**  so all of them were looking at using woodchips sourced from their on-farm resources and using  
**0:58:35-0:58:43:**  it as a soil improver so as a sort of ramial woodchip which is a term that I think was  
**0:58:43-0:58:48:**  coined in Canada a number of years ago but it's sort of a smaller woodchip that comes  
**0:58:48-0:58:55:**  from the twigs and the smaller diameter material so it's exactly the opposite of what you need  
**0:58:55-0:58:59:**  for a good fuel which is I guess one of the things that interested me straight away was  
**0:58:59-0:59:05:**  when I was early on first started at the organic research centre looking at woodchip for fuel  
**0:59:05-0:59:09:**  from hedge rows the thing that everybody says to you is oh no you can't use it from hedge  
**0:59:09-0:59:14:**  rows you've got too much bark the materials to the diameter is too small you'll have too  
**0:59:14-0:59:18:**  much bark in it and for Ramia woodchip that's exactly what you want you want the high bark  
**0:59:18-0:59:26:**  the high bud ratio because this material breaks down faster and it's more nutritionally dense  
**0:59:26-0:59:32:**  as well so it's sort of where the active part of the tree is I guess so we cut this material  
**0:59:32-0:59:41:**  from the on-farm sources and applied it to the soil so it's a way of closing the fertility  
**0:59:41-0:59:47:**  loop on farms and looking at becoming less reliant on external inputs while also I think  
**0:59:47-0:59:53:**  the nice thing is the trees have got deeper roots as well than your annual crops so you're  
**0:59:53-0:59:57:**  bringing some of that nutrients back up into the tree and then instead of the leaves just  
**0:59:57-1:00:02:**  falling underneath the tree with the woodchip if you then spread it onto the soil you're  
**1:00:02-1:00:06:**  moving some of that fertility back out into the field as well so again moving the trees  
**1:00:06-1:00:11:**  out into the tree fertility out into the field but there's a lot there's a lot of skepticism  
**1:00:11-1:00:15:**  about whether you can put woodchip on annual and your sort of cropping areas and whether  
**1:00:15-1:00:20:**  you will get nitrogen lock up in particular also the feasibility around it was something  
**1:00:20-1:00:25:**  that we looked at quite closely in the trials because I think that the organic research  
**1:00:25-1:00:29:**  center one of the really nice things about a lot of the research that I was involved  
**1:00:29-1:00:34:**  in when I was there and I think the organization as a whole focuses on is making sure that  
**1:00:34-1:00:41:**  what we're doing is actually practically feasible and works as well for the farmers yeah so  
**1:00:41-1:00:45:**  we measured all sorts of different things with the farmers with this woodchip we put  
**1:00:45-1:00:53:**  it on every year we added another trial so we had different phases of the rotation so  
**1:00:53-1:01:00:**  at Tolly's we had woodchip over four years in four different locations which was great  
**1:01:00-1:01:06:**  so we could see the sort of impact with the early trial of that woodchip a few years on  
**1:01:06-1:01:13:**  and a few years down the road as well so after a few crops had been planted and so we monitored  
**1:01:13-1:01:20:**  the crop health we monitored the soil health as well and the soil nutrients over the over  
**1:01:20-1:01:26:**  the four-year period and I guess one of the headlines is we didn't really find any negative  
**1:01:26-1:01:34:**  impacts we half expected to see sort of nitrogen lock up and and certainly the crop in the  
**1:01:34-1:01:40:**  first year following woodchip to see some sort of impacts on the on the crop health  
**1:01:40-1:01:44:**  of the woodchip with potentially then following years and when you look to the literature  
**1:01:44-1:01:50:**  which is quite limited on on other trials you did see the sort of dip where the woodchip  
**1:01:50-1:01:54:**  in the first year is maybe locking up a bit of nitrogen and and then as it breaks down  
**1:01:54-1:01:58:**  you haven't got that and I think maybe we were a bit cautious because we the trials  
**1:01:58-1:02:04:**  were on farm so and they were on commercial farms we didn't have a sort of trial field  
**1:02:04-1:02:10:**  that we were doing it on it had to fit in so at Tolles and Wakelands the woodchip went  
**1:02:10-1:02:17:**  onto a legume lay so you've got that sort of legume nitrogen fixing legumes maybe offsetting  
**1:02:17-1:02:21:**  some of the nitrogen lock up if there was any with the woodchip but we didn't see any  
**1:02:21-1:02:25:**  nitrogen lock up really any of it did spit at all. Three years on at Tolles we saw a  
**1:02:25-1:02:30:**  slight maybe on the cabbages on the brassicas a slight sort of dip in the growth in the  
**1:02:30-1:02:36:**  early growth then we followed them through to harvest and we saw no negative effects  
**1:02:36-1:02:41:**  on on on that at all as well and there was even some signs that there may be a positive  
**1:02:41-1:02:47:**  effect on yield as well although the the data wasn't significant enough to sort of say yes  
**1:02:47-1:02:52:**  definitely rameo woodchip definitely gives you an increase in yield there was some signs  
**1:02:52-1:02:59:**  that it may have been positive and some signs as well that the impacts on pest indices of  
**1:02:59-1:03:04:**  the woodchip may have been positive in some aspects as well the marketable yield of potatoes  
**1:03:04-1:03:09:**  over two years of the trial at Tolles were higher in the rameo woodchip than in the other  
**1:03:09-1:03:16:**  plots. And just to understand the the trials a bit so the woodchips are just kind of spread  
**1:03:16-1:03:24:**  on the soil surface at what kind of volume and what time of the year? So we spread them  
**1:03:24-1:03:33:**  in the winter when the sort of so you want to cut the material and spread it as soon  
**1:03:33-1:03:38:**  as possible after cutting so it's fresh and cut it with the leaves off because with the  
**1:03:38-1:03:44:**  leaves on the tree the balance when it breaks down is slightly different and it's more bacterially  
**1:03:44-1:03:48:**  rather than fungal dominated the woodchips is when it breaks it breaks down so we spread  
**1:03:48-1:03:52:**  in winter which creates some problems when you've got wet ground and in particular at  
**1:03:52-1:03:57:**  Wakelands it was a very wet year one year so finding that window to spread was quite  
**1:03:57-1:04:08:**  tricky. The volume the rates we were varied so for the application rates we tried to match  
**1:04:08-1:04:15:**  the application rate that they were the farms were using with compost so Tolly was using  
**1:04:15-1:04:21:**  sort of 60 cubic meters of compost 60 cubic meters per hectare of compost so we used the  
**1:04:21-1:04:25:**  same amount of woodchip but to a certain extent the application rates were determined by the  
**1:04:25-1:04:29:**  amount of material we had available as well so again it's sort of taking a practical point  
**1:04:29-1:04:35:**  of view we work with the farmer to look at what area we had for the trial and how we  
**1:04:35-1:04:39:**  could set it up so that we had enough replicates to get good data and then what area we had  
**1:04:39-1:04:44:**  there and then how much material we had to coppice and how we could match that to the  
**1:04:44-1:04:52:**  application rates so there was a bit of variability and we did it it was about 60 at Wakelands  
**1:04:52-1:04:57:**  at the Arable farm he used a lot of green waste compost and he also had quite a lot  
**1:04:57-1:05:05:**  of a large mature hedge that he wanted to use and chip for the trial so the application  
**1:05:05-1:05:09:**  rate there was quite a lot higher and that made me quite nervous because he wasn't putting  
**1:05:09-1:05:14:**  it onto a legume lay as well and he was putting a higher application rate on just prior to  
**1:05:14-1:05:20:**  a spring crop and then putting a spring crop in sort of a month or two after I'm sort of  
**1:05:20-1:05:25:**  thinking oh my god the nitrogen lock up but actually because he was conventional he was  
**1:05:25-1:05:29:**  putting nitrogen on as well so I guess you offset that potential nitrogen lock up with  
**1:05:29-1:05:36:**  an application of mineral nitrogen and then at Wakelands we had that flexibility with  
**1:05:36-1:05:42:**  the different coppice species because there's so many trees there that the application rate  
**1:05:42-1:05:47:**  so it wasn't such a problem and we started with quite a low application rate and the  
**1:05:47-1:05:52:**  first year of monitoring we didn't really see any difference between the treatment and  
**1:05:52-1:05:55:**  then Martin came out and said right next year let's double the application rate and reapply  
**1:05:55-1:06:01:**  it and he made our experimental design very complex up there which I cursed him for when  
**1:06:01-1:06:07:**  I was analyzing the data but it was actually quite interesting because we had that sort  
**1:06:07-1:06:12:**  of double application with a higher rate which did sort of push the system a little bit into  
**1:06:12-1:06:20:**  into showing us some differences and we definitely saw a sort of jump up in soil organic matter  
**1:06:20-1:06:27:**  which we didn't see in the other lower application rates even actually at Down Farm so the farm  
**1:06:27-1:06:34:**  the conventional farm we didn't see that but we reapplied it at Wakelands we saw that difference  
**1:06:34-1:06:39:**  and yes soil health we monitored as well so we looked at different elements of soil health  
**1:06:39-1:06:45:**  we looked at soil respiration we looked at the different sort of key nutrients as well  
**1:06:45-1:06:51:**  and then we counted a lot of worms Joe helps count worms as well Joe's a worm expert so  
**1:06:51-1:06:55:**  we did an actual two species survey of worms as well and found an insane amount of worms  
**1:06:55-1:07:02:**  at Tolly's high numbers of worms at all three sites but an awful lot of Tolly's and sort  
**1:07:02-1:07:07:**  of a slight sort of differentiation in species as well between the treatments that the species  
**1:07:07-1:07:13:**  overall I think were not particularly spectacular they were mainly your common types but there  
**1:07:13-1:07:19:**  was a slightly different species set that we found in the compost treated rather than  
**1:07:19-1:07:26:**  the Ramia wood chip treated sites I think my overall conclusion is that the compost  
**1:07:26-1:07:30:**  of the Ramia wood chip doesn't necessarily replace the compost it has a slightly different  
**1:07:30-1:07:38:**  action and I think potentially you want to use both of them in what's the word I'm looking  
**1:07:38-1:07:45:**  for together basically but maybe one cycle of compost and a few years later a cycle of  
**1:07:45-1:07:47:**  Ramia wood chips so you've got these sort of different actions on the soil that both  
**1:07:47-1:07:51:**  of them are producing for the application rates we tried to match the application rates  
**1:07:51-1:07:55:**  and the compost you were comparing to was composted Ramia wood chips or was it just  
**1:07:55-1:07:57:**  bought in compost?  
**1:07:57-1:08:05:**  It was composted wood chip at Tolly's which is the material that he uses it was green  
**1:08:05-1:08:11:**  waste compost at the conventional arable which he produces on site he's got a green waste  
**1:08:11-1:08:17:**  composting plant on site so that was there and then at Wakelands actually we didn't have  
**1:08:17-1:08:22:**  a compost treatment we just compared the different species of wood chip against each other we  
**1:08:22-1:08:27:**  included a sort of mixed hedge there as well and when you look at the when we did a sort  
**1:08:27-1:08:32:**  of analysis of the chemical composition of the substrate the compost or the wood chip  
**1:08:32-1:08:37:**  before we applied it as well and the different species of wood chips had really quite big  
**1:08:37-1:08:45:**  differences between the nutrients that was available in them but this didn't sort of  
**1:08:45-1:08:50:**  carry through into the soil but maybe it would after a number of years.  
**1:08:50-1:08:55:**  Willow in particular was quite low overall in nutrients compared to some of the other  
**1:08:55-1:08:59:**  species which is quite interesting because in a way willow is one of the species that's  
**1:08:59-1:09:04:**  maybe best suited for ramia wood chip production as well because it's fast growing and you  
**1:09:04-1:09:10:**  can cop it quite easily so you can sort of fit it into your system and as a veg grow  
**1:09:10-1:09:15:**  it's certainly one of the species that we're thinking about using but then the nutrients  
**1:09:15-1:09:19:**  in it is lower but that's probably matched by the fast growing nature of the tree as  
**1:09:19-1:09:20:**  well.  
**1:09:20-1:09:26:**  But then you would would the ideal be having a variety a mix of different tree species  
**1:09:26-1:09:34:**  to try and have a balanced input of nutrients or do you think it's not that important?  
**1:09:34-1:09:38:**  I would instinctively say yes.  
**1:09:38-1:09:44:**  I don't think the results of this trial necessarily back up that but that's my instinct and I  
**1:09:44-1:09:51:**  think with more years of research you would perhaps see like the results because these  
**1:09:51-1:09:57:**  sort of soil it changes quite slowly over time and wood chip as well the action of wood  
**1:09:57-1:10:02:**  chip on soil I think is quite a long term process for it to sort of break down and fully  
**1:10:02-1:10:06:**  realise its action.  
**1:10:06-1:10:10:**  So yeah I think I would instinctively say yes a mixture would be better but then that's  
**1:10:10-1:10:16:**  probably partly the fact that I'm totally sold on the idea that diversity is important  
**1:10:16-1:10:17:**  as well.  
**1:10:17-1:10:21:**  I just wanted to say as well that the three farms I suppose as well that we used in the  
**1:10:21-1:10:25:**  study all had even the conventional arable because he was using quite high amounts of  
**1:10:25-1:10:33:**  green waste compost on a regular basis all had very high existing levels of sort of soil  
**1:10:33-1:10:40:**  biology and soil health so it'd be quite interesting to try the same technique on a more degraded  
**1:10:40-1:10:41:**  soil.  
**1:10:41-1:10:45:**  I think you may see more spectacular results on a degraded soil.  
**1:10:45-1:10:51:**  Yeah that's very interesting because just to understand properly you're saying that  
**1:10:51-1:10:58:**  on the two farms that used compost you didn't really see a difference between ramial wood  
**1:10:58-1:11:04:**  chips and then compost in terms of plant reaction that they were pretty equal is that kind of  
**1:11:04-1:11:05:**  what you said?  
**1:11:05-1:11:10:**  Yeah they were pretty equal we saw some fairly subtle differences but not a huge amount.  
**1:11:10-1:11:15:**  There was increased phosphorus overall with the ramial wood chip and there were some differences  
**1:11:15-1:11:22:**  again I think in the potato crop at Tolly's we saw a difference in marketable yield so  
**1:11:22-1:11:28:**  the the ramial wood chip had lower slug damage than the compost which surprised me actually  
**1:11:28-1:11:33:**  I wasn't expecting to find that but we did see this sort of lower instance of slug damage  
**1:11:33-1:11:37:**  in the ramial wood chip and that was on both years as well so it's two years later in two  
**1:11:37-1:11:41:**  different fields so I think there's a little bit more certainty that that was actually  
**1:11:41-1:11:42:**  a trend.  
**1:11:42-1:11:47:**  I guess it'd be interesting to to be able to compare as well how energy intensive and  
**1:11:47-1:11:54:**  time consuming the two inputs are because it's true that ramial wood chips you know  
**1:11:54-1:11:58:**  instinctively you kind of think well it's great that you're able to almost equal the  
**1:11:58-1:12:04:**  results of compost with like something that's you know if you have planted trees and you  
**1:12:04-1:12:09:**  can have like on-site input production but then I don't know how it would compare once  
**1:12:09-1:12:14:**  you take into account the chipping etc because both seem to be you know quite labor intensive  
**1:12:14-1:12:18:**  inputs but it'd be interesting to have that comparison.  
**1:12:18-1:12:22:**  I think we did we did try and get our heads around that comparison that was something  
**1:12:22-1:12:28:**  I was definitely interested in and I think on a purely financial basis you wouldn't just  
**1:12:28-1:12:34:**  produce ramial wood chip as opposed to compost but then when you tie it into the fact that  
**1:12:34-1:12:41:**  you need to manage your trees on site anyway and if you want to reduce your reliance on  
**1:12:41-1:12:47:**  external inputs so if you're producing material on site to compost then you've got to go through  
**1:12:47-1:12:52:**  that process anyway whereas if you're relying on sort of external deliveries of material  
**1:12:52-1:12:57:**  that you either compost yourself or external deliveries of ready-made compost then that  
**1:12:57-1:13:05:**  in at the moment I think is more economically viable but I think there's going to be a future  
**1:13:05-1:13:11:**  where maybe there's going to be more value attributed to green waste compost and to wood  
**1:13:11-1:13:20:**  chip and becoming reliant becoming sort of self-reliant is maybe a good goal as well.  
**1:13:20-1:13:25:**  Sure for my own interest is Tolly still using ramial wood chips and will he carry on to  
**1:13:25-1:13:26:**  use it?  
**1:13:26-1:13:34:**  I think he will yeah I don't know I'm sort of yeah I hope he will I think he's quite  
**1:13:34-1:13:39:**  sold on it though and I think he's also inspired other people I mean we're certainly planning  
**1:13:39-1:13:43:**  to try using it and I've spoken to various other growers as well it fits quite nicely  
**1:13:43-1:13:47:**  that's the thing if you can get your sort of like windbreak short rotation coppice rows  
**1:13:47-1:13:52:**  and you can not move the material too far so you can be basically having your wood chip  
**1:13:52-1:13:57:**  production very close to your your vegetable production and I think and you tie it in with  
**1:13:57-1:14:02:**  your rotation so that's your lay phase then I think it can work very nicely with the system  
**1:14:02-1:14:09:**  and I think Tolly will carry on using it he's a wood chip addict.  
**1:14:09-1:14:15:**  Yeah so I think the the last question I wanted to ask both of you because you have that kind  
**1:14:15-1:14:19:**  of more global vision you've you've done trials on different farms and you know Sally you're  
**1:14:19-1:14:26:**  working on a farm as well and you have experience with agroforestry for you you know what what  
**1:14:26-1:14:31:**  kind of has to change for agroforestry to scale up or what what is the main challenge  
**1:14:31-1:14:37:**  is it you know a change in mentality is it more technical solutions that have to be developed  
**1:14:37-1:14:42:**  you know where do you see the kind of main thing main blockades to be lifted for us to  
**1:14:42-1:14:45:**  scale up agroforestry?  
**1:14:45-1:14:51:**  I think it is the mentality question really and you know we've been involved for 10 years  
**1:14:51-1:14:55:**  or so and in the early early years people didn't know the word they didn't know agroforestry  
**1:14:55-1:15:00:**  they didn't understand it and you just had a few pioneering farmers like Stephen Briggs  
**1:15:00-1:15:08:**  and Martin and taking it forward but it is that kind of peer-to-peer sharing of the experience  
**1:15:08-1:15:14:**  that I think we've seen it grow over the last 10 years and you know it's it's now definitely  
**1:15:14-1:15:21:**  more widely understood and widely known in the UK and more people are doing it so bit  
**1:15:21-1:15:27:**  by bit it is increasing we are hearing about all these systems that are being planted or  
**1:15:27-1:15:34:**  people using their resources on farm in a different way and so I think it is that change  
**1:15:34-1:15:38:**  of mentality of trees aren't a bad thing to have on the farm and recognizing the benefits  
**1:15:38-1:15:43:**  and perhaps going that step to making them a productive part of the farm is is the way  
**1:15:43-1:15:51:**  forward. I mean obviously it's you know in terms of support farm support and agroforestry  
**1:15:51-1:15:55:**  has suffered from kind of falling through the gaps of not being agriculture and not  
**1:15:55-1:16:00:**  being forestry and being some kind of weird combination of the two and you know classically  
**1:16:00-1:16:04:**  that it's not you know if you've got too many trees you lose kind of eligibility for for  
**1:16:04-1:16:11:**  your farm payments and I think we're seeing greater recognition from policy makers that  
**1:16:11-1:16:18:**  you know agroforestry provides a way of storing carbon and you know improving the environment  
**1:16:18-1:16:22:**  whilst maintaining agricultural productivity as well and so it should be something that  
**1:16:22-1:16:28:**  that is supported even if it is complicated and I think in the UK and the European level  
**1:16:28-1:16:36:**  there's greater support for agroforestry amongst policy makers as well.  
**1:16:36-1:16:42:**  Yeah I think I'd agree with all of that I'd maybe only add the need for advice as well  
**1:16:42-1:16:47:**  I think we come across a lot of farmers who are quite keen to do it but want that just  
**1:16:47-1:16:52:**  that little bit of help because it's quite complex and there are lots of different options  
**1:16:52-1:16:56:**  out there about where you plant them and also when you put a tree in the ground it's not  
**1:16:56-1:17:01:**  like an annual crop where you can change it next year that tree will be there for a significant  
**1:17:01-1:17:05:**  length of time so I think it's sort of getting over that hurdle and that step of planting  
**1:17:05-1:17:10:**  the trees is a mindset thing but also the need for advice and sort of that peer-to-peer  
**1:17:10-1:17:16:**  learning as well so exactly like this podcast basically getting people to listen to the  
**1:17:16-1:17:20:**  experiences of other farmers and hear them and see them as well.  
**1:17:20-1:17:26:**  Yeah and having a bit of support for getting the trees planted so and the Woodland Trust  
**1:17:26-1:17:32:**  in the UK have been really successful working with farmers helping them design their scheme  
**1:17:32-1:17:37:**  their agroforestry systems and giving support for the trees so paying for the trees paying  
**1:17:37-1:17:43:**  paying for the protection of the trees as well so I think just having you know a little  
**1:17:43-1:17:49:**  bit of money input at that early stage to support the tree planting has been hugely  
**1:17:49-1:17:54:**  beneficial as well as the advice that they've been given giving to the farmers.  
**1:17:54-1:18:00:**  Well yeah thank you so much for all this information it's been really fascinating for me to get  
**1:18:00-1:18:06:**  a bit of a different perspective on these questions because so far we've mainly talked  
**1:18:06-1:18:12:**  to farmers and organizations and we haven't had the chance to talk to researchers so yeah  
**1:18:12-1:18:18:**  thank you so much I really enjoyed this conversation and yeah maybe we'll have you another time  
**1:18:18-1:18:19:**  on the podcast then.  
**1:18:19-1:18:25:**  Yeah thank you it's been fun.  
**1:18:25-1:18:28:**  Thanks very much it's been nice talking to you.  
**1:18:28-1:18:32:**  I hope you enjoyed the episode some of you have been getting in touch with us with some  
**1:18:32-1:18:36:**  ideas and feedback and we really appreciate that and we'll do our best to try and include  
**1:18:36-1:18:41:**  it in upcoming interviews with our guests.  
**1:18:41-1:18:46:**  If you'd like to get in touch with us as well you can do so on social media or websites  
**1:18:46-1:18:58:**  as usual we'll have included all the relevant links down below in the description.

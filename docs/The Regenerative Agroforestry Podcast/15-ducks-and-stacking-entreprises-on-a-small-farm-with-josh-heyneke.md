### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sun, 07 Feb 2021 18:32:56)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:48:**  Hi everyone and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:50:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:50-0:00:56:**  Today we have the pleasure of talking with Josh Heineke from Park Courag in Wales.  
**0:00:56-0:01:02:**  This episode is really interesting because we get to really go in detail on his pastured  
**0:01:02-0:01:04:**  duck egg enterprise.  
**0:01:04-0:01:09:**  And this might not be the usual focus mainly on trees and interactions in the system, but  
**0:01:09-0:01:13:**  it is very interesting because it gives us a real understanding of the opportunities  
**0:01:13-0:01:17:**  and constraints of integrating dogs with other productions.  
**0:01:17-0:01:22:**  And anyone who doesn't know much about that will find it really interesting as we did.  
**0:01:22-0:01:24:**  We hope you enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:24-0:01:26:**  Hi Josh, welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:26-0:01:27:**  Hey guys, thanks for having me.  
**0:01:27-0:01:32:**  To get started it would be really great if we could have a bit of an introduction to  
**0:01:32-0:01:35:**  your farm and an overview of your story.  
**0:01:35-0:01:37:**  Yeah, cool.  
**0:01:37-0:01:42:**  Well yeah, thanks again for having me on.  
**0:01:42-0:01:47:**  So as you guys might be able to hear, my accent is slightly strange.  
**0:01:47-0:01:52:**  I'm actually South African, born and raised in Cape Town.  
**0:01:52-0:02:02:**  And about 10 years ago I moved to the UK to live and work in London with my wife, Abigail,  
**0:02:02-0:02:05:**  who's British.  
**0:02:05-0:02:11:**  And yeah, we spent about eight years working in London.  
**0:02:11-0:02:19:**  My background is in marketing and sales, specifically in the tech sector.  
**0:02:19-0:02:28:**  So when I arrived in London, I got involved in the world of apps and smartphones very  
**0:02:28-0:02:29:**  early on.  
**0:02:29-0:02:35:**  And that was like my obsession when I first started my working career.  
**0:02:35-0:02:45:**  I was obsessed with tech and computers and growing trends in the tech space.  
**0:02:45-0:02:52:**  But after about eight years living and working in London, Abigail and I sort of reached a  
**0:02:52-0:02:59:**  point where we were a little bit sick of it all, to be honest with you.  
**0:02:59-0:03:05:**  We had concerns for the environment.  
**0:03:05-0:03:09:**  We had a few of our own sort of health problems.  
**0:03:09-0:03:13:**  And we were desperate to just get out of the city.  
**0:03:13-0:03:20:**  And we were desperate to do something with our hands and get outside, to be honest.  
**0:03:20-0:03:26:**  I'd been sitting in an office staring out the window at the sky wanting to be outside  
**0:03:26-0:03:29:**  and be in the fresh air.  
**0:03:29-0:03:38:**  And we had always joked about one day retiring and buying a farm and having animals and growing  
**0:03:38-0:03:41:**  our own food.  
**0:03:41-0:03:48:**  And eventually one day we sort of reached a point in London where we had had enough.  
**0:03:48-0:03:56:**  And we started exploring this idea of actually getting a farm and starting to farm.  
**0:03:56-0:04:02:**  And we didn't know how we would do it because it's an incredibly expensive thing to do,  
**0:04:02-0:04:08:**  especially in the UK where land is really expensive.  
**0:04:08-0:04:14:**  And the long story short is we ended up selling our flat in London and going on a little road  
**0:04:14-0:04:17:**  trip around the UK.  
**0:04:17-0:04:29:**  And we were lucky enough that we managed to come across 10 acres of pasture in Wales with  
**0:04:29-0:04:38:**  a little derelict Welsh cottage about four minutes up the road from that land.  
**0:04:38-0:04:45:**  That was an incredibly cheap buy because the house was in ruin and needed work.  
**0:04:45-0:04:53:**  So we came across a really good deal and we managed to be able to afford the land and  
**0:04:53-0:04:54:**  the house.  
**0:04:54-0:05:03:**  And yeah, we purchased that in sort of mid 2016 and here we are today.  
**0:05:03-0:05:13:**  So we started our farm and business sort of about 2017.  
**0:05:13-0:05:20:**  Farm's name is Parkarig, which in Welsh means stone field.  
**0:05:20-0:05:25:**  And that was just the name that was given to the fields by the previous owners.  
**0:05:25-0:05:27:**  And we just really liked it.  
**0:05:27-0:05:30:**  We thought Parkarig was quite a cool name.  
**0:05:30-0:05:39:**  Unlike most Welsh words, Parkarig is actually pretty easy to pronounce for most people.  
**0:05:39-0:05:40:**  So we thought we'd go with that.  
**0:05:40-0:05:45:**  But yeah, Abby and I have no experience in farming.  
**0:05:45-0:05:51:**  I mean, we had no experience in farming.  
**0:05:51-0:05:59:**  All we had was YouTube and the internet and Google and the various sort of permaculture  
**0:05:59-0:06:01:**  books that are out there.  
**0:06:01-0:06:08:**  Early on, we were really inspired by Mark Sheppard and Joel Salatin and Jean Martin  
**0:06:08-0:06:11:**  Fortier.  
**0:06:11-0:06:21:**  And yeah, we just became obsessed with permaculture, really inspired by permaculture and really  
**0:06:21-0:06:26:**  inspired by the idea of becoming self-sufficient.  
**0:06:26-0:06:36:**  And then as time went on and we started learning more and more, we came across this concept  
**0:06:36-0:06:44:**  of regenerative agriculture and we really sort of settled on that framework as the way  
**0:06:44-0:06:47:**  we wanted to move forward with our farm, Parkarig.  
**0:06:47-0:06:52:**  So yeah, that was in 2016.  
**0:06:52-0:06:59:**  We purchased the land and really things really only got kicked off properly in about 2017.  
**0:06:59-0:07:04:**  And are you both working, you and your partner and your wife, sorry, on the farm?  
**0:07:04-0:07:09:**  Yeah, so Abby and I are both 100% on the farm.  
**0:07:09-0:07:20:**  We made the decision early on when we quit our jobs in London and sold the flat, we decided  
**0:07:20-0:07:31:**  that we made a very definitive decision to go and become farmers as a career.  
**0:07:31-0:07:39:**  Even though we knew how difficult it was going to be to actually earn a living farming, we  
**0:07:39-0:07:47:**  thought that unless we actually, through everything we had at it, we'd never achieve anything  
**0:07:47-0:07:55:**  with it because there's a term called death ground strategy that I came across in a book,  
**0:07:55-0:08:00:**  which is just the concept that if you put your back up against the wall and you've got  
**0:08:00-0:08:06:**  no other, you've got no escape route, you'll fight way harder to survive.  
**0:08:06-0:08:13:**  And that's what Abby and I have done since leaving London.  
**0:08:13-0:08:21:**  So we took all of our savings and paid ourselves a salary from the very beginning and invested  
**0:08:21-0:08:26:**  all of our money in the land and this little cottage that we live in.  
**0:08:26-0:08:28:**  And we've not-  
**0:08:28-0:08:29:**  That's very brave.  
**0:08:29-0:08:35:**  Yeah, I mean, it's been incredibly scary and very stressful, especially in the first few  
**0:08:35-0:08:38:**  years when we were just like, what the hell are we doing?  
**0:08:38-0:08:43:**  We have no idea what we're doing and we don't know where to start.  
**0:08:43-0:08:52:**  And looking at 10 acres of grass, it's like a writer staring at a blank piece of paper  
**0:08:52-0:08:56:**  wondering what to put on the page.  
**0:08:56-0:09:07:**  It was a pretty scary experience in the beginning, but we were really motivated by the idea of  
**0:09:07-0:09:17:**  wanting to make a living 100% on the land and from farming.  
**0:09:17-0:09:23:**  And partly the reason why we wanted to do that is because we wanted to be our own bosses.  
**0:09:23-0:09:28:**  We didn't want to work for anyone else any longer and we just wanted to have the total  
**0:09:28-0:09:32:**  freedom of running our own business.  
**0:09:32-0:09:37:**  And we decided farming was going to be what we did.  
**0:09:37-0:09:46:**  So yeah, to answer your question in a long kind of way, Abby and I have been 100% on  
**0:09:46-0:09:48:**  Park and Rigg from the beginning.  
**0:09:48-0:09:56:**  It would be great to know after all of these decisions were made and everything and this  
**0:09:56-0:10:04:**  brave move to the countryside was done, what have you put on this blank slate?  
**0:10:04-0:10:08:**  What are you producing at the moment and who are you selling to?  
**0:10:08-0:10:09:**  Cool, yeah.  
**0:10:09-0:10:17:**  So like I said, we've got 10 acres and that's not a lot of space from a farming point of  
**0:10:17-0:10:20:**  view, especially if you want to try and make it commercially viable.  
**0:10:20-0:10:32:**  So our main focus right now is poultry and we have around about just under 400 ducks  
**0:10:32-0:10:38:**  at the moment for eggs and that is our primary business.  
**0:10:38-0:10:48:**  But around those ducks, we run about 50 breeding ewes, so we sell lamb, hoggets and mutton  
**0:10:48-0:10:51:**  locally.  
**0:10:51-0:11:01:**  We also planted about 700 blueberries on Park Rigg, which we actually haven't yet started  
**0:11:01-0:11:04:**  harvesting commercially.  
**0:11:04-0:11:07:**  So they've taken quite a while to establish and I can talk a bit more about that later  
**0:11:07-0:11:11:**  on.  
**0:11:11-0:11:20:**  So we've got the duck eggs, we've got meat, we've got blueberries and lastly we have annual  
**0:11:20-0:11:28:**  crops which change every year and really this is only our, we've only finished our fourth  
**0:11:28-0:11:34:**  season actually farming commercially.  
**0:11:34-0:11:39:**  So each year we sort of try a different thing when it comes to the annual cultivation, we  
**0:11:39-0:11:43:**  try something different each year.  
**0:11:43-0:11:51:**  Last year, the last two years actually we've done cut flowers and I can talk a little bit  
**0:11:51-0:11:58:**  more about that later on as to where that did and didn't work.  
**0:11:58-0:12:07:**  Last year, sorry, this year we'll be growing squash, specifically squash and I can talk  
**0:12:07-0:12:11:**  a bit more about why we're growing squash this year.  
**0:12:11-0:12:20:**  But yeah, so it's primarily duck eggs, blueberries, meat and then a variety of annual crops.  
**0:12:20-0:12:29:**  Okay and to give a bit of context to our listeners, tell us where you're located in Wales and  
**0:12:29-0:12:36:**  especially, this is the interesting one, how much rainfall do you have?  
**0:12:36-0:12:43:**  Rainfall in Wales, I should have actually, so we've got a lot of rainfall in Wales, off  
**0:12:43-0:12:51:**  the top of my head I can't put it into, I can't quantify it for you but it is a lot.  
**0:12:51-0:13:02:**  We are in West Wales, South West Wales in Camardinshire and yeah, it is very wet, incredibly  
**0:13:02-0:13:05:**  wet.  
**0:13:05-0:13:15:**  Otherwise in the winter, it doesn't really get colder, any colder than minus five centigrade.  
**0:13:15-0:13:27:**  It tends to hang around between one and five degrees centigrade during the winter.  
**0:13:27-0:13:35:**  Although in recent years, I think it's definitely been generally quite warm and wet which, you  
**0:13:35-0:13:38:**  know, no one likes.  
**0:13:38-0:13:51:**  In summer, it doesn't really tend to get, it doesn't get more than 25C very often.  
**0:13:51-0:13:56:**  There'll be periods where it's sort of between 25 and 30 degrees C but they don't last very  
**0:13:56-0:13:59:**  long.  
**0:13:59-0:14:06:**  And recently we have had, since we've arrived actually, I think probably three out of the  
**0:14:06-0:14:14:**  four years we've been here, we've probably had the worst droughts in the summer time  
**0:14:14-0:14:18:**  that our neighbours have ever seen actually.  
**0:14:18-0:14:20:**  And that's, you know, we've not been here long.  
**0:14:20-0:14:28:**  So it's been, it has been very dry in the spring specifically and then it has been incredibly  
**0:14:28-0:14:32:**  wet through the winter and autumn months.  
**0:14:32-0:14:37:**  Josh, could you tell us a bit more about where you sell your produce?  
**0:14:37-0:14:43:**  Because I don't know much about whales, but I figure it to be fairly remote for most of  
**0:14:43-0:14:44:**  it.  
**0:14:44-0:14:49:**  And I'm just wondering where you manage to sell duck eggs, if it's difficult or not.  
**0:14:49-0:14:53:**  And same thing for sheep in a region that produces a lot.  
**0:14:53-0:14:59:**  Yeah, so West Wales is pretty remote.  
**0:14:59-0:15:09:**  I mean, you know, we are quite far away from the majority of the economic activity in the  
**0:15:09-0:15:10:**  UK.  
**0:15:10-0:15:18:**  And so this part of the country, there are quite a few retired people who live out here,  
**0:15:18-0:15:23:**  but it's very sparsely populated.  
**0:15:23-0:15:26:**  So it can be quite difficult.  
**0:15:26-0:15:37:**  It's not as easy to sell your produce directly at a premium price here as it might be in  
**0:15:37-0:15:40:**  other parts of the country.  
**0:15:40-0:15:51:**  We however do have two local organic wholesalers, which we sell our duck eggs to.  
**0:15:51-0:16:00:**  And we also have a CSA down in Swansea called Kytan, which is really popular actually.  
**0:16:00-0:16:05:**  It's a really, really great example of a CSA.  
**0:16:05-0:16:10:**  Probably a good global example actually, but especially in the UK, it's probably one of  
**0:16:10-0:16:14:**  the best CSAs in the UK.  
**0:16:14-0:16:23:**  So we sell our duck eggs through Kytan in Swansea and they are about an hour and a half's  
**0:16:23-0:16:24:**  drive away from us.  
**0:16:24-0:16:28:**  So it's not convenient for us to deliver the eggs there.  
**0:16:28-0:16:34:**  For quite a while, we actually used a regular courier to send our eggs to Swansea for that  
**0:16:34-0:16:39:**  CSA.  
**0:16:39-0:16:42:**  But over time, it just didn't work out.  
**0:16:42-0:16:49:**  There were too many breakages and no matter what we did with the packaging or complaining  
**0:16:49-0:16:53:**  to the courier, nothing helped.  
**0:16:53-0:16:55:**  Couriers just throw packages around way too much.  
**0:16:55-0:17:01:**  So even if you write eggs everywhere and put fragile tape over it, they still throw the  
**0:17:01-0:17:02:**  thing around.  
**0:17:02-0:17:11:**  So eventually we managed to do a deal with our friends up the road who are organic wholesalers  
**0:17:11-0:17:15:**  and they just deliver them to Swansea for us for free actually.  
**0:17:15-0:17:18:**  They happen to be going there every week.  
**0:17:18-0:17:24:**  So they're just doing us a favor and getting our eggs to Kytan now.  
**0:17:24-0:17:29:**  But the logistics around getting our eggs to Kytan has always been a challenge up until  
**0:17:29-0:17:31:**  recently.  
**0:17:31-0:17:39:**  But that route to market for us is really great because that's the only channel where  
**0:17:39-0:17:46:**  we're selling our eggs at a retail price and it makes a huge difference.  
**0:17:46-0:17:54:**  We only sell about 20 dozen a week to Kytan, but getting that full retail price makes a  
**0:17:54-0:17:56:**  huge difference for us.  
**0:17:56-0:18:02:**  So we sell to two organic wholesalers in the area who then sell that on to the various  
**0:18:02-0:18:04:**  retailers in the area.  
**0:18:04-0:18:14:**  We sell to Kytan, the CSA, and then lastly, as of last year 2020, we managed to get in  
**0:18:14-0:18:24:**  with Able and Cole, which is a really great online organic retailer here in the UK.  
**0:18:24-0:18:29:**  And they're one of the largest online organic box schemes.  
**0:18:29-0:18:30:**  They're really cool.  
**0:18:30-0:18:33:**  You should check them out if you don't know them already.  
**0:18:33-0:18:40:**  So we now, as of last year, we sell our duck eggs through them.  
**0:18:40-0:18:49:**  And in terms of the meat, we've tried a variety of different things.  
**0:18:49-0:18:57:**  We've sold our meat boxes online by courier actually.  
**0:18:57-0:19:03:**  And so we've sold meat boxes nationally.  
**0:19:03-0:19:11:**  We've sold them both frozen and just cold, chilled using an insulated packaging that's  
**0:19:11-0:19:16:**  actually made from sheep's wool, believe it or not.  
**0:19:16-0:19:17:**  And that does incredibly well.  
**0:19:17-0:19:23:**  So you package it up and you wrap the sheep's wool around the meat, box it up, ship it off  
**0:19:23-0:19:32:**  for the courier, and it actually stays cold or frozen for three or four days at a push.  
**0:19:32-0:19:44:**  But we've sent meat nationally by next day courier for the last two years or so.  
**0:19:44-0:19:53:**  We also sell our meat locally to people through various retailers that we know.  
**0:19:53-0:19:57:**  They've sort of put us in touch with people looking for meat direct from farms.  
**0:19:57-0:20:04:**  So we've tried selling meat both locally and by box.  
**0:20:04-0:20:09:**  I actually prefer selling the meat locally.  
**0:20:09-0:20:12:**  It's much less stressful.  
**0:20:12-0:20:17:**  You don't have to worry about the courier losing the package or the package getting  
**0:20:17-0:20:20:**  delayed or sitting in a warm warehouse somewhere.  
**0:20:20-0:20:26:**  So yeah, I do prefer selling that way.  
**0:20:26-0:20:39:**  In regards to other produce, the cut flowers, we started off selling some at a local market  
**0:20:39-0:20:46:**  and then decided to go for online sales to sell it through the letterbox.  
**0:20:46-0:20:49:**  I'm not sure if you've heard of letterbox flowers before, but...  
**0:20:49-0:20:50:**  No, I haven't.  
**0:20:50-0:21:01:**  Yeah, so there's a company in the UK who sell packaging, which is the size of your letterbox,  
**0:21:01-0:21:02:**  but it's really long.  
**0:21:02-0:21:09:**  So you can put cut stems in that box and you can then send those cut stems just by post  
**0:21:09-0:21:16:**  basically and they can just get slid through the letterbox.  
**0:21:16-0:21:17:**  And it works great.  
**0:21:17-0:21:19:**  It works really, really well.  
**0:21:19-0:21:25:**  Obviously you want to choose flowers which are going to last better being out of water  
**0:21:25-0:21:28:**  and that's fine.  
**0:21:28-0:21:33:**  Abby did quite a lot of testing and came up with a really nice variety of flowers that  
**0:21:33-0:21:39:**  work by post.  
**0:21:39-0:21:43:**  So that whole concept works great and it's fantastic because we can sell our flowers  
**0:21:43-0:21:47:**  direct to the consumer and we can sell them nationally.  
**0:21:47-0:21:55:**  The only problem that we had was last year was going to be our big year for flower sales.  
**0:21:55-0:22:04:**  When it came to buying the packaging for the letterboxes, there was absolutely none available  
**0:22:04-0:22:08:**  and it was because of COVID.  
**0:22:08-0:22:13:**  I think basically there was something went wrong in the supply chain and the company  
**0:22:13-0:22:20:**  that we used to buy the letterboxes just stopped selling them basically.  
**0:22:20-0:22:25:**  And strangely they are literally the only company that make these letterboxes and I  
**0:22:25-0:22:32:**  went to a few other companies to see if they could make the same thing for us, but it just  
**0:22:32-0:22:36:**  worked out to be prohibitively expensive.  
**0:22:36-0:22:43:**  We just decided to scrap it last year and we didn't do the flowers through the letterbox.  
**0:22:43-0:22:46:**  So that would have been how we sell flowers.  
**0:22:46-0:22:50:**  That's really interesting, I never heard about that system.  
**0:22:50-0:22:56:**  But I was thinking moving on a bit to more the production aspect, since duck eggs is  
**0:22:56-0:23:02:**  the main one for you, could you tell us a bit more about that operation and the different  
**0:23:02-0:23:08:**  aspects and steps in raising ducks?  
**0:23:08-0:23:16:**  We keep khaki campbells primarily, but we also have duck campbells and we also have  
**0:23:16-0:23:20:**  Welsh harlequins.  
**0:23:20-0:23:28:**  Welsh harlequins are actually related to the khaki campbell, but they were a random genetic  
**0:23:28-0:23:34:**  mutation where they threw all sorts of beautiful patterning and they got named the Welsh harlequin.  
**0:23:34-0:23:41:**  But as many of your listeners might know, the khaki campbells are the world's best egg-laying  
**0:23:41-0:23:49:**  duck breed and they've been around for quite some time and they haven't been subject to  
**0:23:49-0:23:55:**  the same intensive breeding programs that most commercial chickens have.  
**0:23:55-0:24:02:**  They're still incredibly healthy birds and they are incredibly good at foraging over  
**0:24:02-0:24:05:**  large spaces.  
**0:24:05-0:24:19:**  In about 2018 we actually got our first flock of 100 ducks for Park Harig.  
**0:24:19-0:24:28:**  We decided to go for a permanent house, so rather than doing mobile housing which is  
**0:24:28-0:24:37:**  really obviously really popular amongst most regenerative farmers, the idea of being able  
**0:24:37-0:24:46:**  to rotate your chickens behind your sheep or your cattle is great, but in our circumstance  
**0:24:46-0:24:52:**  we decided to go for a static house for a number of reasons.  
**0:24:52-0:25:00:**  One of the reasons is that ducks don't take kindly to change, they really like having  
**0:25:00-0:25:09:**  a very consistent routine and they don't really like to be moved around as much as chickens  
**0:25:09-0:25:15:**  might.  
**0:25:15-0:25:23:**  Similar to that, you can herd ducks, so we can rotate our ducks around Park Harig but  
**0:25:23-0:25:27:**  then we can always herd them back to their house.  
**0:25:27-0:25:32:**  It's not like trying to herd chickens where they just scatter everywhere, ducks herd very  
**0:25:32-0:25:36:**  well and it's quite fun to do actually.  
**0:25:36-0:25:41:**  But the primary reason we decided to go for a static house is because as I mentioned earlier  
**0:25:41-0:25:48:**  we get a lot of rainfall in Wales and I was really concerned about how we were going to  
**0:25:48-0:25:57:**  move any mobile housing around on the fields without completely tearing them up.  
**0:25:57-0:26:05:**  If you're moving a house every few days on our fields 365 days a year, it won't be long  
**0:26:05-0:26:10:**  before we just have a mud pit basically.  
**0:26:10-0:26:15:**  So we decided that instead of having a mobile house that we moved around the fields with  
**0:26:15-0:26:21:**  a tractor or a car or whatever, we would build a static house.  
**0:26:21-0:26:29:**  We would keep the ducks there every night and then in the morning we would herd them  
**0:26:29-0:26:37:**  to a different station on the farm and encourage them to forage in that particular area for  
**0:26:37-0:26:43:**  a few days to a week and then move them on after that.  
**0:26:43-0:26:52:**  The other thing about ducks is that they really love water and they need water in order to  
**0:26:52-0:26:59:**  feed so they have to keep going back to their pools in order to properly wash down their  
**0:26:59-0:27:00:**  food.  
**0:27:00-0:27:09:**  We've got mobile paddle pools and IBCs with water in them and we've got the IBCs dotted  
**0:27:09-0:27:12:**  around the farm in various locations.  
**0:27:12-0:27:19:**  So we fill up these mobile paddle pools with water, we take the ducks to that area, they  
**0:27:19-0:27:23:**  swim and enjoy it and they hang around where the water is mostly.  
**0:27:23-0:27:28:**  Then when we want to move them on we just pour the dirty water out into whatever shrubs  
**0:27:28-0:27:39:**  might be nearby and then we fill them up in another location and the ducks move on.  
**0:27:39-0:27:47:**  That's how we rotate the ducks around the farm and that's why we decided to go for a  
**0:27:47-0:27:49:**  static house.  
**0:27:49-0:27:53:**  I'm curious about the feeding.  
**0:27:53-0:28:01:**  How do the ducks, you mentioned foraging but I was curious about the proportion of food  
**0:28:01-0:28:06:**  that they get from forage and how much you have to bring in as I could expect maybe grain  
**0:28:06-0:28:10:**  or how does their feeding work?  
**0:28:10-0:28:18:**  The feed is, as with most poultry, the number one problem from a regenerative point of view  
**0:28:18-0:28:24:**  is that it's our, and from the business side of things, it's our biggest input, it's our  
**0:28:24-0:28:34:**  biggest cost and it's where we make the most environmental impact.  
**0:28:34-0:28:48:**  So our ducks actually eat about 130 to 140 grams of feed each per day in the winter and  
**0:28:48-0:28:52:**  then in the summer it'll be a fair amount less than that.  
**0:28:52-0:29:01:**  It'll probably be more like 110, 120 grams of feed per duck per day but they do forage  
**0:29:01-0:29:11:**  a lot and I think that if we didn't have the forage for them, they would eat a lot more.  
**0:29:11-0:29:14:**  Ducks generally do eat more than chickens and that's quite well known.  
**0:29:14-0:29:23:**  They are very hungry birds but they are also incredibly good foragers.  
**0:29:23-0:29:31:**  So we do have to feed them and I have looked into many, many different ways as to how we  
**0:29:31-0:29:40:**  might be able to reduce that feed consumption and it's very difficult because you are asking  
**0:29:40-0:29:50:**  the bird to do a hell of a lot producing eggs year round and eggs with high quality.  
**0:29:50-0:29:57:**  But in terms of foraging, those ducks are on every square inch of the fields.  
**0:29:57-0:30:05:**  They go to every corner of our 10 acre fields and we have noticed, I mean when we first  
**0:30:05-0:30:15:**  purchased our fields back in 2016 and we were just sort of walking around on this big blank  
**0:30:15-0:30:23:**  set of fields with pretty much nothing other than grass, we had so many slugs.  
**0:30:23-0:30:26:**  I can't even describe to you how many slugs we had.  
**0:30:26-0:30:33:**  In fact, for about 3 or 4 months we actually lived on our fields before we had managed  
**0:30:33-0:30:37:**  to complete the purchase on our house.  
**0:30:37-0:30:39:**  All we had was the fields and we didn't yet have anywhere to live.  
**0:30:39-0:30:45:**  So we had a caravan and we put the caravan on the fields and we lived in the caravan  
**0:30:45-0:30:52:**  on the fields for about 3 or 4 months and it was so terrible.  
**0:30:52-0:30:57:**  Slugs would just, we would come home to our caravan at night and they would just be crawling  
**0:30:57-0:31:04:**  everywhere all over our shoes and our tent and our caravan everywhere and if you walked  
**0:31:04-0:31:09:**  along the fields they would basically be crawling up your legs.  
**0:31:09-0:31:12:**  The climate in Wales for slugs is just perfect.  
**0:31:12-0:31:16:**  It's like warm and wet.  
**0:31:16-0:31:25:**  And honestly, right now we just, there are still slugs on our fields but the ducks have  
**0:31:25-0:31:30:**  completely put them under control.  
**0:31:30-0:31:38:**  And now whenever we grow something that is prone to slug damage, I mean I'll come back  
**0:31:38-0:31:46:**  to this later but our annual veg garden or annual garden is directly below the duck house  
**0:31:46-0:31:52:**  because of the fact that we produce so much manure in the duck house we wanted a quick  
**0:31:52-0:31:57:**  easy place to go and dump that which is on our annual garden.  
**0:31:57-0:32:00:**  And there are no slugs there to worry about.  
**0:32:00-0:32:05:**  I mean we can grow, our neighbours, like we can grow crops that our neighbours would be  
**0:32:05-0:32:13:**  terrified about growing because of the slug damage but it doesn't affect us because those  
**0:32:13-0:32:14:**  ducks keep it in check.  
**0:32:14-0:32:19:**  They absolutely love slugs.  
**0:32:19-0:32:26:**  In terms of pests, the other thing that the ducks actually eat which we learnt sort of  
**0:32:26-0:32:34:**  some part way into our journey with ducks, we learnt that they also happen to like eating  
**0:32:34-0:32:38:**  voles, specifically baby voles.  
**0:32:38-0:32:46:**  So if they come across a nest of baby voles they will gobble them up and early on we actually  
**0:32:46-0:32:55:**  had quite a lot of vol damage to our blueberries where voles would sort of burrow around the  
**0:32:55-0:32:59:**  roots of the blueberries and cause damage.  
**0:32:59-0:33:04:**  And I don't see that anymore and I'm pretty sure that the ducks have something to do with  
**0:33:04-0:33:10:**  it because they spend a lot of time in the blueberry patch foraging around there and  
**0:33:10-0:33:15:**  they've got their beaks in all the little holes and all the mulch and stuff.  
**0:33:15-0:33:18:**  Another reason why there are so many voles in our blueberry patch is because of how much  
**0:33:18-0:33:23:**  mulch we use on blueberries.  
**0:33:23-0:33:28:**  So using mulch on blueberries is fantastic but it also tends to harbour a lot of pests  
**0:33:28-0:33:30:**  and things like voles.  
**0:33:30-0:33:36:**  So combining the ducks with that has been incredibly beneficial.  
**0:33:36-0:33:45:**  So that brings you very nicely to one of the big topics that we wanted to work with you.  
**0:33:45-0:33:51:**  Of course we talked about this previously before this interview together but the whole  
**0:33:51-0:33:56:**  point of our talk was to really focus on the interactions between the different elements  
**0:33:56-0:34:04:**  which you started to introduce there with the gardens and the ducks and also with the  
**0:34:04-0:34:05:**  berries and the ducks.  
**0:34:05-0:34:11:**  We have a special interest in understanding your berry system and how the ducks are interacting  
**0:34:11-0:34:15:**  with that.  
**0:34:15-0:34:21:**  Of course you mentioned some of the pest issues that have been controlled or that are managed  
**0:34:21-0:34:24:**  by the ducks which is fascinating.  
**0:34:24-0:34:29:**  But could you also give us a description of how they're rotated in the system?  
**0:34:29-0:34:31:**  How often do you put them in there?  
**0:34:31-0:34:39:**  So like I said we planted about 700 blueberries and there's more to talk about in terms of  
**0:34:39-0:34:43:**  what else we planted around those blueberries and underneath the blueberries.  
**0:34:43-0:34:51:**  But just to start off with the ducks, so they spend quite a lot of time in the blueberry  
**0:34:51-0:34:54:**  patch.  
**0:34:54-0:35:02:**  We don't have, with our ducks we don't have a rotation, we don't have a super quick rotation  
**0:35:02-0:35:07:**  on our farm so we don't rotate every sort of three days or even every week.  
**0:35:07-0:35:13:**  We tend to spend a couple of weeks in one spot and then a couple of weeks in another  
**0:35:13-0:35:16:**  spot and then a couple of weeks in another spot.  
**0:35:16-0:35:23:**  Within each of those spots there are rotations so because ducks can create mud when they  
**0:35:23-0:35:29:**  dabble in the fields they can, if there's any standing water and they dabble there they  
**0:35:29-0:35:31:**  will create mud.  
**0:35:31-0:35:38:**  So we have sort of, you could divide our 10 acres up into sort of four quadrants and they'd  
**0:35:38-0:35:42:**  spend a few weeks in each of those quadrants.  
**0:35:42-0:35:54:**  And within each of those quadrants they'd probably spend four days on a different spot.  
**0:35:54-0:35:59:**  So there'd be a few IBCs there filled with water and we'd rotate them around inside that  
**0:35:59-0:36:07:**  quadrant so that they don't create any negative impact on the soil in that one spot.  
**0:36:07-0:36:09:**  Without fencing right?  
**0:36:09-0:36:12:**  You just move the IBC and the ducks follow.  
**0:36:12-0:36:13:**  Yeah without fencing.  
**0:36:13-0:36:22:**  So we do have fencing between the four quadrants that I mentioned that there is fencing there  
**0:36:22-0:36:23:**  that isn't perfect.  
**0:36:23-0:36:25:**  I'll say it's not.  
**0:36:25-0:36:34:**  That fencing is mainly for sheep and it broadly sort of keeps the ducks in that general area.  
**0:36:34-0:36:40:**  But the ducks are basically in our hedges, they pop through the sheep fences, they love  
**0:36:40-0:36:47:**  to run up and down the hedges and forage deep within the hedges where we've just got no  
**0:36:47-0:36:50:**  chance of getting them if they go in there.  
**0:36:50-0:36:59:**  But yeah so the general quadrants that I mentioned we have some fencing between that but generally  
**0:36:59-0:37:07:**  speaking we don't try and fence the ducks in, we just move their water and they spend  
**0:37:07-0:37:13:**  the vast majority of time at those water stations and then they do like little sort of missions  
**0:37:13-0:37:18:**  where they go off and they scatter out and they go and forage and then they come back  
**0:37:18-0:37:23:**  to their water and then they drink and they hang out and they swim and then they do another  
**0:37:23-0:37:26:**  little excursion out and they forage.  
**0:37:26-0:37:29:**  So you're making them seem like such fun animals.  
**0:37:29-0:37:35:**  We can imagine a group of mates having some fun.  
**0:37:35-0:37:43:**  They are, they're incredibly busy little things and they're constantly active.  
**0:37:43-0:37:49:**  There is a time during the day where they'll just chill out and have a sleep but most of  
**0:37:49-0:37:57:**  the time they're like running around, they're like running to the next slug.  
**0:37:57-0:38:06:**  But yeah so the reason we didn't like with the fencing side of things and with the rotations  
**0:38:06-0:38:12:**  like I can see with chickens how it might be a bit different.  
**0:38:12-0:38:17:**  The way they scratch the ground creates a lot more impact than ducks generally do.  
**0:38:17-0:38:20:**  Like ducks have flat feet and they don't scratch the ground.  
**0:38:20-0:38:28:**  They do dabble in it with their beaks but they create a lot less impact like that on  
**0:38:28-0:38:31:**  the soil than chickens do unless there's standing water.  
**0:38:31-0:38:37:**  If there's standing water, ducks will just dive in and take advantage and you've got  
**0:38:37-0:38:38:**  a problem very quickly.  
**0:38:38-0:38:45:**  So managing like water on our farm is the number one challenge and the most important  
**0:38:45-0:38:48:**  thing to do especially in Wales.  
**0:38:48-0:38:53:**  But generally speaking ducks cause a lot less impact than chickens do and when we looked  
**0:38:53-0:38:58:**  at our farm system and how we were going to manage ducks like trying to fence them in  
**0:38:58-0:39:07:**  and rotate them was just going to be so complicated and time consuming that we just sort of let  
**0:39:07-0:39:10:**  it happen and we just sort of went with the flow.  
**0:39:10-0:39:17:**  Like we gently guide them with water around the farm but we don't try and force them to  
**0:39:17-0:39:24:**  stay in any particular spot because a we don't really see any negative consequences and b  
**0:39:24-0:39:33:**  I think it would just cause us too much hassle, too much cost in both time and fencing to  
**0:39:33-0:39:35:**  practically do.  
**0:39:35-0:39:40:**  And in terms of predators do you get any issues due to that lack of fencing?  
**0:39:40-0:39:49:**  Yeah we do have issues but what we've got so the predators are generally seasonal so  
**0:39:49-0:39:55:**  well first of all our main problem is foxes.  
**0:39:55-0:40:03:**  We do every now and then get other little guys coming along but it's mainly foxes that  
**0:40:03-0:40:15:**  are the problem and foxes they only really strike at night except during the spring when  
**0:40:15-0:40:21:**  they are feeding their young when they've had a litter and they're trying to feed their  
**0:40:21-0:40:31:**  young or when young foxes, young new foxes come into the territory and they don't and  
**0:40:31-0:40:35:**  they don't no one's given them the memo on the fact that they're not meant to hunt during  
**0:40:35-0:40:36:**  the day.  
**0:40:36-0:40:45:**  So either juvenile foxes or hungry mothers that are trying to feed their babies those  
**0:40:45-0:40:51:**  are the two times when it's risky during the spring and so the only time they really come  
**0:40:51-0:40:56:**  out during the daytime is in the spring.  
**0:40:56-0:41:03:**  So most of the year the ducks are fine because they're in very secure night housing and we've  
**0:41:03-0:41:10:**  got a lot of electric that we keep very hot set up and that keeps them safe.  
**0:41:10-0:41:16:**  But during the springtime we have had we have we did go through a year where we had quite  
**0:41:16-0:41:26:**  a few daytime kills and so what we've done is we've actually gone and we've created a  
**0:41:26-0:41:29:**  really big safe zone.  
**0:41:29-0:41:37:**  So we put we put some fox proof electric fencing in a big ring around the blueberry patch and  
**0:41:37-0:41:42:**  around our annual garden and around the duck house.  
**0:41:42-0:41:48:**  And during the springtime when there's danger of daytime kills we leave the ducks in that  
**0:41:48-0:41:55:**  center ring and it's a really big space so they've still got lots of room to forage but  
**0:41:55-0:41:58:**  they're protected from the foxes.  
**0:41:58-0:42:00:**  So that's how we've gotten around that so far.  
**0:42:00-0:42:06:**  Now that we've like really covered the you know the basics of of of duck you know we've  
**0:42:06-0:42:13:**  done duck 101 duck production which is which is I personally didn't know much about it  
**0:42:13-0:42:15:**  at all.  
**0:42:15-0:42:19:**  Let's recenter a bit to ducks and berries.  
**0:42:19-0:42:25:**  So how are the ducks interacting with the berries and you know more broadly speaking why did  
**0:42:25-0:42:30:**  you integrate the ducks in the berry patch and how successful has it been?  
**0:42:30-0:42:43:**  Yeah so it just seemed like such a good combination ducks and blueberries because primarily at  
**0:42:43-0:42:52:**  the moment it's I'd say it's it does it's been more beneficial for the ducks than it has for the blueberries at this point.  
**0:42:52-0:42:59:**  But I wouldn't say that it's been negative it's been negative for the blueberries.  
**0:42:59-0:43:02:**  There are pros and cons.  
**0:43:02-0:43:08:**  So ducks will eat blueberries that's the first point to make.  
**0:43:08-0:43:14:**  They don't preference them over a slug should I say that if there was a slug and a blueberry  
**0:43:14-0:43:19:**  next to each other they'd go for the slug.  
**0:43:19-0:43:23:**  But ducks are also very short and they don't have a very high reach.  
**0:43:23-0:43:32:**  So we we are really looking at this as more the blueberries is more of a long term investment.  
**0:43:32-0:43:35:**  So as those blue blueberry bushes typically get pretty big.  
**0:43:35-0:43:41:**  I mean I'd say probably around two meters high.  
**0:43:41-0:43:50:**  So in the years to come the berries will not be around the base of the bush.  
**0:43:50-0:43:54:**  The vast majority of them will be well out of reach of the ducks.  
**0:43:54-0:44:00:**  So from commercial point of view on the berries we we look at them as more of a long term  
**0:44:00-0:44:04:**  investment.  
**0:44:04-0:44:09:**  The ducks don't do any of the damage to the blueberry bushes apart from picking the berries  
**0:44:09-0:44:11:**  that they can reach.  
**0:44:11-0:44:14:**  They don't strip the bark or do anything like that.  
**0:44:14-0:44:21:**  They also don't scratch around the base of the blueberries like a chicken would.  
**0:44:21-0:44:26:**  And that's part that was actually one of the early reasons why we decided to go for ducks  
**0:44:26-0:44:34:**  over chickens is because we were mulching our blueberries with a lot of wood chip at  
**0:44:34-0:44:36:**  the time.  
**0:44:36-0:44:42:**  And we were concerned that if we had chickens in there they would just literally scratch  
**0:44:42-0:44:46:**  all the wood chip away from underneath the blueberries.  
**0:44:46-0:44:51:**  Also blueberries have a really fine root system like almost like hairs that run along the  
**0:44:51-0:44:53:**  surface of the soil.  
**0:44:53-0:44:57:**  So they're very shallow, very fine root system.  
**0:44:57-0:45:05:**  And we weren't too comfortable with having chickens scratching that root system too.  
**0:45:05-0:45:08:**  In practice I don't know if it would have harmed them but we just weren't comfortable  
**0:45:08-0:45:10:**  with that.  
**0:45:10-0:45:18:**  So ducks were ducks work quite well with blueberries in that sense that you know they're flat footed.  
**0:45:18-0:45:22:**  They dabble a bit with their beaks but they won't rip up the roots and they won't spread  
**0:45:22-0:45:27:**  the mulch around.  
**0:45:27-0:45:36:**  So yeah I think the ducks and the blueberries play well nicely.  
**0:45:36-0:45:41:**  Obviously the blueberries provide shade and shelter for the ducks and they really love  
**0:45:41-0:45:42:**  that.  
**0:45:42-0:45:49:**  They'll go and like nest underneath the blueberry bush in the hot sun.  
**0:45:49-0:45:58:**  And because we've put so much mulch down underneath the blueberries and we've also planted an  
**0:45:58-0:46:09:**  array of beneficial plants underneath the blueberries, there's a lot of habitat there.  
**0:46:09-0:46:17:**  So when we set up the blueberry patch our goal was always to create as much habitat  
**0:46:17-0:46:26:**  as we can that would collaborate or live alongside the blueberries as best as possible.  
**0:46:26-0:46:36:**  And that habitat which provides lots of space for insects and voles actually provides a  
**0:46:36-0:46:40:**  lot of forage for the ducks at the same time.  
**0:46:40-0:46:48:**  So as much as possible we wanted to try and build an ecosystem within the blueberry patch.  
**0:46:48-0:47:04:**  We didn't want to use plastic sheet mulching, permanent plastic to keep the weeds away.  
**0:47:04-0:47:09:**  Obviously we weren't going to spray any pesticides or whatever to keep the weeds away.  
**0:47:09-0:47:14:**  We also decided pretty early on that it just wasn't because of the size of our blueberry  
**0:47:14-0:47:20:**  patch and because of the fact that we're not using any sort of mechanized weeding systems,  
**0:47:20-0:47:27:**  we decided that weeding the blueberry patch by hand was pretty much unfeasible.  
**0:47:27-0:47:37:**  I mean it's huge and like we tried for the first few years weeding it and we got lots  
**0:47:37-0:47:38:**  of help.  
**0:47:38-0:47:43:**  But it was just like a never-ending impossible task.  
**0:47:43-0:47:51:**  So we decided instead of trying to fight the weeds we would essentially encourage growth  
**0:47:51-0:47:52:**  of all sorts of different plants.  
**0:47:52-0:47:57:**  We'd sow and plant as many different things as we could that we thought might be beneficial  
**0:47:57-0:48:04:**  to the ecosystem in general and that might fight off the grass somewhat.  
**0:48:04-0:48:11:**  So as a result we've got something of an ecosystem establishing in there and an understory underneath  
**0:48:11-0:48:18:**  the blueberries which is establishing and which the ducks like quite a lot.  
**0:48:18-0:48:24:**  And just to recap, to understand where the idea of integrating both came from, it was  
**0:48:24-0:48:29:**  really starting from like a slug control perspective or more from a weeding perspective.  
**0:48:29-0:48:33:**  What was really the initial idea?  
**0:48:33-0:48:39:**  So the blueberry patch, so when we bought our fields and looked at that blank slate  
**0:48:39-0:48:45:**  and tried to figure out what on earth we were going to do, we knew we wanted a combination  
**0:48:45-0:48:52:**  of things because we weren't going to set up a monoculture.  
**0:48:52-0:48:55:**  But we didn't know exactly what that combination was going to be.  
**0:48:55-0:49:04:**  So we started by implementing the blueberry patch purely because we knew that it was going  
**0:49:04-0:49:08:**  to take five years before they started being really productive anyway.  
**0:49:08-0:49:11:**  So we thought, well, we may as well get this process kickstarted.  
**0:49:11-0:49:13:**  We knew we wanted blueberries.  
**0:49:13-0:49:17:**  We knew we had the right soil for it.  
**0:49:17-0:49:21:**  We knew that they would grow okay in the area because we'd seen someone locally growing  
**0:49:21-0:49:27:**  them and we knew they were a high value crop and we liked eating blueberries ourselves.  
**0:49:27-0:49:30:**  So we decided, okay, we're going to go for blueberries.  
**0:49:30-0:49:35:**  And we went ahead and we just planted 700 blueberries.  
**0:49:35-0:49:41:**  And then we sort of moved on to the next stage, which was how are we going to manage the grass  
**0:49:41-0:49:42:**  and the hedges?  
**0:49:42-0:49:46:**  And we decided we'd use sheep for that.  
**0:49:46-0:49:49:**  And I can talk more about the tree rows that we've got separately.  
**0:49:49-0:49:56:**  But it was only after getting, we just decided to go and get a handful of, we got like seven  
**0:49:56-0:50:03:**  ducks from a friend up the road just because we were interested in them.  
**0:50:03-0:50:08:**  And we just fell in love with ducks, to be honest with you.  
**0:50:08-0:50:14:**  It was only a little bit later that we decided to do ducks commercially and that they would  
**0:50:14-0:50:18:**  work well with the blueberry patch.  
**0:50:18-0:50:24:**  There was never any requirement to reduce pests.  
**0:50:24-0:50:29:**  Like blueberries don't tend to really suffer that much from, they don't suffer from slug  
**0:50:29-0:50:30:**  damage.  
**0:50:30-0:50:35:**  For example, slugs don't really impact blueberries.  
**0:50:35-0:50:36:**  Vols do impact blueberries.  
**0:50:36-0:50:44:**  We didn't actually know we'd had, we would have a vol problem until it popped up.  
**0:50:44-0:50:49:**  But then we found out that the ducks were helping with the vols in the end.  
**0:50:49-0:50:54:**  So that was sort of by accident.  
**0:50:54-0:51:01:**  But generally the reason we, I'd say when we decided to go for ducks commercially, one  
**0:51:01-0:51:09:**  of the reasons was that we knew that they would have less negative impact on the beds  
**0:51:09-0:51:10:**  underneath the blueberries.  
**0:51:10-0:51:16:**  And so, and that we wouldn't have to manage them too carefully under the blueberries.  
**0:51:16-0:51:21:**  So I'd say it was initially, it was mostly because we thought the ducks would do less  
**0:51:21-0:51:26:**  harm than chickens would do.  
**0:51:26-0:51:31:**  And we just really wanted to get ducks because we thought they were really cool for a number  
**0:51:31-0:51:32:**  of reasons.  
**0:51:32-0:51:38:**  Initially you integrated them more out of like a constraint in terms of space and to  
**0:51:38-0:51:43:**  be able to stack enterprises and make your like 10 acres as productive as possible rather  
**0:51:43-0:51:51:**  than really out of like kind of mutual beneficial interaction between two elements.  
**0:51:51-0:51:52:**  Yeah, that's correct.  
**0:51:52-0:51:58:**  So stacking enterprises on Parc Carig was something we knew we had to do from the beginning  
**0:51:58-0:52:03:**  because 10 acres was never going to be enough for a monoculture and we didn't want to do  
**0:52:03-0:52:04:**  a monoculture.  
**0:52:04-0:52:16:**  So we knew that having a perennial crop, some ruminants, some poultry, some trees, some  
**0:52:16-0:52:21:**  annual cultivation, we knew that just having all of those things in combination on the  
**0:52:21-0:52:30:**  fields would increase biodiversity and would improve the soil and if managed correctly  
**0:52:30-0:52:34:**  would be beneficial generally from an ecological point of view.  
**0:52:34-0:52:40:**  So we knew that just having multiple different elements to our business and multiple different  
**0:52:40-0:52:46:**  enterprises would be beneficial not only commercially but also ecologically.  
**0:52:46-0:52:55:**  But we didn't at that point have, I think that we started off thinking, well, the ducks  
**0:52:55-0:52:58:**  are not going to do any damage to the blueberries.  
**0:52:58-0:53:02:**  So that was our first, I think, point of decision making.  
**0:53:02-0:53:09:**  We did also think, well, the ducks are at the very least going to fertilize the blueberries  
**0:53:09-0:53:12:**  through their manure by foraging in there.  
**0:53:12-0:53:19:**  And we did quite early on realize that there would be a lot of habitat in the blueberry  
**0:53:19-0:53:22:**  patch which the ducks could forage on.  
**0:53:22-0:53:35:**  So I think from the beginning it was probably more a case of realizing that the ducks would  
**0:53:35-0:53:40:**  not cause any harm to the blueberries but also that the blueberries would probably provide  
**0:53:40-0:53:44:**  some forage to the ducks.  
**0:53:44-0:53:45:**  That makes sense.  
**0:53:45-0:53:50:**  It's kind of hard to, thinking back now, it's kind of hard to remember in which order we  
**0:53:50-0:53:55:**  made those decisions but it all kind of unfolded quite well.  
**0:53:55-0:54:01:**  I'm curious about the weeding in the blueberry patch.  
**0:54:01-0:54:09:**  How effective are the ducks at removing or taking care of the weeding operation?  
**0:54:09-0:54:13:**  Because of course, I imagine you're not getting rid of all the grass.  
**0:54:13-0:54:16:**  You've probably got rows with some grass in between as well.  
**0:54:16-0:54:22:**  But how much do you intervene by hand and how much do you just let the ducks do the  
**0:54:22-0:54:23:**  work?  
**0:54:23-0:54:26:**  Yeah, so actually to be honest with you, the ducks did a terrible job at weeding.  
**0:54:26-0:54:31:**  I mean, they don't really, like I said earlier, they don't scratch around with their feet  
**0:54:31-0:54:33:**  like chickens do.  
**0:54:33-0:54:39:**  So chickens would actually do a better job weeding but they would have to be managed  
**0:54:39-0:54:42:**  a lot more carefully to concentrate that weeding.  
**0:54:42-0:54:48:**  And also they'd probably cause more damage to the blueberries root systems than good.  
**0:54:48-0:54:54:**  But the ducks don't really weed because they've got those flat feet and they dabble with their  
**0:54:54-0:54:59:**  beaks around the base of the blueberries and in between the bushes looking for insects.  
**0:54:59-0:55:03:**  They really are more carnivorous than they are.  
**0:55:03-0:55:12:**  They much prefer eating more insects than they do herbage compared to chicken.  
**0:55:12-0:55:15:**  So yeah, the ducks don't really...  
**0:55:15-0:55:21:**  I should have phrased it in a different way.  
**0:55:21-0:55:22:**  I wasn't clear enough.  
**0:55:22-0:55:28:**  Maybe I meant about how effective they are at suppressing the grasses.  
**0:55:28-0:55:33:**  For example, if you manage to get them in the patch and to really give a big hit on  
**0:55:33-0:55:38:**  the grass for a quite significant amount of time, it will really reduce the pressure of  
**0:55:38-0:55:41:**  the grasses on the berries, for example.  
**0:55:41-0:55:47:**  And I'm curious to what extent you can use the ducks to really control the grass and  
**0:55:47-0:55:48:**  keep it suppressed.  
**0:55:48-0:55:53:**  So you've been at strategic times so that you're benefiting the growth and limiting  
**0:55:53-0:55:57:**  of the berries and you're limiting the competition from the grass.  
**0:55:57-0:56:06:**  Yeah, what the ducks tend to do with the grass is they flatten it.  
**0:56:06-0:56:13:**  And the impact that ducks have on grass is mostly literally just foot traffic, like lots  
**0:56:13-0:56:16:**  of little flat feet busily running around.  
**0:56:16-0:56:19:**  And so it is a bit like...  
**0:56:19-0:56:26:**  It's not quite like hoof impact from ruminants, but they do a little bit of nibbling of the  
**0:56:26-0:56:29:**  grass, but they don't do much grass eating.  
**0:56:29-0:56:34:**  Okay, I had the understanding that they did quite a bit of foraging.  
**0:56:34-0:56:42:**  Yeah, so when I say foraging, I mean, I'm actually purely talking about insects, to  
**0:56:42-0:56:43:**  be honest with you.  
**0:56:43-0:56:44:**  Okay, okay, nice.  
**0:56:44-0:56:46:**  Okay, that's good clarification.  
**0:56:46-0:56:54:**  Yeah, that's probably something I should have highlighted earlier, more so is that another...  
**0:56:54-0:56:59:**  I mean, when I told you about all the slugs that we had on our fields, I mean, that was  
**0:56:59-0:57:04:**  another huge motivation for us to get ducks because it's something that you'll see commonly  
**0:57:04-0:57:10:**  a lot on the internet about ducks is how much they'll eat slugs and how much they'll forage  
**0:57:10-0:57:13:**  for insects, more so than chickens.  
**0:57:13-0:57:21:**  I mean, I've seen ducks neck down like huge slugs that they nearly choked on, to be honest  
**0:57:21-0:57:22:**  with you.  
**0:57:22-0:57:26:**  Like, you can see them literally gobble it down and go down their throats.  
**0:57:26-0:57:30:**  And it's like this big lump that sort of like goes on the throat, they absolutely love it.  
**0:57:30-0:57:34:**  But ducks are much more carnivorous than chickens.  
**0:57:34-0:57:42:**  And yeah, when I mean forage, I mostly mean insects, although something really interesting  
**0:57:42-0:57:50:**  happened recently, which is that we found out that our ducks had been eating a lot and  
**0:57:50-0:57:52:**  I mean a lot of acorns.  
**0:57:52-0:57:58:**  Like we had a good year for acorns this year.  
**0:57:58-0:58:07:**  The oaks just dropped loads and we discovered that the ducks had been completely gobbling  
**0:58:07-0:58:10:**  up all the acorns.  
**0:58:10-0:58:17:**  And they were eating so much, in fact, that it was actually affecting the color of their  
**0:58:17-0:58:19:**  yolks.  
**0:58:19-0:58:24:**  And I found this because I was really worried, like we started getting these like strange  
**0:58:24-0:58:27:**  green yolks on our eggs.  
**0:58:27-0:58:34:**  Like a sort of a, it's hard to describe, but a sort of a almost like, yeah, basically just  
**0:58:34-0:58:35:**  olive green yolks.  
**0:58:35-0:58:42:**  And usually they're like, you know, really deep, rich orange colored.  
**0:58:42-0:58:49:**  And I ended up finding a study that was done in like the 1940s where they actually did  
**0:58:49-0:58:56:**  an experiment and they showed that specifically ducks, although chickens also do it, but ducks  
**0:58:56-0:58:59:**  particularly love acorns.  
**0:58:59-0:59:07:**  If you feed acorns to ducks, it takes about three or four days before their yolks start  
**0:59:07-0:59:08:**  going green.  
**0:59:08-0:59:14:**  And it's because of the tannins that are in the husk of acorns.  
**0:59:14-0:59:20:**  So the shell on the outside has lots of tannins in it and that actually turns the yolks green.  
**0:59:20-0:59:25:**  So I must have been scary at the beginning, like what's happening?  
**0:59:25-0:59:27:**  Because it's not very reassuring in terms of green.  
**0:59:27-0:59:32:**  We often associate with in food as a color that's, well, I mean, in the terms of eggs,  
**0:59:32-0:59:35:**  it would be something not reassuring, but in this case it's different.  
**0:59:35-0:59:38:**  And I wonder the influence that it would have on the taste as well.  
**0:59:38-0:59:39:**  Yeah.  
**0:59:39-0:59:44:**  So we were really nervous about it because we were like, oh man, why are we getting loads  
**0:59:44-0:59:47:**  of rotten eggs or something?  
**0:59:47-0:59:48:**  Like what's happening?  
**0:59:48-0:59:53:**  And then a few customers actually got in touch with us and said like, hey, just so you know,  
**0:59:53-0:59:56:**  like I've got this green egg popping up.  
**0:59:56-0:59:59:**  And yeah, we were really perturbed by it.  
**0:59:59-1:00:04:**  We were kind of like, what's going on here?  
**1:00:04-1:00:11:**  And yeah, we initially avoided eating them and then did some research on it.  
**1:00:11-1:00:14:**  And I was initially like, nah, really?  
**1:00:14-1:00:15:**  Is this true?  
**1:00:15-1:00:21:**  And I did more like scratching around and Googling and then actually came across the  
**1:00:21-1:00:22:**  study and I was like, no, this is legit.  
**1:00:22-1:00:25:**  They are actually eating acorns.  
**1:00:25-1:00:34:**  And then I remembered that I had seen like absolutely tons of acorns on the field.  
**1:00:34-1:00:40:**  And they had pretty much all disappeared since I'd seen them drop earlier this year, earlier  
**1:00:40-1:00:43:**  last year.  
**1:00:43-1:00:50:**  And then we realized that actually we were running two separate flocks.  
**1:00:50-1:00:55:**  So one of the flocks was in an area where the acorns had been dropping and the other  
**1:00:55-1:01:00:**  flock was in the central ring in the blueberry patch where there were no acorn trees, like  
**1:01:00-1:01:01:**  no oaks.  
**1:01:01-1:01:04:**  So there were no acorns in pasture.  
**1:01:04-1:01:10:**  And we realized that we were getting no, there were no green eggs coming out of the one flock  
**1:01:10-1:01:18:**  and all the green eggs were coming out of the other flock, which had access to acorns.  
**1:01:18-1:01:21:**  So we were pretty convinced that it had to be the acorns.  
**1:01:21-1:01:25:**  And we obviously ate the eggs and didn't die.  
**1:01:25-1:01:27:**  And we were happy with that.  
**1:01:27-1:01:29:**  The taste was slightly different.  
**1:01:29-1:01:35:**  Like it was, you'd really have to be looking for it to notice a difference in taste, but  
**1:01:35-1:01:38:**  yeah, slightly different.  
**1:01:38-1:01:46:**  Talking about the acorns and the trees around, you mentioned, well, I'd like to move on to  
**1:01:46-1:01:54:**  talking about hedges and that aspect of the farm, which you've planted a lot of.  
**1:01:54-1:02:00:**  So could you maybe explain to us what species you planted around the berries to start off  
**1:02:00-1:02:02:**  with and why?  
**1:02:02-1:02:08:**  Because you made a comment about it earlier on and I'm sure many of us are curious to  
**1:02:08-1:02:09:**  understand more about this.  
**1:02:09-1:02:10:**  Yeah, cool.  
**1:02:10-1:02:19:**  So actually when we were plowing the blueberry patch and when we had come to the realization  
**1:02:19-1:02:26:**  that we just weren't going to weed this thing by hand, I mean, like it was just unfeasible.  
**1:02:26-1:02:34:**  We started, instead of trying to fight the undergrowth, we started looking at what we  
**1:02:34-1:02:38:**  could sort of plant there that would compete with the grass.  
**1:02:38-1:02:45:**  And we noticed that you actually get in Wales, you get wild blueberries obviously tend to  
**1:02:45-1:02:50:**  be more of a North American crop and plant.  
**1:02:50-1:02:55:**  But in Wales, you do get something called the bilberry and they are like much smaller  
**1:02:55-1:02:58:**  versions of blueberries.  
**1:02:58-1:03:03:**  And we actually noticed that you get them growing in the hedges around the countryside  
**1:03:03-1:03:05:**  here.  
**1:03:05-1:03:15:**  And we thought, well, okay, why don't we try and mimic the hedges to some extent and plant  
**1:03:15-1:03:23:**  similar wild plants that you would see in the hedges alongside these cultivated blueberries.  
**1:03:23-1:03:32:**  And so we went down a path of sort of seeding and planting a bunch of different things in  
**1:03:32-1:03:35:**  the blueberry patch underneath the blueberries.  
**1:03:35-1:03:42:**  I mean, we planted a lot, like a lot of different stuff and a lot of it's disappeared and some  
**1:03:42-1:03:46:**  of it survived and then we've also had volunteers come up of other things.  
**1:03:46-1:03:53:**  But we planted things like cow parsley and yarrow, aquilegia.  
**1:03:53-1:03:59:**  We planted various bulbs, various alliums and daffodils, which you get in the hedges  
**1:03:59-1:04:00:**  here.  
**1:04:00-1:04:04:**  You get a lot of wild garlic in the hedges here, which I don't know if you guys have  
**1:04:04-1:04:12:**  come across, but it's like, it's this really awesome, just like leaf sort of succulent  
**1:04:12-1:04:19:**  leafy green that you get in the hedges, which if you crush it, it just stinks like garlic.  
**1:04:19-1:04:24:**  So in the spring you just get, you walk down the hedges and you just smell garlic everywhere.  
**1:04:24-1:04:31:**  So we planted little bulbs of wild garlic in the blueberry patch.  
**1:04:31-1:04:34:**  You also get wild strawberries in the hedges here.  
**1:04:34-1:04:41:**  So we planted cultivated strawberries in the blueberry patch.  
**1:04:41-1:04:46:**  And that's been, actually we spent quite a bit of time doing that and it's quite a large  
**1:04:46-1:04:51:**  part of our strategy in the blueberry patch, which is that because strawberries spread  
**1:04:51-1:04:58:**  so quickly and so easily and they compete incredibly well with the grass, we just figured,  
**1:04:58-1:05:05:**  we'll just plant as many strawberry runners as we can underneath the blueberries and let  
**1:05:05-1:05:10:**  them run wild basically.  
**1:05:10-1:05:15:**  And we'll harvest the strawberries for ourselves and if they do particularly well, we'll sell  
**1:05:15-1:05:16:**  them.  
**1:05:16-1:05:19:**  And we've done that and it's actually worked incredibly well.  
**1:05:19-1:05:26:**  Like the strawberries have spread a lot underneath the blueberries and it's difficult to tell  
**1:05:26-1:05:30:**  whether they're competing.  
**1:05:30-1:05:31:**  That was my concern.  
**1:05:31-1:05:36:**  Right now I was thinking, I was about to ask you, how is that dealing with competition  
**1:05:36-1:05:40:**  because standard procedure would have, you know, like let's say wood chip underneath  
**1:05:40-1:05:44:**  and just keeping it at that, especially in the establishment phase.  
**1:05:44-1:05:48:**  Yeah, so we do actually mulch.  
**1:05:48-1:05:54:**  So we're using a combination of mulch and understory.  
**1:05:54-1:05:59:**  So we do actually mulch directly underneath the blueberry.  
**1:05:59-1:06:07:**  And we started off using wood chip, but wood chip became for various reasons impractical  
**1:06:07-1:06:11:**  because of the fact that it's actually becoming kind of expensive to get people.  
**1:06:11-1:06:16:**  It used to be a waste product and now it's become really popular and getting hold of  
**1:06:16-1:06:20:**  wood chip is quite difficult for the right price.  
**1:06:20-1:06:24:**  And when you're doing it on that kind of scale, it gets quite expensive.  
**1:06:24-1:06:29:**  It's also quite a heavy and bulky thing to move around.  
**1:06:29-1:06:35:**  And I was getting silage trailers, like tractor loads of silage trailers coming onto the field.  
**1:06:35-1:06:43:**  I mean, we had, in one year we put eight silage trailers of wood chip on the blueberry patch  
**1:06:43-1:06:46:**  and we did that all by hand by wheelbarrow.  
**1:06:46-1:06:47:**  And it was just, it was immense.  
**1:06:47-1:06:56:**  It was so much work and it literally rotted away within kind of 18 to 24 months.  
**1:06:56-1:07:02:**  I mean, yeah, pretty much 18 months and the weeds were coming back up through it.  
**1:07:02-1:07:06:**  So we've now moved over to using sheep's wool actually.  
**1:07:06-1:07:16:**  So when we shear the sheep in the springtime, we use their wool underneath the blueberries  
**1:07:16-1:07:23:**  and we also get wool from some of our neighbors and we use that underneath the blueberries.  
**1:07:23-1:07:25:**  Wool's like an incredible mulch.  
**1:07:25-1:07:26:**  It's amazing.  
**1:07:26-1:07:37:**  It takes years and years for it to rot down and it creates this really dense mat.  
**1:07:37-1:07:44:**  Once it gets wet and it's sort of partially rots down, it just creates this sort of really  
**1:07:44-1:07:50:**  dense carpet around the base of the blueberries.  
**1:07:50-1:07:55:**  So we're using wool at the moment directly under the blueberries and then in between  
**1:07:55-1:07:59:**  the spaces of the blueberries, because the beds are quite big and there's quite a lot  
**1:07:59-1:08:02:**  of space between the blueberries because they're still young.  
**1:08:02-1:08:06:**  That's where we're planting and focusing our efforts on the strawberries and the various  
**1:08:06-1:08:12:**  other things that we've put in there.  
**1:08:12-1:08:17:**  So yeah, and then as time goes by, we expect the blueberries to get much bigger and start  
**1:08:17-1:08:22:**  shading out underneath themselves and in between themselves.  
**1:08:22-1:08:30:**  So we don't expect too much competition and problem in the next sort of five years' time.  
**1:08:30-1:08:36:**  But whilst they're all still small, we use wool underneath them.  
**1:08:36-1:08:47:**  It's interesting you mention that because woodchips was a strategy, let's say, which  
**1:08:47-1:08:50:**  would limit the weeds more or maybe limit the competition more for a certain period  
**1:08:50-1:08:51:**  of time.  
**1:08:51-1:08:57:**  But it's so much effort and energy that you can compromise by doing the strategy that  
**1:08:57-1:09:00:**  you've been trying out over there and doing with the strawberries, for example, which  
**1:09:00-1:09:07:**  may bring some more competition, which may increase the time at which you'll harvest  
**1:09:07-1:09:13:**  berries, but it's going to be much less energy and labor intensive.  
**1:09:13-1:09:19:**  So there's a compromise there to choose, I can expect, in your case.  
**1:09:19-1:09:20:**  Yeah, indeed.  
**1:09:20-1:09:25:**  I mean, it's similar to the ducks and the fencing and the rotations.  
**1:09:25-1:09:33:**  The cost and benefit just didn't really weigh up for us.  
**1:09:33-1:09:34:**  Woodchip is amazing.  
**1:09:34-1:09:35:**  I love woodchip.  
**1:09:35-1:09:39:**  I've used a lot of it in various parts of the field.  
**1:09:39-1:09:48:**  If I was managing a much smaller space with perennials, I'd choose woodchip every time.  
**1:09:48-1:09:56:**  But on that kind of scale, by hand, by wheelbarrow, it just wasn't worth it.  
**1:09:56-1:09:58:**  So yeah, the wool works well.  
**1:09:58-1:10:06:**  And also, just on the strawberries, I mean, it's difficult to tell how much competition  
**1:10:06-1:10:13:**  there is between the strawberries and the blueberries, but I know that strawberries  
**1:10:13-1:10:18:**  tend to want a lot more fertilizer.  
**1:10:18-1:10:28:**  They're heavier feeders, whereas blueberries, they fruit better when there's less nitrogen.  
**1:10:28-1:10:33:**  So the more nitrogen you give a blueberry, the more leafy green it gets and the less  
**1:10:33-1:10:35:**  of a heavy crop you'll tend to get.  
**1:10:35-1:10:40:**  They tend to put more energy into growing new shoots.  
**1:10:40-1:10:46:**  Certainly in the establishment phase, you could argue that your blueberries will enjoy  
**1:10:46-1:10:50:**  all that nitrogen and they'll put on lots of bushy growth and then you can get your  
**1:10:50-1:10:52:**  berries further down the line.  
**1:10:52-1:11:06:**  But yeah, I think the blueberry patch for us has really been quite an experiment and  
**1:11:06-1:11:13:**  we see it very much as a long-term endeavor and a long-term investment.  
**1:11:13-1:11:19:**  I'm more interested in what it's going to do after a decade of being planted because  
**1:11:19-1:11:28:**  our cash crops are really the duck eggs primarily and then our annual cultivation and our sheep.  
**1:11:28-1:11:31:**  Those quickly turn around cash for us.  
**1:11:31-1:11:38:**  But with the blueberries, I kind of look at them as a sort of a 10-year investment and  
**1:11:38-1:11:48:**  I know that there are blueberry plantations in Poland, I think, and in North America that  
**1:11:48-1:11:51:**  are nearly 100 years old.  
**1:11:51-1:11:57:**  So they've got a lot of life in them and it's more of a long game.  
**1:11:57-1:12:06:**  But if we were going to plant blueberries commercially and really make the best of them,  
**1:12:06-1:12:16:**  actually just putting them in straight rows with plastic mulch and fertilizer and all  
**1:12:16-1:12:22:**  that stuff would do loads better.  
**1:12:22-1:12:29:**  We're actually one of, I think we're one of two, maybe three organic blueberry growers  
**1:12:29-1:12:32:**  in the whole of the UK.  
**1:12:32-1:12:39:**  The rest of the blueberry growers in the UK all grow them in pots in polytunnels with  
**1:12:39-1:12:51:**  loads of specific sort of acid-loving compost and fertilizers specifically suited to blueberries.  
**1:12:51-1:12:55:**  And that's the commercial blueberries grown in the UK.  
**1:12:55-1:13:06:**  I think that growing organic blueberries outdoors in the UK is very niche and very experimental.  
**1:13:06-1:13:13:**  And to really make it work commercially, I think is in the short term is not really possible.  
**1:13:13-1:13:19:**  It's much more of a long game than a quick turnaround.  
**1:13:19-1:13:27:**  So yeah, when it comes to planting an understory underneath the blueberries, I'm not too bothered  
**1:13:27-1:13:30:**  about short term competition.  
**1:13:30-1:13:41:**  And I'm kind of, when you think about sort of Mark Shepherd's approach, his stun approach,  
**1:13:41-1:13:48:**  sheer total out of neglect, I am a little bit, I am warm to the idea of actually going,  
**1:13:48-1:13:53:**  all right, we've planted 700 blueberries in this patch.  
**1:13:53-1:14:00:**  We've given them a little bit of a hard time compared to most commercial plantations.  
**1:14:00-1:14:08:**  Maybe only 400 of them actually make it through the first five years and turn into big bushes.  
**1:14:08-1:14:17:**  But at least then we'll have 400 really strong genetic examples in the patch.  
**1:14:17-1:14:23:**  And we're prepared to wait because basically we've got all the other businesses, the enterprises  
**1:14:23-1:14:30:**  on Park Carrigg helping us get along in the beginning cash wise.  
**1:14:30-1:14:39:**  Josh, sorry to interrupt, but I'm seeing the clock is ticking and I did want to ask a bit  
**1:14:39-1:14:44:**  about the other trees you've planted beyond the blueberry patch and understand a bit more  
**1:14:44-1:14:47:**  about the hedges and the trees you might have planted.  
**1:14:47-1:14:56:**  Yeah, so, as I said earlier, the sheep do a fantastic job for us in terms of managing  
**1:14:56-1:15:00:**  the grass and trimming the hedges back.  
**1:15:00-1:15:08:**  So they keep the hedges in shape and the grass and the edges under control.  
**1:15:08-1:15:16:**  We manage our hedges by hand, which is a hell of a task and one which, to be honest with  
**1:15:16-1:15:18:**  you, we're a little bit behind on.  
**1:15:18-1:15:25:**  But what we've primarily been doing at this point is growth that's growing sideways into  
**1:15:25-1:15:26:**  the field.  
**1:15:26-1:15:33:**  We've been trimming off and feeding to the sheep in the summer.  
**1:15:33-1:15:38:**  So it provides really nice tree fodder for the sheep.  
**1:15:38-1:15:45:**  And there are various sort of benefits for parasites and whatnot for the sheep.  
**1:15:45-1:15:55:**  And then we're trimming, we're sort of training the trees and hedges to be more suited for  
**1:15:55-1:15:56:**  coppicing.  
**1:15:56-1:16:02:**  So in the future, we would like to coppice the hedges and lay the hedges as well.  
**1:16:02-1:16:08:**  So there'll be areas where we'll use them for coppicing for firewood, and then there'll  
**1:16:08-1:16:15:**  be areas where we'll lay them to create sort of a living fence.  
**1:16:15-1:16:23:**  So that's how we're approaching the perimeter hedges.  
**1:16:23-1:16:26:**  It's how it would have been done back in the day.  
**1:16:26-1:16:32:**  But obviously these days, they flail them with tractors and they don't manage them by  
**1:16:32-1:16:36:**  hand anymore.  
**1:16:36-1:16:40:**  In the fields we've gone for, we've also planted tree rows.  
**1:16:40-1:16:52:**  So we've divided our fields up into several blocks, into quite a few blocks actually.  
**1:16:52-1:17:00:**  And we've used trees to split the fields up and to create smaller paddocks for our grazing  
**1:17:00-1:17:01:**  and our rotations.  
**1:17:01-1:17:09:**  So we rotate our sheep from block to block or paddock to paddock every three to four  
**1:17:09-1:17:15:**  days, depending on the season, depending on how quickly the grass is growing, depending  
**1:17:15-1:17:22:**  on what the parasites are doing at that time of year, depending on how warm and wet it  
**1:17:22-1:17:23:**  is.  
**1:17:23-1:17:28:**  We might speed up or slow down our rotations.  
**1:17:28-1:17:36:**  And the tree rows that we've planted, the purpose of them is for coppicing and is for  
**1:17:36-1:17:46:**  firewood for our home, as well as fodder for the sheep.  
**1:17:46-1:17:52:**  What species did you plant in these specific tree rows?  
**1:17:52-1:17:59:**  We've planted willow, biomass willow, Salix verminalis.  
**1:17:59-1:18:06:**  We've planted poplar, biomass poplar, which we've planted a few different hybrids.  
**1:18:06-1:18:13:**  Again these are all species that are suited for short rotation coppicing.  
**1:18:13-1:18:18:**  Another one that we've planted is gray alder.  
**1:18:18-1:18:21:**  If you know that, I don't know if you guys have that one with you.  
**1:18:21-1:18:25:**  Yeah, we have them in wet places.  
**1:18:25-1:18:27:**  Yeah, exactly.  
**1:18:27-1:18:33:**  So they've actually, the alder has done like incredibly well in our fields.  
**1:18:33-1:18:39:**  I'd say they're probably the best out of any, which sort of gives you an idea of how wet  
**1:18:39-1:18:42:**  it is where we are.  
**1:18:42-1:18:51:**  We've also planted hazels, sycamores, and we did try field maple, although field maple  
**1:18:51-1:18:55:**  didn't do too well.  
**1:18:55-1:18:59:**  A lot of people are like, why are you planting sycamores in your fields?  
**1:18:59-1:19:06:**  Because sycamores are generally considered a weed tree in the UK.  
**1:19:06-1:19:10:**  But we love them because the sheep love them.  
**1:19:10-1:19:18:**  They have really sweet leaves for the sheep and they grow like stink and they're really  
**1:19:18-1:19:21:**  hardy.  
**1:19:21-1:19:29:**  And they also drop loads of little saplings, little seedlings into the pasture, which if  
**1:19:29-1:19:34:**  they sprout are just nice little snacks for the sheep.  
**1:19:34-1:19:40:**  So yeah, sycamore is one which we've only recently put in the ground, but we've had  
**1:19:40-1:19:50:**  a few in the hedges that we've, some of them in the hedges we've allowed the sheep like  
**1:19:50-1:19:53:**  really frequent access to.  
**1:19:53-1:19:59:**  And we've just been amazed at how much the sheep can hammer back the sycamores and they  
**1:19:59-1:20:03:**  just keep coming back and they just don't look bothered by it at all.  
**1:20:03-1:20:07:**  They just, the regrowth on them is so quick and the sheep seem to love them so much.  
**1:20:07-1:20:14:**  So yeah, we've planted a row of sycamore.  
**1:20:14-1:20:19:**  We've got hazels, we've got alder, as I said, poplar and willow.  
**1:20:19-1:20:28:**  The alder is amazing in the sense that, so it's not really got much value as fodder for  
**1:20:28-1:20:29:**  the sheep.  
**1:20:29-1:20:34:**  Although they nibble on it, they really don't like it.  
**1:20:34-1:20:46:**  So much so that actually we've got one particular row of alder where we haven't yet put up our  
**1:20:46-1:20:49:**  permanent fencing around us.  
**1:20:49-1:20:56:**  And so I just decided last year, because we were so busy last year, I just decided, ah  
**1:20:56-1:21:02:**  screw this, I'm not going to bother fencing around it every time because it was just too  
**1:21:02-1:21:03:**  much hassle.  
**1:21:03-1:21:08:**  So I just decided to, they were already quite well established and I just decided to let  
**1:21:08-1:21:13:**  the sheep have full access to them so that they could graze underneath them as well as  
**1:21:13-1:21:16:**  around them.  
**1:21:16-1:21:22:**  And I did that for the whole of last year and they're absolutely fine.  
**1:21:22-1:21:29:**  The sheep have rubbed on some of them, cracked one or two, nibbled on a little bit of bark,  
**1:21:29-1:21:34:**  but pretty much the damage is hardly any.  
**1:21:34-1:21:41:**  And for the time and energy involved in fencing around it, I'm very happy.  
**1:21:41-1:21:45:**  I wouldn't bother fencing around it again, to be honest with you.  
**1:21:45-1:21:51:**  Having said that, if they were really young, like newly planted, I think that would be  
**1:21:51-1:21:52:**  a problem.  
**1:21:52-1:21:57:**  It would set them back quite a lot, but these ones were already sort of two years old by  
**1:21:57-1:22:00:**  the time I did this.  
**1:22:00-1:22:08:**  Josh, could you just to step out and to go into, to look at the bigger picture, could  
**1:22:08-1:22:13:**  you give us a bit of an idea of what were the objectives that you were looking for when  
**1:22:13-1:22:14:**  you planted out the hedge?  
**1:22:14-1:22:20:**  I imagine there's various, it would be good to just give us a brief overview as to why  
**1:22:20-1:22:21:**  did you put these fences out?  
**1:22:21-1:22:26:**  Sorry, these hedges, I used the wrong word, the hedges.  
**1:22:26-1:22:35:**  Yeah, so I actually call them tree rows only because they look very different to our hedges.  
**1:22:35-1:22:41:**  You know, they're single, we're planting them in single varieties.  
**1:22:41-1:22:49:**  So we're just planting like a block of willow, a block of poplar, a block of hazel, a block  
**1:22:49-1:22:51:**  of alder, a block of sycamore.  
**1:22:51-1:22:58:**  And we've done them like that to make harvesting for firewood more practical.  
**1:22:58-1:23:03:**  So we were harvesting one type of wood at the same time that's grown roughly the same  
**1:23:03-1:23:04:**  rate.  
**1:23:04-1:23:13:**  But to step back a little bit, we put tree rows in in pasture for a number of reasons.  
**1:23:13-1:23:17:**  And I mean, when most of the local farmers look at what we've done, they think it's crazy  
**1:23:17-1:23:24:**  because we've taken some perfectly neat square blank fields of grass and we've gone and planted  
**1:23:24-1:23:30:**  trees in the middle of them and they think that that's absolute sacrilege and crazy.  
**1:23:30-1:23:37:**  But we've done it because it breaks up the fields into smaller paddocks.  
**1:23:37-1:23:44:**  It helps us with our rotations with the sheep around the field.  
**1:23:44-1:23:48:**  It provides shade and shelter for the sheep.  
**1:23:48-1:23:52:**  It provides fodder for the sheep.  
**1:23:52-1:23:58:**  When we trim the trees, we chop and drop the trees and the sheep love it.  
**1:23:58-1:24:03:**  It provides habitat for insects and birds.  
**1:24:03-1:24:07:**  It helps with heavy rainfall on the fields.  
**1:24:07-1:24:14:**  It helps with water infiltration to slow down runoff on the fields.  
**1:24:14-1:24:21:**  I mean, yeah, I'm not sure if I've covered all the benefits of having trees there, but  
**1:24:21-1:24:22:**  it's brilliant.  
**1:24:22-1:24:28:**  And I mean, visually, it just looks so much more beautiful to have rows of trees in a  
**1:24:28-1:24:33:**  field, I think, than to have a big blank field.  
**1:24:33-1:24:40:**  Yeah, Josh, I'm wondering, you know, kind of taking the interview to an end, but there  
**1:24:40-1:24:43:**  is a big question.  
**1:24:43-1:24:47:**  We've talked a lot about diversity, about stacking productions, and clearly there's  
**1:24:47-1:24:54:**  a lot of benefits to that in terms of productivity and using the space that you have well.  
**1:24:54-1:24:59:**  But what kind of, what are the main challenges that it sets out for you?  
**1:24:59-1:25:04:**  Because I'm sure it's not all simple to have that many different things going on at the  
**1:25:04-1:25:06:**  same time and interacting together.  
**1:25:06-1:25:08:**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**1:25:08-1:25:17:**  Like when we started on Park Harek, we were quite naive in the sense that we thought we  
**1:25:17-1:25:24:**  were going to be able to have essentially four, five, six different businesses and we  
**1:25:24-1:25:26:**  were going to be able to manage them all at the same time.  
**1:25:26-1:25:34:**  And trying to juggle all these different things together is really difficult.  
**1:25:34-1:25:39:**  You know, managing the sheep, especially when you've got the ducks, you've got the collecting  
**1:25:39-1:25:46:**  of eggs, you're managing the ducks during droughts when there's no water and you're  
**1:25:46-1:25:51:**  lambing at the same time and, you know, trying to rotate the sheep at the same time.  
**1:25:51-1:25:56:**  And then you've got to weed the blueberries because in the spring, the weeds just go crazy  
**1:25:56-1:25:57:**  in the spring.  
**1:25:57-1:26:01:**  And although, as I've said, we're not weeding them anymore.  
**1:26:01-1:26:06:**  And then, yeah, there's just so much to try and stay on top of.  
**1:26:06-1:26:10:**  And I think that it is a massive challenge.  
**1:26:10-1:26:19:**  And what we've had to do over the last couple of years is to really become a lot more brutal  
**1:26:19-1:26:24:**  when it comes to making decisions about what gets done on the farm.  
**1:26:24-1:26:31:**  We have to make sure that we can earn a living and that we are doing we are looking after  
**1:26:31-1:26:35:**  the livestock and keeping them healthy.  
**1:26:35-1:26:39:**  We can't get stressed out about weeds and the blueberry patch, for example.  
**1:26:39-1:26:46:**  Like there's no point in fighting that with the sheep, for example, we don't pamper them  
**1:26:46-1:26:52:**  like we just we can't afford to in both time and money.  
**1:26:52-1:26:54:**  We manage them.  
**1:26:54-1:26:55:**  We rotate them.  
**1:26:55-1:27:00:**  We give them habitat and good fodder and forage.  
**1:27:00-1:27:06:**  But like we can't pamper them in terms of regular warming and regular vaccination.  
**1:27:06-1:27:17:**  So we we prefer to select sheep that are less labor intensive, that are naturally more healthy  
**1:27:17-1:27:20:**  and ones that don't thrive.  
**1:27:20-1:27:21:**  We let them go.  
**1:27:21-1:27:28:**  We you know, we don't we don't put too much effort into trying to keep everything alive.  
**1:27:28-1:27:35:**  Because if we just let nature take its course most of the time, we save ourselves a lot  
**1:27:35-1:27:38:**  of time.  
**1:27:38-1:27:44:**  Having said that, Park Harrig still needs a lot of management to to keep the cogs turning  
**1:27:44-1:27:48:**  and to keep the business running and to keep things running smoothly.  
**1:27:48-1:27:57:**  So I guess just finding a balance between, you know, taking a sort of a stun approach,  
**1:27:57-1:28:03:**  as Mark Shepherd would call it, and a really intensively managed approach, finding some  
**1:28:03-1:28:10:**  sort of balance between those two ends of the spectrum is really important when it comes  
**1:28:10-1:28:17:**  to your time and and, you know, money expenditure on the farm.  
**1:28:17-1:28:25:**  Josh, did you do you wish you had started with less diversity on the farm?  
**1:28:25-1:28:29:**  Or are you comfortable with with how much you've done?  
**1:28:29-1:28:34:**  And are you planning even to put more to integrate even more into the operation?  
**1:28:34-1:28:44:**  I absolutely don't regret planting all the trees and the shrubs that we have.  
**1:28:44-1:28:51:**  And we have plans to put in a lot more because as far as we see it, you know, especially  
**1:28:51-1:28:58:**  for the duck enterprise, the more trees and shrubs that we have on Park Harrig, as well  
**1:28:58-1:29:04:**  as pasture, the better for the ducks and also for the sheeps, to be honest, the for the  
**1:29:04-1:29:05:**  sheep.  
**1:29:05-1:29:10:**  They really enjoy having a tree or a shrub to to sit underneath.  
**1:29:10-1:29:18:**  So we're going to be planting a lot more over the years.  
**1:29:18-1:29:24:**  We we have slowed down planting new things in the last few years, just because as the  
**1:29:24-1:29:28:**  business has scaled up, we've gotten more and more busy trying to keep the business  
**1:29:28-1:29:29:**  running.  
**1:29:29-1:29:31:**  So we have slowed down.  
**1:29:31-1:29:34:**  But I don't regret any of the early.  
**1:29:34-1:29:39:**  Any of the early plantings that we did.  
**1:29:39-1:29:45:**  I'm very happy with the selection of things that we've got going on in the fields.  
**1:29:45-1:29:51:**  If I was going to go back, I might change a few things purely logistical things like  
**1:29:51-1:29:57:**  slight, you know, I'd make changes to the layout and exactly how we've laid things up.  
**1:29:57-1:30:02:**  But it's very difficult to see those things up front until such time as you've actually  
**1:30:02-1:30:06:**  worked with with them over over a few years.  
**1:30:06-1:30:11:**  And especially when you've got no experience farming at all.  
**1:30:11-1:30:15:**  You know, knowing knowing exactly where you want to put your track and your water pipes  
**1:30:15-1:30:18:**  and your tree rows and all the stuff.  
**1:30:18-1:30:21:**  It's kind of impossible if you've got no experience.  
**1:30:21-1:30:26:**  To be honest, it's very incredible what you've achieved in four years with so little farming  
**1:30:26-1:30:27:**  experience.  
**1:30:27-1:30:36:**  And I would really advise all of the listeners that have made it this far to go on the Insta  
**1:30:36-1:30:44:**  gram of Park Courag and check out lots of videos about ducks hanging out in lines running  
**1:30:44-1:30:45:**  around.  
**1:30:45-1:30:46:**  It's amazing.  
**1:30:46-1:30:50:**  And lots of the systems that have been set up there.  
**1:30:50-1:30:54:**  So it's very I spent quite a lot of time on your Instagram looking at the pictures.  
**1:30:54-1:31:00:**  You've done a really good job at showing the work you've done there and describing the  
**1:31:00-1:31:02:**  systems there.  
**1:31:02-1:31:05:**  The pictures are really good and the descriptions are really good.  
**1:31:05-1:31:14:**  But Josh, it's been an hour and a half now and we will need to take this interview to  
**1:31:14-1:31:18:**  an end for all of our health and well-being.  
**1:31:18-1:31:20:**  We need to go to sleep.  
**1:31:20-1:31:28:**  But thank you so much for your time and for describing your farm so well and explaining  
**1:31:28-1:31:30:**  to us all of your decision process.  
**1:31:30-1:31:31:**  It was really interesting.  
**1:31:31-1:31:33:**  It was really, really interesting.  
**1:31:33-1:31:35:**  Hey, thanks so much, guys.  
**1:31:35-1:31:37:**  I really appreciate you having me on.  
**1:31:37-1:31:41:**  It's been great to chat with you.  
**1:31:41-1:31:45:**  Thanks for making it this far and we really hope you enjoyed the episode as much as we  
**1:31:45-1:31:46:**  did.

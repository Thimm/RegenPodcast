### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 12:15:44)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:30:**  a promising technique called agroforestry.  
**0:00:30-0:00:35:**  In order to find out how it can help us with these challenges, we'll be interviewing farmers,  
**0:00:35-0:00:40:**  scientists, and other experts to share with you their experiences, practical advice, and  
**0:00:40-0:00:44:**  scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:47:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:49:**  We're your hosts, Dimitri and Etienne.  
**0:00:49-0:00:53:**  And today we interviewed Stefan Briggs from Whitehall Farm, where he has set up one of  
**0:00:53-0:00:57:**  the biggest agroforestry systems in the UK.  
**0:00:57-0:01:01:**  Maybe now you're starting to get used to the way we do things on the podcast.  
**0:01:01-0:01:04:**  So with Stefan, we're going to unpack the functioning of his system, and then we're  
**0:01:04-0:01:11:**  going to look at some of the strategic implications and some of the ways that agroforestry has  
**0:01:11-0:01:14:**  affected the strategy of his farm.  
**0:01:14-0:01:19:**  And we're going to find out that Stefan is very happy with the way that he's integrated  
**0:01:19-0:01:22:**  apples in his grain operation.  
**0:01:22-0:01:26:**  And I invite you to keep going so you find out exactly how that works.  
**0:01:26-0:01:30:**  Hi Stefan and welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:30-0:01:33:**  Good afternoon and it's great to be here.  
**0:01:33-0:01:39:**  Well, I was thinking to get us started, maybe you could give us a bit about your story and  
**0:01:39-0:01:42:**  how you got started on Whitehall Farm.  
**0:01:42-0:01:44:**  Okay, yeah.  
**0:01:44-0:01:54:**  So it's a, as is always the case, it's a fairly complex backstory.  
**0:01:54-0:02:00:**  After leaving school many, many years ago, I actually trained as an engineer.  
**0:02:00-0:02:09:**  And after a number of years working in engineering, I decided that actually my true passion led  
**0:02:09-0:02:11:**  in the outdoor world.  
**0:02:11-0:02:20:**  So I did some traveling around the globe and then I retrained in agricultural engineering.  
**0:02:20-0:02:27:**  And that took me to work, do some work in Africa for a few years.  
**0:02:27-0:02:37:**  And then I did some more training as a degree in agriculture and then a master's in soil  
**0:02:37-0:02:38:**  science.  
**0:02:38-0:02:47:**  I then went back to work in Africa on soil projects for a few years and then in India  
**0:02:47-0:02:51:**  for the World Bank and FAO.  
**0:02:51-0:02:56:**  And then I came back to the UK with my wife.  
**0:02:56-0:03:04:**  And as a qualified soil scientist nearly 30 years ago, there were very few farmers interested  
**0:03:04-0:03:10:**  in soil other than organic or biological farmers.  
**0:03:10-0:03:23:**  So I started working with organic farmers, doing advisory work on agronomy and then started  
**0:03:23-0:03:28:**  my own consultancy business in 2000, which is still going today, working with farmers  
**0:03:28-0:03:33:**  all over the UK and internationally.  
**0:03:33-0:03:37:**  There's a consultancy group called Abacus Agriculture.  
**0:03:37-0:03:43:**  But deep down my passion of both myself and my wife, my wife's from a farming family in  
**0:03:43-0:03:48:**  the north of the country, and our passion was always to go farming ourselves.  
**0:03:48-0:03:59:**  So in 2005, we were in a position to buy a very small piece of land of about 10, 12 hectares.  
**0:03:59-0:04:02:**  And we started farming that organically.  
**0:04:02-0:04:08:**  At the same time, we started applying for farms to rent because our pockets weren't  
**0:04:08-0:04:13:**  deep enough to purchase a farm outright or a large farm.  
**0:04:13-0:04:19:**  So we applied for a number of farms and got turned down and eventually we applied for  
**0:04:19-0:04:28:**  Whitehall Farm and were given initially a 15 year term to rent the farm to start our  
**0:04:28-0:04:29:**  farming operation.  
**0:04:29-0:04:38:**  So that's, I guess, the quick answer to how we ended up here.  
**0:04:38-0:04:45:**  And I'm kind of wondering, how did you then get involved with agroforestry?  
**0:04:45-0:04:56:**  So as I alluded to already, I guess my background is very much to do with soils, having done  
**0:04:56-0:04:58:**  a master's in soil science.  
**0:04:58-0:05:09:**  So when we moved on to the farm back in 2007, and I should say the farm, so listeners know  
**0:05:09-0:05:16:**  where the farm is, we're in Cambridgeshire, which is in the east of England.  
**0:05:16-0:05:26:**  We're about one hour north of London, about 30 minutes northwest of Cambridge.  
**0:05:26-0:05:30:**  And we're just on the edge of a large city called Peterborough.  
**0:05:30-0:05:33:**  So the area is very low lying.  
**0:05:33-0:05:41:**  It was drained by the Dutch in the mid 1600s.  
**0:05:41-0:05:47:**  It's known as Fenland here in the UK, but the Dutch would call it a polder or reclaimed  
**0:05:47-0:05:48:**  land.  
**0:05:48-0:05:53:**  So it's a very low, we're only just above sea level, in some places just below sea level.  
**0:05:53-0:06:00:**  So it's an artificial drained landscape, very flat, the whole farm, which is just over 100  
**0:06:00-0:06:05:**  hectares, there's only about one metre difference from one end to the other.  
**0:06:05-0:06:13:**  The soils are very high quality, we have heavy clay soils, and we have some peat soils with  
**0:06:13-0:06:17:**  up to 20% organic matter, organic carbon in them.  
**0:06:17-0:06:21:**  So they're really very fertile.  
**0:06:21-0:06:27:**  But they're very prone to erosion by wind.  
**0:06:27-0:06:39:**  And when we moved on to the farm in 2007, I was shocked to see the amount of erosion  
**0:06:39-0:06:48:**  that was occurring from wind, and the soils get dry without any cover.  
**0:06:48-0:06:55:**  And as a scientist, I found that completely unacceptable that our most important and valuable  
**0:06:55-0:06:58:**  resource was being eroded.  
**0:06:58-0:07:09:**  So I started thinking about ways that we might be able to mitigate the damage done by wind.  
**0:07:09-0:07:15:**  And I thought back to some of my time actually working and living in Uganda with my wife  
**0:07:15-0:07:21:**  on soil projects where I've been involved in some tropical agroforestry.  
**0:07:21-0:07:28:**  And I started to think that maybe that might work here in the UK in a temperate environment.  
**0:07:28-0:07:39:**  So back in 2009, we actually decided after about two years of planning and talking to  
**0:07:39-0:07:48:**  our landowners about putting trees on the farm, we put in place an agroforestry system  
**0:07:48-0:07:50:**  covering 52 hectares.  
**0:07:50-0:08:00:**  We planted for 4,500 trees in a silver arable alley cropping system.  
**0:08:00-0:08:08:**  And the primary function was about trying to stop soil degradation and wind erosion.  
**0:08:08-0:08:15:**  But the other things that come with agroforestry, which we'll discuss, are all benefits.  
**0:08:15-0:08:16:**  Yeah.  
**0:08:16-0:08:22:**  And before we go more in detail into the agroforestry stuff, I was wondering, just to finish this  
**0:08:22-0:08:27:**  kind of picture of your farm, what are your main productions and how do you commercialize?  
**0:08:27-0:08:29:**  Yeah.  
**0:08:29-0:08:38:**  So historically, when we moved on to the farm, the farm, I guess, for probably 30 years would  
**0:08:38-0:08:51:**  have grown wheat, barley, oilseed, maple, some sugar beet and maybe potatoes.  
**0:08:51-0:08:55:**  So it was always a mixture of root crops and cereals.  
**0:08:55-0:09:04:**  When we moved on to the farm in 2007, we wanted to convert the farm to organic production,  
**0:09:04-0:09:08:**  which we started straight away.  
**0:09:08-0:09:19:**  And over the last decade, we've grown wheat, oats, barley.  
**0:09:19-0:09:37:**  We've grown root vegetables like leeks, pouro in French, and also batrouge, red beet.  
**0:09:37-0:09:42:**  And some brassica vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli.  
**0:09:42-0:09:52:**  At one stage, we were growing up to 100 acres or 40 hectares of broccoli and cauliflower.  
**0:09:52-0:10:03:**  We had quite a diverse organic rotation, growing cover crops and growing cash crops of cereals.  
**0:10:03-0:10:09:**  For a number of years, we specialized growing seed crops and vegetables.  
**0:10:09-0:10:19:**  And at one stage, we actually, for seven years, we contract farmed another 150 hectares of  
**0:10:19-0:10:21:**  land elsewhere.  
**0:10:21-0:10:28:**  But that came to an end three years ago.  
**0:10:28-0:10:35:**  And the reasons for that were partly the landowner wanted to change the policy.  
**0:10:35-0:10:42:**  But also, we decided that we wanted to better connect with consumers.  
**0:10:42-0:10:49:**  So we turned one of our buildings into a farm shop and cafe.  
**0:10:49-0:10:55:**  So at the moment, you sell on the wholesale market and then you also have a bit of this  
**0:10:55-0:10:57:**  direct selling through the cafe.  
**0:10:57-0:10:59:**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**0:10:59-0:11:08:**  So two things happened, which we'll talk about later, but in 2011, I traveled the globe under  
**0:11:08-0:11:13:**  a Nuffield farming scholarship looking at agroforestry.  
**0:11:13-0:11:20:**  And what impressed me as part of that journey was farmers and farming businesses which have  
**0:11:20-0:11:22:**  connected better with consumers.  
**0:11:22-0:11:29:**  And my wife and I have always had a passion to better educate and connect consumers and  
**0:11:29-0:11:30:**  the public with farming.  
**0:11:30-0:11:36:**  So we converted, we did the building work and converted one of the buildings into a  
**0:11:36-0:11:38:**  farm shop and a cafe.  
**0:11:38-0:11:48:**  And some of our produce is sold directly to the public through the shop and some is contracted  
**0:11:48-0:11:51:**  on the wholesale market.  
**0:11:51-0:11:57:**  I'm curious to know more about the agroforestry trees that you planted because you mentioned  
**0:11:57-0:12:01:**  you planted 52 hectares of agroforestry.  
**0:12:01-0:12:04:**  But what trees were they?  
**0:12:04-0:12:12:**  So there were a number of parameters which I guess informed our choice.  
**0:12:12-0:12:18:**  The main one being actually that we don't own the farm, that we rent the farm for 15  
**0:12:18-0:12:20:**  year agreement.  
**0:12:20-0:12:26:**  So if we were going to plant trees, we needed an economic market return within the lifetime  
**0:12:26-0:12:28:**  of our rental agreement.  
**0:12:28-0:12:34:**  So that meant that we couldn't say plant an oak tree or a walnut tree and wait 30 years  
**0:12:34-0:12:37:**  for it to mature.  
**0:12:37-0:12:39:**  We needed something that would grow quicker.  
**0:12:39-0:12:49:**  So we actually decided to grow fruit trees and we decided that we would grow apples mainly  
**0:12:49-0:12:55:**  because actually apples had been grown in this region historically but actually over  
**0:12:55-0:13:02:**  the last 25-30 years the amount of apples had declined.  
**0:13:02-0:13:08:**  A consequence of the sort of common agricultural policy I guess was that a lot of apple production  
**0:13:08-0:13:14:**  in the UK decreased massively because it was easier to bring the fruit in from elsewhere  
**0:13:14-0:13:15:**  in Europe.  
**0:13:15-0:13:23:**  But actually organically at least there's a bit of resurgence in demand for UK apples  
**0:13:23-0:13:33:**  and we planted 13 varieties, half of which were heritage varieties, very old varieties  
**0:13:33-0:13:40:**  to try and produce English organic heritage apples.  
**0:13:40-0:13:50:**  And yeah so 4500 trees, 13 varieties of apples and we either sell them as eating or cooking  
**0:13:50-0:13:57:**  fruit or we turn it into juice and sell it as apple juice.  
**0:13:57-0:14:05:**  Ok nice and the apples that you're selling for as fresh apples are they going on the  
**0:14:05-0:14:10:**  wholesale market as well or are they being sold mostly at your farm shop?  
**0:14:10-0:14:16:**  No we sell everything ourselves so we don't go into wholesale markets at all.  
**0:14:16-0:14:21:**  We want it to be price makers rather than price takers.  
**0:14:21-0:14:24:**  And what spacings are your tree lines on?  
**0:14:24-0:14:36:**  So we set the system up based on a 24 meter alley and then the tree lines as an alley  
**0:14:36-0:14:46:**  cropping system face nearly north-south which is important to minimize shade with the sun  
**0:14:46-0:14:49:**  coming up in the east and down in the west.  
**0:14:49-0:14:55:**  We're a little further north here in the UK than you guys in France so at this time of  
**0:14:55-0:15:01:**  year the sun's pretty low so we wanted to minimize shading so that the trees are north-south  
**0:15:01-0:15:10:**  a 24 meter alley with a 3 meter strip of pollen and nectar and flowers underneath the trees  
**0:15:10-0:15:12:**  to attract pollinators.  
**0:15:12-0:15:20:**  So the actual tree rows are 27 meters apart 1.5 meters either side leaving a 24 meter  
**0:15:20-0:15:22:**  alley.  
**0:15:22-0:15:28:**  Ok and the trees on the tree line what's the spacing between each apple tree?  
**0:15:28-0:15:36:**  So 3 meters between each tree and a 3 meter strip a 24 meter alley and our field sizes  
**0:15:36-0:15:47:**  are the biggest field is 13.5 hectares the smallest field will be 4.2 hectares 7 fields  
**0:15:47-0:15:53:**  all together in a 52 hectare block.  
**0:15:53-0:16:03:**  Ok and I'm curious to know about the fertilization and irrigation plan that you have for those  
**0:16:03-0:16:05:**  agroforestry areas.  
**0:16:05-0:16:13:**  Yeah so well the easy one on irrigation is that we don't.  
**0:16:13-0:16:20:**  The only irrigation is what falls out of the sky.  
**0:16:20-0:16:27:**  In some ways we have a very high water table you know we're only at sea level and the water  
**0:16:27-0:16:37:**  table is only 1.5 meters 1 to 1.5 meters below ground so actually stressing the trees and  
**0:16:37-0:16:41:**  getting them to put down deep roots means they can drink from the bottom.  
**0:16:41-0:16:46:**  Anyhow today we've had a lot of rain already this winter we've got some fields where we  
**0:16:46-0:16:53:**  have standing water we have ponds in the fields because we've had so much rain which is a  
**0:16:53-0:16:58:**  bit of an issue although the agroforestry fields are much drier than the fields without  
**0:16:58-0:16:59:**  the trees.  
**0:16:59-0:17:03:**  I guess the trees are helping with that drainage.  
**0:17:03-0:17:11:**  Do you fertilize the apple trees in any specific way or do they just have to do with what there  
**0:17:11-0:17:12:**  is there?  
**0:17:12-0:17:23:**  Yeah so we've looked at the fertilization program for the trees and actually we are  
**0:17:23-0:17:32:**  fortunate to have good fertile soils with good levels of potassium phosphate and nitrogen  
**0:17:32-0:17:39:**  so the trees largely look after themselves although we have to keep an eye on the calcium  
**0:17:39-0:17:49:**  and occasionally have to add some calcium in the form of either sugar beet byproducts  
**0:17:49-0:17:54:**  or a lime product.  
**0:17:54-0:18:01:**  We've only done that once in 10 years so generally they look after themselves pretty well without  
**0:18:01-0:18:03:**  much intervention.  
**0:18:03-0:18:07:**  I have to say when I talk to you I can't help but feel a bit jealous because it seems like  
**0:18:07-0:18:14:**  really really good farming lands between the abundant fertility and the high water table.  
**0:18:14-0:18:21:**  Yeah it's good the challenge what was interesting is when we moved on to the farm the soils  
**0:18:21-0:18:28:**  yeah they're good fertile soils but biologically they were dead and they were completely inert  
**0:18:28-0:18:34:**  and it was very difficult to get crops to establish because the biological status was  
**0:18:34-0:18:44:**  really poor you know it had very high use of fertilizers and pesticides for soil sterilants  
**0:18:44-0:18:52:**  for production and it took us seven eight years to actually get the soils to function  
**0:18:52-0:19:00:**  better biologically and now they work really well and our yields have been going up.  
**0:19:00-0:19:05:**  And yeah the other thing that made me curious is when you were describing that three meter  
**0:19:05-0:19:12:**  strip you know of for pollinators below the trees did you sow that when you planted the  
**0:19:12-0:19:18:**  trees and then you kind of just let it be and mow it from time to time or what does  
**0:19:18-0:19:20:**  that look like?  
**0:19:20-0:19:27:**  Yeah so before we planted the trees in the immediately following the harvest in 2009  
**0:19:27-0:19:39:**  we sowed the three meter strips under the trees with a mixture of legumes, clovers,  
**0:19:39-0:19:49:**  wildflowers about 30 well we had about 20 different species that we planted on some  
**0:19:49-0:19:55:**  fields we did one mixture on some fields we did another mixture and then we planted the  
**0:19:55-0:20:01:**  trees into those mixtures and over the last 10 years those mixtures have changed massively  
**0:20:01-0:20:08:**  so and initially some species the pioneer species came up and then later on the legumes  
**0:20:08-0:20:18:**  the clovers and the sanfoins and the daisies dominated and even though we didn't plant  
**0:20:18-0:20:26:**  any grass the grass has come into the strips as well over the last decade.  
**0:20:26-0:20:32:**  But they provide a really important refuge for pollinating insects which we need for  
**0:20:32-0:20:41:**  the trees but also beneficial insects which we need for managing the crops around the  
**0:20:41-0:20:48:**  rest of the farm biologically so there's a lot of abundance of biodiversity in those  
**0:20:48-0:20:57:**  strips in fact we've been working with some universities and we've had two PhD students  
**0:20:57-0:21:06:**  and about six MSc students studying the biodiversity and the species richness and the distribution  
**0:21:06-0:21:14:**  of insects and it's significantly better in the agroforestry and they publish that research  
**0:21:14-0:21:18:**  in scientific journals.  
**0:21:18-0:21:24:**  Well that's fascinating and I'm thinking and it doesn't cause any problems for you in terms  
**0:21:24-0:21:32:**  of management then that you know for example seeds of weeds or anything I'm saying that  
**0:21:32-0:21:36:**  because I think some farmers could be scared of leaving such a strip in the middle of their  
**0:21:36-0:21:37:**  cultures.  
**0:21:37-0:21:45:**  Yeah well I guess it's we make sure we don't leave it we actually manage it so yeah there  
**0:21:45-0:21:56:**  probably are a little you know a few more weeds along the edge but not massively detrimental.  
**0:21:56-0:22:04:**  The strips themselves we manage by cutting 50% of the strip with a sort of ride on lawnmower  
**0:22:04-0:22:13:**  in usually sort of July each year and then the other half between the trees in September  
**0:22:13-0:22:19:**  that allows us to actually harvest the harvest the crops in the alleys with a nice clean  
**0:22:19-0:22:20:**  edge.  
**0:22:20-0:22:25:**  So one of the design features is that all the apples that we have the apple trees they're  
**0:22:25-0:22:32:**  all later varieties so some of the varieties we picked we couldn't have fruit that was  
**0:22:32-0:22:40:**  ready to pick in August because we still had to harvest the cereals so the cereals wouldn't  
**0:22:40-0:22:46:**  typically be harvested here till mid-August in a very hot year it might be early August  
**0:22:46-0:22:51:**  the fruit the fruit is not ready to harvest till sort of late September early October  
**0:22:51-0:22:59:**  so we can harvest the cereals plant cover crops and then go and go and harvest the fruit  
**0:22:59-0:23:02:**  afterwards so it's a double harvest here.  
**0:23:02-0:23:07:**  That's really interesting how that fits kind of and you can spread that through the year  
**0:23:07-0:23:11:**  and that's really interesting.  
**0:23:11-0:23:17:**  Now that I think we have a bit of a you know clear idea of what your farm and your agroforestry  
**0:23:17-0:23:23:**  systems look like I was thinking maybe you could share with us some of the observations  
**0:23:23-0:23:29:**  you might have had over the few years and I'm thinking you know we're always interested  
**0:23:29-0:23:34:**  in the interactions between trees and the cultures and obviously you planted them for  
**0:23:34-0:23:41:**  wind protection so maybe the first question is were you able to see and observe actual  
**0:23:41-0:23:45:**  improvements in the wind erosion?  
**0:23:45-0:23:53:**  Yeah so not only you know what we've observed as farmers but working with universities in  
**0:23:53-0:23:59:**  terms of doing research we're seeing less less soil erosion in the agroforestry because  
**0:23:59-0:24:06:**  the trees are slowing the wind and the wind is predominantly from the southwest for a  
**0:24:06-0:24:14:**  maritime climate when the wind blows strongly the trees are protecting the soils and we're  
**0:24:14-0:24:19:**  seeing less less erosion so that it's doing its job there.  
**0:24:19-0:24:25:**  Secondly you know one of the things that attracted me to the agroforestry was having a mix of  
**0:24:25-0:24:32:**  perennial plants and also annual plants in a climate change world that we now live in  
**0:24:32-0:24:40:**  planting a seed every season and asking it to start from scratch and not knowing whether  
**0:24:40-0:24:50:**  it's going to be a hot year, dry, cold year, dry year, wet year is like gambling, professional  
**0:24:50-0:24:57:**  gambling farming and having a mix of annuals and perennials I think helps mitigate some  
**0:24:57-0:25:02:**  of the risks around climate change.  
**0:25:02-0:25:11:**  And have you seen any kind of effects of potential competition between the roots of the apple  
**0:25:11-0:25:16:**  trees and your main crop?  
**0:25:16-0:25:23:**  So in terms of those sort of observations a couple of things, first thing you know one  
**0:25:23-0:25:28:**  of the reasons we planted fruit trees is because we didn't want the trees to get too big so  
**0:25:28-0:25:33:**  we prune the trees every winter that allows us to pick the fruit by hand so the trees  
**0:25:33-0:25:40:**  are only maybe three and a half four meters tall but at four meters tall they're giving  
**0:25:40-0:25:51:**  40 meters of wind wind interruption and the alleys are only 24 meters wide so there's  
**0:25:51-0:25:56:**  a nice sort of wind interruption going on.  
**0:25:56-0:26:02:**  Every year in the autumn when the trees lose their leaves and the energy goes back into  
**0:26:02-0:26:09:**  the roots we actually root prune so we use a subsoiler a deep surface calculator to go  
**0:26:09-0:26:15:**  along the edge of the tree strip and actually just as we prune the canopy we prune the roots  
**0:26:15-0:26:20:**  to help force the roots down deeper in the soil so they're not competing in the same  
**0:26:20-0:26:31:**  zone as the annual crops so there's a differentiation between where those roots are occupying.  
**0:26:31-0:26:37:**  What we've noticed in the last few years now the trees are large and established is that  
**0:26:37-0:26:43:**  when it's really wet last winter this winter we've had excessive rainfall where we're set  
**0:26:43-0:26:51:**  to see more of that with climate change that the fields are a little drier and the drainage  
**0:26:51-0:27:01:**  is improved by the presence of those tree roots but then conversely in the summer when  
**0:27:01-0:27:13:**  it when when if it gets really hot we had a really dry year last year in 2020 and there's  
**0:27:13-0:27:21:**  perhaps a little bit of wind reduction lower evapotranspiration and perhaps a bit of shading  
**0:27:21-0:27:27:**  from the trees and what we found is that the crop immediately adjacent to the sort of three  
**0:27:27-0:27:34:**  to six meters immediately adjacent to the tree strips was was twice the crop that it  
**0:27:34-0:27:42:**  was in the middle of the alley so last year we had we had probably 15 to 18 percent lower  
**0:27:42-0:27:48:**  yields because of drought but the trees the crop immediately adjacent to the trees was  
**0:27:48-0:27:53:**  significantly bigger significantly higher yield and then those trees are adding to that  
**0:27:53-0:27:57:**  sort of resilience.  
**0:27:57-0:28:02:**  That's amazing because you know obviously if we're doing this podcast as we think agroforestry  
**0:28:02-0:28:09:**  is interesting but you know it's so great to hear from observation how powerful integrating  
**0:28:09-0:28:12:**  trees can be that's really great.  
**0:28:12-0:28:17:**  The other bit of research we've been helping with is we've been looking at mycorrhizae  
**0:28:17-0:28:24:**  so working with some universities where we've got the perennial trees in place in the agroforestry  
**0:28:24-0:28:29:**  strips the mycorrhizae levels are much higher and they spread out into the alleys so there's  
**0:28:29-0:28:37:**  also probably an effect of better access to water and nutrients from those mycorrhizal  
**0:28:37-0:28:44:**  associations so having those in the system is just it's like having a turbocharger on  
**0:28:44-0:28:51:**  a car in terms of getting access to water and nutrients at the right times.  
**0:28:51-0:28:55:**  And so you've actually been kind of followed by a lot of scientists and it seems like a  
**0:28:55-0:28:57:**  lot of data is coming out of your farm.  
**0:28:57-0:29:05:**  Yeah well we're not so we're not we didn't set up the system to be research it's a commercial  
**0:29:05-0:29:10:**  business that has to make money we have to pay the rent you know we're a commercial farming  
**0:29:10-0:29:20:**  business but I wanted to I have an inquisitive mind some would say that's a blessing sometimes  
**0:29:20-0:29:29:**  it's a curse I wanted to try and demonstrate or show that actually what we were doing actually  
**0:29:29-0:29:38:**  worked there's an old Chinese proverb which says the person or the people that say it's  
**0:29:38-0:29:43:**  impossible shouldn't shouldn't get in the way of the people that are already doing the  
**0:29:43-0:29:44:**  impossible.  
**0:29:44-0:29:51:**  We wanted to you know we had lots of neighbouring farmers saying you know what are you doing  
**0:29:51-0:29:54:**  why are you planting trees you must be mad.  
**0:29:54-0:29:55:**  Wow.  
**0:29:55-0:30:02:**  We wanted to we wanted to show them actually it is possible and it does work and having  
**0:30:02-0:30:07:**  roughly 50 percent of the farm with agroforestry and 50 percent of the farm without agroforestry  
**0:30:07-0:30:13:**  gives us a great opportunity to show the benefits.  
**0:30:13-0:30:19:**  So I was just wondering since you do have these two different types of plots with and  
**0:30:19-0:30:24:**  a bit of a possibility to compare were you able to observe any difference in terms of  
**0:30:24-0:30:29:**  pest pressure or disease pressure on the crops between the agroforestry plots and the ones  
**0:30:29-0:30:35:**  without trees?  
**0:30:35-0:30:42:**  It's interesting in that you know as an organic farmer I don't get very exercised or don't  
**0:30:42-0:30:48:**  get very concerned by pests or diseases because we're trying to actively trying to do systems  
**0:30:48-0:30:52:**  without without pest or you know trying to minimize the risk of pest diseases in the  
**0:30:52-0:30:55:**  first place.  
**0:30:55-0:30:58:**  So we don't have major pest or disease issues.  
**0:30:58-0:31:04:**  Having said that the research that we've done with universities shows that there are much  
**0:31:04-0:31:15:**  higher numbers and special distributions of beneficial insects and fewer harmful insects  
**0:31:15-0:31:16:**  in the agroforestry.  
**0:31:16-0:31:19:**  So I think we're well placed.  
**0:31:19-0:31:24:**  If we were to have a pest issue we're well placed to have lots of beneficials to help  
**0:31:24-0:31:26:**  be part of the team to fight the problem.  
**0:31:26-0:31:32:**  But we don't see, I don't get exercised by pest and disease problems.  
**0:31:32-0:31:34:**  They're not a problem for us.  
**0:31:34-0:31:37:**  No, that's great.  
**0:31:37-0:31:43:**  And you know I was thinking you mentioned soil mycorrhizae and the fact that you were  
**0:31:43-0:31:45:**  able to see an increase.  
**0:31:45-0:31:50:**  Did you also do other tests to measure kind of soil biology and did you see any differences  
**0:31:50-0:31:54:**  as well by introducing trees?  
**0:31:54-0:32:08:**  So we haven't seen any massively significant differences in soil nutrient status.  
**0:32:08-0:32:14:**  But what we have been doing is, I trained as a soil biologist so I've been actually  
**0:32:14-0:32:18:**  doing some work on soil biology, hence the mycorrhizae.  
**0:32:18-0:32:27:**  And what we found is in the plots or the fields with the trees we've seen a much bigger shift  
**0:32:27-0:32:36:**  from arable soils which are predominantly bacterial dominated to a shift towards more  
**0:32:36-0:32:40:**  fungal domination in the species.  
**0:32:40-0:32:46:**  So ultimately we need a mixture of both fungi and bacteria in the soils to the engine to  
**0:32:46-0:32:49:**  drive the soil microbiome.  
**0:32:49-0:32:55:**  But actually most cropping arable soils are too dominated by bacteria and the trees have  
**0:32:55-0:33:01:**  really helped us move it towards a more fungal balance which is giving us more resilience  
**0:33:01-0:33:11:**  in terms of drought, it's giving us more access to nutrients and productivity has been increasing.  
**0:33:11-0:33:17:**  So to give you some idea, our cropping has changed a little bit.  
**0:33:17-0:33:24:**  Over the last few years we've been growing a lot more oats.  
**0:33:24-0:33:30:**  We actually grow, one of the few farms in the UK growing for a certified organic and  
**0:33:30-0:33:34:**  certified gluten free market.  
**0:33:34-0:33:40:**  I'm actually celiac myself, so I'm from celiac disease so I have an interest in gluten free  
**0:33:40-0:33:50:**  products and we're growing gluten free oats and we're yielding typically 6 to 6.4 tonnes  
**0:33:50-0:33:59:**  per hectare of organic oats which is pretty respectable.  
**0:33:59-0:34:05:**  And kind of my last question to wrap up this bit of agronomic section.  
**0:34:05-0:34:12:**  I know you already have very high levels of organic matter so has introducing trees increased  
**0:34:12-0:34:13:**  that organic matter?  
**0:34:13-0:34:19:**  Is that something that you necessarily want?  
**0:34:19-0:34:27:**  So yeah, if you're starting at very low levels of organic matter you can increase them by  
**0:34:27-0:34:30:**  cover crops and agronomic processes.  
**0:34:30-0:34:34:**  When you've already got very high levels our objective was not necessarily to increase  
**0:34:34-0:34:42:**  organic matter, it was to maintain the organic matter and stop the fields blowing away.  
**0:34:42-0:34:50:**  But where parts of the farm are very heavy clay in the distance about 4 kilometres away  
**0:34:50-0:34:56:**  I can see some very tall towers and chimneys and that's the brick factories.  
**0:34:56-0:35:02:**  This location was where they mined all the clay to make bricks.  
**0:35:02-0:35:07:**  So we're right on the edge of that so part of the fields is very heavy clay and when  
**0:35:07-0:35:15:**  we first moved on to the farm we really struggled to get crops to grow because the soil was  
**0:35:15-0:35:17:**  in such bad condition.  
**0:35:17-0:35:22:**  Now the germination of the crops there is as good as it is elsewhere on the farm and  
**0:35:22-0:35:28:**  that's partly because of the trees and partly because of the organic system and partly because  
**0:35:28-0:35:29:**  of the cover crops etc.  
**0:35:29-0:35:34:**  I wouldn't say it was all the agroforestry but the agroforestry definitely contributes  
**0:35:34-0:35:35:**  to that.  
**0:35:35-0:35:42:**  Of course and it's true that for the purpose of the podcast we focus a lot on agroforestry  
**0:35:42-0:35:47:**  and the trees but yeah, totally understand that the cover crops play a huge role and  
**0:35:47-0:35:55:**  they're only a little part of a bigger transformation on the farm that obviously has been successful.  
**0:35:55-0:36:04:**  There's no single silver bullet, lots of little hammers which help you change the system.  
**0:36:04-0:36:09:**  And I've kind of tried to force you to separate things and say it's just the trees and I realize  
**0:36:09-0:36:16:**  it's a bit tricky but I think the takeaway is that they were part of a really positive  
**0:36:16-0:36:19:**  transformation of the farm and that even if they're not the only ones responsible they  
**0:36:19-0:36:25:**  definitely played their part in taking you where you are today.  
**0:36:25-0:36:32:**  The bit that really excites me about the agroforestry now it's established is this mixture of perennials  
**0:36:32-0:36:38:**  and annuals but also that we've made the farm bigger.  
**0:36:38-0:36:41:**  So we're farming three-dimensionally.  
**0:36:41-0:36:51:**  As farmers too often we always think at the height of a head of wheat or the back of a  
**0:36:51-0:37:00:**  all-brat cow we think very two-dimensionally whereas if we can use the farm three-dimensionally  
**0:37:00-0:37:07:**  and have components that don't compete in the same space or at the same time then we  
**0:37:07-0:37:14:**  can make the farm much bigger and ultimately what we're trying to do is take sunlight and  
**0:37:14-0:37:19:**  water and carbon dioxide and build carbon.  
**0:37:19-0:37:26:**  So it's about solar capture and the trees, the crops are growing from winter through  
**0:37:26-0:37:32:**  through the winter through to mid-summer and the trees are growing from late spring through  
**0:37:32-0:37:33:**  to late autumn.  
**0:37:33-0:37:39:**  So there's an overlap in time and there's also an overlap in space, deep tree roots,  
**0:37:39-0:37:46:**  high canopy, the cereals and the vegetables are shallower roots and lower canopy so they  
**0:37:46-0:37:48:**  don't compete with each other.  
**0:37:48-0:37:54:**  And the work that has been done on agroforestry productivity shows that the sort of land equivalent  
**0:37:54-0:38:04:**  ratios are typically between sort of 1 and 1.4 i.e. the same level of productivity or  
**0:38:04-0:38:09:**  up to 40% more productive from the combination of both components.  
**0:38:09-0:38:15:**  The studies that we've done show we're between sort of we were a few years ago at sort of  
**0:38:15-0:38:21:**  1.1 we're now at about 1.25 so it's sort of 25% more productive than the agroforestry  
**0:38:21-0:38:24:**  than we are in just the cropping area alone.  
**0:38:24-0:38:31:**  Wow, it's great to have this data but you know for the moment we've talked a lot about  
**0:38:31-0:38:39:**  the successes of agroforestry but I'm wondering is there also a flip side to it and especially  
**0:38:39-0:38:47:**  in terms of you know implementation and management what kind of challenges have you encountered?  
**0:38:47-0:38:49:**  Well we've made loads of mistakes.  
**0:38:49-0:38:55:**  That's part of learning isn't it?  
**0:38:55-0:39:03:**  I guess some of the lessons that we've learned, some of the varieties we picked weren't the  
**0:39:03-0:39:04:**  best varieties.  
**0:39:04-0:39:07:**  There's a couple of varieties I wouldn't pick again.  
**0:39:07-0:39:10:**  I think fruit trees were the right thing.  
**0:39:10-0:39:15:**  When we planted the trees a few things happened.  
**0:39:15-0:39:24:**  Initially the trees were planted in 2009 as one year old trees so they're about 1 to 1.2  
**0:39:24-0:39:41:**  meters tall as a very thin stem and when we planted them we put a machined round post  
**0:39:41-0:39:52:**  and a tie to the tree and a guard and a small bamboo cane stick for support.  
**0:39:52-0:39:58:**  When the tree started to grow the one thing that we hadn't anticipated is that we've created  
**0:39:58-0:40:08:**  4,500 perching posts for pigeons and that's fine when one pigeon comes and lands on your  
**0:40:08-0:40:14:**  young tree but when two of his friends come to keep him company we found about a thousand  
**0:40:14-0:40:17:**  trees had gotten broken.  
**0:40:17-0:40:21:**  Maybe 0.3 of the meter got broken out of the top.  
**0:40:21-0:40:32:**  That was a hard lesson so we actually went back and put a sort of 3 meter bamboo stick  
**0:40:32-0:40:36:**  with every tree and that solved the problem because the pigeons would perch on top of  
**0:40:36-0:40:38:**  the stick.  
**0:40:38-0:40:42:**  Now that's not a problem because the trees are big.  
**0:40:42-0:40:45:**  A hundred pigeons could land and the trees would be fine.  
**0:40:45-0:40:46:**  So that was one lesson.  
**0:40:46-0:40:56:**  The second lesson is that the machined posts that we planted would be put in with the new  
**0:40:56-0:40:57:**  tree planting.  
**0:40:57-0:41:05:**  The quality of the timber was very poor and after three years they'd rotten and I should  
**0:41:05-0:41:08:**  have spent more money on a hardwood chestnut post.  
**0:41:08-0:41:12:**  So that was a mistake.  
**0:41:12-0:41:21:**  I guess the third thing would be where we are.  
**0:41:21-0:41:25:**  I probably should have bought wood chip and put around the base of the tree to help with  
**0:41:25-0:41:28:**  weed control.  
**0:41:28-0:41:32:**  The trees were establishing in the first few years but we're in an area where there isn't  
**0:41:32-0:41:44:**  a lot of wood chip and wood mulch available and we used a geotextile 1 meter square around  
**0:41:44-0:41:46:**  the trees which worked perfectly.  
**0:41:46-0:41:47:**  It worked really well.  
**0:41:47-0:41:50:**  It kept the weeds down.  
**0:41:50-0:41:59:**  Ten years on when you try and mow around the trees sometimes you collect the 1 meter geotextile  
**0:41:59-0:42:02:**  in the mower which can be a problem.  
**0:42:02-0:42:11:**  The bigger problem is that it's an ideal home for voles and mice.  
**0:42:11-0:42:15:**  It's nice and warm and dry and sometimes they eat the root of the tree.  
**0:42:15-0:42:21:**  So we've lost a few trees, maybe only 5%, but we lost a few trees from voles.  
**0:42:21-0:42:26:**  But potentially the wood chips would have also been a good habitat for them.  
**0:42:26-0:42:38:**  There are some lessons that we've learnt.  
**0:42:38-0:42:43:**  The understory that we planted, some of the species didn't survive.  
**0:42:43-0:42:51:**  I probably would have planted more Lucerne alfalfa and more Samfoyne because that's done  
**0:42:51-0:42:52:**  really well.  
**0:42:52-0:42:58:**  It has a long lifespan so those are some of the things.  
**0:42:58-0:43:08:**  The other lesson that we learnt, we're in quite a windy location and in an orchard bees  
**0:43:08-0:43:10:**  are really important for pollination.  
**0:43:10-0:43:14:**  In agroforestry bees are really important for pollination but in a really windy exposed  
**0:43:14-0:43:26:**  location the bees tend to travel, they tend to roam and pollinate in the more sheltered  
**0:43:26-0:43:33:**  areas and not so much in the most exposed areas, especially if it's wet and cold or  
**0:43:33-0:43:34:**  raining.  
**0:43:34-0:43:43:**  So we now work with a commercial beekeeper to have 40 hives out on the farm.  
**0:43:43-0:43:48:**  So having more bees earlier in the system I think would have been better because we  
**0:43:48-0:43:54:**  found some areas that the fruit production was compromised by lack of pollination.  
**0:43:54-0:43:59:**  I just wanted to go back to what you were saying about the wood chips because what would  
**0:43:59-0:44:00:**  you do then?  
**0:44:00-0:44:06:**  Because it is a tricky question because we used wood chips planting fruit trees in Greece  
**0:44:06-0:44:11:**  on Massey Farm but the volumes are huge and especially if you have humid conditions, which  
**0:44:11-0:44:15:**  wasn't the case in Greece but presumably is the case in England, then you're having to  
**0:44:15-0:44:19:**  remulch quite often to keep the weed suppression effect.  
**0:44:19-0:44:26:**  So now that you know this, how would you get the wood chips and would you maybe use another  
**0:44:26-0:44:28:**  fabric then?  
**0:44:28-0:44:32:**  I looked at it from a practical and cost point of view, it wasn't viable for us because we're  
**0:44:32-0:44:37:**  in an area where there isn't, we're in the part of the country where there isn't much  
**0:44:37-0:44:44:**  forestry and which it was really expensive to transport.  
**0:44:44-0:44:54:**  So at the time it wasn't an option but I think I'd be looking at other things now, perhaps  
**0:44:54-0:45:03:**  compost or perhaps wool, used wool from sheeps, even cardboard.  
**0:45:03-0:45:07:**  Yeah, yeah, that was true, there's interesting things out there.  
**0:45:07-0:45:13:**  In terms of management though, you mentioned that you put the tree lines north to south  
**0:45:13-0:45:17:**  for the sunshine effect.  
**0:45:17-0:45:20:**  Has it changed a lot the way you work the lands in terms of machinery?  
**0:45:20-0:45:23:**  Has it added some extra constraints?  
**0:45:23-0:45:30:**  No, in fact one of the things that we wanted to do is make sure that we could use normal  
**0:45:30-0:45:35:**  farm machinery so what it's actually done is opened up an opportunity for us to develop  
**0:45:35-0:45:39:**  a controlled traffic farming system.  
**0:45:39-0:45:48:**  So we've actually rationalised all our machinery to six metres, so cultivators are six metres,  
**0:45:48-0:45:56:**  the sowing seeder is six metres, we actually run, being an organic farm, we run a six metre  
**0:45:56-0:46:04:**  seeder matched to a six metre inter-row hoe, a Garthord Robocrop.  
**0:46:04-0:46:13:**  So we sow all our cereals at 22 centimetre spacings in the row and then we use a computer  
**0:46:13-0:46:21:**  and camera guided hoe, the Robocrop six metres matched to the seeder which does an inter-row  
**0:46:21-0:46:28:**  weeding between the cereals which works brilliantly and so that's six metres, four passes in the  
**0:46:28-0:46:37:**  alley between the trees, six six six six and then our combine is six point two metres so  
**0:46:37-0:46:43:**  everything is now developed into a really well operating controlled traffic farming  
**0:46:43-0:46:53:**  system and if we apply permitted trace minerals like manganese or magnesium we can still run  
**0:46:53-0:47:00:**  a 24 metre crop sprayer down the middle of the field.  
**0:47:00-0:47:06:**  And how has the extra workload that comes with taking care of the trees, so not only  
**0:47:06-0:47:10:**  the harvest and the selling but you know the root pruning, the pruning, how has that kind  
**0:47:10-0:47:13:**  of integrated to your previous productions?  
**0:47:13-0:47:18:**  Is it something that's kind of easily spread out through the year or have you had to deal  
**0:47:18-0:47:19:**  with some extra?  
**0:47:19-0:47:28:**  Yeah it's actually at times of the year when we're not so busy on the farm so the pruning  
**0:47:28-0:47:37:**  for the fruit trees is winter time and there tends to be less cropping and arable and crop  
**0:47:37-0:47:43:**  and other work to do on the farm during the winter so that keeps employment on the farm.  
**0:47:43-0:47:50:**  As a hundred hectare farm it was always quite difficult to justify employing somebody to  
**0:47:50-0:47:55:**  work on the farm full time but the trees have helped us do that because it provides employment  
**0:47:55-0:47:57:**  during the winter months.  
**0:47:57-0:48:03:**  The picking of the fruit is after the main harvest, the main cereal harvest and crop  
**0:48:03-0:48:10:**  harvest is during August and the fruit harvest is our second harvest and it's late September  
**0:48:10-0:48:19:**  or early October and that's just before we go and then start the autumn sowing and seeding  
**0:48:19-0:48:21:**  program for the cereal crops.  
**0:48:21-0:48:27:**  So it all meshes quite well, gives us a nice even profile of labour throughout the year  
**0:48:27-0:48:29:**  really.  
**0:48:29-0:48:32:**  And it's not too hard to find labour then in the region because I know sometimes that's  
**0:48:32-0:48:37:**  a limitation is that certain things make ecological sense but then you don't necessarily have  
**0:48:37-0:48:41:**  the human resources to actually pick fruits or...  
**0:48:41-0:48:52:**  Well we're quite mechanised in that we usually employ a team of about six casual staff for  
**0:48:52-0:48:58:**  picking and we are in a part of the country where there is quite a lot of vegetables grown  
**0:48:58-0:49:05:**  so the casual labour that's picking vegetables during the summer by the time they've got  
**0:49:05-0:49:10:**  to late September or early October a lot of those vegetables have been harvested, the  
**0:49:10-0:49:18:**  salad crops have been harvested so we pick up some of that casual labour in the early  
**0:49:18-0:49:23:**  autumn and just use them, just six people for a couple of weeks to pick all the fruit  
**0:49:23-0:49:35:**  and then that's picked into 300 kilo bins which are on the back of a low trailer behind  
**0:49:35-0:49:46:**  a 160 horseback tractor and then we use a telescopic JCB to move everything around quite  
**0:49:46-0:49:51:**  mechanised so it's just the picking from the trees and putting into the bin which can be  
**0:49:51-0:49:55:**  done reasonably quickly and quite efficiently.  
**0:49:55-0:49:59:**  And for the pruning of the trees, how many people do you have?  
**0:49:59-0:50:08:**  Well typically we have a rotation so two people will prune half the trees one year and half  
**0:50:08-0:50:11:**  the trees the following year.  
**0:50:11-0:50:19:**  That's one, the man that works on the farm full time plus one other and we'll do the  
**0:50:19-0:50:23:**  pruning through the winter.  
**0:50:23-0:50:31:**  So apparently from a kind of practical perspective the trees have integrated really well into  
**0:50:31-0:50:36:**  your farm operation but in terms of sales how did that happen because you're kind of  
**0:50:36-0:50:42:**  bringing in a new product and how did that integration to the business come along?  
**0:50:42-0:50:52:**  Yeah so as I said earlier on in the interview we selected apples because we rent the farm  
**0:50:52-0:51:02:**  and we wanted an economic return within the period of our rental agreement of 15 years  
**0:51:02-0:51:10:**  and we could also see there was an opportunity to grow organic apples using agroforestry  
**0:51:10-0:51:18:**  because most of the orchards that are operated in the UK and throughout Europe are really  
**0:51:18-0:51:25:**  highly intensive so they're not suited to organic production because they're highly  
**0:51:25-0:51:31:**  intensive so it's actually quite difficult to grow organic apples so we thought that  
**0:51:31-0:51:37:**  there was an opportunity to do it in an agroforestry way.  
**0:51:37-0:51:44:**  So initially when we started harvesting fruit from about year four onwards some of our fruit  
**0:51:44-0:51:52:**  was just sold wholesale until three years ago when we went through a year of building  
**0:51:52-0:52:03:**  the farm shop and the cafe which my wife runs, she heads that business up and then that allows  
**0:52:03-0:52:13:**  us to sell the fruit directly to consumers but still about 80% of it now is turned into  
**0:52:13-0:52:14:**  apple juice.  
**0:52:14-0:52:20:**  When we do a mixed blended apple juice and also single priority apple juices which we  
**0:52:20-0:52:27:**  bottled and then we can retail them throughout the year and that works really well and it  
**0:52:27-0:52:29:**  adds significant value as well.  
**0:52:29-0:52:35:**  Sure and your local market is significant enough to absorb that amount of apples.  
**0:52:35-0:52:47:**  Yeah so we're fortunate, the town Peterborough has 220,000 people that's between I suppose  
**0:52:47-0:52:54:**  two and eight kilometres away depending on the farm but the shop will be about eight  
**0:52:54-0:53:03:**  kilometres from the city and in a normal year there's good demand and we sell plenty.  
**0:53:03-0:53:10:**  Clearly it's a pretty bumpy ride for retail and hospitality businesses with Covid at the  
**0:53:10-0:53:17:**  moment it's quite challenging.  
**0:53:17-0:53:22:**  And I'm wondering how many tons does it represent that you collect every year?  
**0:53:22-0:53:34:**  So the trees are say four and a half thousand trees, the strips under the trees on the 52  
**0:53:34-0:53:43:**  hectares, the strips are actually four hectares in size so it's about 8% of the land area  
**0:53:43-0:53:52:**  has trees and about 92% has cereal crops and the trees are yielding about five tons per  
**0:53:52-0:54:01:**  hectare of fruit so we're around 20-25 tons of fruit per year and 80% of that will get  
**0:54:01-0:54:11:**  turned into juice which we sell in seven 50 millilitre or two 50 millilitre bottles.  
**0:54:11-0:54:15:**  You probably don't have that figure off the top of your head but you know presumably the  
**0:54:15-0:54:21:**  trees occupy 8% of the land but represent a much higher value proportionally in terms  
**0:54:21-0:54:22:**  of your sales.  
**0:54:22-0:54:29:**  Yeah so I'll try and do a quick calculation into euros.  
**0:54:29-0:54:33:**  You can say it in pounds it's fine.  
**0:54:33-0:54:43:**  Well euro, pound it's about the same.  
**0:54:43-0:54:49:**  The output for the cereals is about I suppose about 1300 euros per hectare.  
**0:54:49-0:55:02:**  The fruit is about 1800 euros per hectare in terms of economic output but that's at  
**0:55:02-0:55:04:**  a wholesale price.  
**0:55:04-0:55:12:**  If we turn that fruit into juice it's worth 4,000 euros a hectare.  
**0:55:12-0:55:19:**  So you can travel its value in turning it into a juice product.  
**0:55:19-0:55:22:**  Wow it's great.  
**0:55:22-0:55:27:**  One thing comes to mind though is that you mentioned how difficult it is to do organic  
**0:55:27-0:55:33:**  apples and then by diversifying to perennial crops and apples you are taking on a whole  
**0:55:33-0:55:37:**  new type of production with a lot of technical challenges.  
**0:55:37-0:55:45:**  So the other input being knowledge was it difficult to gain that expertise of producing  
**0:55:45-0:55:47:**  organic apples?  
**0:55:47-0:55:54:**  Yeah I'll be perfectly honest we were complete novices in terms of fruit production.  
**0:55:54-0:55:58:**  I probably still are.  
**0:55:58-0:56:07:**  I'm a much better cereal farmer than I am fruit farmer and we probably should be fertilizing  
**0:56:07-0:56:13:**  and pushing the production harder on the fruit but I'm a better cereal farmer than I am a  
**0:56:13-0:56:22:**  fruit farmer and we just had to learn by talking to other people about production and the challenge  
**0:56:22-0:56:26:**  there is that most of the production is very intensive and there's very little organic  
**0:56:26-0:56:32:**  fruit production so there are relatively few people you can talk to and you have to make  
**0:56:32-0:56:34:**  it up as you go along.  
**0:56:34-0:56:38:**  Yeah but on the other hand of course you could be pushing it more but obviously then if you're  
**0:56:38-0:56:43:**  pushing it more it's also more time and resources and inputs that you're investing so if you're  
**0:56:43-0:56:48:**  able to have a low input system and still manage to have produce to sell and make a  
**0:56:48-0:56:51:**  profit on it is still very interesting.  
**0:56:51-0:57:02:**  Yeah and that's really our farming philosophies is easy care.  
**0:57:02-0:57:11:**  It's low input, good output and adding value because not only do we run the farming business,  
**0:57:11-0:57:22:**  we run the retail and the cafe business and the education and also I run a consultancy  
**0:57:22-0:57:28:**  business working with other organic farmers and also part-time I'm head of soils for the  
**0:57:28-0:57:32:**  Royal Agricultural Society of England so we're busy.  
**0:57:32-0:57:40:**  We can only do so many things, there are only 24 hours in a day and seven days a week.  
**0:57:40-0:57:44:**  There's a question in terms of the workload then because we've talked about value, we've  
**0:57:44-0:57:50:**  talked about how much of the land it occupies but how do you distribute your time between  
**0:57:50-0:57:56:**  the cereals and the apples and how much additional workload does it represent including those  
**0:57:56-0:58:02:**  trees?  
**0:58:02-0:58:10:**  So there obviously is some additional work and the system is more complex but the work  
**0:58:10-0:58:19:**  is at different periods of the year so for cereals the seeding is, the cultivations and  
**0:58:19-0:58:28:**  seeding is in sort of October into November, the weeding is in the spring and the harvesting  
**0:58:28-0:58:38:**  is in August for us whereas the fruit trees, the pruning is in the middle of winter in  
**0:58:38-0:58:45:**  December, January, February and the harvesting is in October so they don't clash.  
**0:58:45-0:58:50:**  They're really different periods of the year for the different operations.  
**0:58:50-0:58:56:**  The pick for the fruit is after the cereal.  
**0:58:56-0:59:03:**  I drive the combine harvester so we finish the harvest and there's sort of a triumphant  
**0:59:03-0:59:08:**  yeah we finished harvest and then you have 10 days or two weeks and then you start harvest  
**0:59:08-0:59:09:**  again.  
**0:59:09-0:59:15:**  There's two harvests and we're only really finished harvest by the time we've got all  
**0:59:15-0:59:17:**  the fruit harvested.  
**0:59:17-0:59:22:**  But it seems you know I've been trying to pick things and find the flow but overall  
**0:59:22-0:59:28:**  it just seems that you're very satisfied with what you've done with including these trees  
**0:59:28-0:59:34:**  and it really seems to make sense both in terms of economic sense and practical sense  
**0:59:34-0:59:39:**  and also certain enjoyment diversifying your productions.  
**0:59:39-0:59:49:**  Yeah it is, it works and I was determined to make it, set it up to make it work but  
**0:59:49-0:59:56:**  it is more complex there are and as you rightly said this you know it's a it's managed complexity  
**0:59:56-0:59:58:**  for want of a better word.  
**0:59:58-1:00:04:**  So we've introduced more management requirement because we have two perennials and annuals  
**1:00:04-1:00:12:**  and fruit and cereals but it is quite manageable it's just another crop that we've got to learn.  
**1:00:12-1:00:17:**  We've had you know the machinery all works we haven't had to go and buy any other than  
**1:00:17-1:00:21:**  some hand pruning equipment and a mower to mow under the trees.  
**1:00:21-1:00:30:**  We haven't had to go and buy any specialist equipment so it's doable by any farm and that's  
**1:00:30-1:00:38:**  part of what we wanted to do is to do something that other farmers could do as well.  
**1:00:38-1:00:42:**  And I guess one of the real bonuses is that you know we started this interview by saying  
**1:00:42-1:00:51:**  that the farm we have is rented on a 15 year agreement on the basis of what we've done  
**1:00:51-1:00:58:**  here with the organic production with the agroforestry also with the retail business  
**1:00:58-1:01:03:**  as well but with the agroforestry particularly it allowed us to go to our landowner and say  
**1:01:03-1:01:10:**  listen we you know we've invested heavily in the farm we've improved the farm we want  
**1:01:10-1:01:17:**  a longer a rental arrangement so at year 10 we surrendered the rental agreement and took  
**1:01:17-1:01:23:**  another 15 years so that gives us 25 years.  
**1:01:23-1:01:32:**  I often say that we've made the farm so complicated that they can't let it to anybody else.  
**1:01:32-1:01:36:**  That's a good strategy.  
**1:01:36-1:01:41:**  And you know kind of taking this interview to an end because I want to be considerate  
**1:01:41-1:01:50:**  with your time as well and the clock is ticking but I'm interested to know a bit as a conclusion  
**1:01:50-1:01:55:**  what are the next steps for Whitehall Farm then because you still have you're still renting  
**1:01:55-1:02:00:**  so you know are you thinking of complexifying more if you get longer leases or how do you  
**1:02:00-1:02:04:**  imagine the next few years?  
**1:02:04-1:02:06:**  Yeah it's an interesting one.  
**1:02:06-1:02:14:**  Yeah we've done a lot probably more than what many farmers would do.  
**1:02:14-1:02:19:**  We the agroforestry is working you know I think I think that works well I don't think  
**1:02:19-1:02:25:**  I'd change too many things different varieties perhaps.  
**1:02:25-1:02:32:**  I think we may go back into some more vegetable production if market opportunities allow.  
**1:02:32-1:02:40:**  I am exploring the possibility of planting more trees but as nursery trees.  
**1:02:40-1:02:41:**  OK.  
**1:02:41-1:02:46:**  There's the climate change is a big demand throughout Europe for planting more trees.  
**1:02:46-1:02:49:**  Where is all that planting material going to come from?  
**1:02:49-1:02:56:**  Perhaps we can use agroforestry and instead of planting one tree in a row we plant two  
**1:02:56-1:02:59:**  and we leave one and we take the other out and sell it.  
**1:02:59-1:03:04:**  So now having the tree expertise that we could actually grow some planting material that  
**1:03:04-1:03:08:**  is using agroforestry as a nursery production system.  
**1:03:08-1:03:11:**  So that's that's one of the things I'm thinking about.  
**1:03:11-1:03:18:**  But we shall continue to do more and more on the retail and farm shop and the cafe and  
**1:03:18-1:03:26:**  the education and bringing people to the farm to learn about farming to buy produce and  
**1:03:26-1:03:27:**  add value that way.  
**1:03:27-1:03:30:**  So I think that's where our energy is going to go.  
**1:03:30-1:03:31:**  Sure.  
**1:03:31-1:03:41:**  And sorry to be honest I spent I spent a lot of time a lot of time talking to government  
**1:03:41-1:03:42:**  and policymakers.  
**1:03:42-1:03:55:**  You know 10 years ago agroforestry was ignored and to some extent ridiculed.  
**1:03:55-1:03:58:**  Five years ago polite interest.  
**1:03:58-1:04:04:**  We're now at a stage where actually because of Brexit we're actually developing our own  
**1:04:04-1:04:12:**  domestic agricultural policy and agroforestry is very much in favour by government and it  
**1:04:12-1:04:13:**  will be supported.  
**1:04:13-1:04:15:**  So we've actually helped.  
**1:04:15-1:04:23:**  I've been pretty central I think in helping government wake up to the benefits of agroforestry  
**1:04:23-1:04:27:**  underpinned by the research that others have done and we've done here.  
**1:04:27-1:04:32:**  And so we spent a lot of time and I will continue to spend a lot of time helping shape agricultural  
**1:04:32-1:04:41:**  policy here in the UK to make sure agroforestry is part of a land use system.  
**1:04:41-1:04:48:**  In fact you know I was the first vice president of the European Agroforestry Federation.  
**1:04:48-1:04:57:**  With Christian Dupras and I and others dreamt up over many bottles of wine late night in  
**1:04:57-1:05:01:**  Paris 2011 and 2012.  
**1:05:01-1:05:03:**  That's great.  
**1:05:03-1:05:09:**  Hopefully we'll be able to get Christian Dupras and others on the podcast as well because  
**1:05:09-1:05:16:**  I mean your whole group has done so much great work on agroforestry and so many helpful resources.  
**1:05:16-1:05:20:**  And to conclude I'm curious to have your opinion because you know we haven't really had the  
**1:05:20-1:05:27:**  time but you also to discuss this but you also did this trip and produced a report on  
**1:05:27-1:05:31:**  agroforestry in the world that's fascinating that we'll definitely put the link under the  
**1:05:31-1:05:38:**  episode so you have what I mean is that you have experience and have seen things way beyond  
**1:05:38-1:05:42:**  just your experience on your farm and from all that knowledge and your experience what  
**1:05:42-1:05:47:**  do you think are the kind of key points to focus on to develop agroforestry or the key  
**1:05:47-1:05:50:**  missing pieces of the puzzle?  
**1:05:50-1:05:56:**  Yeah as you rightly say I was very fortunate to be well first of all I was very fortunate  
**1:05:56-1:06:01:**  to be awarded a Nuffield scholarship to travel globally looking at agroforestry and I went  
**1:06:01-1:06:08:**  to North and South America, I spent time in China, all around Europe.  
**1:06:08-1:06:16:**  In fact just before Christmas last year I was awarded another award which was a recognition  
**1:06:16-1:06:24:**  of the person who had changed the industry most as a result of that Nuffield scholarship  
**1:06:24-1:06:26:**  which was a great accolade.  
**1:06:26-1:06:39:**  But in answer to your question in terms of where things might go what one might do differently  
**1:06:39-1:06:46:**  were some of the sort of blockages to agroforestry I think there are a number of things.  
**1:06:46-1:06:55:**  I actually if I had a crystal ball I think nut trees are going to be really important  
**1:06:55-1:06:57:**  over the next decade.  
**1:06:57-1:07:04:**  I think nut protein is going to be hugely important so I think agroforestry has a role  
**1:07:04-1:07:06:**  to play there.  
**1:07:06-1:07:12:**  I also think actually more collaborations you know if we want multifunctional land use  
**1:07:12-1:07:19:**  to deliver biodiversity, to deliver productivity, to be resilient against climate change and  
**1:07:19-1:07:22:**  agroforestry is very much multifunctional.  
**1:07:22-1:07:28:**  We actually need multi operator, one of the challenges of the Common Agricultural Policy  
**1:07:28-1:07:33:**  is that it says one person is in charge of this part of the land.  
**1:07:33-1:07:41:**  You might have multiple occupation and that requires that as a farmer I'm multi skilled,  
**1:07:41-1:07:50:**  I'm a biologist, I'm a physicist, I'm a chemist, I'm a plumber, electrician, accountant, you  
**1:07:50-1:07:55:**  know many things but as you rightly said I know about grain production I had to learn  
**1:07:55-1:07:59:**  about fruit production but I think there's an opportunity for people to work together  
**1:07:59-1:08:06:**  to cooperate so that perhaps one person manages the tree component or one person manages the  
**1:08:06-1:08:09:**  crops and another person manages the livestock.  
**1:08:09-1:08:14:**  But the policy structures don't allow that to happen.  
**1:08:14-1:08:21:**  They say that one person must be responsible for one parcel of land and that has to change  
**1:08:21-1:08:27:**  because if we want to build resilience against climate change we need to use each other's  
**1:08:27-1:08:32:**  knowledge and skills because we don't all know everything or have the skills ready.  
**1:08:32-1:08:38:**  What you just said resonates with me so much because my experience these last months traveling  
**1:08:38-1:08:43:**  to different farms in France is I've often found that you know we often think that the  
**1:08:43-1:08:47:**  limiting factor is land which is true it is hard to get you know access to land but I  
**1:08:47-1:08:54:**  met so many farmers that wanted to diversify, wanted to complexify but just didn't have  
**1:08:54-1:09:01:**  the skills, the resources or the time to do so and we're just looking basically for partners  
**1:09:01-1:09:05:**  to be able to do these things together and make the most out of these synergies.  
**1:09:05-1:09:11:**  So I think what you said is really key and we're definitely going to need some new collaborations  
**1:09:11-1:09:17:**  and you mentioned the legal side let's say the subsidy side the common agricultural policy  
**1:09:17-1:09:23:**  but that also means you know in kind of like the ways we are used to farm and that farmers  
**1:09:23-1:09:28:**  also you know connect back with a certain form of collective you know.  
**1:09:28-1:09:33:**  Some of the legal challenges are like the common agricultural policy or our own domestic  
**1:09:33-1:09:41:**  agricultural policy here in the UK or indeed land tenure so I rent the farm the rental  
**1:09:41-1:09:46:**  agreement doesn't allow me to let any land to anybody else because that would be subletting  
**1:09:46-1:09:53:**  but those kind of limitations stifle innovation.  
**1:09:53-1:09:58:**  The common agricultural policy has been good at food security but it's been it's massively  
**1:09:58-1:10:07:**  stifled innovation and if we want farming systems that are multifunctional and resilient  
**1:10:07-1:10:16:**  to climate change we need to you know have a new thinking to allow us to build systems  
**1:10:16-1:10:18:**  that have that innovation and that resilience.  
**1:10:18-1:10:23:**  And that's something I actually forgot to ask you but just quickly maybe could you tell  
**1:10:23-1:10:29:**  us how difficult is it to implement an agroforestry system on the land that you don't own because  
**1:10:29-1:10:33:**  then you have to go and ask permission from the landowner?  
**1:10:33-1:10:35:**  How does that go?  
**1:10:35-1:10:41:**  So you know two years before we established the agroforestry I had those conversations  
**1:10:41-1:10:43:**  with our landowner.  
**1:10:43-1:10:49:**  I had to sign a document which basically said if we surrender the farm and we give up the  
**1:10:49-1:10:57:**  rental agreement I have to take the trees with me and return it to agricultural land.  
**1:10:57-1:11:04:**  I'm hoping that in you know another 15 years when we eventually if we give up the farm  
**1:11:04-1:11:11:**  that the system will be will be so robust and work so well that another the following  
**1:11:11-1:11:15:**  occupier will say yeah we'll just keep them and that won't be a problem.  
**1:11:15-1:11:21:**  But I was prepared to take that risk so if nothing else then you know I would have to  
**1:11:21-1:11:24:**  start a firewood business.  
**1:11:24-1:11:27:**  Yeah I think so.  
**1:11:27-1:11:28:**  In 15 years time.  
**1:11:28-1:11:30:**  Wood carving, wood carving enterprise.  
**1:11:30-1:11:34:**  It's not the end of the world.  
**1:11:34-1:11:38:**  Listen Stefan thank you so much for all this information.  
**1:11:38-1:11:44:**  It's been really a great interview and it's really fascinating to be able to hear all  
**1:11:44-1:11:48:**  of your experience and everything that you've witnessed through experience on Whitehall  
**1:11:48-1:11:53:**  Farm so thank you so much.  
**1:11:53-1:12:00:**  It's a pleasure and I hope it makes interesting reading to or interesting listening I should  
**1:12:00-1:12:08:**  say to your listeners and I just take the opportunity to say you know in these challenging  
**1:12:08-1:12:14:**  times it's great to be in agriculture, great to watch agroforestry developing.  
**1:12:14-1:12:18:**  I hope everyone's well and safe.  
**1:12:18-1:12:22:**  Well thank you so much for listening we really hope you enjoyed it.

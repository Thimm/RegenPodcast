### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sun, 31 Oct 2021 17:34:03)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:47:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:52:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we have the immense pleasure of interviewing Francis Boukay  
**0:00:52-0:00:59:**  who is a farmer, consultant, author as well as owner of the company Galago.  
**0:00:59-0:01:03:**  So I wanted to talk to Francis because after reading his book I was very much inspired  
**0:01:03-0:01:09:**  by his understanding of agronomy and how he is really going into a lot of depth into the  
**0:01:09-0:01:14:**  science behind agroecological systems, looking at how soil functions.  
**0:01:14-0:01:17:**  And one of the things that really came out in all of these, in his book and all of the  
**0:01:17-0:01:24:**  concepts that he talks about is the importance of having a healthy soil system based on fungi  
**0:01:24-0:01:25:**  and lignin.  
**0:01:25-0:01:30:**  Now of course in agroforestry this is very pertinent, it's extremely interesting and  
**0:01:30-0:01:36:**  agroforestry can serve as a source of this lignin material but on top of that what really  
**0:01:36-0:01:41:**  is becoming clearer and clearer to me is that agroforestry will only have an impact on an  
**0:01:41-0:01:46:**  agricultural system if we first start dealing with the soil health.  
**0:01:46-0:01:49:**  And Francis will go into a lot of depth with this, talking about this and I really hope  
**0:01:49-0:01:53:**  that you enjoy this interview.  
**0:01:53-0:01:55:**  Hello Francis and welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:55-0:02:01:**  Yes, thank you Dimitri for welcoming me and for having invited me.  
**0:02:01-0:02:07:**  No, it was an absolute pleasure to have you on here and we usually start with our guests  
**0:02:07-0:02:13:**  with an introduction as to how they got into farming and how they got to where they are  
**0:02:13-0:02:17:**  right now so it would be great if you could tell us a bit about yourself.  
**0:02:17-0:02:30:**  Yeah so just to give you some hints about me, I am at first a farmer.  
**0:02:30-0:02:39:**  That is to say I farm about 600 hectares in the centre of France and mainly with rabble  
**0:02:39-0:02:49:**  crops but in fact there are many many species from hemp up to corn and winter wheat, winter  
**0:02:49-0:02:58:**  barley, sunflowers, grain sorghum and so on.  
**0:02:58-0:03:08:**  Also 100 hectares of grasses of patches because up to recent times I had herds of goats and  
**0:03:08-0:03:17:**  finally on my own farm I got aware that some, I would say perhaps not problems, I don't  
**0:03:17-0:03:23:**  like the word problems, but some limiting factors were appearing.  
**0:03:23-0:03:33:**  Salt compaction, decrease of humus, to speak about the main challenges I had to face and  
**0:03:33-0:03:42:**  then I began to try to understand what was happening, why the global fertility was slowly  
**0:03:42-0:03:44:**  decreasing.  
**0:03:44-0:03:48:**  The soils are not dead, they are never dead.  
**0:03:48-0:03:55:**  They can be sick but they are not dead and after many searches, many trials on my own  
**0:03:55-0:04:01:**  farm I got aware that there were two limiting factors.  
**0:04:01-0:04:07:**  First, the mineral balance, the mineral balance is so important.  
**0:04:07-0:04:20:**  Up to now it was dealt with only from an analysis and from the pH and three elements, N, P and  
**0:04:20-0:04:21:**  K.  
**0:04:21-0:04:23:**  It was not enough.  
**0:04:23-0:04:27:**  I will come back to this point if necessary.  
**0:04:27-0:04:37:**  The second limiting factor, the second bottleneck is the mineral balance and that's why I began  
**0:04:37-0:04:45:**  to bear interest to the forest, to forest tree because in our Western Europe countries  
**0:04:45-0:04:56:**  show the climax, that is to say the natural vegetation, the natural plants is forest and  
**0:04:56-0:05:05:**  I began to look at what was happening inside the forest and what was striking and mainly  
**0:05:05-0:05:12:**  in this season which is autumn, you have many, many fungi, mushrooms.  
**0:05:12-0:05:21:**  I like mushrooms but in my fields there were some, there were even many 50 or 60 years  
**0:05:21-0:05:28:**  ago when I was young and now you never see mushrooms, something happens.  
**0:05:28-0:05:41:**  So it was the beginning of my searches, of my trials and if necessary we will dig more  
**0:05:41-0:05:47:**  in detail to speak about these points.  
**0:05:47-0:05:58:**  One last point, I began also to work as a consultant to give advice.  
**0:05:58-0:06:08:**  After understanding some points, let's be modest, let's be modest, after understanding  
**0:06:08-0:06:19:**  some points I thought I could share some ideas, some tracks to follow with my fellow farmers  
**0:06:19-0:06:28:**  and finally I began to travel all around the world in America, North America, South America,  
**0:06:28-0:06:37:**  all over Europe, also sometimes in Africa, one time in New Zealand and Australia just  
**0:06:37-0:06:45:**  to share what I knew but also to learn, to learn and to learn and still to learn from  
**0:06:45-0:06:57:**  other scientists, farmers and I began to get aware that advice was not enough.  
**0:06:57-0:07:06:**  I had to go absolutely further because sometimes I told people, oh you should use such stuff,  
**0:07:06-0:07:13:**  such material, such fertilizer, such trace elements and they came back to me while telling  
**0:07:13-0:07:25:**  me, wow, but I can't find it, my distributor has not this rare material and that's why  
**0:07:25-0:07:32:**  I came to the conclusion I had to make the products which were ideal to balance again  
**0:07:32-0:07:41:**  the soils and I created a company which is devoted to this work of making, of manufacturing  
**0:07:41-0:07:47:**  my special recipe and this company is called Galago.  
**0:07:47-0:08:02:**  I created it in 2014 and now it's a company with 50 people and we are now working all  
**0:08:02-0:08:14:**  over Europe and we have also some intentions to go beyond Atlantic Ocean.  
**0:08:14-0:08:15:**  Very nice.  
**0:08:15-0:08:24:**  I would not say in a few words, in many sentences I explain who I am and where I come from.  
**0:08:24-0:08:25:**  Very nice.  
**0:08:25-0:08:30:**  And I mean, are you a farmer?  
**0:08:30-0:08:32:**  Is your family farming for multiple generations?  
**0:08:32-0:08:35:**  How did you come into it in the first place?  
**0:08:35-0:08:44:**  Oh yes, all my family is in farming, farming industry.  
**0:08:44-0:08:53:**  My father was a small farmer in Normandy and he decided to move to the center of France  
**0:08:53-0:08:57:**  just to find a bigger farm.  
**0:08:57-0:09:05:**  You know, it was very difficult at the time, it was in the 70s to find a lander in Normandy  
**0:09:05-0:09:07:**  at this time.  
**0:09:07-0:09:17:**  And when he decided that I was not at all ready to go, to come back on the farm.  
**0:09:17-0:09:25:**  I had a diploma in translation in English.  
**0:09:25-0:09:32:**  I had a diploma for literature and for some economics.  
**0:09:32-0:09:44:**  And I had just been hired by a bank, French international trade bank, Banque Francaise  
**0:09:44-0:09:46:**  du Commerce Exteri√®re.  
**0:09:46-0:09:58:**  And exactly the day where I had to join this bank, my dad, my daddy had a heart attack.  
**0:09:58-0:10:04:**  And of course, I had to assist him, to support him.  
**0:10:04-0:10:07:**  And I told him, oh, don't care.  
**0:10:07-0:10:12:**  I will replace you for a few days or a few weeks.  
**0:10:12-0:10:16:**  And finally, he never really recovered.  
**0:10:16-0:10:31:**  And I was really thrown in farming without being able to swim in this almost new space  
**0:10:31-0:10:32:**  for me.  
**0:10:32-0:10:39:**  But I have to tell you something which is very positive in this story.  
**0:10:39-0:10:47:**  What is positive is the fact that I did not know what I should have sought and I did not  
**0:10:47-0:10:52:**  know what it was forbidden to think.  
**0:10:52-0:10:58:**  So of course, I could use the tracks I found.  
**0:10:58-0:11:07:**  And I read, I read, I read many, many books, English written books.  
**0:11:07-0:11:18:**  And I found so many wonderful, wonderful thoughts, agronomic approaches in the US, in Australia,  
**0:11:18-0:11:25:**  in India, Pakistan, Chinese, Russian, the Russian school, the agronomic Russian school  
**0:11:25-0:11:28:**  is absolutely wonderful in Cuba and so on.  
**0:11:28-0:11:42:**  So I got aware that there were so many, so many, so many bright ideas which were unexplored,  
**0:11:42-0:11:49:**  unexploited, I should say, which existed, but which were unexploited.  
**0:11:49-0:11:52:**  And it's very surprising.  
**0:11:52-0:11:53:**  We have here the proof.  
**0:11:53-0:11:57:**  We have many ways of communicating.  
**0:11:57-0:12:03:**  We have internet, we have many social networks and so on.  
**0:12:03-0:12:15:**  Nevertheless, the knowledge doesn't go very easily and is subjected absolutely to the  
**0:12:15-0:12:26:**  culture, the culture of peoples, the habits of farmers, the pressure of agrochemicals,  
**0:12:26-0:12:36:**  the legislation which doesn't always understand why they impose such regulation.  
**0:12:36-0:12:39:**  They think it would be useful.  
**0:12:39-0:12:41:**  Sometimes it's counterproductive.  
**0:12:41-0:12:50:**  When they say you have to put your slurry deep inside the soil, but they don't understand  
**0:12:50-0:12:59:**  anything, it should be left on the ground to be simply sterilized by the UV light.  
**0:12:59-0:13:08:**  It should be cleaned by the sun and it should be re-excisionated.  
**0:13:08-0:13:20:**  And if they say you have to dig it into the soil, they think only on disturbances for  
**0:13:20-0:13:25:**  the noise, for the noise.  
**0:13:25-0:13:31:**  It's just for the noise of the neighbors, but it's not for nature.  
**0:13:31-0:13:38:**  So I began really to think somewhat differently.  
**0:13:38-0:13:47:**  That's my story and why I came to the point where I am now, nowadays.  
**0:13:47-0:13:53:**  I can't help myself to ask the question about when you're talking about culture and some  
**0:13:53-0:14:01:**  of the challenges, the belief systems that are preventing people from creating change.  
**0:14:01-0:14:06:**  What about you and the fact that you didn't have an agricultural engineer as you have  
**0:14:06-0:14:08:**  in France degree?  
**0:14:08-0:14:13:**  Was that ever limiting to you in your communication and in the way that you managed to interact  
**0:14:13-0:14:16:**  as a consultant?  
**0:14:16-0:14:27:**  Oh, of course, it's a very important, an important question because we have a certain need to  
**0:14:27-0:14:33:**  overcome this difficulty of communication.  
**0:14:33-0:14:41:**  And we have bright people who made studies.  
**0:14:41-0:14:44:**  They know things I don't know.  
**0:14:44-0:14:54:**  They use Excel tool much better than I do myself.  
**0:14:54-0:15:01:**  But I think the very young generation is evolving.  
**0:15:01-0:15:10:**  But in my own company, I have just hired very young agronomist bright people.  
**0:15:10-0:15:19:**  But I get where we have a still to try to transfer another point of view.  
**0:15:19-0:15:31:**  That is to say, if I speak only about pH, you know, acidity, I have just to explain  
**0:15:31-0:15:42:**  them that an alkaline soil doesn't mean you have enough calcium because alkalinity can  
**0:15:42-0:15:51:**  be caused by too much sodium, too much potassium, too much magnesium.  
**0:15:51-0:16:00:**  I found very acidic soils which had already too much calcium.  
**0:16:00-0:16:03:**  So I have just to explain that.  
**0:16:03-0:16:07:**  That is to say, it's a question of mind mapping.  
**0:16:07-0:16:14:**  But I believe very much in the power of communication.  
**0:16:14-0:16:20:**  And one of my job is to try to communicate.  
**0:16:20-0:16:22:**  That's why I wrote a book.  
**0:16:22-0:16:40:**  That's why I try to speak common sense language, common sense, not pure scientific work.  
**0:16:40-0:16:42:**  You know, it's a secret.  
**0:16:42-0:16:46:**  I will give you a secret.  
**0:16:46-0:16:55:**  I asked to science direct to be accepted in the network of scientists.  
**0:16:55-0:17:05:**  I gave all what I did, my book and so on, on the conclusion, you are not a scientist.  
**0:17:05-0:17:09:**  I am sad, not for my own pride.  
**0:17:09-0:17:13:**  It's not a problem of my own pride.  
**0:17:13-0:17:20:**  But I think what you are lacking really is not scientist.  
**0:17:20-0:17:30:**  We have brilliant scientists, but people who are able to put together again everything  
**0:17:30-0:17:35:**  which is known to make again an agro-system.  
**0:17:35-0:17:48:**  Because an agro-system is very complex and we need many, many specialists, many technicians,  
**0:17:48-0:17:56:**  many people who go very, very deep in the knowledge of mechanisms.  
**0:17:56-0:18:07:**  But at the time you absolutely need a very good generalist who put that again all together.  
**0:18:07-0:18:11:**  And I think I am a good generalist.  
**0:18:11-0:18:19:**  Apparently a generalist is not a scientific.  
**0:18:19-0:18:21:**  That's quite sad to hear.  
**0:18:21-0:18:28:**  But I have to say that I am happy you introduced your book and if you hadn't I would have explained  
**0:18:28-0:18:33:**  to our listeners how enthusiastic I was about reading your book, which is in front of me  
**0:18:33-0:18:34:**  right now.  
**0:18:34-0:18:44:**  Because I really appreciated how you were discussing about breaking apart from some  
**0:18:44-0:18:49:**  of the ideas that we carry in agroecology and in regenerative agriculture and looking  
**0:18:49-0:18:56:**  going a bit deeper in the sense, not taking for example no till as an end in itself, but  
**0:18:56-0:19:01:**  as one of the means to an end, as one of our tools that can have its own limits.  
**0:19:01-0:19:06:**  And so I really appreciated how it made me think of things in a non-dogmatic way and  
**0:19:06-0:19:10:**  to also understand the complexity and the nuance of each of these techniques that we  
**0:19:10-0:19:16:**  sometimes have a tendency to hail as an almighty solution to some of our agricultural problems.  
**0:19:16-0:19:21:**  And so I read it, it's in French and I, is there an English translation?  
**0:19:21-0:19:22:**  Not yet.  
**0:19:22-0:19:29:**  Oh, it has been decided the last week and it will be translated.  
**0:19:29-0:19:30:**  Very nice.  
**0:19:30-0:19:31:**  It will be translated.  
**0:19:31-0:19:39:**  I think it could be useful and I will make some addendums, you know, because I think  
**0:19:39-0:19:54:**  for the English speaking people, some references maybe will not be very prevalent, will not  
**0:19:54-0:19:55:**  be relevant.  
**0:19:55-0:19:57:**  So pertinent, so relevant.  
**0:19:57-0:19:59:**  Relevant, yes, exactly.  
**0:19:59-0:20:03:**  I feel there will not be a relevance.  
**0:20:03-0:20:13:**  But from a technical point of view and absolutely I will stick to what I already wrote.  
**0:20:13-0:20:20:**  Even after a few months, I don't regret many lines.  
**0:20:20-0:20:21:**  Very nice.  
**0:20:21-0:20:23:**  So I think that's going to be very exciting.  
**0:20:23-0:20:27:**  And if anybody's listening, it's a book that one of the most interesting books I've read  
**0:20:27-0:20:29:**  recently on agriculture.  
**0:20:29-0:20:31:**  So I highly advise it.  
**0:20:31-0:20:39:**  And actually, I think it's a good way to get into the core of the topic, which was agronomy.  
**0:20:39-0:20:43:**  Because one of the things that you said in the book was, you know, the soil organisms  
**0:20:43-0:20:45:**  don't like to eat salad.  
**0:20:45-0:20:47:**  And it's one of the lines in the book.  
**0:20:47-0:20:49:**  And of course, it needs to be put into context.  
**0:20:49-0:20:52:**  But basically, that kind of, that was one of the things that started, you know, that  
**0:20:52-0:20:56:**  was already making me think because I hadn't quite realized that how, you know, we talk  
**0:20:56-0:21:01:**  a lot about cover crops, but depending on how we use cover crops, we may not be reaching  
**0:21:01-0:21:03:**  the objectives that we're looking for.  
**0:21:03-0:21:06:**  And I would love it if you could a bit explain to us how that works.  
**0:21:06-0:21:10:**  And, you know, what are some of the current mistakes that we're making with cover crops?  
**0:21:10-0:21:14:**  And that's naturally going to lead us into the soil fertility question.  
**0:21:14-0:21:27:**  You know, even agriculture doesn't avoid or escape the, what is fashionable.  
**0:21:27-0:21:30:**  There are fashionable ideas.  
**0:21:30-0:21:39:**  And now it's, the reward is given to the guy who doesn't kill at all.  
**0:21:39-0:21:43:**  No tines, no discs, nothing.  
**0:21:43-0:21:48:**  And we go from one extreme to another one.  
**0:21:48-0:21:53:**  And of course, that's what is striking for me.  
**0:21:53-0:21:58:**  I was dealing, I give another example, which is not in the book.  
**0:21:58-0:22:05:**  I have to give something else or otherwise we will be boring.  
**0:22:05-0:22:06:**  I will be boring.  
**0:22:06-0:22:09:**  We will be bored.  
**0:22:09-0:22:21:**  But I was speaking to a very, very big vine grower this same morning.  
**0:22:21-0:22:28:**  And he told me he has a problem of salinity, you know, too much salt in the soil.  
**0:22:28-0:22:36:**  And of course he was told you have to put a gypsum, what he did and cover crops.  
**0:22:36-0:22:41:**  But I looked deeper in details.  
**0:22:41-0:22:48:**  What happens just because of the cover crops?  
**0:22:48-0:22:52:**  He has been growing now for six or seven years.  
**0:22:52-0:22:57:**  The salinity is worst, worse on worse.  
**0:22:57-0:23:00:**  And he doesn't understand why.  
**0:23:00-0:23:08:**  But we have only to think about the fluxes, the flows, you know, of the nutrients.  
**0:23:08-0:23:22:**  And when you have evapotranspiration, which is much higher than leaching, than the rain,  
**0:23:22-0:23:32:**  the rainfall, then of course the salt will come back to the surface just through the  
**0:23:32-0:23:33:**  capillarity.  
**0:23:33-0:23:43:**  He told me I had some small problems five or six years ago, but now I thought having  
**0:23:43-0:23:51:**  corrected everything through agrobiology, regenerative agriculture and so on.  
**0:23:51-0:24:00:**  But I told him what you did is exactly the opposite of what you should have done.  
**0:24:00-0:24:01:**  Why?  
**0:24:01-0:24:09:**  Because during the winter rains, you have a cover crop which evaporates.  
**0:24:09-0:24:24:**  So the water which should take the salt down finally doesn't do its work just because we  
**0:24:24-0:24:32:**  have the use of this water by the surface, by the plants, by the cover crop.  
**0:24:32-0:24:34:**  And then you have an accumulation.  
**0:24:34-0:24:43:**  And he told me the cover crops is poorer and poorer, is smaller and smaller.  
**0:24:43-0:24:51:**  So you know the world which tells the hell is paved with good intentions.  
**0:24:51-0:24:55:**  So in agronomy, it's also true.  
**0:24:55-0:24:57:**  It's also true.  
**0:24:57-0:25:01:**  We have always to think about the agrosystem.  
**0:25:01-0:25:04:**  What is really happening?  
**0:25:04-0:25:09:**  And that's why sometimes my conclusion, I am not fashionable.  
**0:25:09-0:25:13:**  They are not fashionable.  
**0:25:13-0:25:17:**  And sometimes I tell people you have a still to plow.  
**0:25:17-0:25:27:**  So it's curious in these times, but I have to tell them, yes, it's a way to cure, to  
**0:25:27-0:25:32:**  maintain your soil at the upper level.  
**0:25:32-0:25:37:**  Because you have no biology, you have not the roots of trees which do that and that  
**0:25:37-0:25:38:**  and that.  
**0:25:38-0:25:40:**  And so you have to replace.  
**0:25:40-0:25:47:**  One pivotal idea is the following one.  
**0:25:47-0:25:56:**  When you are cultivating the soil, you have to adjust to understand that before man appeared,  
**0:25:56-0:25:59:**  certainly it was a forest.  
**0:25:59-0:26:11:**  And the only questions to be asked is which functions have been weakened or destroyed  
**0:26:11-0:26:15:**  through deforestation?  
**0:26:15-0:26:20:**  Perhaps maybe it can be the fungal population.  
**0:26:20-0:26:30:**  Maybe it's the fact that the roots of the trees are able to catch water even at 20,  
**0:26:30-0:26:33:**  30 or 40 meters deep.  
**0:26:33-0:26:48:**  So it can be, I would say, an ecological help to pump and to irrigate because you replace  
**0:26:48-0:26:53:**  simply a function which disappeared because of deforestation.  
**0:26:53-0:27:04:**  And in many, many environmentalist head, you have not to irrigate, you have not to do anything,  
**0:27:04-0:27:12:**  but it's not fair towards the nature because nature have many, many possibilities.  
**0:27:12-0:27:21:**  But of course, you deprive it of the means which it had before deforestation.  
**0:27:21-0:27:31:**  So it's a question of responsibility since you deprive this ecosystem from some means  
**0:27:31-0:27:35:**  and trees are so powerful means.  
**0:27:35-0:27:43:**  It's an obligation, a moral obligation to replace these functions which have been weakened.  
**0:27:43-0:27:46:**  You know, what I tell you is very important.  
**0:27:46-0:27:56:**  I think when you look at agrosystems with these eyes, you begin to think that maybe  
**0:27:56-0:28:02:**  glyphosate, for example, is perhaps not the main problem.  
**0:28:02-0:28:17:**  The main problem is perhaps the goats which heat the grass very short and you have sun-dried  
**0:28:17-0:28:29:**  pastures all over the summer while the trees are green in the forest, while these trees  
**0:28:29-0:28:35:**  are evaporating, they are giving back water in the atmosphere.  
**0:28:35-0:28:43:**  And I go beyond, I think I explain it in my book on the leaves, on the canopy, on the  
**0:28:43-0:28:44:**  phytoplhere.  
**0:28:44-0:28:56:**  There are millions and millions of small bacteria which are taken by the winds, the whirling  
**0:28:56-0:29:04:**  winds, you know, whenever there is a storm and then they go in the clouds.  
**0:29:04-0:29:15:**  And once these very small bacteria are in the clouds, they are the kernel of the future  
**0:29:15-0:29:17:**  drops of water.  
**0:29:17-0:29:26:**  That is to say the very small droplets of a stream, of the clouds, aggregate around  
**0:29:26-0:29:34:**  the bacteria and once the critical weight is reached, then the droplet falls.  
**0:29:34-0:29:41:**  But you need absolutely vegetation, canopy during the winter.  
**0:29:41-0:29:50:**  So an irrigated corn, even if it is irrigated, it can make sense, it can be ecological.  
**0:29:50-0:29:59:**  It can be ecological if you think only you restore the functions which have been weakened  
**0:29:59-0:30:01:**  by the deforestation.  
**0:30:01-0:30:08:**  It's certainly another view and I tell exactly the same about the sugar beads.  
**0:30:08-0:30:16:**  And for everybody, for everybody sugar bead, it's a sheet, you know, it's a sheet.  
**0:30:16-0:30:26:**  Basically it's the worst thing on the planet because it's industrial, but if I give you  
**0:30:26-0:30:38:**  another point of view, it's still more adapted to the change of the climate.  
**0:30:38-0:30:50:**  Just because this plant grows on two years, you know, the first year is for the root and  
**0:30:50-0:30:54:**  the second year it's flowers and it's for the seeds.  
**0:30:54-0:31:04:**  Under the first year, and that's what is interesting for the sugar bead grower, there is no key  
**0:31:04-0:31:12:**  stages for the sugar bead, that is to say, even if this plant is lacking water for two  
**0:31:12-0:31:15:**  months, it's not a problem.  
**0:31:15-0:31:19:**  Its potential is not at all damaged.  
**0:31:19-0:31:22:**  It's not damaged at all.  
**0:31:22-0:31:29:**  And when the rain comes back again, then the growth starts again.  
**0:31:29-0:31:41:**  And it's wonderful because it has a very, very deep rooting system first and it can  
**0:31:41-0:31:45:**  overcome a drought without any problem.  
**0:31:45-0:31:54:**  So when I hear organic winter wheat, it's wonderful, the solution, no, it's not true.  
**0:31:54-0:32:02:**  From an ecological point of view, it's crazy, absolutely crazy, because most winter wheat  
**0:32:02-0:32:14:**  takes absolutely, I would say, two herbicides at least between one and three fungicides  
**0:32:14-0:32:19:**  and some years, one insecticide.  
**0:32:19-0:32:20:**  Corn?  
**0:32:20-0:32:22:**  Nothing.  
**0:32:22-0:32:33:**  Only one or two herbicides, but no fungicide, no growth regulator, nothing else.  
**0:32:33-0:32:35:**  You understand what I mean?  
**0:32:35-0:32:43:**  So when I told you that I did not know what I was allowed and what I was forbidden to  
**0:32:43-0:32:48:**  think, that's the result of my free thinking.  
**0:32:48-0:32:53:**  Yeah, naturally, very interesting.  
**0:32:53-0:32:56:**  And I know that in the book you go in a lot more detail explaining all of these things  
**0:32:56-0:33:01:**  and it's worth it because you put lots of graphs and lots of illustrations as well to  
**0:33:01-0:33:05:**  assist us to understand in more detail what you mean there.  
**0:33:05-0:33:11:**  But for me, it makes me think of the idea that for farmers, it can be quite challenging  
**0:33:11-0:33:18:**  to have to manage their operations and on top of that, gain such an in-depth, holistic  
**0:33:18-0:33:24:**  understanding of all of the mineral flows, the water flows, the carbon cycle and everything.  
**0:33:24-0:33:32:**  How do you advise farmers to start to really gain a grasp of this reality without necessarily  
**0:33:32-0:33:34:**  having to depend on a consultant?  
**0:33:34-0:33:36:**  Is it even possible?  
**0:33:36-0:33:41:**  Oh, you are absolutely right.  
**0:33:41-0:33:50:**  It's not that simple and it can be challenging, of course, to face such a change.  
**0:33:50-0:34:00:**  My advice is to go from step to another step, just not to run any risk.  
**0:34:00-0:34:15:**  A farmer, of course, is also a manager of an industry, of a company.  
**0:34:15-0:34:21:**  He has liabilities, responsibilities towards his farm workers.  
**0:34:21-0:34:22:**  He has some.  
**0:34:22-0:34:26:**  He has his family, his wife, children.  
**0:34:26-0:34:31:**  We have also to pay for the studies of your children.  
**0:34:31-0:34:44:**  So of course, it can look like being very distant from agronomy, but you have to think  
**0:34:44-0:34:52:**  absolutely about all that when you give some advice because there are consequences behind.  
**0:34:52-0:34:58:**  So my advice is to go step after another step.  
**0:34:58-0:35:08:**  And my advice is first, have a look at your soil and look at it.  
**0:35:08-0:35:14:**  And the first thing to have a look at is the following one.  
**0:35:14-0:35:22:**  Is the surface still connected to the deep light layers?  
**0:35:22-0:35:31:**  For me, the best definition of a dead soil or of a dying soil is the fact that there  
**0:35:31-0:35:43:**  is really a border, a pan, a plough pan or a pan between the surface layers and the deep,  
**0:35:43-0:35:44:**  the bedrock.  
**0:35:44-0:35:49:**  You have absolutely to have a still communication in between.  
**0:35:49-0:35:54:**  And it's not very complicated to have a look at it.  
**0:35:54-0:36:02:**  But if there is a pan created by man, that is to say by farm equipment, only farm equipment  
**0:36:02-0:36:06:**  will solve it rapidly.  
**0:36:06-0:36:14:**  Otherwise you could have to wait, don't know, five years, 10 years, 20 years.  
**0:36:14-0:36:21:**  And if you let trees growing, otherwise it will never happen.  
**0:36:21-0:36:30:**  But you have a time enough to go bankrupt before the plants have solved the problem.  
**0:36:30-0:36:36:**  So I say, when I see that, I say it's the first step.  
**0:36:36-0:36:43:**  You have absolutely to reap, to subsoil your soil.  
**0:36:43-0:36:53:**  You have not to plough it again, but you have to subsoil it just to break this pan.  
**0:36:53-0:37:06:**  And so you have no longer wet soil after heavy rainfall, you know, and you have a storing  
**0:37:06-0:37:12:**  water in the deep layers and the roots can go immediately much, much deeper.  
**0:37:12-0:37:17:**  So it's really the first point, the first step to follow.  
**0:37:17-0:37:26:**  So even with my own company, Galago, which is a commercial company, we can call it commercial,  
**0:37:26-0:37:28:**  but it's my first advice.  
**0:37:28-0:37:34:**  I have nothing to sell, but I want absolutely my clients to be satisfied.  
**0:37:34-0:37:38:**  And the first economic step is the following one.  
**0:37:38-0:37:41:**  Yeah, is this one.  
**0:37:41-0:37:43:**  What is surprising?  
**0:37:43-0:37:45:**  I was myself surprised.  
**0:37:45-0:37:55:**  And I described in some papers, even in no-till situations with cover crops, you can find  
**0:37:55-0:38:04:**  very hard pans and sometimes which are still harder than plough pans.  
**0:38:04-0:38:16:**  Just because when you have too much moisture, water logging in the soil, then the minerals,  
**0:38:16-0:38:24:**  iron and manganese mainly are reduced, chemically reduced.  
**0:38:24-0:38:28:**  And then they are soluble, water soluble.  
**0:38:28-0:38:35:**  They go somewhat deeper and when they find oxygen again, they deposit, you know.  
**0:38:35-0:38:45:**  And so what was initially only a question of physics, that is to say a compacted layer  
**0:38:45-0:38:57:**  becomes a chemical layer, a chemical cement, you know, with a hyron and manganese as cement  
**0:38:57-0:39:04:**  between drains of sand, silts, loaves and clay, you know, and it becomes like rock.  
**0:39:04-0:39:10:**  And I found it even in these situations of no-till.  
**0:39:10-0:39:18:**  So the second point, it was the first, the second point, the chemical balance between  
**0:39:18-0:39:30:**  calcium and magnesium beyond the, just beyond the pH indicator.  
**0:39:30-0:39:38:**  These two minerals have a very, very strong action on the physics of the soil.  
**0:39:38-0:39:51:**  That is to say, in a nutshell, magnesium, it's a glue and calcium can aerate, give porosity.  
**0:39:51-0:39:55:**  But we have absolutely to get a balance in between.  
**0:39:55-0:40:02:**  That's why my pH, the pH for me is not an indicator.  
**0:40:02-0:40:11:**  Actually it can be very deceiving, you know, to follow only the pH.  
**0:40:11-0:40:21:**  The third step, you can believe me, when you already did that, you still, you already see  
**0:40:21-0:40:28:**  many, many bigger changes and you gain confidence in what you are doing.  
**0:40:28-0:40:38:**  And you know, by observation, but also instinctively that you run less and less risk if you go  
**0:40:38-0:40:39:**  further.  
**0:40:39-0:40:52:**  And then the third step, I absolutely advise the clients who are willing to do it, to use  
**0:40:52-0:40:59:**  one of my recipes, which is commercially called a natural gel.  
**0:40:59-0:41:08:**  It's, and I close, you know, the loop I opened a few minutes ago.  
**0:41:08-0:41:17:**  That is to say, we are lacking mushrooms, fangos, you know, the, this fungi with caps,  
**0:41:17-0:41:26:**  we lack them because they are pivotal, they are the masterpiece of soil biology.  
**0:41:26-0:41:35:**  And the good news in that the spores of mushrooms are very, very, very resistant.  
**0:41:35-0:41:44:**  Their half-life, if I can speak half-life about living organisms is decades, really  
**0:41:44-0:41:52:**  decades, because they are protected by melanin layer, you know, so they resist the microbial,  
**0:41:52-0:41:54:**  the bacterial attacks.  
**0:41:54-0:42:00:**  And even if you don't see them, they are still dormant sport.  
**0:42:00-0:42:07:**  So what I want to do is to wake them up so that they can do their job.  
**0:42:07-0:42:16:**  I will come, if you are willing, of the advantages of waking them up because it has something  
**0:42:16-0:42:20:**  to do with agroforestry, with agro systems and so on.  
**0:42:20-0:42:22:**  Please go ahead.  
**0:42:22-0:42:23:**  You don't even need to wait for me.  
**0:42:23-0:42:25:**  Go ahead.  
**0:42:25-0:42:28:**  Okay.  
**0:42:28-0:42:37:**  So the main advantages, I give just some advantages of waking up the mushrooms.  
**0:42:37-0:42:45:**  They store much more efficiently than anything else on earth, the carbon.  
**0:42:45-0:42:54:**  They are able to store carbon with an efficiency, which you will never find anywhere else.  
**0:42:54-0:43:06:**  That is to say, to put it in a few words, when they intake, when they take in carbon,  
**0:43:06-0:43:20:**  they breath out only 50% of the carbon under the C2 form, you know, the oxygen carbon.  
**0:43:20-0:43:26:**  And in the area, they breath out up to 85%.  
**0:43:26-0:43:35:**  So if you want to store carbon, that is to say for a farmer to make humus, carbon is,  
**0:43:35-0:43:40:**  you know, adjusted for administration, for authorities, or to get the credits, carbon  
**0:43:40-0:43:41:**  credits.  
**0:43:41-0:43:46:**  But carbon for a farmer, it's humus, it's life.  
**0:43:46-0:43:54:**  So if you want life, you need fungal population.  
**0:43:54-0:44:11:**  And if I just describe one or two more advantages, they produce glomalin and oxalic acids in  
**0:44:11-0:44:27:**  huge quantities, glomalin is so recalcitrant to decay that it can last up to 40, 50 years,  
**0:44:27-0:44:31:**  40, 50 years for half life.  
**0:44:31-0:44:42:**  You imagine the store, the carbon which was stored by fungi today will be decayed, used  
**0:44:42-0:44:49:**  for only 50% in 2017.  
**0:44:49-0:44:52:**  I will be dead.  
**0:44:52-0:44:59:**  So imagine it's very, very efficient.  
**0:44:59-0:45:07:**  And you have also a stability, that is to say, through the miscellium and glomalin,  
**0:45:07-0:45:17:**  which are soft glues, they are able to resist erosion, wind erosion, water erosion, very,  
**0:45:17-0:45:18:**  very efficiently.  
**0:45:18-0:45:27:**  I have many, many, many examples of people who used my solutions with the slopes and  
**0:45:27-0:45:34:**  even in the same conditions, that is to say the same crop rotation, the same fertilizer  
**0:45:34-0:45:41:**  and so on and so on, the main species, winter wheat and so on, after a heavy rainfall, then  
**0:45:41-0:45:51:**  you have big ridges with the neighbors when it crosses the field of my clients, no ridges  
**0:45:51-0:45:52:**  at all.  
**0:45:52-0:45:59:**  That is to say, there was such a rainfall that it flowed over the field, but without  
**0:45:59-0:46:06:**  carrying anything, without taking anything from the field itself.  
**0:46:06-0:46:12:**  It goes out from the field of our clients, then again the ridges.  
**0:46:12-0:46:15:**  It's absolutely incredible.  
**0:46:15-0:46:18:**  So that's what is important.  
**0:46:18-0:46:27:**  It was a third step only and I have 55 steps.  
**0:46:27-0:46:32:**  We maybe will have to stop there.  
**0:46:32-0:46:35:**  Go ahead.  
**0:46:35-0:46:42:**  So the fourth step, we have to take care of the seeds.  
**0:46:42-0:46:50:**  Once you have looked at your soil, you have absolutely to take care of the seeds because  
**0:46:50-0:46:55:**  that's where everything is initiated.  
**0:46:55-0:46:57:**  That's where everything begins.  
**0:46:57-0:47:11:**  That is to say, it's like a children which was born with the microbiology of his or her  
**0:47:11-0:47:12:**  mother.  
**0:47:12-0:47:24:**  This microbiology is inside the intestines up to his death unless you take too many antibiotics  
**0:47:24-0:47:26:**  during your life.  
**0:47:26-0:47:37:**  Otherwise, your mother gave you health, transmitted to you health.  
**0:47:37-0:47:41:**  The seeds are not sterile.  
**0:47:41-0:47:48:**  They bear many, many, many bacteria, fungal spores and so on.  
**0:47:48-0:47:57:**  So they deserve much more than only receiving fungicides and insecticides.  
**0:47:57-0:47:59:**  And that's what I do.  
**0:47:59-0:48:09:**  Of course, fusarium does exist.  
**0:48:09-0:48:19:**  The smut, you know, in French, the smut does exist.  
**0:48:19-0:48:30:**  But we can counteract their action only with some organic molecules and trace elements  
**0:48:30-0:48:41:**  and to favor the beneficial microorganisms which are already on the seeds on my own observation.  
**0:48:41-0:48:53:**  When you do it, you can create such a beneficial environment in the spermosphere.  
**0:48:53-0:49:02:**  That is to say, the young rhizosphere, you know, when you have only a small sprout around  
**0:49:02-0:49:06:**  the seed, then everything begins.  
**0:49:06-0:49:18:**  And the microbiology which is there at the starting point will go ahead with the crops  
**0:49:18-0:49:19:**  up to the harvest.  
**0:49:19-0:49:31:**  And I already saw stubbles, you know, which had a completely different color when treated  
**0:49:31-0:49:34:**  this way or not.  
**0:49:34-0:49:44:**  Gray with fungicides and perfectly bright yellow when you respected the original microbiology  
**0:49:44-0:49:46:**  which is around the seed.  
**0:49:46-0:49:58:**  And then, and I will go rapidly because I don't want to be too long, but I will try  
**0:49:58-0:50:06:**  to give some help to the plant, to the crops whenever there are some stresses.  
**0:50:06-0:50:18:**  It can be hail, for example, it can be hail or heat or frost and so on.  
**0:50:18-0:50:24:**  That is to say the habiotic stresses.  
**0:50:24-0:50:34:**  You have some biotic stresses, including the biotic stresses due to the physiology itself  
**0:50:34-0:50:41:**  of the plant, that is to say, when the seed, you know, the seed of corn, for example, is  
**0:50:41-0:50:51:**  empty, then the plant is weaned, sevret, weaning.  
**0:50:51-0:50:55:**  I think weaned is the right word in English.  
**0:50:55-0:51:05:**  That is to say the seed is empty and there is nothing more to give to the plant itself.  
**0:51:05-0:51:14:**  So it has to be self-sufficient, you know, and the plant has to live absolutely 100%  
**0:51:14-0:51:18:**  through the uptake of its roots.  
**0:51:18-0:51:27:**  At this time, sometimes it makes sense to help it and just to end the steps, we see  
**0:51:27-0:51:39:**  if we took care of all these one, first, second, third, fourth steps, then the diseases, the  
**0:51:39-0:51:44:**  insects are much more violent.  
**0:51:44-0:51:51:**  They are much weaker, they are easy to master, to harness.  
**0:51:51-0:51:58:**  And then only some biocontrol products work in this situation.  
**0:51:58-0:51:59:**  It does work.  
**0:51:59-0:52:12:**  Of course, if the agro system, the soil is unbalanced, you absolutely need modern, useful,  
**0:52:12-0:52:22:**  efficient, but also dangerous fungicides.  
**0:52:22-0:52:32:**  On this last point, I take care also of all the microflora, which is on the leaves, on  
**0:52:32-0:52:36:**  the canopy, on the stems.  
**0:52:36-0:52:43:**  At the beginning of our conversation, I told you there are billions and billions and billions  
**0:52:43-0:52:49:**  of bacteria on leaves and some are very useful.  
**0:52:49-0:52:52:**  Very naturally, for example, you have yeasts.  
**0:52:52-0:52:58:**  That is to say saccharomyces cerevisiae, you know, yeasts.  
**0:52:58-0:53:10:**  And if you take care of them, first, they don't leave much room for pathogens, for airborne  
**0:53:10-0:53:11:**  pathogens.  
**0:53:11-0:53:17:**  They consume, they feed on leaves exudates.  
**0:53:17-0:53:25:**  So there is a food competition, you know, between good and bad guys.  
**0:53:25-0:53:28:**  And they win it.  
**0:53:28-0:53:38:**  For most yeasts, for example, they exudate also antibiotics, they exudate molecules which  
**0:53:38-0:53:47:**  help the crops to resist everything which could damage it.  
**0:53:47-0:53:51:**  So it's the last point.  
**0:53:51-0:53:54:**  What is tricky, you know, of course.  
**0:53:54-0:54:04:**  For those who are selling biosolutions, they immediately think of diseases, of insects,  
**0:54:04-0:54:13:**  and they propose, you know, a natural enemy, natural foe, an enemy of such and such parasite  
**0:54:13-0:54:15:**  to sell it.  
**0:54:15-0:54:26:**  They don't think of health, you are first to build a good, strong, deep rooting system,  
**0:54:26-0:54:36:**  a soil, a living soil, a good and balanced nutrition of the plant before thinking of  
**0:54:36-0:54:43:**  striking against insects and fungi, fungal pathogens and so on.  
**0:54:43-0:54:54:**  And when you do it, then the farmer, the producer is more and more conscious that he can go  
**0:54:54-0:54:59:**  further without running any risk.  
**0:54:59-0:55:08:**  And it was rather long, what I explained, but I could not give you only the titles.  
**0:55:08-0:55:16:**  I had absolutely to go more in detail for you and those who could listen what I told  
**0:55:16-0:55:20:**  to understand all that.  
**0:55:20-0:55:29:**  But when they see that they can go further without running any risk, really, they cross  
**0:55:29-0:55:38:**  this apparently dangerous border from one step to another one, to another one, and then  
**0:55:38-0:55:40:**  to end.  
**0:55:40-0:55:44:**  Don't begin by the end of the story.  
**0:55:44-0:55:48:**  Don't begin by bio fungicides.  
**0:55:48-0:55:50:**  Very bad idea.  
**0:55:50-0:55:52:**  Very bad idea.  
**0:55:52-0:55:54:**  Begin by your soil.  
**0:55:54-0:55:55:**  Very interesting.  
**0:55:55-0:55:56:**  Was it clear, Dimitri?  
**0:55:56-0:56:05:**  Yeah, I mean, for me, it's always important to complete the idea in the picture and we're  
**0:56:05-0:56:10:**  discussing very complex, holistic type thinking.  
**0:56:10-0:56:16:**  And so it's also very encouraging to hear these things from a person that has the experience  
**0:56:16-0:56:18:**  that you have and that worked with so many farmers.  
**0:56:18-0:56:21:**  So there's encouraging solutions out there.  
**0:56:21-0:56:30:**  But linking things back a bit to agroforestry, I'm curious to know for you, what is the role  
**0:56:30-0:56:33:**  of the tree on the farm?  
**0:56:33-0:56:37:**  Before we start going into the challenges associated with it, just from an agronomical  
**0:56:37-0:56:43:**  perspective, what can the tree provide to us and how can it help complete and meet some  
**0:56:43-0:56:48:**  of our ecological objectives to create a sustainable agriculture?  
**0:56:48-0:57:04:**  Oh, agroforestry for me is very relevant for the new challenges, is very useful and for  
**0:57:04-0:57:06:**  at least two main reasons.  
**0:57:06-0:57:10:**  If you want, I can find other reasons.  
**0:57:10-0:57:12:**  But the first...  
**0:57:12-0:57:17:**  55 other reasons.  
**0:57:17-0:57:22:**  I can find 100, I think.  
**0:57:22-0:57:35:**  The first reason, I would say, if you want to draw many benefits from agroforestry, I  
**0:57:35-0:57:42:**  would say is not only mathematics, it's also quality.  
**0:57:42-0:57:53:**  I already thought when you have a century, one century or centuries old tree, you can  
**0:57:53-0:58:01:**  be sure this tree met already many, many, many challenges.  
**0:58:01-0:58:13:**  Insects, diseases, drought, wet storms, everything God can offer to us.  
**0:58:13-0:58:16:**  And he survived.  
**0:58:16-0:58:19:**  Why did he survive?  
**0:58:19-0:58:27:**  Certainly because he developed himself some mechanisms.  
**0:58:27-0:58:40:**  And in many, many occasions with the help of some auxiliaries, insects, fungi and so  
**0:58:40-0:58:41:**  on.  
**0:58:41-0:58:52:**  So when you leave it, at least I would say some islands, oasis of these trees, you are  
**0:58:52-0:59:04:**  absolutely sure to get on your farm a library of the best of what can be done by nature  
**0:59:04-0:59:08:**  to protect your farm.  
**0:59:08-0:59:15:**  So don't think about how many cubic meters is this tree.  
**0:59:15-0:59:22:**  It is so many hundred or thousand euros worth.  
**0:59:22-0:59:28:**  So it makes sense to cut it, to plant again new, young trees and so on.  
**0:59:28-0:59:31:**  No bad calculation.  
**0:59:31-0:59:37:**  You absolutely to keep your libraries on your farm.  
**0:59:37-0:59:51:**  From point, second advantages, you are absolutely sure that from point to point, you have at  
**0:59:51-1:00:04:**  least a huge, I will call it a pit, you know, which connects the surface with the bedrock.  
**1:00:04-1:00:10:**  And so there are still exchanges of minerals and so on.  
**1:00:10-1:00:21:**  And the way I would say a motorway to drive waters deep into the bedrock.  
**1:00:21-1:00:34:**  So you are absolutely sure that at some places in your fields, on your farm, you have this  
**1:00:34-1:00:38:**  connection, which is absolutely essential.  
**1:00:38-1:00:49:**  Without life, without trees, these poles, these channels will be rapidly filled and  
**1:00:49-1:00:58:**  so closed and then everything is over, game over.  
**1:00:58-1:01:09:**  And for example, the calcium, which is in the soil, can easily be transformed very rapidly  
**1:01:09-1:01:23:**  into calcium carbonate, calcite, you know, and it is really perfectly, how do you say,  
**1:01:23-1:01:33:**  perfectly, closely uncrossable sealed.  
**1:01:33-1:01:38:**  So it's the second advantage.  
**1:01:38-1:01:41:**  I would say, may I add a third point?  
**1:01:41-1:01:48:**  I said two points.  
**1:01:48-1:02:05:**  From a diagram point of view, we hear so often, you know, in French, I think in English, it's  
**1:02:05-1:02:19:**  rameo, chipped wood, I think the right wording, R-C-Y, if I remember well.  
**1:02:19-1:02:31:**  Of course, it can be these trees on the farm, can be a source of wood chips.  
**1:02:31-1:02:41:**  If you want to favor the fungal populations, if you want to favor the mushrooms, you absolutely  
**1:02:41-1:02:52:**  to put again lignin, recalcitrant tissues in the agro system, because only the mushrooms  
**1:02:52-1:03:03:**  are able to decay, to heat, and to break the bonds of the lignin, because they are equipped  
**1:03:03-1:03:06:**  with the right enzymes.  
**1:03:06-1:03:09:**  Bacteria have not.  
**1:03:09-1:03:16:**  Bacteria can break cellulose, but not lignin.  
**1:03:16-1:03:20:**  They break cellulose in the goat's rumen, you know.  
**1:03:20-1:03:25:**  They are perfectly able to do it, but not the lignin.  
**1:03:25-1:03:36:**  So you give an advantage, a competitive advantage to the fungal populations if you spread lignin,  
**1:03:36-1:03:41:**  if you spread wood chips on your soil.  
**1:03:41-1:03:51:**  And it's also a way combined with my recipe which wakes up the fungal spores, it's a way  
**1:03:51-1:03:58:**  also to maintain a minimum population on the soil.  
**1:03:58-1:04:12:**  Of course, what is called the white wood are slightly more efficient, that is to say those  
**1:04:12-1:04:23:**  who contain too much tannins like oak, for example, they are not that good immediately,  
**1:04:23-1:04:33:**  that is to say it takes time for biology to decay and to really make good use of these  
**1:04:33-1:04:38:**  very hard and resistant wood species.  
**1:04:38-1:04:49:**  So my advice would be to use poplars, for example, all these white helms, all these  
**1:04:49-1:04:54:**  white wood trees.  
**1:04:54-1:04:57:**  Does it answer your questions?  
**1:04:57-1:05:01:**  Definitely, yeah for sure.  
**1:05:01-1:05:06:**  I'm thinking a lot about some of the things you're talking about in your book where you're  
**1:05:06-1:05:11:**  linking also, as you mentioned before, the importance of being able to favour the fungal  
**1:05:11-1:05:18:**  populations in order to store the humus, to be able to store carbon in the soil long term  
**1:05:18-1:05:22:**  with all of its fertility benefits.  
**1:05:22-1:05:27:**  And also one of the things that is talked about a lot, at least in French agronomy,  
**1:05:27-1:05:32:**  there's a lot of talk about it, is the rations du sol, and it's about bringing in that organic  
**1:05:32-1:05:40:**  matter, enough organic matter per year in order to keep going, to keep the engine, the  
**1:05:40-1:05:48:**  micro biological engine running in order to supply the health and the vital functions  
**1:05:48-1:05:49:**  of the system.  
**1:05:49-1:05:58:**  To what extent do you think this type of RAMUEL chipped wood system could be used in this?  
**1:05:58-1:06:03:**  How does it fit into the agro-cological transition of our farms?  
**1:06:03-1:06:07:**  Yes, of course.  
**1:06:07-1:06:16:**  It makes sense to give food, feed to the soil biology.  
**1:06:16-1:06:20:**  I would sum up here this way.  
**1:06:20-1:06:30:**  If you have cattle, if you have cows or goats, it's as if you decided to give them only minerals,  
**1:06:30-1:06:41:**  but no more hay, no more corn silage, no soy, no pellets, nothing else than minerals.  
**1:06:41-1:06:51:**  And sometimes in our crop rotations, we give only NPK, ammonitrate and so on.  
**1:06:51-1:06:53:**  So it's not enough.  
**1:06:53-1:06:59:**  Of course, there remains some roots.  
**1:06:59-1:07:09:**  We don't harvest the roots, except for some crops, but we don't harvest the roots.  
**1:07:09-1:07:11:**  So there is something remaining.  
**1:07:11-1:07:29:**  But the advantage at least of the RAMUEL chipped wood is that it's another kind of food, of  
**1:07:29-1:07:31:**  feed.  
**1:07:31-1:07:41:**  That is to say, what we give back to the soil oftentimes is too soluble, too digestible,  
**1:07:41-1:07:45:**  too quick, too fast.  
**1:07:45-1:07:47:**  It's fast food.  
**1:07:47-1:07:57:**  So for our soils, we need slow food, absolutely slow food.  
**1:07:57-1:08:06:**  I come back to the pseudo solution behind the cover crops.  
**1:08:06-1:08:14:**  Oftentimes it is destroyed before maturity, when they are still young.  
**1:08:14-1:08:25:**  That is to say, you give back to your soil a diet for pigs or for hens.  
**1:08:25-1:08:28:**  It's too fast, too quick.  
**1:08:28-1:08:31:**  You have no recalcitrant molecules.  
**1:08:31-1:08:37:**  You feed only bacteria, not the fungal population.  
**1:08:37-1:08:45:**  So of course, with the cover crops, you have advantages such as the protection against  
**1:08:45-1:08:46:**  erosion.  
**1:08:46-1:08:48:**  That's absolutely true.  
**1:08:48-1:08:58:**  You are able to take up the nitrates, which were leaching in the subsoil and so on.  
**1:08:58-1:09:01:**  These advantages are absolutely true.  
**1:09:01-1:09:06:**  But it's not a balanced diet nevertheless.  
**1:09:06-1:09:22:**  In nature, nothing, nothing is left on the soil without being either mature, really mature,  
**1:09:22-1:09:30:**  or digested by browsing animals like cows or goats.  
**1:09:30-1:09:33:**  It doesn't exist.  
**1:09:33-1:09:37:**  But man invented it, this way of doing.  
**1:09:37-1:09:53:**  Man is very strong, intelligent, but he lacks modesty.  
**1:09:53-1:10:00:**  When you reminded me of a diet, I spoke about a diet for the soil.  
**1:10:00-1:10:03:**  That's absolutely true.  
**1:10:03-1:10:09:**  We have to think of a balanced diet to the soil.  
**1:10:09-1:10:22:**  If you give only greens, only salad, I call it salad to the soil, then of course there  
**1:10:22-1:10:25:**  is a microbiology which will adapt.  
**1:10:25-1:10:35:**  But it will not be necessarily the microbiology which is able to store carbon to make long-living  
**1:10:35-1:10:40:**  humus for decades and decades.  
**1:10:40-1:10:42:**  Absolutely not true.  
**1:10:42-1:10:45:**  We have absolutely to think of it.  
**1:10:45-1:10:51:**  It's not only a calculation, inputs, outputs.  
**1:10:51-1:11:06:**  I know farmers who do this, the wheat straw or the barley or oats straw has value in some  
**1:11:06-1:11:08:**  areas in France.  
**1:11:08-1:11:18:**  So they sell it and they sow a cover crop and they say, no problem, I replace the carbon  
**1:11:18-1:11:24:**  I sold by the carbon which is in the cover crops.  
**1:11:24-1:11:30:**  Very very bad calculations because it's not the same carbon, it's not the same sugars.  
**1:11:30-1:11:37:**  I will just take a striking example.  
**1:11:37-1:11:58:**  There are sometimes in some places where you have a tea, in a tea room and so on, those  
**1:11:58-1:12:09:**  small tips, wood sticks with sugar at the other.  
**1:12:09-1:12:22:**  So you see that you can move your tea and stir your tea and so on to sweet it.  
**1:12:22-1:12:29:**  So you mix everything just to give you an idea.  
**1:12:29-1:12:40:**  This sugar and the wooden stick have exactly the same CN ratio, carbon nitrogen ratio.  
**1:12:40-1:12:52:**  That is to say 50% pure carbon for each sugar and the wooden stick.  
**1:12:52-1:13:03:**  We have very very little percentage of protein inside.  
**1:13:03-1:13:15:**  Of course, so the CN ratio is around one for 2000 you imagine, it's nothing.  
**1:13:15-1:13:24:**  So the calculation, you see the comparison between the straw and the cover crop, it's  
**1:13:24-1:13:26:**  the same.  
**1:13:26-1:13:35:**  You say oh it's carbon and carbon, okay, but really the sugar and the wood have not the  
**1:13:35-1:13:38:**  same taste.  
**1:13:38-1:13:42:**  The taste, it doesn't taste the same.  
**1:13:42-1:13:47:**  And the bacteria, do you imagine, and the microbiology, it will not be the same which  
**1:13:47-1:13:52:**  will take care of the sugar and the wooden stick.  
**1:13:52-1:14:02:**  So this pure administrative calculation with an Excel, an informative tool that is completely  
**1:14:02-1:14:03:**  deceiving.  
**1:14:03-1:14:12:**  I tell, yes, you have to take care of the diet of your soil and don't make any confusion  
**1:14:12-1:14:16:**  between different sugars.  
**1:14:16-1:14:23:**  There are very very very long chains on one side and very short chains on the other side  
**1:14:23-1:14:28:**  and the result will not be the same.  
**1:14:28-1:14:41:**  So the Ramiol chipped wood really brings the second type of carbon.  
**1:14:41-1:14:52:**  This one which will definitely favor the fungal population and thanks to this type of long  
**1:14:52-1:15:00:**  chain carbon, the agro system will be able to make long lasting humus.  
**1:15:00-1:15:06:**  It will be my conclusion on this topic.  
**1:15:06-1:15:07:**  Was it clear enough?  
**1:15:07-1:15:14:**  Yeah, no, definitely it was very clear and I just feel like maybe some of the people  
**1:15:14-1:15:21:**  hearing this might think, yes, but I can also achieve similar results with, for example,  
**1:15:21-1:15:25:**  certain types of cover crops or leaving the cover crops mature.  
**1:15:25-1:15:26:**  Is that true?  
**1:15:26-1:15:31:**  I mean, I'm just questioning sometimes if we really need to have the trees everywhere,  
**1:15:31-1:15:37:**  if we really need to be doing Ramiol wood chips with our trees, also to try and see  
**1:15:37-1:15:42:**  the other side of agroforestry, because it does require a big change in our practices.  
**1:15:42-1:15:48:**  It requires a big change also in the economic or in the business plan of the farm.  
**1:15:48-1:15:53:**  So I'm just wondering, can we still achieve our agro-cological objectives without the  
**1:15:53-1:15:57:**  tree?  
**1:15:57-1:16:11:**  Yes, of course, we can have this salt and it makes sense also.  
**1:16:11-1:16:16:**  And I think we can, we can absolutely.  
**1:16:16-1:16:23:**  But then the objective will not be the same about the cover crops.  
**1:16:23-1:16:32:**  So first, the main crop itself, you have to keep the crop residues which are mature, the  
**1:16:32-1:16:39:**  stalks, the stalks, the corn stalks and so on.  
**1:16:39-1:16:48:**  You have to keep them, don't sell them, don't try to make money, I don't know, with all  
**1:16:48-1:16:51:**  these crop residues, keep them.  
**1:16:51-1:16:57:**  They have more value than only the P and the K they hold.  
**1:16:57-1:17:03:**  They have a much more value than these only two minerals.  
**1:17:03-1:17:05:**  It's the first point.  
**1:17:05-1:17:13:**  Secondly, we can still go further, but considering the cover crops quite differently, that's  
**1:17:13-1:17:17:**  what I did on my own farm.  
**1:17:17-1:17:25:**  What I thought was not to produce as much biomass as possible, but I looked very much  
**1:17:25-1:17:29:**  at the time I had before the next crop.  
**1:17:29-1:17:42:**  And I just looked at this time and then decided which cover crop could go mature, reach the  
**1:17:42-1:17:57:**  maturity before I had absolutely to destroy it, to chop it or to spray it with glyphosate.  
**1:17:57-1:18:06:**  I tried not to use glyphosate, but sometimes when necessary, I used it.  
**1:18:06-1:18:13:**  Okay, I closed the bracket.  
**1:18:13-1:18:21:**  So the main indicator is not how much, but which maturity on which quality I will be  
**1:18:21-1:18:26:**  able to reach before the next crop.  
**1:18:26-1:18:34:**  And then I will make everything possible so that the fungal population is there.  
**1:18:34-1:18:39:**  I have just to add this because it's so important.  
**1:18:39-1:18:50:**  So many people, so many farmers fear there is an hunger for nitrogen if the cover crop  
**1:18:50-1:18:58:**  is too mature that they say, oh, the CEN ratio is now 30 or 40.  
**1:18:58-1:19:02:**  I have absolutely to chop it to hold it.  
**1:19:02-1:19:12:**  We have this hunger only because there are no longer mushrooms in the soils.  
**1:19:12-1:19:16:**  Just think of it.  
**1:19:16-1:19:25:**  In the forest, you have trunks, you know, oak trunks and so on, which are fallen on  
**1:19:25-1:19:27:**  the soil.  
**1:19:27-1:19:31:**  No need, no hunger for nitrogen.  
**1:19:31-1:19:33:**  Nothing.  
**1:19:33-1:19:43:**  You have a small shrubs, you have a small plants all around the trunks and the leaves  
**1:19:43-1:19:45:**  there and the branches.  
**1:19:45-1:19:48:**  No hunger for nitrogen, no hunger.  
**1:19:48-1:19:49:**  Why?  
**1:19:49-1:19:52:**  Because the fungal population is there.  
**1:19:52-1:20:02:**  And the fungi are absolutely wonderful because they are able to thrive on needles, on gross  
**1:20:02-1:20:15:**  needles with CEN ratio of up to 4,000.  
**1:20:15-1:20:22:**  That is to say one part nitrogen for 4,000 part carbon.  
**1:20:22-1:20:26:**  And why are they able to do it?  
**1:20:26-1:20:36:**  Just because they have mycelium, because they transport, they carry nitrogen from their  
**1:20:36-1:20:43:**  dead tissues towards the new cells of the myceliums.  
**1:20:43-1:20:49:**  So they recycle it regularly.  
**1:20:49-1:20:53:**  So they are not in competition with crops to do it.  
**1:20:53-1:20:59:**  Whereas bacteria needs absolutely natural nitrogen.  
**1:20:59-1:21:07:**  But it is not able to transfer it to its colleagues, to the other bacteria.  
**1:21:07-1:21:17:**  And they have such a powerful metabolism that they deprive the crops from the nitrogen.  
**1:21:17-1:21:25:**  So it's not an hunger for nitrogen, it's an hunger for mushrooms, what we observe.  
**1:21:25-1:21:35:**  So we can absolutely do a very, very good job without wood chips if we take care of  
**1:21:35-1:21:43:**  the maturity of cover crops and we take care of, of course, not to spray too many fungicides  
**1:21:43-1:21:45:**  in the fields.  
**1:21:45-1:21:56:**  Of course, fungicides kill fungi, mushrooms.  
**1:21:56-1:22:07:**  If the straw is full, the wheat straw is full of fungicides, of course, only slowly the  
**1:22:07-1:22:10:**  bacteria will be able to do the job.  
**1:22:10-1:22:14:**  So there is a competition with crops and so on and so on.  
**1:22:14-1:22:20:**  And of course, it's a vicious circle, you know.  
**1:22:20-1:22:30:**  My advice is always, I tell all my clients, please, if you could not to spray the last  
**1:22:30-1:22:36:**  fungicide on your weeds, barley and so on, it would be wonderful.  
**1:22:36-1:22:43:**  It's still acceptable for the first or the second spray, but the last is absolutely a  
**1:22:43-1:22:55:**  disaster because we have, of course, many residues in the straw, fungicide residues.  
**1:22:55-1:23:02:**  And so the fungal population can't do its job properly.  
**1:23:02-1:23:09:**  So that was my short answer to your long question.  
**1:23:09-1:23:16:**  No, I think, you know, I don't want to take much more of your time.  
**1:23:16-1:23:22:**  We could keep discussing these issues and break things down much more.  
**1:23:22-1:23:30:**  And you know, as a concluding remark, I think it's interesting to observe the natural ecosystems  
**1:23:30-1:23:37:**  and to understand, you know, when the trees have got the leaves out, when they are harvesting  
**1:23:37-1:23:42:**  the mineralization that's happening during the summer, what they're doing with that biomass,  
**1:23:42-1:23:47:**  you know, they're producing lignin and the same thing with the grasslands as well, the  
**1:23:47-1:23:52:**  perennial grasslands, which is where our ecosystems always tend towards perennity.  
**1:23:52-1:23:58:**  And also, you know, they are producing lignin, they are producing or at least cellulose and  
**1:23:58-1:24:03:**  complex carbon molecules that are difficult to break down, favoring a fungal life.  
**1:24:03-1:24:09:**  And so, you know, it's interesting to see that you've been able on your operation and  
**1:24:09-1:24:15:**  through your clients and your company as well to be practicing biomimicry.  
**1:24:15-1:24:19:**  So yeah, I really appreciated the conversation.  
**1:24:19-1:24:21:**  It was really interesting.  
**1:24:21-1:24:33:**  And with the wood behind you, it's a really pleasure to speak about lignin.  
**1:24:33-1:24:43:**  Thank you so much for listening.

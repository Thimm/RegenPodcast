### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Wed, 02 Mar 2022 16:51:18)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:46:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:46-0:00:49:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:49-0:00:56:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we interviewed Fede Ricosan Bonifacio from Northern Italy.  
**0:00:56-0:01:02:**  Fede has a 30 hectare farm in the north of Italy that he inherited from his family and  
**0:01:02-0:01:09:**  inspired by the very barren monocrop fields around him, he started thinking about planting  
**0:01:09-0:01:16:**  trees and started thinking about an alternative land use for his farm.  
**0:01:16-0:01:22:**  So he now is certified organic, has planted hedges all over his fields and has also been  
**0:01:22-0:01:28:**  implementing five hectares of polycyclic forestry in collaboration with the research institute  
**0:01:28-0:01:29:**  that studies just this.  
**0:01:29-0:01:35:**  So maybe it's not familiar with many people and we'll hear more about it in the interview.  
**0:01:35-0:01:42:**  But it's again very interesting to see how a farmer, a small scale farmer is using forestry,  
**0:01:42-0:01:48:**  farm forestry and using trees, hedges to be able to meet their agroecological objectives.  
**0:01:48-0:01:53:**  So for us it was a fascinating interview and I hope you enjoy it as well.  
**0:01:53-0:01:55:**  Hi Fede and welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:55-0:01:59:**  Hello, hello Ciao Dimitri.  
**0:01:59-0:02:07:**  Nice, so before we started I was looking at pictures from your farm when we visited and  
**0:02:07-0:02:12:**  I actually show these pictures to quite a lot of people and they never believe how quickly  
**0:02:12-0:02:13:**  your trees are growing.  
**0:02:13-0:02:14:**  Yeah, that's true.  
**0:02:14-0:02:16:**  They always tell me that's not true, it's not possible.  
**0:02:16-0:02:20:**  It's not possible to have a poplar this big in 10 years.  
**0:02:20-0:02:29:**  Me too, I'm still wonder by the speed of the tree.  
**0:02:29-0:02:33:**  They grow really fast in this area.  
**0:02:33-0:02:39:**  Yeah I'm going to share some of these pictures when we talk about our episode together on  
**0:02:39-0:02:44:**  our social media because I think people need to see these huge poplar trees and after they've  
**0:02:44-0:02:47:**  listened to the interview they'll know the story behind stuff.  
**0:02:47-0:02:53:**  I've got a nice picture with my hand on one of the poplar trees and it just looks massive.  
**0:02:53-0:02:58:**  But you know I'm curious because we didn't get to, as I said earlier, we didn't get to  
**0:02:58-0:03:04:**  talk about this when I came to visit so much because there were many people and etc.  
**0:03:04-0:03:07:**  I'd love to know a bit more about your story.  
**0:03:07-0:03:09:**  Yes, yes, yes.  
**0:03:09-0:03:15:**  I started farming in a family farm so actually I was really lucky because I had the chance  
**0:03:15-0:03:22:**  to start managing a farm and managing my family farm.  
**0:03:22-0:03:30:**  Me have three brothers and the farm is from my father.  
**0:03:30-0:03:32:**  I have a background in biology.  
**0:03:32-0:03:39:**  At the beginning I didn't, it was always in my mind but it never really focused on doing  
**0:03:39-0:03:41:**  my university studies.  
**0:03:41-0:03:53:**  I studied biology and then gradually it came into my mind that that was my work, my deal  
**0:03:53-0:03:59:**  to take care about this land that was originally, when I was young, was run as a conventional  
**0:03:59-0:04:03:**  farm.  
**0:04:03-0:04:13:**  It's about 30 hectares in the middle of the plain in the south of Verona in Italy.  
**0:04:13-0:04:15:**  And so that's how it started.  
**0:04:15-0:04:24:**  So with the intention of taking care about the land I had the chance to manage.  
**0:04:24-0:04:34:**  And during my studies I gradually discovered all the application of different disciplines  
**0:04:34-0:04:41:**  around ecology and of course, agroecology and the plantation of tree was one of the  
**0:04:41-0:04:46:**  first elements and steps to start.  
**0:04:46-0:04:52:**  Because you have to think my land when I took it was completely deforested of course because  
**0:04:52-0:04:55:**  it was a conventional farming.  
**0:04:55-0:05:05:**  Every piece of land was overexploited and of course using chemical and so on.  
**0:05:05-0:05:09:**  And so I had, and moreover it's a plain land.  
**0:05:09-0:05:18:**  So I had, you can imagine I had a blank sheet where I should draw, where I had to draw the  
**0:05:18-0:05:20:**  design of the farm.  
**0:05:20-0:05:26:**  And I had just a couple of rows within the middle of the land.  
**0:05:26-0:05:33:**  And so I started, and that's I think one of the best choice so far of the farm is the  
**0:05:33-0:05:35:**  plantation of trees.  
**0:05:35-0:05:44:**  And we decided to do it on the edge of the, on the marginal area of the farm that are  
**0:05:44-0:05:54:**  actually the farm is developed on 800 meters almost length and it's less wider.  
**0:05:54-0:06:00:**  So in the north side, north south direction this 800 meters.  
**0:06:00-0:06:02:**  So it's a strip you mean?  
**0:06:02-0:06:04:**  Yeah it's a big strip.  
**0:06:04-0:06:13:**  Yeah north south and I decided to use the north side and the south side for making the  
**0:06:13-0:06:14:**  forest.  
**0:06:14-0:06:24:**  Yeah a polycyclic forest replantation in both sides north and south.  
**0:06:24-0:06:34:**  And we decided to join this forest with some double edge lines of edge of edges of the  
**0:06:34-0:06:36:**  trees.  
**0:06:36-0:06:46:**  And so we have now about 12 lines of edges of trees and connecting these two forests  
**0:06:46-0:06:49:**  of about five hectares.  
**0:06:49-0:06:55:**  Okay so in total you said it's 30 hectares?  
**0:06:55-0:06:59:**  Totally the farm is 30 hectares.  
**0:06:59-0:07:07:**  Yeah and it's about five hectares of polycyclic forest replantation, five hectares of edges  
**0:07:07-0:07:19:**  and I have 15 hectares of arable land, of cropping land.  
**0:07:19-0:07:30:**  And then yeah the rest is grass, we have some, we've done two years ago a nice lake for environmental  
**0:07:30-0:07:44:**  purpose to recreate a regeneration spot for birds mainly and aquatic animals.  
**0:07:44-0:07:47:**  See this is the confirmation of the farm.  
**0:07:47-0:07:56:**  Yeah and actually this first step happened in 2012, so 10 years ago.  
**0:07:56-0:08:00:**  Okay nice so that was 10 years ago that you took over the management of the farm let's  
**0:08:00-0:08:03:**  say that you started being responsible for that?  
**0:08:03-0:08:10:**  Yeah few years before formally but then practically about when I always say when we start the  
**0:08:10-0:08:18:**  planting degrees that's when I start getting involved practically into farming activity.  
**0:08:18-0:08:24:**  And so I'm curious what I mean what made you like what were the influences that got you  
**0:08:24-0:08:26:**  to plant trees straight away?  
**0:08:26-0:08:28:**  Where did you get these ideas from?  
**0:08:28-0:08:29:**  Where did it come from?  
**0:08:29-0:08:39:**  Now first of all you know always often I have to say often solutions comes out of from problems  
**0:08:39-0:08:47:**  you know so we had the problem that we had a countryside landscape totally apart from  
**0:08:47-0:08:54:**  some very old popular trees on this main road we had apart from that the landscape were  
**0:08:54-0:09:04:**  really not a friendly environment, it was super sunny in winter, super cold and windy  
**0:09:04-0:09:14:**  in winter and no shade so the first so this is the one of the first reason the landscape  
**0:09:14-0:09:21:**  really is one of the first motivation of course is not one of the first motivation just the  
**0:09:21-0:09:29:**  landscape I knew also studying biology and ecology that the importance of the trees on  
**0:09:29-0:09:37:**  the insect colonizing trees and the soil and underneath and so of course I didn't I didn't  
**0:09:37-0:09:44:**  study agriculture but yeah just with some ecological background I knew that that was  
**0:09:44-0:09:50:**  one of the main most important steps to start cultivating in an organic way also.  
**0:09:50-0:09:58:**  I had to recreate a good environment where to start cultivating also good food so and  
**0:09:58-0:10:06:**  in a place where there were no good environment that's the best choice you can do.  
**0:10:06-0:10:17:**  I was also influenced by books about the agroecology, permaculture, regeneration of soil and so  
**0:10:17-0:10:21:**  also I had these influences.  
**0:10:21-0:10:25:**  That's amazing and so I mean from the farm visit I know that there's a lot of you do  
**0:10:25-0:10:30:**  a lot of different products and you I think we even ate the pasta that comes from your  
**0:10:30-0:10:34:**  own grain so could if you could tell us a bit about you know the wider context beyond  
**0:10:34-0:10:40:**  the trees what you produce on your on the farm what are your main products from the  
**0:10:40-0:10:41:**  farm?  
**0:10:41-0:10:49:**  Yeah, hello, as I told you the farm has 15 hectares of arable cultivated land so the  
**0:10:49-0:10:56:**  second step I always say was to look for the right seeds so after planting the trees I  
**0:10:56-0:11:06:**  had to wait until they grow and so I had time to focus on techniques of farming so with  
**0:11:06-0:11:13:**  the appropriate like machinery and so on because it's still a lot of land and you cannot think  
**0:11:13-0:11:24:**  about doing a synergic agriculture or not till I had to focus on that on the machine  
**0:11:24-0:11:31:**  and the mechanization of farming and as I told you the seeds so I got in touch with  
**0:11:31-0:11:40:**  a really cool association in Italy called the Ritet dei Semirurali that is an association  
**0:11:40-0:11:48:**  of associations in Italy, national association doing some also lobbying at European level  
**0:11:48-0:12:01:**  promoting the rights of farmers of small farmers especially and the rights of reproducing seeds  
**0:12:01-0:12:08:**  and so on so through this association I got in touch with many many super interesting  
**0:12:08-0:12:14:**  farmers in Italy the association is spread from north to south of Italy so really I had  
**0:12:14-0:12:23:**  the occasion to meet a lot of people and through that to that meetings I got some seeds of  
**0:12:23-0:12:32:**  ancient weeds, soft weeds, I started cultivating it's about seven years and now we are reproducing  
**0:12:32-0:12:43:**  it from seven years and so our main production I should say is the flower of soft weed, two  
**0:12:43-0:12:58:**  different kind, a mix of soft weed and a selected weed for making a more like white let's say  
**0:12:58-0:13:09:**  more like type one we say type one flower and then we have a very nice variety of corn  
**0:13:09-0:13:17:**  we make a nice polenta I guess in English is the same name polenta flower of corn we  
**0:13:17-0:13:25:**  used to boil into water it's very popular here in Benete region and this is the main  
**0:13:25-0:13:32:**  product then together with my girlfriend we started also some vegetable garden around  
**0:13:32-0:13:40:**  the houses of the farm and so we do produce some vegetables we do three thousand meters  
**0:13:40-0:13:54:**  of tomatoes for making tomato sauce, Julia she is a beekeeper so we do produce some honey  
**0:13:54-0:14:08:**  and then some vegetables mainly vegetable fruits also for private use in our mind there  
**0:14:08-0:14:15:**  is some project also on the vegetable garden specially because now we are doing the pruning  
**0:14:15-0:14:23:**  of the edges we are collecting so much wood and we really would like to start a proper  
**0:14:23-0:14:31:**  vegetable garden for selling through this.  
**0:14:31-0:14:37:**  That's definitely something we are going to talk about the hedge wood chips etc because  
**0:14:37-0:14:43:**  that's fascinating understanding that process but before that I'm curious how do you sell  
**0:14:43-0:14:48:**  all of your products directly to customers or is it more like wholesale stuff that goes  
**0:14:48-0:14:49:**  into properties?  
**0:14:49-0:14:58:**  No, no, no I have to say the percentage of the product I sell directly it's about 20  
**0:14:58-0:15:06:**  percent our goal is to reach the 100 percent but there is a big need of investment in terms  
**0:15:06-0:15:18:**  of stockage where to put the seeds, how to treat, to clean so it's already a big deal  
**0:15:18-0:15:26:**  with just two varieties of wheat and some corn and then we do also of course we do also  
**0:15:26-0:15:45:**  some other crops we sell directly like beans, dry beans or other like oats and that's all  
**0:15:45-0:15:50:**  the culture mainly.  
**0:15:50-0:16:00:**  The rest of the product goes directly to the big market there is a lot of requests of organic  
**0:16:00-0:16:12:**  seeds specially we have a company next to us producing milk from oats and so we do produce  
**0:16:12-0:16:22:**  a lot of that and soy also for them it's a really nice market I like also the vegetable  
**0:16:22-0:16:28:**  milk so that's important.  
**0:16:28-0:16:33:**  Why would you just out of curiosity looking a bit at your kind of your marketing strategy  
**0:16:33-0:16:37:**  why would you want to go with 100 percent directly sold?  
**0:16:37-0:16:38:**  Why?  
**0:16:38-0:16:43:**  I'm just curious because you've got the two models there you're selling some directly  
**0:16:43-0:16:49:**  and you're also selling to local I mean wholesale to local transformation businesses etc so  
**0:16:49-0:16:55:**  why are you trying to go more towards the direct selling?  
**0:16:55-0:17:03:**  Yeah in fact maybe I said it wrong maybe I mean originally my idea was to reach 100 percent  
**0:17:03-0:17:12:**  of direct selling but it's very big the farm and it's not necessary I mean I pointed it  
**0:17:12-0:17:20:**  because it was like an economic goal maybe because through direct selling you may gain  
**0:17:20-0:17:27:**  a little bit more but actually you're right I don't really need to reach that.  
**0:17:27-0:17:35:**  I had in mind also a project for baking bread and I think that with a good production of  
**0:17:35-0:17:43:**  bread I might use a lot of land let's say for direct selling the product so I guess  
**0:17:43-0:17:54:**  it won't be that difficult if I start also baking to reach 50-80 percent to change the  
**0:17:54-0:18:02:**  percentage you know to switch the percentage from 80 percent direct selling and 20 maybe  
**0:18:02-0:18:11:**  for leguminos or other product but still there is a lot of nice product and nice companies  
**0:18:11-0:18:17:**  you can collaborate with for example I have a friend doing fermentation of soy with the  
**0:18:17-0:18:28:**  cereals and doing miso so why not collaborating and producing all the food from yeah and sell  
**0:18:28-0:18:36:**  it directly or half or yeah with less passages.  
**0:18:36-0:18:41:**  Yeah because from our experience as well at Massey Farm you know there's a high cost to  
**0:18:41-0:18:50:**  direct selling often the cost of distributing at the beginning especially to find the customers  
**0:18:50-0:18:57:**  the labeling yeah yeah exactly so sometimes of course it's dependent on each context you  
**0:18:57-0:19:02:**  know each farm will be different but sometimes it seems like it would be a relief to just  
**0:19:02-0:19:08:**  be able to provide it to somebody that you know takes big bags of it and no or yeah yeah  
**0:19:08-0:19:14:**  but then again the price maybe doesn't just doesn't make it make the cut you know and  
**0:19:14-0:19:19:**  it's so it's an interesting case to look at because you have you know you have a farm  
**0:19:19-0:19:25:**  that's big but it's also not huge and so the quantities you could potentially manage with  
**0:19:25-0:19:31:**  high effort to direct sell you know 30 hectares of products but yeah 15 hectares.  
**0:19:31-0:19:38:**  15 exactly because but still yeah as you said there's also a lot of work on the yeah on  
**0:19:38-0:19:44:**  the farm in general then we have within from this year I guess we're gonna open a grituristic  
**0:19:44-0:19:52:**  activity so I guess there would be also a lot to do with gardening, hosting and welcoming  
**0:19:52-0:20:01:**  the guests so you're probably right I mean we won't reach the 100% with that part yeah  
**0:20:01-0:20:09:**  one of the chances we have is because I'm so happy about the forest we did that we might  
**0:20:09-0:20:18:**  plant some more so when we reach like 10, 5 hectares of cultivated land with crops so  
**0:20:18-0:20:24:**  then I've reached my goal initial goal.  
**0:20:24-0:20:30:**  It's interesting yeah also adapting little by little your land use to kind of your strategy  
**0:20:30-0:20:35:**  as things evolve and again I really want to talk about this why you're so happy with the  
**0:20:35-0:20:41:**  forestry that's something we're going to get into after I've got it on my notes here but  
**0:20:41-0:20:48:**  maybe we can start by talking a bit more about the hedges and I'd like to know a bit more  
**0:20:48-0:20:54:**  about what were your key or your specific objectives for planting hedges around your  
**0:20:54-0:21:00:**  land and if I understand correctly just to give a bit of paint a better picture to our  
**0:21:00-0:21:04:**  our listeners because I was there on the farm you've got your hedges and in between you've  
**0:21:04-0:21:12:**  got big parcels right you've got big land strips with where you cultivate the where  
**0:21:12-0:21:18:**  you cultivate the grains right so they're really it's like a it's like a matrix of hedges  
**0:21:18-0:21:22:**  in inside which you've got your crops.  
**0:21:22-0:21:29:**  Exactly that's the correct description of the farm it's not like because in a common  
**0:21:29-0:21:38:**  sense when I heard about talking about agroforestry I imagine lines of trees separating separated  
**0:21:38-0:21:51:**  by 20-30 meters of cultivated land in this case we have fields of 50 meters around 50-30  
**0:21:51-0:21:56:**  meters and 500 meters longer.  
**0:21:56-0:22:02:**  Yeah okay nice and so what were your key objectives then what was your...  
**0:22:02-0:22:14:**  For the hedges as I told you we were surrounded by industrial farming and so our the first  
**0:22:14-0:22:22:**  objective of the of the hedges was to create protection on the on the edge on the edge  
**0:22:22-0:22:30:**  of the farm so apart from the the forest itself that is already a protection and we we designed  
**0:22:30-0:22:39:**  some some edge edges I don't know how you say it like border edges edges border edges  
**0:22:39-0:22:50:**  okay yeah yeah the border edges made by mainly the main trees there are mulberry and and  
**0:22:50-0:22:58:**  lime tree tillia every eight meters we planted the lime tree and then mulberry and between  
**0:22:58-0:23:09:**  them I've planted six varieties of willow willow trees very nice and now we are also  
**0:23:09-0:23:16:**  collaborating with with a friend making baskets with these willows really nice but only in  
**0:23:16-0:23:23:**  a part of that because it's too many too many trees too handy yeah just a part of that this  
**0:23:23-0:23:31:**  is one of the main objective of the edges then then we in the in the in the edges within  
**0:23:31-0:23:39:**  the farm in the middle of the fields between the fields we we called that edges small fruit  
**0:23:39-0:23:51:**  side and the goal was to provide the fruits and nutrients to birds bees and and so on  
**0:23:51-0:23:57:**  all the animals that may live in the farm and so in the in these edges we we planted  
**0:23:57-0:24:12:**  many prunes different variety of prunes and and then it's the nuts the the hazelnuts and  
**0:24:12-0:24:23:**  then other varieties of like sambucus or other fruits cornea or cornews cornews see corn  
**0:24:23-0:24:33:**  or cherry yeah yeah in Latin and yeah so all these prunus cherazos avium male and all the  
**0:24:33-0:24:42:**  varieties of prunus and then and these are considered the low trees while has a proper  
**0:24:42-0:24:55:**  trees we planted the many quercus yeah and then some other varieties of yeah poplar and  
**0:24:55-0:25:04:**  some tilia also there for the bees and the almost so we we decided to create some some  
**0:25:04-0:25:14:**  diversification with it is within this inner edge so I'm curious why you you decided within  
**0:25:14-0:25:19:**  the inner edge why you decided to go with a simpler design and a simpler setup on the  
**0:25:19-0:25:28:**  outer hedges was it for speed of growth of the trees or see see see see was a no because  
**0:25:28-0:25:37:**  I thought that the the the willow the willow tree would have create a nice barrier better  
**0:25:37-0:25:45:**  barrier actually no I would do it a little bit different now with the experience again  
**0:25:45-0:25:54:**  in this in this years because there are also for example there are some always green trees  
**0:25:54-0:26:01:**  that might be more useful in the in the in the borders for some noise we have some roads  
**0:26:01-0:26:08:**  some industrial area in the east sides so I would have planted more of this especially  
**0:26:08-0:26:16:**  because I planted some in those edges and I have seen them growing very well even if  
**0:26:16-0:26:27:**  they were more trees adapted for for hilly altitudes or yeah or mountain like quercus  
**0:26:27-0:26:35:**  ilex some whole milk so the outer edges is more the carcass and the protection layer  
**0:26:35-0:26:41:**  also against pesticide drift and etc from the neighbour activities and then inside it's  
**0:26:41-0:26:50:**  more focusing on ecosystem yeah and productivity and and biodiversity etc exactly insects and  
**0:26:50-0:26:56:**  so on see see see but actually with this barrier of willow is it's working very well it's of  
**0:26:56-0:27:05:**  course in in in spring and summer time but then yeah in winter it's a bit naked yeah  
**0:27:05-0:27:10:**  yeah interesting and so I mean we're going to go into more of the details because there  
**0:27:10-0:27:15:**  was also this this this idea of plastic mulch that you had used and I really want some feedback  
**0:27:15-0:27:21:**  on that from your experience but before that how did how did you fund the the planting  
**0:27:21-0:27:25:**  was this something that you you know did you provide the investment for that or did you  
**0:27:25-0:27:30:**  get help from from yeah in fact how did that go yeah doing the the question you did you  
**0:27:30-0:27:35:**  made me before I did an answer about about this because actually one of the motivation  
**0:27:35-0:27:42:**  that pushed me to do it is that by the time by 2012 there was a very interesting program  
**0:27:42-0:27:51:**  mission funding like this kind of plantation I was really lucky because then it disappeared  
**0:27:51-0:27:59:**  for for 10 years this kind of subsidies for plantation mixed plantation of poplar together  
**0:27:59-0:28:10:**  with walnuts and other long-term trees so I had the chance to to meet these fundings  
**0:28:10-0:28:20:**  that was were very generous they used to found 80% for the forest of the plantation costs  
**0:28:20-0:28:29:**  I'm talking about plants preparation work of the soils and mulching and and and and  
**0:28:29-0:28:38:**  plantation as I told you and then yeah and then while for the edges there were 100% funding  
**0:28:38-0:28:46:**  because it has a more environmental purpose the edges instead the from the forest after  
**0:28:46-0:28:52:**  some years you start gaining some money you know so it was more founded and then there  
**0:28:52-0:28:59:**  were there are still found they are still funding me like the missing income they call  
**0:28:59-0:29:09:**  it they call it so they gave from the edges they calculate about 2,000 euro per actors  
**0:29:09-0:29:19:**  getting an edges like six meter wide and yeah and this it's a really big incentive that  
**0:29:19-0:29:28:**  I wouldn't I have to say I wouldn't have done that if there were no funding like that how  
**0:29:28-0:29:36:**  would you have done it if you didn't have this funding but let's say this kind of funding  
**0:29:36-0:29:45:**  is nobody never asked me that actually it's a good question I would I would have done  
**0:29:45-0:29:53:**  it but now with the experience I have I would have saved money on on the plants first of  
**0:29:53-0:29:59:**  all I wouldn't save money in the mulching because I have to say I can I can see there  
**0:29:59-0:30:08:**  were differences between mulched lines of tree and not mulched and this especially if  
**0:30:08-0:30:16:**  on not in the edges but especially in the in the in the polycyclic plantation I wouldn't  
**0:30:16-0:30:27:**  save money on mulching because because it's important you have to be productive and then  
**0:30:27-0:30:39:**  maybe I would invite a lot of friends to plant and so and so I would say some money because  
**0:30:39-0:30:48:**  you planted all of these five hectares of hedges in one go in one year in one winter  
**0:30:48-0:30:55:**  okay wow yeah so lots of a lot of work yeah a lot of work was a big investment see see  
**0:30:55-0:31:03:**  there was a big investment as of yeah especially people work like because of the plantation  
**0:31:03-0:31:10:**  itself had to be done manually of course maybe there are techniques you can plant not manually  
**0:31:10-0:31:16:**  but since we had so much variety different variety we had boxes you have to choose the  
**0:31:16-0:31:25:**  trees it's not like you're planting potatoes on the ground or so it's a bit more I understand  
**0:31:25-0:31:31:**  the problem we've experienced this problem many times and you always end up mixed up  
**0:31:31-0:31:38:**  where at the end you you've only got one kind of tree left like I don't know if you encountered  
**0:31:38-0:31:43:**  this in your plantation but that's how it usually goes yeah yeah yeah that's true that's  
**0:31:43-0:31:52:**  happened we had the four tools we had four tools for making the holes in the mulching  
**0:31:52-0:31:59:**  and so there were four people one of them was me making the holes in the in the ground  
**0:31:59-0:32:06:**  with this metal tools you push it with the foot and you go 20 30 centimeter down in the  
**0:32:06-0:32:16:**  earth okay and and then yeah people on the back so tell me about the the mulch that you  
**0:32:16-0:32:20:**  used and you know when we were there I was fascinated by the difference between the plastic  
**0:32:20-0:32:25:**  mulch the biodegradable mulch the no mulch maybe you can tell us a bit about this this  
**0:32:25-0:32:29:**  mulching experience and and you know how it and you know what are the results see the  
**0:32:29-0:32:37:**  result I mean I cannot say much about different like samples with no mulching and so I had  
**0:32:37-0:32:43:**  just one line of poplar with no mulching and I have to say they are very very small because  
**0:32:43-0:32:53:**  they're very small smaller than their friends in the next line because they suffered a very  
**0:32:53-0:33:02:**  dry summer during the first year and and the mulching in that case I can't say it helped  
**0:33:02-0:33:15:**  a lot saving water saving water for the for the roots I experienced both the biodegradable  
**0:33:15-0:33:26:**  mulching we had stripes one meter 20 wide of course we use a machinery to lay it down  
**0:33:26-0:33:36:**  on the ground and and I did this biodegradable mulching on the edges and I never so see and  
**0:33:36-0:33:45:**  after I say three four years totally disappeared then I know people says not chase not people  
**0:33:45-0:33:53:**  disappearing is just the fragmenting very very small pieces so I don't know how good  
**0:33:53-0:34:01:**  is for the soil for the insect and so on but it did his job because during the first two  
**0:34:01-0:34:10:**  years the plants were quite safe in terms of water retention and with the control and  
**0:34:10-0:34:19:**  and so not much difference with the talking about the facts not much difference with the  
**0:34:19-0:34:27:**  with the non biodegradable plastic mulching while that plastic mulching I use it in the  
**0:34:27-0:34:36:**  forest and after three years we removed it all completely we cut the with a knife and  
**0:34:36-0:34:43:**  we took it out so that's a lot of work that's also a lot of work you have to take into account  
**0:34:43-0:34:50:**  so yeah so that's interesting to look at the the difference so that it only lasted two  
**0:34:50-0:34:57:**  years the biodegradable mulch math three three by by the third fourth year I didn't see it  
**0:34:57-0:35:04:**  anymore okay okay but by then the trees had already taken off see see no problem already  
**0:35:04-0:35:11:**  from the second year the third year yeah yeah but even from the first year then we used  
**0:35:11-0:35:23:**  to keep very low the with the with the yeah cutting the weeds twice three times per year  
**0:35:23-0:35:30:**  next to the trees both in the during the first years both in the forest and in the edges  
**0:35:30-0:35:35:**  with what tool did you do that we have a tool on the back of the tractor it can move a little  
**0:35:35-0:35:46:**  bit on the on the right side so yeah yeah so you can go closer but not much and you  
**0:35:46-0:35:51:**  just don't do that anymore after like when now we do it because we yeah of course we  
**0:35:51-0:35:56:**  do it see see see see no but it's okay yeah of course yeah yeah we do it but it's less  
**0:35:56-0:36:01:**  important we don't go very close to the plant because there's already shade and there's  
**0:36:01-0:36:07:**  no need to go very closer but we do it for the yeah see and I'm curious about the detail  
**0:36:07-0:36:13:**  of planting because you put so first you lay out the plastic mulch then you come and what  
**0:36:13-0:36:22:**  happens first of all first of all it's a big ripper passing and signing where you're gonna  
**0:36:22-0:36:31:**  do the edges or also the plantation of the forest so the big ripper 80 centimeter depth  
**0:36:31-0:36:40:**  and then yeah and then we passed with the machinery at that time I had a very good farmer  
**0:36:40-0:36:46:**  tractor farmer who used to go very straight because you know you have a blank sheet and  
**0:36:46-0:36:55:**  he went very very straight and he did a great job and he designed straight lines of trees  
**0:36:55-0:37:02:**  we still have yeah and so and after that we had these tools we call it carrotatore in  
**0:37:02-0:37:12:**  italian so you make a like a carrot of trees of soil has a like a crown on the on the bottom  
**0:37:12-0:37:21:**  and you can push it with the food it's very simple we had the four of them we made it  
**0:37:21-0:37:30:**  with a with a with a local camper carpenter company here okay and so then you would just  
**0:37:30-0:37:37:**  make the hole through the plastic through the plastic pull out pull out the the soil  
**0:37:37-0:37:43:**  leave the soil maybe on the mulching so you can reuse it after that then we had plants  
**0:37:43-0:37:55:**  of course two years plants trees with within within a within a vase contained in a pot  
**0:37:55-0:38:02:**  in a pot they were potted plants potted in a multiple pot most of them were in multiple  
**0:38:02-0:38:10:**  pot not all of them we had also naked roots plants like the this is the main most of the  
**0:38:10-0:38:21:**  plant were in in multiple pots and five centimeter depth these pots for estal plants and so yeah  
**0:38:21-0:38:28:**  and so you took it from there you plant it within the hole simple and then you then have  
**0:38:28-0:38:34:**  weeds growing on the sides like weeds growing on the pot it see also also trees growing  
**0:38:34-0:38:42:**  at the end we have poplar growing everywhere now because we had already some poplar very  
**0:38:42-0:38:49:**  old then we planted poplar in the in the forest and they they spread very well so they're  
**0:38:49-0:38:57:**  growing they start growing within the holes already 10 years ago nine years ago so did  
**0:38:57-0:39:02:**  you have to weed by hand no i never did it no like the weeds or you just let it be we  
**0:39:02-0:39:11:**  let it be so far okay yeah okay so i'm curious about more like the long-term management you  
**0:39:11-0:39:17:**  said that nowadays you're you're you're mowing the the hedges right 10 years down the line  
**0:39:17-0:39:24:**  uh yeah what do you mean mowing the edges yeah i'm curious because you know i'm curious  
**0:39:24-0:39:30:**  how you manage the hedge 10 years 10 years later because you just you just let the hedge  
**0:39:30-0:39:36:**  grow for 10 years if i understand correctly just now you've started uh intervening there  
**0:39:36-0:39:43:**  so what what you do exactly and for what purpose hello yeah the actually we left next to the  
**0:39:43-0:39:49:**  edges we left three meters and three meters from the trees okay three meters on the right  
**0:39:49-0:39:57:**  and three meters on the left now the branches are invading the roads let's say so i had  
**0:39:57-0:40:07:**  to intervene and and moreover i'm going to give a nice shape to the plants creating like  
**0:40:07-0:40:17:**  an umbrella underneath the the the streets the roads and yeah and then containing keeping  
**0:40:17-0:40:23:**  the the edge and not invading the fields the other side because we have the double lines  
**0:40:23-0:40:34:**  of edges with a canal a little canal in the middle and and so we have a inner part inside  
**0:40:34-0:40:41:**  the the edges that is more it's going to be this is really interesting because it opens  
**0:40:41-0:40:53:**  up to to different possibility to use this space within within within this two line of  
**0:40:53-0:41:03:**  edges we we are now thinking about using it like a like a picnic area like we would like  
**0:41:03-0:41:10:**  to develop like some many spots along the edges where like people could come and doing  
**0:41:10-0:41:20:**  their picnic maybe doing their grill or eventually making um see create some yeah because it's  
**0:41:20-0:41:27:**  not very common really to have a nice piece of land with some trees grass some shade in  
**0:41:27-0:41:32:**  summer time even if we are in the middle of a countryside area there's no more anymore  
**0:41:32-0:41:40:**  around and so this is something really amazing we we now can appreciate and we can say it's  
**0:41:40-0:41:48:**  really nice and so we are going to do the pruning focusing also on this and the the  
**0:41:48-0:41:59:**  work it's like yeah with the with a little saw motor engine so yeah we do the main pruning  
**0:41:59-0:42:11:**  and then we had a chipper so we keep aside we do different like in a spot we put all  
**0:42:11-0:42:18:**  the small branches in another spot we put the big branches we're going to use for fire  
**0:42:18-0:42:24:**  and after that so you pass with the with with the pruning cutting and selecting sorting  
**0:42:24-0:42:30:**  the wood and then in another passage we do the chopping of the small branches and we  
**0:42:30-0:42:36:**  take out the the big one so that's what the tractor attached tool that you do the topping  
**0:42:36-0:42:43:**  right yeah exactly where you do it by you do it all by hand the the all by hands the  
**0:42:43-0:42:49:**  the pruning of the edges by hands the first pruning okay wow that's a lot that's a lot  
**0:42:49-0:42:56:**  of work right doing passing through the whole hedge individual tree it's about five kilometers  
**0:42:56-0:43:04:**  long so it's a lot of work yeah of course if i also this i should have done some pruning  
**0:43:04-0:43:10:**  before that would have saved some some times and money probably now but i wouldn't have  
**0:43:10-0:43:19:**  much also burning wood probably so wood to burn yeah yeah yeah so in england i've just  
**0:43:19-0:43:24:**  come back from the uk now they prune their hedges with with hedge cutters uh-huh you  
**0:43:24-0:43:31:**  know the head does they only just prune always at the same spot you know and so it's it creates  
**0:43:31-0:43:34:**  they let it grow for a year or two and then they prune it so you don't have a lot of biomass  
**0:43:34-0:43:39:**  production uh-huh you see what i guess it's always pruning small branches small branches  
**0:43:39-0:43:45:**  small branches to to make it like in a tidy hedge uh-huh it doesn't create shade for the  
**0:43:45-0:43:50:**  for the for the pasture for the pasture and it keeps everything clean that's that's their  
**0:43:50-0:43:54:**  strategy in the countryside there most of the time that's what that's what you see but  
**0:43:54-0:44:00:**  it's a cutting machine like it's a cutting blade like yeah like a flail mower usually  
**0:44:00-0:44:07:**  they use them in the roads as well yeah yeah yeah etc it's just a flail mower on an arm  
**0:44:07-0:44:12:**  that that moves and that can go to the vertical it can like reach out and go to the horizontal  
**0:44:12-0:44:18:**  to do the tops you know it's quite a flexible tool but but it doesn't allow you to have  
**0:44:18-0:44:22:**  that vibe that you know wouldn't you wouldn't use a chipper because yeah and then yeah the  
**0:44:22-0:44:27:**  the yeah of course you save money in that way but the other way you don't you don't  
**0:44:27-0:44:33:**  collect also all these materials because exactly with my chipper i collect it yeah yeah exactly  
**0:44:33-0:44:40:**  and so what are you planning on doing with so many with five kilometers of wood chips  
**0:44:40-0:44:49:**  actually has a also um as for the cutting of the of the forest also for because i have  
**0:44:49-0:44:55:**  some lines of wood to burn i didn't do all the chopping and the and the pruning in one  
**0:44:55-0:45:02:**  year i spread it in two or three years so i started last year and i did about two kilometers  
**0:45:02-0:45:10:**  and this year i still have to start i'm going to start march i think i'll do another two  
**0:45:10-0:45:15:**  kilo two kilometers and collecting it and putting next to the vegetable garden and then  
**0:45:15-0:45:26:**  we use it to make pathways and then probably also to try to use it for mulching the the  
**0:45:26-0:45:33:**  cultivated the land for vegetable garden some of that we use it also for because we have  
**0:45:33-0:45:43:**  two horses and three donkeys so we use some of that for for the the litter for the horses  
**0:45:43-0:45:49:**  yeah the litter yeah okay so this is really for personal use there's there's not a commercial  
**0:45:49-0:45:55:**  objective with this of trying to sell no of course investing no exactly let's say no no  
**0:45:55-0:46:02:**  commercially it's not interesting i've found or maybe so far maybe i will we will find  
**0:46:02-0:46:08:**  somebody who might be interested but like for example chip and wood from little branches  
**0:46:08-0:46:19:**  it not is not interesting because it makes a lot of the chain dust it's not much woody  
**0:46:19-0:46:25:**  because there's the the the external part of the branches that doesn't burn very well  
**0:46:25-0:46:34:**  so has not a good value in terms of burning for chipping but it might be maybe sold for  
**0:46:34-0:46:42:**  liters or other purpose or just as mulching pathways as we do because creates also a very  
**0:46:42-0:46:49:**  nice aesthetic effect so if you do you can sell it for gardening or so it could work  
**0:46:49-0:46:56:**  it could work but at the moment is a personal use and we are thinking about yeah improving  
**0:46:56-0:47:03:**  the vegetable garden with these materials for pathways and maybe activated with the  
**0:47:03-0:47:11:**  with the compost from from the horses okay very nice very interesting and i'm curious  
**0:47:11-0:47:17:**  about how you've seen the trees or the hedges interact with the with the grain crops in  
**0:47:17-0:47:22:**  between have you noticed that there is a certain competition going on between the two has it  
**0:47:22-0:47:28:**  reduced a bit the productivity of that of that area i'm curious about how the your grain  
**0:47:28-0:47:33:**  crops interact with the with the trees no actually at the moment i i cannot tell you  
**0:47:33-0:47:39:**  much about that because the the plant even in 10 years is a lot of time it's not much  
**0:47:39-0:47:48:**  for the trees and then yeah so they they don't have very impact on on the on the next fields  
**0:47:48-0:47:58:**  i can say there are some some some i can see some impacts next to the big trees where many  
**0:47:58-0:48:06:**  leaves fall down in winter and so you have a lot of a lot of organic structure made so  
**0:48:06-0:48:14:**  but this uh this is plants like 30 meters high we have four five that plants and i can  
**0:48:14-0:48:24:**  see difference there it's part of the edges but it's just some spots yeah okay okay another  
**0:48:24-0:48:30:**  interesting effect of these edges is that they are very really full of birds a lot of  
**0:48:30-0:48:41:**  birds coming and and insects also i i i interact with during my cutting of the weeds next to  
**0:48:41-0:48:50:**  it's really full and many different okay interesting and have you noticed differences in in in  
**0:48:50-0:48:55:**  the microclimate have you have you noticed a big change in in you know in the heat in  
**0:48:55-0:49:01:**  the cold in the wind how do you feel about about that has it met your expectations let's  
**0:49:01-0:49:12:**  say no i i cannot feel it no i mean i i i i don't live within i should live there with  
**0:49:12-0:49:17:**  a little tiny house in the within there and maybe i could tell you a bit more and maybe  
**0:49:17-0:49:22:**  i should have lived before without and then i would but i'm sure there are effects because  
**0:49:22-0:49:27:**  uh yeah you can imagine just imagine you with a tiny house in the middle of the countryside  
**0:49:27-0:49:36:**  with no trees around and the other side you in the middle of the edges of course there  
**0:49:36-0:49:43:**  is differences but i couldn't feel it on my skin like yeah no i'm i'm curious if there's  
**0:49:43-0:49:48:**  something that you know if there was some obvious results or if if you felt you know  
**0:49:48-0:49:51:**  in my farm for example in the places which are protected by trees because there's so  
**0:49:51-0:49:56:**  much wind we we feel a big difference you know and and you know it's a big difference  
**0:49:56-0:50:00:**  in the wind we see a big difference also in the cold in the winter it's quite dramatic  
**0:50:00-0:50:07:**  but also because it's dramatic conditions um see now here it's not windy region at all  
**0:50:07-0:50:17:**  it's not wind it's foggy during winter and uh see no wind nice i have to say though to  
**0:50:17-0:50:22:**  add a bit of information from a very experiential point of view and and you know anecdotal uh  
**0:50:22-0:50:28:**  let's say observation that when i arrived on the land all the landscape around is is  
**0:50:28-0:50:32:**  basically just corn and soy and some big big buildings and stuff it's you know it feels  
**0:50:32-0:50:37:**  very barren as you as you said uh whilst being on such productive land so i mean it's very  
**0:50:37-0:50:42:**  very bad and then you come into this place and you see as you said grass and you see  
**0:50:42-0:50:46:**  hedges and and you don't see what's happening around you know it closes off the view it's  
**0:50:46-0:50:50:**  it definitely has an impact you definitely feel like you're somewhere else yeah it's  
**0:50:50-0:50:58:**  quite uh but this is just a human's perspective i wonder what a bird's perspective is they're  
**0:50:58-0:51:06:**  happy for sure yeah like we are when we are there yeah for sure nice so maybe we can shift  
**0:51:06-0:51:12:**  to the the the polycyclic forestry that you've got because this is again a bit to set the  
**0:51:12-0:51:18:**  scene this is really interesting for for farmers because you know one thing is is a forester  
**0:51:18-0:51:23:**  or forestry enterprise that have you know hundreds or thousands of hectares of forest  
**0:51:23-0:51:28:**  and that manage it but another thing is is farmers that are using you know small pieces  
**0:51:28-0:51:33:**  of land like you are to plant for to have forestry projects and you know we're trying  
**0:51:33-0:51:39:**  to find out you know how does that work how do you how do we interviewed for example row  
**0:51:39-0:51:42:**  and reed that is very much you know he's got a relatively small farm for the area where  
**0:51:42-0:51:47:**  he is and he advocates a lot and works a lot with farmers who have other practices like  
**0:51:47-0:51:51:**  who have sheep or who have grains and he's integrating these high value timber trees  
**0:51:51-0:51:55:**  and so we're starting to enter this conversation with people so we're very excited to be able  
**0:51:55-0:51:59:**  to talk to you about this because you have you know feedback from 10 12 years and already  
**0:51:59-0:52:09:**  one harvest of poplars or at least some poplar harvested of small scale farm forestry and  
**0:52:09-0:52:14:**  you know a lot of our listeners are curious about that so you know I've got lots of questions  
**0:52:14-0:52:20:**  set up for you as you can expect and you know the first one is you know why did you decide  
**0:52:20-0:52:26:**  to to go with polycyclic forestry what why forestry and not just hedges and grains where  
**0:52:26-0:52:33:**  did this crazy idea come from of course because we we fell in love with trees and the needs  
**0:52:33-0:52:41:**  that we we felt also the needs of re-reforesting the lands and taking care if I if I wouldn't  
**0:52:41-0:52:49:**  I decided also to to to do to do farming also because I wanted to take care about the land  
**0:52:49-0:52:55:**  and and of course when I mean take care taking care about the land is one of the activities  
**0:52:55-0:53:01:**  we have to we have to do is planting trees especially in this area because I have experience  
**0:53:01-0:53:07:**  I've traveled around Italy and Europe there are region hilly region where there's less  
**0:53:07-0:53:15:**  needs of trees but this area like where we are in in the big plains in north of Italy  
**0:53:15-0:53:23:**  there's really a big needs for that so so that was the the main reason why we decided  
**0:53:23-0:53:29:**  to do that then of course the funding issue is a is an important element I mean without  
**0:53:29-0:53:37:**  that funding I don't know how when and I would have done it and then I had the chance to  
**0:53:37-0:53:44:**  meet another interesting association working on research and lobbying for pushing from  
**0:53:44-0:53:54:**  from monoculture of poplar to multiple polycyclic plantations and so I had the chance to meet  
**0:53:54-0:54:03:**  them and actually we are also giving them part of the founding we gain every year from  
**0:54:03-0:54:12:**  that that plantation we give six of the of that money to them to collect data and to  
**0:54:12-0:54:20:**  then share it share those data and to yeah to do research so our plantation is also very  
**0:54:20-0:54:30:**  well detected in some all information about the biomass of the of the plants the diameter  
**0:54:30-0:54:39:**  and then all is registered for every year and because it's yeah because it was a quite  
**0:54:39-0:54:48:**  innovative scheme of plantation maybe you could describe a bit what it is this polycyclic  
**0:54:48-0:54:51:**  forestry because I'm sure a lot of people are just thinking trying to imagine what it  
**0:54:51-0:54:57:**  looks like yeah exactly so starting from the first world polycyclic we have multiple many  
**0:54:57-0:55:06:**  many more than one cycle of production of this plantation of trees so let's start from  
**0:55:06-0:55:15:**  the the the we have to we can say we have long term cycle of trees in our case it's  
**0:55:15-0:55:29:**  about oak and tilia lime tree is it correct yeah and those trees are yes lime tree so  
**0:55:29-0:55:38:**  those trees is they are within the same line the line of the long term trees separated  
**0:55:38-0:55:46:**  by eight meters then the second cycle is the cycle of poplar this the first cycle sorry  
**0:55:46-0:55:56:**  is about is gonna last between 50 they say but I think it's gonna be more 20 to 30 years  
**0:55:56-0:56:04:**  then the second cycle the popular cycle it's gonna be 10 years and I just figured out last  
**0:56:04-0:56:14:**  year that I can do two cycle of this I'm gonna plant the poplar after cutting them this autumn  
**0:56:14-0:56:21:**  we're gonna cut them and replant it within the same row line and very interesting this  
**0:56:21-0:56:32:**  is the the poplar cycle and then the third cycle is the plane tree plane tree that is  
**0:56:32-0:56:42:**  a super short cycle it's gonna be can be between four to six year can last we decided because  
**0:56:42-0:56:51:**  we started to cut this tree already a few years ago and we decided to give different  
**0:56:51-0:56:59:**  timing for not doing all job in one year so we shipped the work from the fourth to the  
**0:56:59-0:57:08:**  sixth year okay okay interesting and the by plane tree you mean the platanus by the way  
**0:57:08-0:57:17:**  the plane tree platanus okay nice see it's so I can describe you a little bit more the  
**0:57:17-0:57:28:**  main we call it the yeah the long term cycle line is each tree of each main tree like an  
**0:57:28-0:57:38:**  oak alternate and and the tilia is separated by eight meters in in this within this eight  
**0:57:38-0:57:53:**  meters we planted alnus alnus trees untano yeah holders holders and aside sambucus okay  
**0:57:53-0:58:02:**  sambucus is the elderberry elderberry exactly so we're in the middle of this eight meters  
**0:58:02-0:58:11:**  between the main trees a long-term tree you have these trees that they just they are there  
**0:58:11-0:58:20:**  just to support the main trees to support with making a cycle of nutrients between the  
**0:58:20-0:58:28:**  leaves and to support the straight growing of the main trees so that's the role of sambucus  
**0:58:28-0:58:35:**  and alnus within the main row line yes right that's what they do yeah that's what they  
**0:58:35-0:58:44:**  do also I think alnus is a also alnus I think is a nitrogen fixer yeah yeah I think it is  
**0:58:44-0:58:53:**  yeah yeah and so this is a multiple role for the long-term cycle then so what are your  
**0:58:53-0:59:01:**  main products from your from the multi-cyclic actually what's the this is gonna be this  
**0:59:01-0:59:14:**  is gonna be timber wood wood for furniture because okay yeah no nuts tree and walnuts  
**0:59:14-0:59:23:**  yeah and tilia lime tree are really very used but this is more how do you say an incognito  
**0:59:23-0:59:30:**  I don't know exactly how much they're gonna gain from them because the market of that  
**0:59:30-0:59:37:**  kind of wood is very flexible and 10 years ago there was a very high valuable now it's  
**0:59:37-0:59:44:**  really low maybe in 10 years it's gonna be high again so I cannot do prediction on how  
**0:59:44-0:59:51:**  much we're gonna be it's gonna be but I can't just yeah but I can tell you that there is  
**0:59:51-1:00:00:**  a lot of market for popular for industry for making the plants the sheets there are many  
**1:00:00-1:00:09:**  beginners in the north of Italy asking for wood and I can tell you the the prices are  
**1:00:09-1:00:18:**  really good they pay even I can say bit more than one euro per centimeter of circumference  
**1:00:18-1:00:28:**  circumference okay yeah for a tree yeah see and I can tell you in a good environment talking  
**1:00:28-1:00:42:**  about not sandy soil but with a good percentage of clay or lime and yeah and with with water  
**1:00:42-1:00:48:**  not too much deep in the ground you know we in our plane we have water you can find it  
**1:00:48-1:00:55:**  even in summer at one meter 52 meters you already have wet yeah maybe in summer a bit  
**1:00:55-1:01:03:**  more but a plant can reach that very easy and especially if you do yeah working before  
**1:01:03-1:01:09:**  so so and I can tell you that that this plant this popular can grow about 10 centimeters  
**1:01:09-1:01:20:**  per year of two conferences of gyr okay yeah um see I did all the measurement because because  
**1:01:20-1:01:31:**  I've already sold the the popular to the industry they didn't cut it yet but I've made the agreement  
**1:01:31-1:01:38:**  okay and so they come then with their machines and they harvest it for you yeah yeah they  
**1:01:38-1:01:44:**  are visit for them actually because I've sold them yeah okay but you don't have to worry  
**1:01:44-1:01:49:**  about the harvest no no no no no no and they also collect all the branches because they  
**1:01:49-1:01:56:**  need to warm up the oven to dry the sheets they will produce with the yeah so they will  
**1:01:56-1:02:08:**  clean up just that for this kind of polycyclic forest plantation and the the the they just  
**1:02:08-1:02:15:**  have to be to pay attention to the row to the line next to to the popular actually to  
**1:02:15-1:02:24:**  not break the tilla and not break the high value trees exactly exactly and that's the  
**1:02:24-1:02:33:**  main issue I'm concerned about the next cutting and they already asked me to cut the line  
**1:02:33-1:02:46:**  of of of plane trees to to make the the operation easier yes because they're not used to these  
**1:02:46-1:02:51:**  polycyclic conditions right exactly so are they so they're not very happy about that  
**1:02:51-1:02:58:**  I imagine no no they're not very happy that's one of the reasons why they might regain on  
**1:02:58-1:03:03:**  the prices no you know no but this is more difficult and actually it is the more difficult  
**1:03:03-1:03:09:**  because of course if you have a monoculture of poplar wherever you start and then you  
**1:03:09-1:03:15:**  go on here you have to pay a bit more attention you don't go in with big machinery they I  
**1:03:15-1:03:23:**  think they will do it the the cutting they would do it by hand somewhere with the with  
**1:03:23-1:03:29:**  a person not with a big machine while normally usually they do it with big machines yeah  
**1:03:29-1:03:36:**  normally in monoculture popular day they come with the big machines that's an interesting  
**1:03:36-1:03:47:**  aspect to it see what do you do with the plantain so the plantain the plantain after six years  
**1:03:47-1:03:55:**  I've cut between four and six years I've cut it and I let it dry on the fields I do some  
**1:03:55-1:04:03:**  where I collect it in some spots within the forest lifting them from from the ground with  
**1:04:03-1:04:13:**  the with the weather and then within the same year I sell it or somehow after six eight  
**1:04:13-1:04:21:**  months they're already dry I can I can sell it and I used to prepare some big bags like  
**1:04:21-1:04:32:**  one meter eighty high and one meter per one meter of the base and yeah and we sell it  
**1:04:32-1:04:39:**  directly to local market people we put some signs in front of the gate of the farm and  
**1:04:39-1:04:47:**  our yeah our customer are growing actually from the first year we had few like 10 15  
**1:04:47-1:04:55:**  people now we have doubled we are still not much for what for firewood they see they use  
**1:04:55-1:05:00:**  it most for heating actually because what's especially this year we had a lot of requests  
**1:05:00-1:05:07:**  because of the rising of the prices of the gas and so on so a lot of people start heating  
**1:05:07-1:05:16:**  their houses with wood with the either very interesting and so they asked me to cut it  
**1:05:16-1:05:21:**  they asked me to cut it small pieces because the stove normally especially the kitchen  
**1:05:21-1:05:30:**  stove they they need the 30 centimeter long piece of wood and the platinum plant is not  
**1:05:30-1:05:41:**  the hardest and the highest quality but has a nice value for burning interesting very  
**1:05:41-1:05:47:**  interesting and I mean shifting back to the to the company that comes to harvest their  
**1:05:47-1:05:54:**  poplars your poplars but that you have signed off already I'm curious is five hectares of  
**1:05:54-1:06:00:**  forestry or five hectares of poplar is that worth it for them to come because I would  
**1:06:00-1:06:05:**  imagine they would also bargain with you and be like ah it's a small quantity it's not  
**1:06:05-1:06:11:**  is that also something they let's say let's say I would say it's a minimum amount especially  
**1:06:11-1:06:17:**  if you talk about polycyclic because yeah if you talk about monoculture maybe a couple  
**1:06:17-1:06:23:**  of vectors is enough because you have a density of in a monoculture you have a density of  
**1:06:23-1:06:33:**  I think 300 plants per hectare while here in our first we have 90 popular per hectare  
**1:06:33-1:06:39:**  okay interesting and so that's what I'm curious to know about why opt for more multi-cyclic  
**1:06:39-1:06:45:**  when you could be doing when you could be doing a monoculture you know if I was trying  
**1:06:45-1:06:52:**  to optimize optimize economic return or well maybe that's not I should I should go back  
**1:06:52-1:06:57:**  on myself here and maybe just ask the simple question you know why would a farmer go for  
**1:06:57-1:07:06:**  multi-cyclic instead of monoculture yeah that's another good question I mean if you see only  
**1:07:06-1:07:12:**  the economical reason there's not much need but just because there's a lot of uncertainty  
**1:07:12-1:07:22:**  in the in the in the long term cycle because I cannot tell you the nuts tree we're gonna  
**1:07:22-1:07:31:**  be paid a lot now I don't know it how it's gonna be in 10 years so I mean yeah because  
**1:07:31-1:07:38:**  the farmer should do it because he trusts in I mean in itself in in nature and I guess  
**1:07:38-1:07:45:**  I did it because I was confident because I love also woodworks so I said oh by 20 years  
**1:07:45-1:07:51:**  30 years I think I will find a way to give value to those trees you know that's what  
**1:07:51-1:07:57:**  what was my thought but I don't know yeah you're right most of the farmer wouldn't wouldn't  
**1:07:57-1:08:04:**  do it and especially if there's no funding for that because actually I did it also because  
**1:08:04-1:08:13:**  I was subsidized so what what what it's my missing income is is balanced by the founding  
**1:08:13-1:08:21:**  and this is something unfortunately important to to make it happen but I guess the work  
**1:08:21-1:08:27:**  we are doing would demonstrate that it could be done even without so far it's not gonna  
**1:08:27-1:08:35:**  it's it's interesting what we are taking out from these fields economically speaking economically  
**1:08:35-1:08:45:**  it's interesting because the poplar are really yeah did their job and and also from the wood  
**1:08:45-1:08:52:**  for burning it's easy to cut it's easy to the the scheme of the polycyclic make the  
**1:08:52-1:09:00:**  work quite easy to do you that there are good distances between the trees so the work is  
**1:09:00-1:09:07:**  quite easy and it's competitive I mean with the with the wood coming from the mountains  
**1:09:07-1:09:14:**  or other so if you're what you're saying is that if you knew what the price of the long-term  
**1:09:14-1:09:19:**  trees was if you knew if you could get a good deal on the price of these of the tilia and  
**1:09:19-1:09:25:**  the nuts nuts tree and the walnuts you would become you know it would be very it could  
**1:09:25-1:09:30:**  be very interesting economically yeah that's what that's what you're saying because now  
**1:09:30-1:09:37:**  the uncertainty is making you a bit hesitate yeah you know yeah that's okay and then I  
**1:09:37-1:09:44:**  don't know also some uncertainty about the second cycle of poplar and maybe a third cycle  
**1:09:44-1:09:49:**  I don't know how it's gonna be maybe talking about a third cycle is too much but for sure  
**1:09:49-1:09:59:**  a second cycle it's possible yeah interesting so the main the main advantage of of polycyclic  
**1:09:59-1:10:06:**  forestry is is ecological then right it's also if you have for example a riparian area  
**1:10:06-1:10:09:**  which is a very sensitive area where you don't necessarily want to put a monoculture you  
**1:10:09-1:10:15:**  would like to be then it could be it's a good way of rationalizing and ecological your ecological  
**1:10:15-1:10:20:**  objectives and you know and getting an income from them yeah you know that's kind of what  
**1:10:20-1:10:30:**  I perceive no you're right I gave it for granted I mean I was of course one of the main advantage  
**1:10:30-1:10:37:**  of this kind of plantation even even if you want to talk about the the most economical  
**1:10:37-1:10:44:**  valuable plants like the poplar from a popular productive perspective it's still very interesting  
**1:10:44-1:10:57:**  because I totally reduced the intervention for pesticides or or also for fertilization  
**1:10:57-1:11:06:**  this is fertilizers yeah fertilizers I didn't do anything from the first year totally anything  
**1:11:06-1:11:13:**  and the plants are really healthy so far I've seen around plantation of poplar monoculture  
**1:11:13-1:11:21:**  really destroyed by a fertilizer and they work the soil underneath and it's completely  
**1:11:21-1:11:28:**  crazy so of course one of the main advantages the most interesting part of this plantation  
**1:11:28-1:11:36:**  is the the ecological synergy that they create and they they they about you also talking  
**1:11:36-1:11:49:**  about pruning to reduce a lot the pruning activity especially after talking about poplar  
**1:11:49-1:11:59:**  and walnuts and tillia after this fifth six year the plant goes very alone totally alone  
**1:11:59-1:12:06:**  very well wow and during those interesting so see sorry no sorry Dimitri and during the  
**1:12:06-1:12:13:**  first year of course has any plantation you have to do some pruning and activities yeah  
**1:12:13-1:12:19:**  yeah naturally so the management costs are lower it seems yeah implementation costs are  
**1:12:19-1:12:28:**  high management costs through the life cycle are lower yeah that's the main point yeah  
**1:12:28-1:12:35:**  that's very interesting and as you said if we knew about the price of the of the timber  
**1:12:35-1:12:44:**  wood the walnuts and tillia and wood for furniture of course we could say and to the farmer yeah  
**1:12:44-1:12:52:**  it's more convenient we could be more sure about there's a lot of it's making me think  
**1:12:52-1:12:58:**  a lot because you know how can we make these ecological well a key question we're asking  
**1:12:58-1:13:03:**  ourselves on the podcast and in general that people talk about in agroecology is how can  
**1:13:03-1:13:10:**  we make you know more ecological practices profitable and here your experience with the  
**1:13:10-1:13:15:**  with the polycyclic forestry is exactly that you know you're really experiencing firsthand  
**1:13:15-1:13:20:**  and giving us this feedback of how a system that is more ecologically you know it's much  
**1:13:20-1:13:25:**  more ecologically let's say respectful is also you know it's got some other challenges  
**1:13:25-1:13:29:**  but also high potential in a way you know we're starting to understand where is their  
**1:13:29-1:13:34:**  potential with for example the reduced management also the long-term fertility of the land of  
**1:13:34-1:13:39:**  the soil you know not depleting the soil of its you know being able to do more cycles  
**1:13:39-1:13:43:**  being able to when you do the final harvest put it back into production you're maintaining  
**1:13:43-1:13:49:**  your soil capital thanks to the diversity and the organic matter production etc and  
**1:13:49-1:13:56:**  also the fact that you're using no herbicides and no fertilizers etc and then that's you  
**1:13:56-1:14:02:**  know it's also a long-term game right yeah it's a long-term vision as compared to a more  
**1:14:02-1:14:07:**  short term you know like just popular monoculture for example which can give you a short-term  
**1:14:07-1:14:13:**  return that can be quite high especially with these prices now you know but so yeah I'm  
**1:14:13-1:14:17:**  saying these things so that people understand where we're you know where we're thinking  
**1:14:17-1:14:21:**  how how things are evolving in our heads with Etienne as we kind of try to evolve through  
**1:14:21-1:14:27:**  this agroforestry landscape yeah another interesting opportunity I have seen but I didn't exploit  
**1:14:27-1:14:37:**  it properly but after the first cut of the of the plane trees the the lights came into  
**1:14:37-1:14:46:**  the forest and I didn't use the that light and that soil that here I weren't I was not  
**1:14:46-1:14:55:**  ready to do and but yeah there are also some little opportunities after cutting I guess  
**1:14:55-1:15:00:**  next year when I will cut the poplar it would be the same yeah it's gonna be a big empty  
**1:15:00-1:15:11:**  I can use for a couple of years empty space I can use I could use and then now we start  
**1:15:11-1:15:16:**  talking about these opportunities you get into the conditionalities of the foundings  
**1:15:16-1:15:21:**  because when I got these foundings they allowed you to do this but then they don't allow to  
**1:15:21-1:15:30:**  do that so for example they don't allow you to I guess plant cucumbers or watermelon within  
**1:15:30-1:15:38:**  the forest or they don't allow you to graze animals underneath okay interesting yeah this  
**1:15:38-1:15:48:**  is some yeah weak weaker elements that I guess we're gonna face it and I guess the European  
**1:15:48-1:15:55:**  Union might interact with these needs and maybe change the conditionality they are proposing  
**1:15:55-1:16:02:**  you know we are into a European project our farm together with many others in Benetton  
**1:16:02-1:16:09:**  in Europe called agro mix and they are I guess you know about them they are talking about  
**1:16:09-1:16:14:**  these opportunities yeah yeah for sure that's very interesting we're in communication with  
**1:16:14-1:16:23:**  them to develop to try and collaborate in order to in order to do interviews with their  
**1:16:23-1:16:29:**  farms really and so we're talking with them and we've yeah so we started engaging with  
**1:16:29-1:16:35:**  them as an agricultural community and cool a few a few months back yeah so that's cool  
**1:16:35-1:16:42:**  that's nice to see that you're also part of this of this scheme and etc. I wanted to I  
**1:16:42-1:16:47:**  wanted to ask you if you think that this multi-cyclic forestry could be scaled up you know how if  
**1:16:47-1:16:52:**  you had if you had 50 hectares to use in forestry and you did the you did the test on five is  
**1:16:52-1:16:57:**  it something that you think could be scaled up to 50 is it reasonable this or would you  
**1:16:57-1:17:06:**  need to as you grow you need to go more towards simplification you know yeah no I would say  
**1:17:06-1:17:15:**  it's totally scalable I would if I had the more land I would I would do it I would do  
**1:17:15-1:17:24:**  it definitely and even I wouldn't change much in the scheme we have I mean we could think  
**1:17:24-1:17:35:**  about some testing on different medium cycle plants like the platanos could be it's really  
**1:17:35-1:17:44:**  an interesting plant actually yeah but I would do some testing with others and then the yeah  
**1:17:44-1:17:51:**  I would I would do it it's I would say it's scalable actually at the moment I was just  
**1:17:51-1:17:59:**  thinking talking with a friend who was asking who's looking for some land they want to they  
**1:17:59-1:18:06:**  are farmer in Verona they're looking for a place to for some piece of land to invest  
**1:18:06-1:18:13:**  instead of putting the money in the banks they are looking for a piece of land and yeah  
**1:18:13-1:18:21:**  it has always been on my mind to to spread this model on the on the on the land on the  
**1:18:21-1:18:25:**  surrounding and to get involved people that they want to put their money in the bank and  
**1:18:25-1:18:31:**  instead of that put it in in such a project this is something really I would like to make  
**1:18:31-1:18:40:**  it happen in a way in our land especially if the return is higher than than the than  
**1:18:40-1:18:48:**  the bank interest rates for example or then the the difference yeah in yeah well maybe  
**1:18:48-1:18:55:**  in 20 years you can say in 20 years just with the popular you can say my you might get the  
**1:18:55-1:19:02:**  investment back in then yeah interesting and then there's the whole conversation on carbon  
**1:19:02-1:19:07:**  credits and these things because this is gonna it's gonna come also new with the new energy  
**1:19:07-1:19:13:**  I guess yeah interesting that could also be funding the plantation of these of these systems  
**1:19:13-1:19:18:**  but that's a whole other conversation about the carbon credits we're at the beginning  
**1:19:18-1:19:23:**  yes but not we'll see in the next few years how it evolves for farmers and how they benefit  
**1:19:23-1:19:31:**  from it yeah now but see as a nice question what you ask and I'm really happy also to  
**1:19:31-1:19:38:**  did this I did this job with the in collaboration with this association called Alséa because  
**1:19:38-1:19:49:**  yeah they really with with this data we can really yeah compare it and and and show it  
**1:19:49-1:19:57:**  to to other farmers and show the results also not to the farmer but also to the policy maker  
**1:19:57-1:20:06:**  that they are writing down the funding schemes very interesting I'm curious why you know  
**1:20:06-1:20:11:**  you decided to kind of separate the popular because I'm sure you had heard even 10 years  
**1:20:11-1:20:18:**  ago about you know intercropping where you have you know poplars and and grains you know  
**1:20:18-1:20:24:**  throughout the landscape why did you decide to concentrate or maybe you know you've gone  
**1:20:24-1:20:28:**  through the decision process but maybe you can just tell us like what what's your opinion  
**1:20:28-1:20:34:**  on concentrating forestry together and then having separate grain production as compared  
**1:20:34-1:20:40:**  to having poplars and you know forestry and grains more integrated into crop what do you  
**1:20:40-1:20:49:**  think about this no in my case I did it because I wanted also there to create a barrier because  
**1:20:49-1:20:55:**  on the back of this forest we have a company making compost and making a lot of not really  
**1:20:55-1:21:03:**  nice sound and smells yeah so I wanted to create a bigger thicker barrier from them  
**1:21:03-1:21:09:**  but this is one of the then of course yeah I knew about this different schemes of cultivation  
**1:21:09-1:21:16:**  and my opinion I would I would keep an eye on this kind of I will keep an eye on on these  
**1:21:16-1:21:26:**  opportunities I would develop it in a you know like instead of having a line of trees  
**1:21:26-1:21:33:**  I would do like a complex model like I did in that my in my forest multi-cycle forest  
**1:21:33-1:21:41:**  so I would put all these tree cycles I described before within within a multiple line and be  
**1:21:41-1:21:48:**  in between these multiple lines of forest it's gonna be a mix between forest and edges  
**1:21:48-1:21:55:**  I would go that's how I see my farm in five years I guess yeah yeah that's very interesting  
**1:21:55-1:22:00:**  yeah I see I I can envision it as well so we have like a very highly productive you  
**1:22:00-1:22:07:**  know thick hedge or thin forest exactly and and and going in big lines and then you know  
**1:22:07-1:22:14:**  with maybe four or five six even eight different trees of different you know polycyclic style  
**1:22:14-1:22:21:**  and then in between big spaces for cultivating weeds for making every 40 50 meter yeah interesting  
**1:22:21-1:22:25:**  yeah that's we have to do that that's very exciting we have to find somewhere we can  
**1:22:25-1:22:32:**  try it out yeah very cool maybe that's how you're gonna do it on your land because you're  
**1:22:32-1:22:39:**  thinking of growing your your your polycyclic cultivation area so maybe that's an interesting  
**1:22:39-1:22:45:**  yeah yeah no but it's something really I would still if there are funding no doubt I would  
**1:22:45-1:22:52:**  do it without the funding I have to be to find a way to do it and it's gonna be harder  
**1:22:52-1:22:57:**  of course what what do you need when you say you know without the funding I need to find  
**1:22:57-1:23:03:**  a way to do it if we're just looking at your your issue here of of making it work economically  
**1:23:03-1:23:09:**  what do you need to have the confidence to invest or what do you need to to be able to  
**1:23:09-1:23:14:**  create that project without Europe just you know dishing out money no I just need time  
**1:23:14-1:23:21:**  I need time to to do it at the moment I have my because I have too many I have a multiple  
**1:23:21-1:23:33:**  multi multi multi farm how to say so we had so many activities that some have no time  
**1:23:33-1:23:38:**  to focus on one project and the other yeah and of course the funding doesn't give me  
**1:23:38-1:23:49:**  time but time is money in a way so they will make it happen and the other way I should  
**1:23:49-1:23:58:**  reduce the activity of the farm focus find the tranquility the to do it in a way but  
**1:23:58-1:24:03:**  still so it's more about thinking right it's about working out solutions you mean not finding  
**1:24:03-1:24:12:**  time to sit down and to organize and then to decide to do it and the funding give you  
**1:24:12-1:24:17:**  like a kick and and they tell you oh you have to do it there's a deadline I have to do it  
**1:24:17-1:24:24:**  in two months you have to to apply and then by next year it's gonna be done and then I  
**1:24:24-1:24:30:**  would do it would it be an option to go see the bank for these kind of projects or to  
**1:24:30-1:24:35:**  go see an investor somebody that would give you a loan you know is that something that  
**1:24:35-1:24:40:**  you you think would be viable or you you you wouldn't take the risk no no no it could be  
**1:24:40-1:24:48:**  it could be silly you know from this this funding issue it's a it's a it's an issue  
**1:24:48-1:24:53:**  because in a way it's cool they give you they give you money to do even cool stuff you can  
**1:24:53-1:25:01:**  you can apply for you have to also yeah adapt it to to your needs but it's possible and  
**1:25:01-1:25:07:**  you can do cool stuff and the other way they they steer the market they steer your decision  
**1:25:07-1:25:24:**  they steer it's not really see so but but would this is I mean since for example there  
**1:25:24-1:25:31:**  is the opportunity oh I know that there could be the opportunity to gain two thousand euro  
**1:25:31-1:25:38:**  per actor for example for that kind of plantation I would wait until maybe next year is going  
**1:25:38-1:25:45:**  to be a out this funding opportunity so I wait one year more to and I see if there is  
**1:25:45-1:25:50:**  because otherwise if the net the the year after they come out with this opportunity  
**1:25:50-1:25:57:**  and I just did it with my own or doing a loan or so on it's gonna be stupid so after the  
**1:25:57-1:26:05:**  experience I had I would say let's wait or let's let's push the European Union and each  
**1:26:05-1:26:15:**  region of Europe to to make a proper call for making this funding for finding this multiple  
**1:26:15-1:26:24:**  polycyclic plantation not only multicultural plantation but it's important they they they  
**1:26:24-1:26:33:**  should introduce this it's interesting I've got one last question for you and that is  
**1:26:33-1:26:39:**  what would you have done differently in your multi cyclic or polycyclic forestry plantation  
**1:26:39-1:26:43:**  what are the top if I were to go and plant my own now what would you what things and  
**1:26:43-1:26:47:**  I was to you know inspire myself from your work and and your system what would you do  
**1:26:47-1:26:59:**  differently what would you tell me Laura if I have to talk about the edges I wouldn't  
**1:26:59-1:27:10:**  plant the prunus spinosa guys because it's full of spines interesting that's the one  
**1:27:10-1:27:18:**  I did it I thought how I'm gonna be no it's too much spines and talking about the the  
**1:27:18-1:27:28:**  polycyclic forestry plantation as I told you I wouldn't modify almost everything maybe  
**1:27:28-1:27:38:**  maybe some distances between platanos a little bit higher now they are at two meters maybe  
**1:27:38-1:27:48:**  two meters and a half but then really I like the the way it has been designed and so interesting  
**1:27:48-1:27:55:**  yeah I I did the in the 82 forest polycyclic for one in the south with the popular and  
**1:27:55-1:28:02:**  the one in the north without the popular and I found a much better the one with the popular  
**1:28:02-1:28:12:**  because the public gives much more space within work so what I suggest if I should have to  
**1:28:12-1:28:16:**  do it again I would do it all with it with the popular with this triple with the cycle  
**1:28:16-1:28:27:**  yeah popular medium long and very short cycle interesting very interesting listen Fede I'm  
**1:28:27-1:28:33:**  not gonna take more of your time because you've already been very generous and no it was fascinating  
**1:28:33-1:28:40:**  interview really interesting and for me it was really a pleasure to be here in super  
**1:28:40-1:28:47:**  cool podcast really interesting yeah thank you I really appreciate we really appreciate  
**1:28:47-1:28:53:**  that so let's I hope we get to visit the farm again soon as well and yeah you're always  
**1:28:53-1:29:04:**  welcome and I welcome all of you listener to visit us well that's it for us today thank  
**1:29:04-1:29:10:**  you so much for listening sorry for the the slight interruptions that Fede and I were  
**1:29:10-1:29:15:**  doing with each other there was a slight lag in the conversation due to internet problems  
**1:29:15-1:29:19:**  so sometimes it didn't flow as nicely as we would like but anyways thank you so much for  
**1:29:19-1:29:25:**  making it this far and we really look forward to releasing the next episode

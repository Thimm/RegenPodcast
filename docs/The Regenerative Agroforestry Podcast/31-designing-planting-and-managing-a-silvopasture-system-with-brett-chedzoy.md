### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:25:03)
**0:00:00-0:00:14:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:14-0:00:17:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:17-0:00:21:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:21-0:00:26:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:26-0:00:31:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:31-0:00:32:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:32-0:00:36:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:36-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:47:**  Hi and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:49:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:49-0:00:53:**  Today we have the pleasure of having Brett back on the show.  
**0:00:53-0:00:59:**  We did an episode with him about a year ago and learned a lot about silvopasture and we  
**0:00:59-0:01:03:**  really wanted to have him back a second time because he has so much more knowledge to share  
**0:01:03-0:01:04:**  with us.  
**0:01:04-0:01:12:**  And this week we were able to really focus on planting a silvopasture system, you know,  
**0:01:12-0:01:17:**  which trees to plant, where to plant them and we're able to cover lots of practical  
**0:01:17-0:01:23:**  details from the design to the management of establishing new silvopasture systems.  
**0:01:23-0:01:28:**  We were also able to go into living barns, which is a really smart way of using some  
**0:01:28-0:01:32:**  coniferous plantations to shelter animals during the winter.  
**0:01:32-0:01:36:**  I hope you enjoyed the episode as much as I did.  
**0:01:36-0:01:40:**  Hi Brett and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:01:40-0:01:46:**  Thank you so much for coming back for a second conversation and a second round.  
**0:01:46-0:01:48:**  Thank you Etienne.  
**0:01:48-0:01:54:**  I was thinking we could kick this episode off with a brief introduction of what you  
**0:01:54-0:02:00:**  do and who you are for people who haven't listened to you in the previous episode so  
**0:02:00-0:02:03:**  they can get a sense of your context.  
**0:02:03-0:02:05:**  I'm Brett Chedzoy.  
**0:02:05-0:02:10:**  I work as a forester for Cornell Cooperative Extension in upstate New York.  
**0:02:10-0:02:19:**  I cover 11 county region of the state helping woodland owners and land management professionals  
**0:02:19-0:02:21:**  be better stewards of their woods.  
**0:02:21-0:02:29:**  I also work part time in agricultural issues, particularly grazing management.  
**0:02:29-0:02:36:**  And agroforestry though is my unofficial passion.  
**0:02:36-0:02:43:**  I've been working in education around civil pasturing but also other agroforestry systems  
**0:02:43-0:02:49:**  such as maple syrup production for my 15 years in extension.  
**0:02:49-0:02:57:**  And that's the day job our family owns and operates ranching operations in the Watkins  
**0:02:57-0:03:03:**  Glen New York area and also in central Argentina in the Sierra Mountains.  
**0:03:03-0:03:08:**  My wife Maria is from central Argentina.  
**0:03:08-0:03:15:**  We bought our ranch there in 1994 and have been developing it into a civil pasture ranch  
**0:03:15-0:03:17:**  ever since.  
**0:03:17-0:03:20:**  And the same is true of our family farm in New York.  
**0:03:20-0:03:27:**  It was a dairy farm until the mid 80s and when we settled back here in the early 2000s  
**0:03:27-0:03:32:**  we tried to take what we were doing in Argentina and apply it here and we raised our three  
**0:03:32-0:03:34:**  children here on the farm.  
**0:03:34-0:03:41:**  They're all off into college and adulthood now but it's civil pasturing has been a great  
**0:03:41-0:03:45:**  fit for our farm in both corners of the world.  
**0:03:45-0:03:52:**  And here in New York though it's helped us in many ways keep our farm more profitable  
**0:03:52-0:03:53:**  and enjoyable.  
**0:03:53-0:03:56:**  So look forward to talking with you about that.  
**0:03:56-0:04:01:**  Yeah well you know there's so much to talk about and last time we did a pretty good first  
**0:04:01-0:04:07:**  shot at it and we were able to cover a lot of a bit of a bigger picture of silver pasture,  
**0:04:07-0:04:13:**  a lot of the different interactions and it was a really fascinating introduction to silver  
**0:04:13-0:04:22:**  pasture and we also covered a bit how to establish, you know convert wood to a silver pasture  
**0:04:22-0:04:27:**  system but this time I would like us to go a bit more into some detail about that and  
**0:04:27-0:04:34:**  specifically on your experience on those two farms understanding what choices you made  
**0:04:34-0:04:38:**  and you know what worked and what didn't and what you learned from all of that.  
**0:04:38-0:04:47:**  So to get us started maybe you can tell us which silver pasture systems did you establish  
**0:04:47-0:04:49:**  on both farms.  
**0:04:49-0:04:56:**  So here in New York we live in the middle of the forest and our farm is was well was  
**0:04:56-0:05:01:**  and still is predominantly covered with trees but that's true of much of the northeastern  
**0:05:01-0:05:04:**  United States.  
**0:05:04-0:05:16:**  So here we were using primarily the existing trees to use as the base for creating productive  
**0:05:16-0:05:24:**  silver pastures what we call wood silver pastures and we also though had been planting trees  
**0:05:24-0:05:34:**  on our farm since 1988 so we've used since taken those plantations and developed them  
**0:05:34-0:05:36:**  into plantation silver pastures.  
**0:05:36-0:05:45:**  Now on the ranch in Argentina the Argentines like to quip that God gave them great soil  
**0:05:45-0:05:53:**  and rainfall and climate for growing trees but then forgot to put the trees there so  
**0:05:53-0:05:58:**  when I started working there in the early 1990s with these large ranching operations  
**0:05:58-0:06:05:**  many of whom were owned and being managed by people with forestry backgrounds they saw  
**0:06:05-0:06:10:**  it as their mission to put the trees there and that's what we've been doing on our ranch  
**0:06:10-0:06:18:**  there as well since 1998 was the first year we planted trees on our ranch in Argentina  
**0:06:18-0:06:21:**  several years after we bought it.  
**0:06:21-0:06:30:**  So there it's entirely plantation silver pasture where we're starting from scratch so we have  
**0:06:30-0:06:37:**  the grasslands and we have good rainfall this is a in central Argentina it's about a 40  
**0:06:37-0:06:46:**  inch or a thousand millimeter a year rainfall climate but then so that that is very conducive  
**0:06:46-0:06:51:**  to growing a lot of different types of trees there although we found that some species  
**0:06:51-0:06:57:**  work better than others and we can talk more specifically about that later on.  
**0:06:57-0:07:03:**  Perfect thanks for recapping a bit of those different systems and I think it would be  
**0:07:03-0:07:11:**  good to start with what you call plantation silver pasture systems and bringing trees  
**0:07:11-0:07:17:**  then into pasture maybe starting with what you've been doing in the US you could tell  
**0:07:17-0:07:23:**  us a bit about the function that you that these trees have and why you felt the need  
**0:07:23-0:07:27:**  to bring them into pastures in the first place.  
**0:07:27-0:07:34:**  I feel that trees on both of our ranches contribute significantly in a number of ways but just  
**0:07:34-0:07:40:**  to talk about in the context of our farm here in New York I feel that the trees obviously  
**0:07:40-0:07:48:**  are a timber crop but they also provide shade for our grazing livestock which is very important  
**0:07:48-0:07:56:**  throughout the grazing season here if you look on any sunny day where it's more than  
**0:07:56-0:08:02:**  mildly warm the animals are actively seeking out shade so in the silver pastures we can  
**0:08:02-0:08:11:**  create extensive disperse shade for them versus just a field edge or a couple shade trees.  
**0:08:11-0:08:16:**  It certainly helps enhance habitat for a lot of the wildlife that's important to us here  
**0:08:16-0:08:18:**  on the farm.  
**0:08:18-0:08:26:**  We love the way our silver pastures look for their aesthetic quality and then I think finally  
**0:08:26-0:08:33:**  but equally important the keeping the trees in these more natural grazing systems these  
**0:08:33-0:08:40:**  silver pastures helps improve the health of the soil and also gives us other so-called  
**0:08:40-0:08:42:**  ecosystem services.  
**0:08:42-0:08:48:**  And how has this then you know translated into the design of these systems what trees  
**0:08:48-0:08:55:**  that you select to both accomplish you know shelter but also with the timber value as  
**0:08:55-0:08:57:**  you just mentioned.  
**0:08:57-0:09:04:**  Here in New York we rely primarily on natural regeneration trees are what want to just come  
**0:09:04-0:09:11:**  into the landscape on their own when we stop mowing fields or mowing the lawn or planting  
**0:09:11-0:09:19:**  a garden and we've planted tens of thousands of trees here on the farm in New York over  
**0:09:19-0:09:26:**  the past 30 some years particularly though where we felt something was missing.  
**0:09:26-0:09:32:**  In Argentina that numbers more in the hundreds of thousands of trees in both cases though  
**0:09:32-0:09:40:**  both New York and Argentina we chose trees that we felt would not just survive but thrive  
**0:09:40-0:09:45:**  and contribute to the goals of our grazing farms.  
**0:09:45-0:09:52:**  We weren't successful in all cases in terms of picking trees that would survive over time  
**0:09:52-0:09:57:**  but over the past 30 some years we've made a lot of progress.  
**0:09:57-0:10:03:**  And I'd like to add though in case I forget to do so later on I keep saying we I'm obviously  
**0:10:03-0:10:12:**  talking about Maria my wife and our family our children Ian, Claire and Joe but particularly  
**0:10:12-0:10:17:**  in Argentina where we're relying on some some great people to make all this happen.  
**0:10:17-0:10:25:**  I have to credit a longtime Forester friend Esteban Zuppan who has been the caretaker  
**0:10:25-0:10:32:**  of our ranch for since we left there in the early 2000s and if it wasn't for Esteban and  
**0:10:32-0:10:40:**  a lot of other great people that have helped us over the years Antonio, Vicente, Juan it  
**0:10:40-0:10:45:**  just wouldn't have happened because we can only really be farming in one place at one  
**0:10:45-0:10:46:**  time.  
**0:10:46-0:10:53:**  Just coming back to this design of silver pasture systems could you give us the name  
**0:10:53-0:11:01:**  of some of the trees then that you've established in the US and in Argentina?  
**0:11:01-0:11:08:**  Here on the farm in New York we've planted a mix of both coniferous species, pines, firs,  
**0:11:08-0:11:13:**  starch, spruce and hardwood species.  
**0:11:13-0:11:22:**  Two of our favorites have been black walnut, juglans nigra and black locust, robinia pseudoacassia.  
**0:11:22-0:11:29:**  Black locust which is a tree my understanding is it's widely planted in parts of Europe.  
**0:11:29-0:11:36:**  I think in many ways is the perfect tree for agroforestry systems particularly silver pasture  
**0:11:36-0:11:39:**  systems because it checks all the boxes.  
**0:11:39-0:11:47:**  It's a fast growing tree, it's relatively easy and inexpensive to establish.  
**0:11:47-0:11:55:**  It's a nitrogen fixing tree, it has foliage that leafs out late in the spring so it allows  
**0:11:55-0:12:03:**  a lot of sunlight to come through and promote early spring ephemeral growth in our pastures.  
**0:12:03-0:12:10:**  But I think most importantly it's a tree that can be harvested at a relatively small size  
**0:12:10-0:12:15:**  or young age and be used for valuable products.  
**0:12:15-0:12:21:**  Being a grazing farm one of our biggest expenses is building fences and maintaining fences  
**0:12:21-0:12:27:**  and that requires a lot of fence posts.  
**0:12:27-0:12:34:**  About 80% of the cost of a fence is the cost of the post and installing that post.  
**0:12:34-0:12:42:**  So over time we've tried to utilize living trees more as our living fence posts.  
**0:12:42-0:12:45:**  We can go back and talk about that more if you're interested.  
**0:12:45-0:12:51:**  It's not a simple matter of just attaching your fence or fence insulators directly to  
**0:12:51-0:12:53:**  a living tree.  
**0:12:53-0:12:55:**  That wouldn't work.  
**0:12:55-0:13:03:**  But where we have to harvest trees, turn them into fence posts, locusts is really our only  
**0:13:03-0:13:07:**  truly durable native species.  
**0:13:07-0:13:13:**  So we found these locusts and when we were planting these locusts over 30 years ago,  
**0:13:13-0:13:19:**  I should add that at that time we were not, even though it was a family dairy farm, we  
**0:13:19-0:13:26:**  really weren't grazing livestock so there wasn't a lot of importance to us to be planting  
**0:13:26-0:13:31:**  trees for silvopastures or for producing fence posts.  
**0:13:31-0:13:42:**  But when we really started to turn the farm into this grazing operation in the early 2000s  
**0:13:42-0:13:49:**  we realized that we could either go buy pressure treated pine posts from somewhere halfway  
**0:13:49-0:13:54:**  across the United States or we could be harvesting the black locust trees that we had planted  
**0:13:54-0:13:58:**  15 and 20 years earlier and use those for our fence posts.  
**0:13:58-0:14:06:**  And it became a big savings for us to be able to use these homegrown posts.  
**0:14:06-0:14:11:**  So I really like locusts for a lot of reasons but not least of which is it's rather unique  
**0:14:11-0:14:19:**  for us in that it's a tree that we can be harvesting and utilizing in 15 to 20 years  
**0:14:19-0:14:26:**  versus 50 or more years which is more typical of the tree species that we grow here for  
**0:14:26-0:14:28:**  saw timber products.  
**0:14:28-0:14:36:**  Yeah that's interesting because I was wondering in terms of layout if sometimes there was  
**0:14:36-0:14:42:**  a clash between the function of shade and trying to produce decent timber because you  
**0:14:42-0:14:46:**  know for example you might put trees out for shade and animals might spend a lot of time  
**0:14:46-0:14:51:**  underneath and create a lot of compaction or vice versa but it seems that what you're  
**0:14:51-0:14:56:**  saying is that you've managed to find a tree like acacia that's actually very hardy and  
**0:14:56-0:15:01:**  can take like the presence of animals pretty well and is you know pretty tough.  
**0:15:01-0:15:06:**  So if we're doing if we're setting up our civil pastures correctly and managing them  
**0:15:06-0:15:13:**  correctly the livestock impact to those trees should be pretty minimal and I think we talked  
**0:15:13-0:15:21:**  about this pretty extensively last year in our first episode of how we go about doing  
**0:15:21-0:15:27:**  intensive rotational grazing and allowing long rest and recovery periods between each  
**0:15:27-0:15:33:**  time that they pass through a given paddock or a portion of our entire pasture system  
**0:15:33-0:15:39:**  and that's really I think the most important way that we reduce the impacts on trees particularly  
**0:15:39-0:15:45:**  young trees is we just never let the animals stay there long enough to where they become  
**0:15:45-0:15:53:**  bored and restless and start to rub on the trees or spend too much time loafing around  
**0:15:53-0:16:01:**  under the trees they go in they put their heads down they graze the portion of the pasture  
**0:16:01-0:16:08:**  that we want them to graze they may take some nibbles off of any low-lying tree limbs or  
**0:16:08-0:16:10:**  shrubs that are there as well.  
**0:16:10-0:16:19:**  It's really interesting and enjoyable to watch grazing animals because they know and I'm  
**0:16:19-0:16:25:**  sure it's a subconscious process but they know what they need to seek out in terms of  
**0:16:25-0:16:30:**  food selection so in our civil pastures we have a lot of plant diversity we don't have  
**0:16:30-0:16:36:**  just herbaceous plants like grasses and forbs we have these woody plants and browse as well  
**0:16:36-0:16:43:**  and when we watch our animals move every day into a fresh paddock they will often first  
**0:16:43-0:16:49:**  walk over to any woody browse nibble on that for maybe the first five to ten minutes and  
**0:16:49-0:16:55:**  then they seem to get their fill of whatever it was they were subconsciously seeking out  
**0:16:55-0:17:01:**  in that browse and then they turn their attention to what we think of as the pasture the grass  
**0:17:01-0:17:03:**  plants.  
**0:17:03-0:17:09:**  We're actually preparing an episode with Fred Provenza who's been writing on nutritional  
**0:17:09-0:17:15:**  intelligence of livestock so you know I'll have a few more answers for you in a few weeks  
**0:17:15-0:17:21:**  or you can just listen to the next episodes because that's what we'll be exploring.  
**0:17:21-0:17:27:**  I'm really pleased to hear that because Fred I have found to be one of the most knowledgeable  
**0:17:27-0:17:38:**  and most interesting people that can talk so eloquently about that process of how animals  
**0:17:38-0:17:48:**  behave and how they select and seek out this food source versus that food source.  
**0:17:48-0:17:54:**  So that is definitely a podcast episode I will be listening to.  
**0:17:54-0:17:59:**  And so if I'm to recap a bit and to make sure I understood you have these acacias that were  
**0:17:59-0:18:06:**  actually planted before you were even thinking of silvopasture and then are there any other  
**0:18:06-0:18:12:**  trees that you added since then a bit with a more like conscious design of the animals  
**0:18:12-0:18:14:**  needs for example in mind?  
**0:18:14-0:18:20:**  So to give you just a really broad overview of our planting history on our farm in New  
**0:18:20-0:18:32:**  York in the past 33 years we've planted at least 33 different tree species at a significant  
**0:18:32-0:18:37:**  scale now that doesn't count all the other oddball species that we plant more just for  
**0:18:37-0:18:44:**  fun what we would think of as like a specimen tree.  
**0:18:44-0:18:51:**  But here's what we've learned the hard way of those three dozen or so tree species that  
**0:18:51-0:18:54:**  we've planted.  
**0:18:54-0:19:04:**  We've lost probably almost two thirds of those trees over time to mostly pest issues that  
**0:19:04-0:19:10:**  we didn't anticipate when we were planting those trees so many of the tree species that  
**0:19:10-0:19:21:**  we've planted were to complement and build on the several dozen tree species that grow  
**0:19:21-0:19:24:**  on our farm naturally.  
**0:19:24-0:19:32:**  So we have very diverse mostly deciduous forest here of oak and maple and cherry and walnut  
**0:19:32-0:19:43:**  and basswood I believe you call it lime or Tilo and parts of Europe hickories just lots  
**0:19:43-0:19:46:**  and lots of different tree species.  
**0:19:46-0:19:54:**  What we lack are more the conifer species and then we don't have enough of some of these  
**0:19:54-0:20:01:**  other hardwood trees that we value such as black locust even though black locust is somewhat  
**0:20:01-0:20:05:**  a naturally occurring tree here in parts of New York.  
**0:20:05-0:20:10:**  So we tried to pick trees we weren't planting the same things that already grew here but  
**0:20:10-0:20:18:**  planting additional trees and what we found is that when you plant trees that don't naturally  
**0:20:18-0:20:26:**  occur here many of them end up being susceptible to pests that eventually catch up to them  
**0:20:26-0:20:29:**  in these new locations.  
**0:20:29-0:20:36:**  To give you some examples we've planted a lot of Douglas fir which is a western US species  
**0:20:36-0:20:43:**  and Douglas fir suffers from a foliar fungal disease called rhabdicline needle cast.  
**0:20:43-0:20:48:**  So we have beautiful looking Doug fir for the first 15 years we planted here and then  
**0:20:48-0:20:54:**  for the past 15 years we've all but lost it to this fungal disease and the same has happened  
**0:20:54-0:21:01:**  to some of our pine species it's happened to some of our spruce species and of course  
**0:21:01-0:21:06:**  now we have pests that are attacking some of the hardwood species too.  
**0:21:06-0:21:14:**  One of the more serious current pests is called the emerald ash borer which causes essentially  
**0:21:14-0:21:20:**  100% mortality in all species of ash or fraxenus.  
**0:21:20-0:21:27:**  But to understand kind of your thought process and your design process you started with an  
**0:21:27-0:21:34:**  open field or pasture and then you know where did you place trees and how did you decide  
**0:21:34-0:21:39:**  for example spacings and lines etc.  
**0:21:39-0:21:46:**  Early on we followed the models that had been used traditionally and that was plantation  
**0:21:46-0:21:50:**  forestry at fairly high densities per acre.  
**0:21:50-0:22:00:**  We were planting trees on as little as a 2 by 2 meter spacing and that worked okay for  
**0:22:00-0:22:09:**  the conifers like the pines and the firs and the larch because those seedlings were relatively  
**0:22:09-0:22:17:**  inexpensive and they also didn't require as much tender loving care to get them established.  
**0:22:17-0:22:26:**  With hardwoods, hardwoods are a little more difficult to get established in the first  
**0:22:26-0:22:30:**  few years because they're more sensitive to herbaceous competition.  
**0:22:30-0:22:36:**  They also seem to be magnets for a variety of wildlife that want to come and either eat  
**0:22:36-0:22:41:**  the foliage or the roots or the bark off those young trees.  
**0:22:41-0:22:44:**  And they're also typically seedlings that are more expensive.  
**0:22:44-0:22:54:**  So we've done different designs with different groups or mixes of trees.  
**0:22:54-0:23:03:**  In what I would do today and we haven't done extensive tree planting here on the farm for  
**0:23:03-0:23:08:**  not since the first few years we moved back and today what we find is we're planting Rosa  
**0:23:08-0:23:14:**  trees along our internal fences more for shade but we're also using species like black locust  
**0:23:14-0:23:22:**  to have the ability to spread naturally on their own over time once you have a row of  
**0:23:22-0:23:23:**  bigger trees.  
**0:23:23-0:23:29:**  What I would do today is probably plant fewer trees per acre, add more species to the mix  
**0:23:29-0:23:35:**  to hedge against those risks that I just talked about with unforeseen pest issues.  
**0:23:35-0:23:43:**  But first and foremost I always would be thinking about ease of maintenance and people that  
**0:23:43-0:23:50:**  have not planted trees before I think underestimate how much work goes into it after that first  
**0:23:50-0:23:53:**  step of putting trees in the ground.  
**0:23:53-0:24:01:**  So to me that's just the very starting point and I want to always try to design any tree  
**0:24:01-0:24:07:**  planting in a way that I can go in there and maintain it for at least several years and  
**0:24:07-0:24:13:**  in some cases you may be able to get trees to a point where you can leave them largely  
**0:24:13-0:24:19:**  onto their own in just a few years and in other cases it may take 10 years or more for  
**0:24:19-0:24:24:**  those trees to get to the point where you can then give them less attention and less  
**0:24:24-0:24:27:**  care.  
**0:24:27-0:24:33:**  In situations where we're going to have to think about managing the weeds or the grass  
**0:24:33-0:24:39:**  that's growing in between the trees we need to think about straight rows would work better  
**0:24:39-0:24:49:**  to be able to mow between the rows than groups of trees or something where the trees aren't  
**0:24:49-0:24:52:**  in nice straight patterns.  
**0:24:52-0:24:58:**  The other thing we need to think about is the probability that we may have to irrigate  
**0:24:58-0:25:05:**  or water those trees and if it's fairly small planting in rows we might be able to set up  
**0:25:05-0:25:10:**  drip irrigation and if not then we have to think about how can we haul water out to those  
**0:25:10-0:25:18:**  trees which honestly may not be even possible in areas that are too steep or too rocky or  
**0:25:18-0:25:23:**  have other barriers and obstacles.  
**0:25:23-0:25:30:**  So it's interesting because in a sense most of the planting of trees occurred before you  
**0:25:30-0:25:32:**  started really focusing on grazing then.  
**0:25:32-0:25:37:**  It more happened in the sense that first you had plantations of wood for timber and then  
**0:25:37-0:25:41:**  you were thinking how can I run through my animals.  
**0:25:41-0:25:48:**  Here in New York most of our tree planting happened prior to becoming grazers but everything  
**0:25:48-0:25:56:**  that we've planted since we started raising livestock we're planting in ways that we can  
**0:25:56-0:26:04:**  maintain it and protect it and that's why planting single rows adjacent to our existing  
**0:26:04-0:26:10:**  internal subdivision fences what we call our paddock fences that has worked well because  
**0:26:10-0:26:15:**  we already have a fence on one side of the row of trees and then it's pretty easy to  
**0:26:15-0:26:24:**  set up a temporary fence on the other side to exclude animals at least temporarily from  
**0:26:24-0:26:31:**  those young trees and if we set it up properly so most of our internal fencing is just a  
**0:26:31-0:26:37:**  single hot wire and keep in mind that we raise cattle we used to raise a lot of sheep and  
**0:26:37-0:26:47:**  goats with cattle a single hot wire fencing will usually be effective in keeping the animals  
**0:26:47-0:26:57:**  in or out of where you want them with sheep and goats a single hot wire probably is not  
**0:26:57-0:27:04:**  so what we've tried to do where we're planting single rows of trees along our internal fences  
**0:27:04-0:27:14:**  is keep that wire just high enough above the ground usually 50 to 60 centimeters and just  
**0:27:14-0:27:21:**  far out enough from the trees that the cows can't quite reach over and heavily browse  
**0:27:21-0:27:30:**  the young trees or rub on the trunks and possibly girdle or damage the bark of those young trees  
**0:27:30-0:27:36:**  but to the extent that the cows can reach under those single wires and graze at least  
**0:27:36-0:27:43:**  part of the grass that not only helps maintain the fence but it also reduces the amount of  
**0:27:43-0:27:52:**  vegetation that we have growing around those young trees and we still have to do some supplemental  
**0:27:52-0:28:00:**  maintenance whether it's mowing or mulching or in some cases we've had to spray because  
**0:28:00-0:28:07:**  it's not just the part of the grass and other weeds that's growing above the ground that  
**0:28:07-0:28:12:**  are affecting those young trees it's the roots below the ground that are competing with those  
**0:28:12-0:28:19:**  young trees as well it's quite interesting that you you had this progression and you  
**0:28:19-0:28:24:**  know that you were planting trees for different reasons in different phases and I'm interested  
**0:28:24-0:28:31:**  to see the different rationales if you were to continue planting trees would you still  
**0:28:31-0:28:35:**  include some in the middle of some paddocks or in the end you know do you really recommend  
**0:28:35-0:28:42:**  circling around the paddocks following those existing fences for example I think to do  
**0:28:42-0:28:49:**  it all over again etienne I would probably try to get the trees planted and established  
**0:28:49-0:28:55:**  before we even started grazing it and that's just inadvertently how it worked out on much  
**0:28:55-0:29:00:**  of the farm here in New York now in Argentina we've always been planting concurrently with  
**0:29:00-0:29:08:**  the grazing and but there we're planting fast growing mostly fast growing pine species and  
**0:29:08-0:29:16:**  we find that we can start to graze those young plantations within just two to three years  
**0:29:16-0:29:27:**  of planting what's really important to keep in mind though is that the way we would graze  
**0:29:27-0:29:32:**  in and amongst young trees is probably quite different than the way we would graze in and  
**0:29:32-0:29:41:**  amongst older larger trees so when I talk about starting to graze in a young plantation  
**0:29:41-0:29:49:**  or a young plantation silvopasture whether it's in two years or five years or ten years  
**0:29:49-0:29:57:**  that doesn't mean it's the same same duration of grazing or the same timing of when the  
**0:29:57-0:30:06:**  animals are in there as we would in a like a mature wood silvopasture because the larger  
**0:30:06-0:30:15:**  trees are largely resistant to things like animals that want to scratch themselves on  
**0:30:15-0:30:23:**  the tree or nibble on the foliage doesn't matter if they nibble on the foliage of low  
**0:30:23-0:30:28:**  hanging branches that doesn't affect a mature tree to any significant extent but it would  
**0:30:28-0:30:37:**  if it was a young tree that was maybe just a couple meters tall and one hungry animal  
**0:30:37-0:30:42:**  comes over and strips half the foliage off that tree that's going to put quite a bit  
**0:30:42-0:30:49:**  of stress on that young tree I think the bigger vulnerability there though is that the animals  
**0:30:49-0:30:56:**  will come over and rub on the trees and so we try not to ever have animals on either  
**0:30:56-0:31:06:**  ranch in areas of young trees during times of the grazing season where they're being  
**0:31:06-0:31:16:**  stressed by external parasites particularly horn flies biting fly that just drives the  
**0:31:16-0:31:22:**  animals crazy during the hot summer months and for them for the cattle at those times  
**0:31:22-0:31:29:**  of the year a young tree looks like the ideal scratching post because it's flexible and  
**0:31:29-0:31:38:**  it usually has low hanging limbs so we've we've lost some trees in the past because  
**0:31:38-0:31:45:**  we've perhaps put them in there for a little too long or not quite the right time but that's  
**0:31:45-0:31:52:**  not to say that we can't graze young plantation silvopastures at all we just need to think  
**0:31:52-0:31:57:**  about doing it either before the trees start to leaf out in the case of hardwoods or we  
**0:31:57-0:32:04:**  need to think about moving the animals through there more quickly and doing it at a time  
**0:32:04-0:32:11:**  where they have really lush grass and the animals will just focus on grazing like we  
**0:32:11-0:32:15:**  call it flash grazing they'll they'll take off that young succulent growth but then we  
**0:32:15-0:32:20:**  move them out of there perhaps just a few hours later before they turn their attention  
**0:32:20-0:32:27:**  to the young trees but I'm wondering because clearly it's a bit different to you know plants  
**0:32:27-0:32:34:**  out a timber plantation and then graze your animals through it or to plant trees around  
**0:32:34-0:32:39:**  a grazing system with the aims of you know increasing its productivity or animal welfare  
**0:32:39-0:32:45:**  etc and I'm wondering now that you you have both experiences you've been both planting  
**0:32:45-0:32:51:**  for timber production and also then you have grazing what what would you do today or how  
**0:32:51-0:32:57:**  might those two different types of planting differ in terms of spacing for example the  
**0:32:57-0:33:06:**  needs of hardwood trees or deciduous trees like nut trees for example are quite different  
**0:33:06-0:33:16:**  than those of coniferous trees so many coniferous species like pines, large fir, spruce those  
**0:33:16-0:33:25:**  trees tend to grow in a we call it a pyramidical form so just think of a classic pine tree  
**0:33:25-0:33:35:**  it has a typically a nice straight stem the branches grow out to form a nice well-shaped  
**0:33:35-0:33:42:**  crown so but if you if you can picture a pine tree the way we draw a little stick diagrams  
**0:33:42-0:33:47:**  of pine trees it looks like a little pyramid whereas if you think about how a hardwood  
**0:33:47-0:33:55:**  tree grows it grows like a wine glass so the the crown grows outwards and it may still  
**0:33:55-0:34:02:**  be a nice straight trunk but hardwoods typically can out compete softwoods because they just  
**0:34:02-0:34:09:**  get their heads up above the softwoods more quickly and they spread their crowns out over  
**0:34:09-0:34:21:**  the top of these little slender pointed shape softwoods therefore if we're going to plant  
**0:34:21-0:34:29:**  a mix to establish silvopastures we probably need to think about a design that segregates  
**0:34:29-0:34:36:**  the hardwoods the the broad crowned hardwoods from the pointy crowned softwoods for at least  
**0:34:36-0:34:42:**  enough time that the softwoods don't get quickly over top like putting an umbrella over the  
**0:34:42-0:34:50:**  top of the pine tree and most conifer species need pretty much full sunlight there are some  
**0:34:50-0:34:58:**  exceptions of conifers that have significant shade tolerance but many are sun lovers and  
**0:34:58-0:35:04:**  hardwoods most species that we value in silvopasture systems are also sun lovers not least of which  
**0:35:04-0:35:10:**  is black locusts but they they have the ability to send out a branch up through that hole  
**0:35:10-0:35:18:**  and maybe grow more off to the side where they they they see sunlight and grow away  
**0:35:18-0:35:27:**  from competing neighbor trees conifers don't do that well they typically grow straight  
**0:35:27-0:35:34:**  up and if something gets over the top of them it'll really slow down the growth and possibly  
**0:35:34-0:35:39:**  cause them to perish over time because they're not getting enough sunlight for photosynthesis  
**0:35:39-0:35:49:**  to sustain themselves so i like to try to when we're planting trees we're usually thinking  
**0:35:49-0:35:56:**  about either hardwood mixes or softwood mixes in that combining them together now i can  
**0:35:56-0:36:03:**  think of many cases where it may make sense to combine them together but that just adds  
**0:36:03-0:36:08:**  one more layer of complexity to the design and the ongoing maintenance for those trees  
**0:36:08-0:36:17:**  and in argentina we plant mostly conifers particularly pines because they seem to be  
**0:36:17-0:36:25:**  best adapted to the conditions of our ranch these are soils that they're fertile soils  
**0:36:25-0:36:32:**  but they're relatively low in organic matter they're granite based soils that are very  
**0:36:32-0:36:40:**  drought prone and the pines tend to tolerate those periodically droughty conditions better  
**0:36:40-0:36:46:**  than hardwoods that's not to say that we don't have good sites within our ranch there to  
**0:36:46-0:36:53:**  plant hardwoods but pines are what thrive here in new york it's really just the opposite  
**0:36:53-0:36:59:**  that the the conifers grow and can grow great quite well but the hardwoods just grow so  
**0:36:59-0:37:09:**  much better so we're taking better advantage of the site quality here in new york to plant  
**0:37:09-0:37:18:**  hardwoods that said we've planted many softwood mixes over the years and when we were planting  
**0:37:18-0:37:24:**  those we planted them for reasons that had more to do with the site quality than thinking  
**0:37:24-0:37:36:**  about using those in the future silvopastures today many of our conifer plantations today  
**0:37:36-0:37:43:**  we i think we generally think of them as silvopastures but we more specifically think of them as  
**0:37:43-0:37:50:**  our living barns and a way of another way of thinking of a living barn would be like  
**0:37:50-0:38:00:**  a wooded shelter area for livestock during extreme weather particularly winter weather  
**0:38:00-0:38:11:**  and that's one thing that sets us apart here in new york sorry and perhaps where some of  
**0:38:11-0:38:19:**  your other audiences tuning in from like canada was that we have we have months of very cold  
**0:38:19-0:38:26:**  winter weather and the cold is not really the issue for livestock it's it's the cold  
**0:38:26-0:38:38:**  when it's combined with uh prolonged snow storms and most of our grazing livestock in  
**0:38:38-0:38:44:**  silvopasture areas are ruminant animals if we're ruminant can keep its belly full of  
**0:38:44-0:38:51:**  good quality feed whether it's stockpiled pasture or hay in the winter it can usually  
**0:38:51-0:38:58:**  generate all the heat it needs to keep itself warm but if you have a winter storm or blizzard  
**0:38:58-0:39:08:**  where you might have a day or two or sometimes even more of prolonged precipitation snow  
**0:39:08-0:39:18:**  and sleet combined with cold and wind chill allowing them to get into those conifer plantations  
**0:39:18-0:39:27:**  to reduce the wind chill and get their faces out of that driving snow really helps them  
**0:39:27-0:39:33:**  stay more comfortable and it's much like silvopastures help grazing animals stay more comfortable  
**0:39:33-0:39:39:**  during periods of high temperature as well and so the difference the basic difference  
**0:39:39-0:39:47:**  between how i would see our conifer plantation silvopastures as living barns from our other  
**0:39:47-0:39:54:**  plantation silvopastures that are more hardwood mixes is that we don't focus as much on growing  
**0:39:54-0:40:00:**  forage under our plantation under our living barns what we're really managing them for  
**0:40:00-0:40:06:**  is we still have to manage them meaning we still have to thin trees out to promote good  
**0:40:06-0:40:12:**  growth of the best trees but we're trying to preserve a little bit more tree density  
**0:40:12-0:40:18:**  in there because it's that tree density that's giving us the biggest benefit and by having  
**0:40:18-0:40:26:**  on our farm here in new york we have six different areas totaling about 20 little over 20 acres  
**0:40:26-0:40:35:**  of these living barns and that has pretty much eliminated the need to have other structures  
**0:40:35-0:40:44:**  like pole barns or what we call coverall structures to house our animals during these extreme  
**0:40:44-0:40:50:**  winter events and any of those structures would be very expensive not only to build  
**0:40:50-0:40:51:**  but maintain  
**0:40:51-0:40:58:**  yeah i know that a bit too well because i'm in a mountainous region where everyone has  
**0:40:58-0:41:04:**  big big barns and big buildings so i'll be thinking of the living barns and i want us  
**0:41:04-0:41:10:**  to go into some detail on living barns and and and what it means in practice but before  
**0:41:10-0:41:18:**  that i i wanted to i wanted to understand uh still on this idea of design um have you  
**0:41:18-0:41:26:**  found a good uh balance between you know planting for a good quality timber but still allowing  
**0:41:26-0:41:30:**  enough light for forage because i'm assuming and correct me if i'm wrong because i don't  
**0:41:30-0:41:36:**  know so much about timber production but we often see sometimes fairly dense plantations  
**0:41:36-0:41:43:**  to you know encourage uh straight long trunks and you might have all the foresters parameters  
**0:41:43-0:41:49:**  uh to try and make the best production possible but that might not completely align with including  
**0:41:49-0:41:55:**  animals in the mix and you know letting sunlight come in and having a herbaceous strata so  
**0:41:55-0:42:00:**  obviously you're managing to combine both uh is that something obvious to you or did  
**0:42:00-0:42:04:**  it require some adjustments between the needs of the grazing animals and the need of producing  
**0:42:04-0:42:13:**  high quality timber i don't think we've had to really adjust the way we manage our plantation  
**0:42:13-0:42:22:**  plantations for those two different objectives that is plantations just for timber production  
**0:42:22-0:42:33:**  versus plantations for civil pasturing i think we probably discussed this in our first episode  
**0:42:33-0:42:44:**  last year but to make the point again atn the way that we would manage any woods be  
**0:42:44-0:42:50:**  it a artificially established woods that is a plantation where we plant the trees versus  
**0:42:50-0:42:57:**  a natural occurring woods there's the stocking level of trees or the density of trees that  
**0:42:57-0:43:03:**  we would want be it for timber production or for good forage production is really quite  
**0:43:03-0:43:10:**  similar and i'm not going to get into the kind of the technical forestry explanation  
**0:43:10-0:43:17:**  of that but one thing that does make a plantation for timber a little bit different than a plantation  
**0:43:17-0:43:27:**  for civil pasturing is that we need to control the competition between our better trees that  
**0:43:27-0:43:33:**  are growing in that upper campy level but in civil pastures we also need to think about  
**0:43:33-0:43:38:**  thinning anything that's below that upper campy right down to the ground level so if  
**0:43:38-0:43:48:**  we have a layer of invasive shrubs growing under our big trees our nice trees we need  
**0:43:48-0:43:56:**  to make additional investments to remove that layer of interfering invasive shrubs because  
**0:43:56-0:44:01:**  it's that shrub layer that's intercepting that sunlight which is the critical ingredient  
**0:44:01-0:44:08:**  to grow forage in our civil pasture understory but last time we mentioned we talked a lot  
**0:44:08-0:44:14:**  about taking a already existing forest or plantation and then thinning that out to allow  
**0:44:14-0:44:20:**  light for forages but in in this scenario where you're starting from let's say pasture  
**0:44:20-0:44:25:**  supposedly if you had plant the trees that are too far apart that would affect the shape  
**0:44:25-0:44:30:**  that they take and not incentivize them to grow tall and produce nice straight trunks  
**0:44:30-0:44:36:**  so you're having to start with a density that's much higher than what allows animals to come  
**0:44:36-0:44:44:**  in or how does that work you're right so i understand what you're asking the first thing  
**0:44:44-0:44:53:**  we have to think about when we design our tree planting project is well i think there's  
**0:44:53-0:44:57:**  several important things i already talked about the importance of being able to maintain  
**0:44:57-0:45:05:**  it but we also have to think about costs because to the extent that we can minimize the investment  
**0:45:05-0:45:13:**  we're making up front the more positive the financial outlook is going to look off into  
**0:45:13-0:45:19:**  the future so one of the ways that we control the the upfront costs of course is to plant  
**0:45:19-0:45:25:**  fewer trees what does not work well is trying to cut corners and if you know that trees  
**0:45:25-0:45:33:**  are going to just need a certain level of care in those early critical years then you  
**0:45:33-0:45:39:**  can't say well okay instead of spending a hundred dollars a hectare a year to maintain  
**0:45:39-0:45:44:**  this let's only spend 50 because 50 might be the difference between most of the trees  
**0:45:44-0:45:51:**  surviving and most of the trees dying or at least taking much longer to get established  
**0:45:51-0:45:57:**  and start growing so that you can get in there and do things like raise your animals much  
**0:45:57-0:46:07:**  earlier so the number of trees per hectare we're balancing several different important  
**0:46:07-0:46:16:**  considerations there we we every tree represents a cost so we want to plant as few trees as  
**0:46:16-0:46:23:**  possible to get the results that we want now that depends on the type of trees we're planting  
**0:46:23-0:46:29:**  and the design of those trees that we're planting so to go back to that example of hardwoods  
**0:46:29-0:46:37:**  versus softwoods softwoods depending on the species they might do quite well at fairly  
**0:46:37-0:46:47:**  open spacings because they're so shade intolerant that the limbs prune themselves off naturally  
**0:46:47-0:46:53:**  that's particularly the case with many of the pine species whereas hardwoods if you  
**0:46:53-0:47:02:**  don't create enough shading and side competition they'll grow as like big open lawn type trees  
**0:47:02-0:47:08:**  or just require so much more investment in going in there and doing corrective pruning  
**0:47:08-0:47:14:**  and pruning the lower limbs off one of the ways that we can compensate that for that  
**0:47:14-0:47:22:**  though is to plant some rows tighter together and then maybe leave valleys in between with  
**0:47:22-0:47:30:**  broader spacing and one of the designs that I like although I think there are many that  
**0:47:30-0:47:37:**  would work well for silvopastures is to plant a row of the trees that we really want to  
**0:47:37-0:47:45:**  be there for the long term and then fairly tightly on both sides of that row of say the  
**0:47:45-0:47:52:**  long term trees is plant rows of trees that we can harvest more in the short term and  
**0:47:52-0:47:59:**  locust would be what black locust would be one of those examples where the black locust  
**0:47:59-0:48:04:**  is going to probably grow a little faster than say the nut trees that we plant in the  
**0:48:04-0:48:11:**  middle and that locust is going to get up there and push those nut trees to grow taller  
**0:48:11-0:48:20:**  and straighter but we can go in there maybe after a couple decades and remove those rows  
**0:48:20-0:48:28:**  of locust and utilize it for things like fence posts and then leave the nut trees to grow  
**0:48:28-0:48:38:**  off into future decades so there's and you could do the same thing by planting say conifers  
**0:48:38-0:48:42:**  on both sides of your hardwoods.  
**0:48:42-0:48:47:**  And then having this kind of high density per line you can space out your lines as much  
**0:48:47-0:48:54:**  as you want and be very flexible in the amount of grazing or paddocks you leave in between  
**0:48:54-0:48:58:**  them so yeah it seems like quite a flexible design.  
**0:48:58-0:49:05:**  So when we talk about this also Etienne it's important to note that sometimes so you keep  
**0:49:05-0:49:14:**  using the example of trees that were growing for timber, timber products most timber products  
**0:49:14-0:49:22:**  seek to grow a tall straight tree not all trees that we're planting on our farms or  
**0:49:22-0:49:30:**  planting for silvopastures are necessarily being planted for growing timber products  
**0:49:30-0:49:39:**  particularly saw timber so in the case of say like European or Asian chestnuts and hazelnuts  
**0:49:39-0:49:51:**  and fruit trees like apples those trees are not being grown primarily for saw timber so  
**0:49:51-0:50:02:**  in fact it's almost preferable to plant those trees so that they can grow broad spreading  
**0:50:02-0:50:10:**  crowns and in those situations the design or the initial planting density might be different  
**0:50:10-0:50:15:**  than where we're trying to grow high quality saw timber.  
**0:50:15-0:50:21:**  And on your farm you have planted quite a few of more nuts or fruit trees then?  
**0:50:21-0:50:26:**  No on our farm pretty much everything we've planted have been what we consider timber  
**0:50:26-0:50:29:**  species.  
**0:50:29-0:50:38:**  That said if we ever find the time and money to do more extensive planting our farm that's  
**0:50:38-0:50:45:**  really where I'd like to focus next is to try to have more of these orchard type groves  
**0:50:45-0:50:50:**  that are dual purpose silvopastures.  
**0:50:50-0:50:56:**  It does require a lot of knowledge and skill to grow proper beautiful timber trees and  
**0:50:56-0:51:03:**  get a good product out of them so let's say I'm a livestock farmer and you know I know  
**0:51:03-0:51:09:**  mostly about cows and grazing but I do want to include some trees into my operation would  
**0:51:09-0:51:14:**  you recommend that I stick to kind of black locust and get a simple product out of it  
**0:51:14-0:51:18:**  like posts would that be a safe bet for me or are they other trees that you think are  
**0:51:18-0:51:23:**  reasonable for someone with limited skills and experience in terms of forestry to include  
**0:51:23-0:51:25:**  with animals?  
**0:51:25-0:51:29:**  The answer to that question Etienne really depends on where you live in the world so  
**0:51:29-0:51:36:**  black locust is more of a northern climate species it seems to be very adaptable so I've  
**0:51:36-0:51:44:**  seen black locust growing from subtropical regions all the way up into boreal regions  
**0:51:44-0:51:50:**  where it can be very cold in the winter but many tree species and there's keep in mind  
**0:51:50-0:51:58:**  that there are literally dozens maybe even hundreds of tree species worldwide I think  
**0:51:58-0:52:04:**  can be very very useful in silvopasture systems.  
**0:52:04-0:52:11:**  What we need to look for though whenever possible is to try to start with native species and  
**0:52:11-0:52:17:**  the reason I say that is not because I have anything against non-native species but I'm  
**0:52:17-0:52:25:**  basing that comment on the lesson that I mentioned earlier of where we planted lots of different  
**0:52:25-0:52:33:**  trees years ago on our farm and then found out eventually that pests from wherever those  
**0:52:33-0:52:41:**  trees originated from eventually caught up with those trees and wiped them out so I think  
**0:52:41-0:52:50:**  trees that have been growing in a given area for centuries if not thousands of years those  
**0:52:50-0:52:56:**  are trees that probably have inherently lower risk of pest issues there are some notable  
**0:52:56-0:53:05:**  exceptions to that such as the emerald ash borer however whenever you bring something  
**0:53:05-0:53:14:**  new in and put it there I have really no problems with that from an ecological perspective because  
**0:53:14-0:53:21:**  I think nature eventually sorts it out what belongs and what doesn't belong if it doesn't  
**0:53:21-0:53:29:**  belong some plague or pest is going to take that organism out as long as you're not introducing  
**0:53:29-0:53:35:**  something that becomes invasive in nature and that's rarely the case with trees at least  
**0:53:35-0:53:41:**  in northern climates now I know there's cases of invasive trees that is trees that become  
**0:53:41-0:53:49:**  pests in warmer parts of the world where the trees can grow so fast that they just displace  
**0:53:49-0:53:59:**  native trees here on our farm though I'm gonna pick things that are best suited for the site  
**0:53:59-0:54:05:**  but also complementary to our objectives so locust has been one of those trees that has  
**0:54:05-0:54:13:**  worked very well for us but locust even though it grows on our ranch in Argentina it's not  
**0:54:13-0:54:20:**  I don't think is well adapted to growing there is some other hardwood species oaks seem to  
**0:54:20-0:54:27:**  do very well on our ranch in Argentina but we also have native species there such as  
**0:54:27-0:54:34:**  mesquite is there any places on your farm where you would not put trees you know because  
**0:54:34-0:54:39:**  we often say you know we should put tree where should we put trees but when you have animals  
**0:54:39-0:54:44:**  for example and are there some some mistakes and including trees where they shouldn't be  
**0:54:44-0:54:53:**  I struggle to think of examples of where we wouldn't want to plant trees trees in a general  
**0:54:53-0:54:59:**  sense but there are some tree species and I'll go back to using black locust is a perfect  
**0:54:59-0:55:07:**  example black locust is one of a handful of tree species that spreads through its root  
**0:55:07-0:55:15:**  system we call it a clonal species and over time it'll send up new shoots from the root  
**0:55:15-0:55:23:**  system so wherever you plant locust today you expect it to creep outwards over time  
**0:55:23-0:55:28:**  so another common example that I think many of much of your audience would be familiar  
**0:55:28-0:55:39:**  with is poplar particularly what's known as white poplar populus alba I believe is the  
**0:55:39-0:55:45:**  botanical name that's another example of a tree species that is clonal in nature so if  
**0:55:45-0:55:52:**  you plant it too close to areas where you don't want trees such as your gateways your  
**0:55:52-0:56:01:**  laneways the public road the homestead over time you've created a situation where you're  
**0:56:01-0:56:08:**  going to be trying to fight back the encroachment of the trees and is that an issue in pasture  
**0:56:08-0:56:13:**  for example because if you're grazing animals there might be some areas where you want the  
**0:56:13-0:56:19:**  black locust to stay where you intended them to be or is the animal pressure enough to  
**0:56:19-0:56:24:**  keep that under control are you having to come in and cut those small black locusts to  
**0:56:24-0:56:27:**  keep them in check?  
**0:56:27-0:56:31:**  On our farm we've made the mistake of planting black locusts too close to the power line  
**0:56:31-0:56:38:**  right of ways and the public road and that's become a growing problem over the years because  
**0:56:38-0:56:44:**  the locusts wants to just keep encroaching under the power lines and into the road right  
**0:56:44-0:56:55:**  of way and grazing alone won't usually keep that in check keep in mind that in civil pasture  
**0:56:55-0:57:02:**  systems we're usually doing well not usually we should be doing intensive rotational grazing  
**0:57:02-0:57:08:**  with long rest and recovery periods and if you have a fast growing species like white  
**0:57:08-0:57:16:**  poplar or black locust that two or three times during the grazing season where the animals  
**0:57:16-0:57:21:**  may pass through that area and take a bite or two off the top of those young suckers  
**0:57:21-0:57:29:**  or shoots that are coming up that is probably not enough to keep that tree from eventually  
**0:57:29-0:57:35:**  outgrowing the browsing height of the livestock and then a little problem turns into a bigger  
**0:57:35-0:57:36:**  problem.  
**0:57:36-0:57:40:**  What would you recommend then for making sure that doesn't happen?  
**0:57:40-0:57:44:**  Let's say I'm putting a line of black locust in the middle of my pasture to offer a bit  
**0:57:44-0:57:52:**  of protection to my animals is it to pass with some kind of cutting device once a year  
**0:57:52-0:57:54:**  will that be sufficient then?  
**0:57:54-0:57:59:**  One of my favorite sayings is I guess a way of paraphrasing it would be prevent the problem  
**0:57:59-0:58:06:**  before it happens so if we know a particular tree species has characteristics such as suckering  
**0:58:06-0:58:12:**  through the root system then we shouldn't plant it adjacent areas where we don't want  
**0:58:12-0:58:18:**  that tree spreading into whereas other trees that don't sucker from the root system it  
**0:58:18-0:58:28:**  may be perfectly fine to plant them uptight to access areas and roads because the tree  
**0:58:28-0:58:34:**  could possibly produce seedlings from seed over time but it's going to happen at such  
**0:58:34-0:58:40:**  a slow rate that we can stay on top of that whereas if you think about the difference  
**0:58:40-0:58:50:**  between young trees or regeneration from seed versus young trees from vigorous mature tree  
**0:58:50-0:58:58:**  root systems that's like an order of magnitude difference in the rate at which those trees  
**0:58:58-0:59:05:**  grow and the ability to which they can spread outward.  
**0:59:05-0:59:15:**  So I don't think we want to set ourselves up for situations  
**0:59:15-0:59:24:**  where we may have to do unnecessary maintenance and prevention down the road so just understand  
**0:59:24-0:59:33:**  what the characteristics are of the trees you're planting and species that may have  
**0:59:33-0:59:42:**  that ability to encroach or invade into unwanted areas just don't plant them in those areas.  
**0:59:42-0:59:51:**  I guess one point I couldn't emphasize enough, Etienne, is I think any tree planting even  
**0:59:51-0:59:55:**  if it's just for timber but particularly for any agroforestry system and especially for  
**0:59:55-1:00:03:**  silvopasturing we want to we're going to have our preferred species but I think we want  
**1:00:03-1:00:10:**  to mix it up and add as many species to the mix as possible.  
**1:00:10-1:00:16:**  Keeping in mind don't plant species that are doomed to failure 10 years down the road when  
**1:00:16-1:00:19:**  they get taken out by a well-known pest.  
**1:00:19-1:00:26:**  I think it would be useful if we kind of took a practical step-by-step of going from the  
**1:00:26-1:00:31:**  moment where you plant a tree and going through the different maintenance steps you have to  
**1:00:31-1:00:38:**  go through you know and when do you include animals again and for how long and maybe looking  
**1:00:38-1:00:43:**  at some of the choices and also successes and mistakes that you made in that process.  
**1:00:43-1:00:51:**  So it all starts with having a good plan and that plan is only a little bit about the tree  
**1:00:51-1:00:57:**  species and the design of the planting or the plantation.  
**1:00:57-1:01:05:**  I think it's equally if not more importantly about how much can you afford to invest are  
**1:01:05-1:01:10:**  you planting trees that are going to be compatible with what your vision or goals are for those  
**1:01:10-1:01:21:**  trees and are they trees that you can commit to taking care of because if it's something  
**1:01:21-1:01:28:**  like what we think of as the hardy pioneer species so blank locust would be a hardwood  
**1:01:28-1:01:31:**  example of what I consider a pioneer species.  
**1:01:31-1:01:38:**  These are trees that in nature you see are the first to show up on a disturbed site and  
**1:01:38-1:01:46:**  kind of pave the way for other tree species to then come in through that natural succession.  
**1:01:46-1:01:55:**  So in nature we often see things like aspen, locust, pines, birch, alders, all tree species  
**1:01:55-1:02:03:**  that are able to become established in less than ideal conditions and then over time we  
**1:02:03-1:02:13:**  might see oaks, maples, other nut trees they come in once these other early pioneer trees  
**1:02:13-1:02:20:**  come in and have started to shade out the grass competition and created a little bit  
**1:02:20-1:02:29:**  more shade and cut down on the moisture losses of the soil a little bit more.  
**1:02:29-1:02:38:**  And when we're planting trees into a farm field however we want to think about okay  
**1:02:38-1:02:44:**  first of all am I putting the right tree in the right site so don't plant a tree that  
**1:02:44-1:02:50:**  needs very fertile well-drained soils and a heavy clay-based soil that's seasonally  
**1:02:50-1:02:57:**  wet you're just it's not that that tree might not survive or persist for years but it's  
**1:02:57-1:03:07:**  never going to reach its full potential there and if we're really going to achieve the benefits  
**1:03:07-1:03:13:**  out of tree planting that we're seeking then we need to plant trees that will perform well  
**1:03:13-1:03:20:**  over time regardless of what our objectives are whether it's just shade and habitat or  
**1:03:20-1:03:27:**  it's nut production or it's timber production or it's just I want pretty long-lived trees  
**1:03:27-1:03:37:**  out there we want trees that are well suited to that site and will grow well and the bigger  
**1:03:37-1:03:44:**  tree becomes the more limiting a marginal site becomes to the health of that tree.  
**1:03:44-1:03:49:**  That's why I say you can probably get almost anything growing there for the first decade  
**1:03:49-1:03:56:**  or two but will it really continue to grow and do well 50 years and 100 years down the  
**1:03:56-1:04:05:**  road so to go back to your question so we want to start with a plan that is carefully  
**1:04:05-1:04:17:**  thinking it all through and not just species and planting design but are these trees going  
**1:04:17-1:04:24:**  to give me the outcomes I'm looking for and are they trees that I can take care of so  
**1:04:24-1:04:30:**  are they trees that I can pretty much plant and walk away which is what we do on our ranch  
**1:04:30-1:04:36:**  in Argentina with pines or are they trees that I may have to be out there maintaining  
**1:04:36-1:04:43:**  them several times each year through the first five or ten years that I planted those trees  
**1:04:43-1:04:52:**  so that's where it starts and then obviously where it all really hits the pavement is where  
**1:04:52-1:05:00:**  we go out the trees show up and by the way part of that planning process is seeking out  
**1:05:00-1:05:04:**  quality sources of trees and that's easier said than done.  
**1:05:04-1:05:12:**  I find it's always been difficult and maybe even more difficult today to go out and find  
**1:05:12-1:05:19:**  really good sources of good quality trees so there are many forest nurseries out there  
**1:05:19-1:05:26:**  that might sell run-of-the-mill stuff but if we're going to invest a tremendous amount  
**1:05:26-1:05:32:**  of time and money into planting trees plant the best quality trees that you can both quality  
**1:05:32-1:05:37:**  in terms of how they were raised in the nursery in other words they come out of there with  
**1:05:37-1:05:45:**  good root system and good stem mass and things that meaning they're a healthy vigorous seedling  
**1:05:45-1:05:53:**  that's going to be able to overcome those stresses of being out planted and start growing  
**1:05:53-1:06:00:**  from day one versus some little wimpy seedling that's gonna just sit there and barely stay  
**1:06:00-1:06:06:**  alive for the first few years but also think about the genetic quality so in that weather  
**1:06:06-1:06:14:**  again your goal is fruit production or nut production or timber production there are  
**1:06:14-1:06:20:**  certainly it's not that all trees are created equal in that sense so within any given tree  
**1:06:20-1:06:28:**  species there's potentially sources out there that will give you better growth for timber  
**1:06:28-1:06:37:**  or better nut production or better quality nuts or fruit and it costs more to buy that  
**1:06:37-1:06:45:**  improved stock but when you pencil it out it's usually very cost effective to spend  
**1:06:45-1:06:52:**  that additional money on better genetics up front so the trees show up we get them in  
**1:06:52-1:07:01:**  the ground it takes a lot of labor to do that we need to make sure that when game day arrives  
**1:07:01-1:07:08:**  we've got our volunteer paid workforce out there ready to get the trees in the ground  
**1:07:08-1:07:16:**  in a timely fashion and then once we get the trees in the ground we can probably take a  
**1:07:16-1:07:25:**  deep breath for a little bit but if we then need to be thinking almost immediately about  
**1:07:25-1:07:33:**  okay what wants to come and eat my little trees is it my livestock is it the outbreak  
**1:07:33-1:07:39:**  of some defoliating insect that's gonna happen that spring is it the rodents that are out  
**1:07:39-1:07:46:**  there living in these grassy pasture systems is it the other wildlife like deer deer would  
**1:07:46-1:07:57:**  be one of the biggest barriers to planting any trees here in the northeastern U.S. an  
**1:07:57-1:08:03:**  adult deer white tail deer eats about 5,000 tree seedlings a day as part of its diet year  
**1:08:03-1:08:11:**  around here in New York so young plantation of freshly planted trees that are chock full  
**1:08:11-1:08:17:**  of nutrients right out of the forest nursery bed that's like a delicacy for deer and they  
**1:08:17-1:08:24:**  can go in there at a very inopportune moment that is just as these weak little seedlings  
**1:08:24-1:08:31:**  are leafing out for the first time and overnight take a bite off the top of everything and  
**1:08:31-1:08:36:**  that may not kill those seedlings but it certainly doesn't help them either so protecting those  
**1:08:36-1:08:43:**  young trees is really the next step and then I think kind of the final phase is being able  
**1:08:43-1:08:52:**  to reduce the herbaceous plant competition around those trees for a few years as they're  
**1:08:52-1:09:00:**  trying to get their small root systems established herbaceous plants grasses in particular are  
**1:09:00-1:09:09:**  very effective at keeping woody plants from invading their turf so we need to think about  
**1:09:09-1:09:17:**  either some sort of mechanical or chemical way of reducing that root competition around  
**1:09:17-1:09:22:**  those young trees and that also in turn often helps reduce the habitat for voles and moles  
**1:09:22-1:09:30:**  and shrews and bunny rabbits and other critters that want to come in and girdle that succulent  
**1:09:30-1:09:35:**  nutrient filled bark off that young tree seedling.  
**1:09:35-1:09:41:**  And I'm wondering on your farm just going back one step what kind of soil preparation  
**1:09:41-1:09:43:**  do you do?  
**1:09:43-1:09:46:**  You dig individual holes?  
**1:09:46-1:09:49:**  Do you prepare lines?  
**1:09:49-1:09:55:**  I'll answer that but first I want to say that I've made every mistake imaginable over the  
**1:09:55-1:10:04:**  years with planting trees and I attribute a lot of that to thinking like a forester  
**1:10:04-1:10:17:**  so where I live forestry is highly reliant upon natural regeneration and we don't often  
**1:10:17-1:10:25:**  plant trees here in New York in the northeastern US because if we just do the right silvicultural  
**1:10:25-1:10:29:**  treatments nature will plant the trees for us.  
**1:10:29-1:10:35:**  We talked a little bit at the beginning about why we may still choose to plant other trees  
**1:10:35-1:10:42:**  just to put things there to either enrich the mix of species or because we can plant  
**1:10:42-1:10:49:**  trees that we find very useful like blank locusts if we're going to grow trees for fence  
**1:10:49-1:10:55:**  posts then locusts is the tree of choice and we don't have a lot of naturally occurring  
**1:10:55-1:10:59:**  black locusts.  
**1:10:59-1:11:06:**  But what I've learned the hard way is that to plant trees I need to stop thinking as  
**1:11:06-1:11:13:**  a forester where I'm expecting nature to do it for me and I need to be thinking more like  
**1:11:13-1:11:23:**  a very skilled horticulturalist where I'm going to put very intensive care into this  
**1:11:23-1:11:30:**  horticultural crop and the success of any tree planting project I think is directly  
**1:11:30-1:11:38:**  proportional to the effort that goes into it both on the planning side that is carefully  
**1:11:38-1:11:44:**  thinking through all the steps and making sure that you're able to meet the minimum  
**1:11:44-1:11:51:**  requirements of those steps but also making sure that you realize that putting the tree  
**1:11:51-1:11:57:**  in the ground that active planting is just where the work really begins.  
**1:11:57-1:12:04:**  So when I look at some of my neighboring farmer friends that are orchardists and vineyardists  
**1:12:04-1:12:14:**  I think that's really more of the model that we need to follow for planting any trees and  
**1:12:14-1:12:28:**  that isn't necessary in all parts of the world with all tree species but it's much more of  
**1:12:28-1:12:38:**  a commitment than I think many of us initially estimate that putting trees in the ground  
**1:12:38-1:12:45:**  and mowing it for a couple years may not cut it.  
**1:12:45-1:12:50:**  Watering trees is sometimes going to be important.  
**1:12:50-1:12:52:**  Controlling pest issues on the trees is going to be important.  
**1:12:52-1:12:58:**  Controlling herbaceous competition around the young trees is going to be important.  
**1:12:58-1:13:04:**  In Argentina we have a prolonged fire season in the winter and protecting young trees from  
**1:13:04-1:13:13:**  fire is a big challenge for us and there's probably no bigger threat to young trees than  
**1:13:13-1:13:15:**  fire.  
**1:13:15-1:13:19:**  And what can you do to protect trees from fire than in Argentina?  
**1:13:19-1:13:26:**  We treat them as silvopastures and graze cattle in them as early as we can because it's really  
**1:13:26-1:13:33:**  a very symbiotic relationship where the trees over time benefit the cattle, they give them  
**1:13:33-1:13:42:**  shade and shelter and also help shift the pastures into more palatable and better quality  
**1:13:42-1:13:47:**  forages over time because of that cooler moisture microclimate that the trees create but the  
**1:13:47-1:13:55:**  cattle in turn are essential for controlling fuel loads and in the absence of grazing we're  
**1:13:55-1:14:03:**  letting a lot of dry dead plant material accumulate under those young trees and it's just a matter  
**1:14:03-1:14:09:**  of it's not if but when fire is going to hit us and if we can control that fuel load through  
**1:14:09-1:14:18:**  grazing then we can usually make it through a fire without significant damage whereas  
**1:14:18-1:14:26:**  if we were not grazing our plantations I think we'd just have a ticking time bomb sitting  
**1:14:26-1:14:27:**  there.  
**1:14:27-1:14:36:**  Going back to our planting methods, have you always used the same soil prep?  
**1:14:36-1:14:39:**  Is that a variable that's changed as well?  
**1:14:39-1:14:47:**  The way I would do it on our farm today is to try to auger the trees in versus planting  
**1:14:47-1:14:50:**  them with a shovel or planting them with a tree planter.  
**1:14:50-1:14:56:**  A lot of the trees we planted in the past we did with a tree planter which makes a slit  
**1:14:56-1:15:03:**  in the soil and it's a method that's well suited for small bare root seedlings but it  
**1:15:03-1:15:10:**  doesn't work well for larger containerized seedlings and I think that when we plant hardwoods  
**1:15:10-1:15:16:**  we need to be thinking more about containerized seedlings versus bare root seedlings because  
**1:15:16-1:15:20:**  we want those trees, yeah and we're going to spend more on those larger containerized  
**1:15:20-1:15:28:**  seedlings up front but if we get higher survival and the trees become established much quicker,  
**1:15:28-1:15:34:**  meaning less maintenance over time, it probably more than paid for itself.  
**1:15:34-1:15:43:**  To plant any type of seedling though that has a fairly well developed root system you  
**1:15:43-1:15:45:**  have to make a pretty big hole.  
**1:15:45-1:15:51:**  I just want to jump in here because we often hear that bare root seedlings have a much  
**1:15:51-1:15:57:**  better root structure because they're not root bound by pots but for you basically avoiding  
**1:15:57-1:16:03:**  the initial stress of being bare rooted and being potted still pays off, like you're not  
**1:16:03-1:16:07:**  worried of the long term effect of root bound.  
**1:16:07-1:16:12:**  I think it has a lot to do with the production method here in the US.  
**1:16:12-1:16:19:**  There's what they call bottomless containers or bottomless pots so it's an air root pruning  
**1:16:19-1:16:24:**  method that seems to work well with many hardwood species.  
**1:16:24-1:16:28:**  To answer that question though the first thing we have to recognize is that not all tree  
**1:16:28-1:16:36:**  species are created equally so some tree species they can transplant quite well as bare root  
**1:16:36-1:16:37:**  seedlings.  
**1:16:37-1:16:45:**  Other species they perform very poorly, they might survive but they go into a planting  
**1:16:45-1:16:51:**  shock phase where that tree...  
**1:16:51-1:16:58:**  Our goal should always be besides survivability is to get that tree off and running as early  
**1:16:58-1:17:05:**  as possible and that's a combination of both what we plant in terms of a small bare root  
**1:17:05-1:17:11:**  seedling versus a containerized seedling and the planting method but it's also a reflection  
**1:17:11-1:17:21:**  of the early care that we put in to getting those trees, getting their roots in the ground  
**1:17:21-1:17:28:**  and getting them growing as quickly as possible as early as possible.  
**1:17:28-1:17:34:**  That's why more and more especially for the type of trees that we would be planting for  
**1:17:34-1:17:41:**  our silvopastures today which would be primarily hardwoods versus spruce and pine and I'm talking  
**1:17:41-1:17:47:**  about New York not Argentina I'm going to auger them in so all the trees that we planted  
**1:17:47-1:17:54:**  in recent years we use an auger on one of our farm tractors it's a heavy duty auger  
**1:17:54-1:17:58:**  with a pointed self-feeding tip.  
**1:17:58-1:18:04:**  It's not nearly as productive as the tree planter that we were using 20 and 30 years  
**1:18:04-1:18:14:**  ago but I think it gives us better results it also helps to an extent with the site preparation.  
**1:18:14-1:18:21:**  The act of augering that hole in kind of destroys those herbaceous grass roots in close proximity  
**1:18:21-1:18:25:**  to where those young tree roots are going to be at least through part of the first growing  
**1:18:25-1:18:27:**  season.  
**1:18:27-1:18:32:**  I think that we need to think a little bit more though about especially some of the more  
**1:18:32-1:18:37:**  delicate hardwoods where we would either then need to follow up and mulch heavily around  
**1:18:37-1:18:38:**  the tree.  
**1:18:38-1:18:47:**  Mulching can be a double-edged sword because on one hand it helps suppress weed growth  
**1:18:47-1:18:53:**  and tramps in moisture but it can also suck nutrients out of the ground if we're not using  
**1:18:53-1:18:55:**  the properly composted wood chips.  
**1:18:55-1:19:05:**  It can also create habitat for some rodents and sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't.  
**1:19:05-1:19:12:**  Mulching would be a more organic alternative to using herbicides or chemical controls to  
**1:19:12-1:19:15:**  control the herbaceous competition.  
**1:19:15-1:19:21:**  I personally don't like herbicides not because I have any philosophical opposition to the  
**1:19:21-1:19:29:**  herbicides but herbicides when you spray a patch of sod that is a patch of dense grass  
**1:19:29-1:19:37:**  and you kill the grass in that spot whatever is in that seed bank is going to quickly express  
**1:19:37-1:19:45:**  itself and just probably be a bigger headache than what the grass was.  
**1:19:45-1:19:54:**  So wherever we spray grass here with something like glyphosate what we get back are very  
**1:19:54-1:20:04:**  fast growing aggressive warm season weeds that could be even worse than the grass for  
**1:20:04-1:20:06:**  those young trees.  
**1:20:06-1:20:13:**  Is there any other options in terms of you have wood chips, herbicides, is there some  
**1:20:13-1:20:15:**  kind of mechanical tilling?  
**1:20:15-1:20:24:**  Mechanical so you could be rototilling you could scrape the sod in a strip and that might  
**1:20:24-1:20:30:**  work fine in soils that are like loamy soils where you don't have a lot of rocks to contend  
**1:20:30-1:20:36:**  with the sod stripping doesn't seem to work very well on our farm because we have too  
**1:20:36-1:20:38:**  many large stones in our soil.  
**1:20:38-1:20:46:**  It also then creates an uneven surface that is hard to mow around so the first year it  
**1:20:46-1:20:52:**  looks great because you have this strip that might be half a meter wide of where you've  
**1:20:52-1:20:58:**  basically scalped the sod off and planned your trees into that but by the second year  
**1:20:58-1:21:06:**  where you have tall weeds and woody plants and grass and other things starting to encroach  
**1:21:06-1:21:14:**  back around those trees you've now created this spot that's hard to get the mower especially  
**1:21:14-1:21:21:**  if you've left large stones laying on top of the soil surface.  
**1:21:21-1:21:31:**  Rototilling would be similar in that it's in essence the same effect as spraying where  
**1:21:31-1:21:40:**  you've removed what was suppressing the expression of the seed bank there and what's worse is  
**1:21:40-1:21:47:**  you've churned the soil up so in that act of scarifying the soil you temporarily remove  
**1:21:47-1:21:53:**  that herbaceous competition but what comes in after that could be much worse.  
**1:21:53-1:22:01:**  That's why I like mulching probably the best but we just need to make sure that we, and  
**1:22:01-1:22:07:**  a common mistake I've seen with tree planting projects here is they plant the trees and  
**1:22:07-1:22:12:**  then either they never quite get around to putting the mulch down or they go out and  
**1:22:12-1:22:19:**  scramble to try to look for mulch but they don't find mulch that's been composted adequately  
**1:22:19-1:22:26:**  so they're putting more or less fresh chips around the trees and that can rob a lot of  
**1:22:26-1:22:33:**  nitrogen out of the soil as the decay fungi try to break those fresh chips down and really  
**1:22:33-1:22:36:**  jeopardize the growth of those young trees.  
**1:22:36-1:22:39:**  Is that something you've witnessed on your farm?  
**1:22:39-1:22:46:**  Because I'm aware of that mechanism but we haven't witnessed it in Greece when using  
**1:22:46-1:22:52:**  fresh wood chips and I'm wondering if you then saw that lack of nitrogen.  
**1:22:52-1:22:56:**  Yeah we haven't done much mulching over the years when we have.  
**1:22:56-1:23:00:**  We have tried to use chips that have been sitting in a pile probably for at least a  
**1:23:00-1:23:06:**  year or so but I think that it depends on what you're starting with in the soil so if  
**1:23:06-1:23:13:**  you have a soil that is already quite fertile and quite healthy and has lots of microbial  
**1:23:13-1:23:20:**  activity in it there might be plenty to go around so to speak.  
**1:23:20-1:23:29:**  Whereas if you're planting on a site that is already limited perhaps in decomposers  
**1:23:29-1:23:39:**  or macronutrients like nitrogen adding a organic material there that may take away from what  
**1:23:39-1:23:46:**  the young tree needs so I think you can't generalize accurately because in some cases  
**1:23:46-1:23:53:**  I think using green chips or fresh chips may work perfectly fine in other cases it may  
**1:23:53-1:24:01:**  not and wood chips would just be one example though of a mulch that we could use for or  
**1:24:01-1:24:05:**  a compost type material that we could use for mulch.  
**1:24:05-1:24:12:**  In Argentina not on our ranch but in some other areas that were adjacent to a large  
**1:24:12-1:24:18:**  peanut shelling factory we were using the peanut shells as the mulch and we were doing  
**1:24:18-1:24:22:**  direct seedings into.  
**1:24:22-1:24:32:**  We basically went through made a furrow put the seeds in that furrow mostly nut species  
**1:24:32-1:24:38:**  like oaks and walnuts and hickories and then we went over and in that furrow laid a layer  
**1:24:38-1:24:46:**  of it was probably somewhere between five and ten centimeters in thickness it wasn't  
**1:24:46-1:24:52:**  that we were super accurate or consistent and those nuts thrived like they came up through  
**1:24:52-1:25:00:**  those peanut shells and grew wonderfully and that those peanut shells suppressed the weed  
**1:25:00-1:25:08:**  growth for what I remember is in some cases up to three growing seasons.  
**1:25:08-1:25:13:**  So that was a system that worked very well but it was flat ground it was it was loamy  
**1:25:13-1:25:21:**  soil and it was and we didn't have any because this was all cropland before I don't think  
**1:25:21-1:25:28:**  we had the wildlife to contend with as much as we would in a like a small farm field that  
**1:25:28-1:25:35:**  might already be full of rodents that want to girdle young trees but we were also planting  
**1:25:35-1:25:42:**  at very high densities there too so we were planting nuts at like almost a 50 centimeter  
**1:25:42-1:25:49:**  to 100 centimeter spacing because we had lots of nuts so I think we had so many trees per  
**1:25:49-1:25:56:**  row that we we could afford to lose a significant percentage and still have plenty of trees  
**1:25:56-1:25:58:**  per hectare.  
**1:25:58-1:26:02:**  That's what I was gonna ask you know because you said once your trees are established the  
**1:26:02-1:26:07:**  first thing you want to be thinking about is what's gonna eat my tree now and what are  
**1:26:07-1:26:11:**  the options then that you've put in place on your farm to try and protect those young  
**1:26:11-1:26:12:**  trees?  
**1:26:12-1:26:19:**  That's why to do it over again Etienne I think that I would plant the trees first and then  
**1:26:19-1:26:24:**  let the trees get started and keep the keep the animals out until I felt the trees were  
**1:26:24-1:26:30:**  the stage that I could either graze it on a more regular basis or at least opportunistically  
**1:26:30-1:26:34:**  go in and flash graze it at the right moments.  
**1:26:34-1:26:40:**  Now in our ranch in Argentina just because of the species that we're predominantly using  
**1:26:40-1:26:46:**  mostly pines and the fact that we want to control the fuel loads in these young plantations  
**1:26:46-1:26:51:**  at the early stage possible we have to push the envelope a little bit and we pay the cost  
**1:26:51-1:26:58:**  for that to a small extent not because the cattle really want to graze young pines but  
**1:26:58-1:27:05:**  because they will rub on these young pines and break the limbs off and girdle the bark  
**1:27:05-1:27:11:**  if we're not careful about how long we leave them in there and when we put them in there  
**1:27:11-1:27:16:**  and how quickly we move them from one spot to the next.  
**1:27:16-1:27:23:**  The bigger issue here in New York though is not our grazing livestock it's deer and deer  
**1:27:23-1:27:31:**  again are probably by far the largest herbivores that want to eat our young trees and that's  
**1:27:31-1:27:37:**  a challenge both in systems where we're using natural regeneration and situations where  
**1:27:37-1:27:44:**  we're using artificial regeneration that is tree planting so I can easily keep my livestock  
**1:27:44-1:27:51:**  out of young forest plantations I can't keep deer out of young forest plantations as easily  
**1:27:51-1:27:56:**  and one thing that we're doing here today we have a whole extension website dedicated  
**1:27:56-1:28:04:**  to it is building what we call slash walls so think of slash as logging debris we're  
**1:28:04-1:28:09:**  about to build our first brush walls where we're taking invasive shrubs and bulldozing  
**1:28:09-1:28:14:**  them into large windrows around the perimeter of these areas where we want to plant young  
**1:28:14-1:28:25:**  trees and using that as a like a natural organic barrier to exclude deer for five to ten years  
**1:28:25-1:28:31:**  long enough to either get the naturally occurring young trees up and running or trees that we  
**1:28:31-1:28:38:**  plant in there up and running and our experience is showing we've been building slash walls  
**1:28:38-1:28:44:**  now in this area for five years we can build them at a much lower cost per foot of fence  
**1:28:44-1:28:52:**  or per foot of barrier than building a fence fence and to build a fence that will keep  
**1:28:52-1:28:58:**  deer out it's a fairly significant fence and the beauty is though we don't really have  
**1:28:58-1:29:03:**  to maintain these slash walls we can build them and pretty much walk away from them and  
**1:29:03-1:29:08:**  if a tree falls on them it just makes them better we all have to it's not like our eight  
**1:29:08-1:29:15:**  to ten foot high deer resistant fences that if a branch falls on them it flattens the  
**1:29:15-1:29:20:**  fence and the deer can walk right back in there again sorry you're talking about eight  
**1:29:20-1:29:27:**  to ten years for deer but what would be the ideal time to exclude animals including livestock  
**1:29:27-1:29:35:**  from the young plantation again is it to graze as often as we want and for as long as we  
**1:29:35-1:29:40:**  want or is it to just be able to go in there and graze a little bit here and a little bit  
**1:29:40-1:29:49:**  there so i think that you can probably in most cases be back to grazing a young plantation  
**1:29:49-1:29:59:**  within two to three years after planting but only if you're using very skillfully and well  
**1:29:59-1:30:08:**  controlled rotational grazing this is not so if you're gonna put animals into a young  
**1:30:08-1:30:17:**  plantation that's not a situation where you want to have your newbie summer intern that  
**1:30:17-1:30:23:**  doesn't really have the grazing skills yet be in charge of that because the intern is  
**1:30:23-1:30:27:**  probably going to make the mistake of doing the same thing in that young plantation that  
**1:30:27-1:30:34:**  you might be doing in other areas either more mature silvopastures or pastures that don't  
**1:30:34-1:30:40:**  have young vulnerable trees and it doesn't work the same way we talked about earlier  
**1:30:40-1:30:46:**  but shorter durations that is normally maybe you would leave your animals in there for  
**1:30:46-1:30:51:**  a day maybe you can only leave them in there for a couple of hours and putting animals  
**1:30:51-1:31:02:**  in there either right before leaf out or right after leaf drop or putting animals in there  
**1:31:02-1:31:08:**  say when you see a week of cooler weather where they might not be as heat stressed and  
**1:31:08-1:31:16:**  being driven quite as crazy by biting flies like horn flies so it's it's understanding  
**1:31:16-1:31:22:**  how your animals think and then being able to anticipate what could cause the animals  
**1:31:22-1:31:28:**  to go in there and show destructive behavior or damaging behavior to those young trees  
**1:31:28-1:31:35:**  other management inputs like pruning atn or going in and doing early what we think of  
**1:31:35-1:31:42:**  as pre-commercial thinnings that is thinning trees at a cost or a loss versus thinning  
**1:31:42-1:31:52:**  a weed delaying those thinnings till we can be harvesting something that's usable or sellable  
**1:31:52-1:32:03:**  all those management activities may or may not be necessary it depends partly on it depends  
**1:32:03-1:32:11:**  partly on the the initial design and implementation of the planting it also depends on responding  
**1:32:11-1:32:20:**  to unforeseen issues so a common example here in new york is that sometimes we have late  
**1:32:20-1:32:29:**  frost that can damage young trees just as they're leafing out in mid-may and that kills  
**1:32:29-1:32:36:**  the terminal growth in that young tree and then you get side branches that start to and  
**1:32:36-1:32:42:**  you so what what happens in that case instead of having a nice straight single stem you  
**1:32:42-1:32:48:**  now have multiple stems so you may have to go in and do some corrective pruning to retrain  
**1:32:48-1:32:56:**  it to a single stem when when at all possible we want to avoid those types of management  
**1:32:56-1:33:01:**  activities because they cost money and it's not it's not just that they cost money they  
**1:33:01-1:33:10:**  take time and that time is i feel the biggest limiting factor for all farmers today so we  
**1:33:10-1:33:19:**  want to set this up in a way that it minimizes like we don't have to do things that are potentially  
**1:33:19-1:33:25:**  avoidable things but if we're going to grow trees and our objectives is to have straight  
**1:33:25-1:33:33:**  tall trees then doing some pruning at some point may be necessary we also prune for example  
**1:33:33-1:33:41:**  we prune our pines in argentina not because we need to for timber quality or because the  
**1:33:41-1:33:49:**  trees won't eventually prune themselves pines typically self-prune very well we just we  
**1:33:49-1:33:57:**  want to get that those ladder fuels away from the ground as early as possible so we typically  
**1:33:57-1:34:03:**  go in when the trees are starting at around three meters tall and will prune up the first  
**1:34:03-1:34:09:**  meter and a half in other words the the lower half of the living branches on that tree and  
**1:34:09-1:34:16:**  that way if a hot fast fire comes through it's not potentially jumping up and scorching  
**1:34:16-1:34:26:**  the crowns of those young trees you were saying handling for example disease or pests  
**1:34:26-1:34:33:**  is that a big time input well those are the things that nature throws at us and we just  
**1:34:33-1:34:42:**  have to be prepared to respond the best that we can so spraying trees for pests may be  
**1:34:42-1:34:50:**  necessary watering trees or irrigating trees during drought may be necessary we we would  
**1:34:50-1:34:58:**  like to try to reduce or minimize the need for those things by starting with trees that  
**1:34:58-1:35:04:**  are less vulnerable to pest issues or that may be less susceptible to drought stress  
**1:35:04-1:35:10:**  but you just you can't control those things you can't control pest outbreaks you can't  
**1:35:10-1:35:18:**  control floods or droughts you can't control hail storms so you just sometimes need to  
**1:35:18-1:35:26:**  have you need to go in there and help correct damage or loss that's been done from some  
**1:35:26-1:35:32:**  natural occurrence after the fact maybe as a final part to this episode i'd really like  
**1:35:32-1:35:40:**  to understand how you've managed to integrate living barns and coniferous tree plantations  
**1:35:40-1:35:46:**  into the management of your animals and you've mentioned the benefits in terms of shelter  
**1:35:46-1:35:52:**  that they provide but did you actually plant those plantations with that in mind or is  
**1:35:52-1:36:00:**  it was it more an opportunistic use of them our living barns on our farm here in new york  
**1:36:00-1:36:08:**  came about as an opportunistic use of these conifer plantations that we had planted a  
**1:36:08-1:36:13:**  decade or more earlier at that time not thinking about okay someday we're going to use these  
**1:36:13-1:36:21:**  to provide shelter during extreme winter weather to our animals we planted conifers in those  
**1:36:21-1:36:28:**  spots because we wanted to have some more conifers on our farm and the conifer species  
**1:36:28-1:36:36:**  that we chose for those sites seemed to be well adapted to those sites we also felt that  
**1:36:36-1:36:41:**  with the limited time and ability to care for young trees that the conifers were going  
**1:36:41-1:36:52:**  to be easier to establish than hardwoods so our living barns were a after the fact use  
**1:36:52-1:37:03:**  of plantations that we had planted years earlier and in hindsight though i'm very glad that  
**1:37:03-1:37:10:**  we did plant those conifer plantations and i think that they've probably been one of  
**1:37:10-1:37:17:**  our greatest assets across the entire farm or one of the greatest benefits of our tree  
**1:37:17-1:37:28:**  planting efforts because i just first and foremost i want my animals to be comfortable  
**1:37:28-1:37:35:**  and i think happy comfortable animals perform better they stay healthier they create less  
**1:37:35-1:37:45:**  headaches for me and as i mentioned earlier i think that livestock particularly ruminant  
**1:37:45-1:37:51:**  livestock with the fermentation in their rumens they're able to generate enough heat to stay  
**1:37:51-1:37:59:**  warm but they definitely benefit from having some place that they can get out of the wind  
**1:37:59-1:38:08:**  and the driving snow or freezing rain and be more comfortable during those those types  
**1:38:08-1:38:15:**  of winter storms now what i'm talking about is is common during a winter here in upstate  
**1:38:15-1:38:22:**  new york it may not be as common during a winter in greece for example or in central  
**1:38:22-1:38:27:**  argentina nonetheless i i'm sure you can think of examples of where your animals would like  
**1:38:27-1:38:34:**  to have some shelter from the extremes and and maybe it's not cold maybe it's more heat  
**1:38:34-1:38:43:**  but to me living barns is living barns is a concept that to me makes sense 10 times  
**1:38:43-1:38:48:**  out of 10 i i don't really see a downside to it when compared to the alternatives of  
**1:38:48-1:38:55:**  having to build a roofed shelter and to build even a very minimal pole barn type structure  
**1:38:55-1:39:05:**  here in new york you're starting at a cost and this is pre-supply chain shortages you  
**1:39:05-1:39:10:**  would be looking at a minimum cost of probably ten dollars per square meter of roof shelter  
**1:39:10-1:39:17:**  and today it's probably closer to twenty dollars per square meter but then on top of that it's  
**1:39:17-1:39:24:**  a structure that we have to maintain over time and here in new york at least agricultural  
**1:39:24-1:39:32:**  buildings are only exempted from property taxes for the first 10 years so every building  
**1:39:32-1:39:40:**  that i build on the farm i'm eventually paying taxes and our taxes are very significant here  
**1:39:40-1:39:49:**  on the value of that structure so i see buildings as a asset that requires maintenance and depreciates  
**1:39:49-1:39:55:**  over time i see living barns on the other hand is uh it requires some maintenance or  
**1:39:55-1:40:00:**  at least it requires some some care we still want to go in there and thin the same way  
**1:40:00-1:40:06:**  we would thin our woods for timber production or thinning our woods for civil pasture production  
**1:40:06-1:40:12:**  because we want to reduce the competition amongst trees take out the poor quality trees  
**1:40:12-1:40:19:**  and promote the growth of our better trees but our living barns appreciate over time  
**1:40:19-1:40:24:**  because these are trees that continue to grow bigger and more valuable but in the living  
**1:40:24-1:40:30:**  barns our primary objective is creating good shelter for animals from winter storms it's  
**1:40:30-1:40:37:**  not necessarily trying to maximize the amount of forage that we're growing underneath so  
**1:40:37-1:40:43:**  in our living barns we tend to use species or favor species in this thinning because  
**1:40:43-1:40:51:**  these were all mixed coniferous plantations we're favoring species that tend to have denser  
**1:40:51-1:40:58:**  foliage denser canopies so spruce and fir versus say pine and larch and larch would  
**1:40:58-1:41:04:**  be deciduous anyhow it's not that we have thinned out all of the pine or all of the  
**1:41:04-1:41:14:**  larch we're just not favoring those as much as we do the more dense canopy conifer species  
**1:41:14-1:41:22:**  so when we use the term living barn atm i think that uh might create a false impression  
**1:41:22-1:41:27:**  of like these are areas where we put the animals for the duration of the winter we have them  
**1:41:27-1:41:33:**  for extensive periods of time in the winter that's not at all how we use our living barns  
**1:41:33-1:41:39:**  on our farm so i said earlier that we have a little over 20 acres of living barn areas  
**1:41:39-1:41:44:**  but it's six different plantations that range from about half a hectare in size to about  
**1:41:44-1:41:51:**  three hectares in size and that was that wasn't something we planned 30 years ago we again  
**1:41:51-1:41:57:**  we weren't planting these trees as living barns today i might make them perhaps a little  
**1:41:57-1:42:02:**  bigger and design them a little differently but we were utilizing what we had already  
**1:42:02-1:42:10:**  put there in previous years through our planting efforts we don't what we we try to do with  
**1:42:10-1:42:17:**  our living barn areas is we we put hay either in or adjacent to them so like we might put  
**1:42:17-1:42:25:**  them on the down downwind sides of these plantations most of our storms here come from the west  
**1:42:25-1:42:31:**  or north so we try to have hay on the say the south and the east side but you you don't  
**1:42:31-1:42:36:**  always know so we have storms called nor'easters where the wind of course comes out east so  
**1:42:36-1:42:43:**  in some of the living barns we might put the hay on the west side or the north side and  
**1:42:43-1:42:49:**  we hold those areas in reserve until we really need them so with our farm grazing across  
**1:42:49-1:42:55:**  these 500 acres during the growing season in the winter we might utilize half to two  
**1:42:55-1:43:04:**  thirds of that total grazing base that by the way is divided into about 120 permanent  
**1:43:04-1:43:10:**  paddocks we're rotationally bale grazing throughout the winter but when the animals when the weather  
**1:43:10-1:43:17:**  is relatively mild we can put the animals pretty much wherever we want when the we look  
**1:43:17-1:43:23:**  at the 10-day forecast and see that severe winter weather is coming we start moving them  
**1:43:23-1:43:31:**  in the direction of one of these living barns and not all of our living barns are the same  
**1:43:31-1:43:37:**  in terms of access to water or the drainage of the soil so if it's going to be a kind  
**1:43:37-1:43:43:**  of a short duration storm we might be able to use one of the smaller living barns or  
**1:43:43-1:43:50:**  one of the living barns that say is on a lower wetter heavier soil type especially if we  
**1:43:50-1:43:55:**  know that the ground is going to be frozen for the day or two or three that the animals  
**1:43:55-1:44:02:**  are in there and then we have other living barns where if they need to ride it out for  
**1:44:02-1:44:09:**  several days of bad weather those living barn areas would be better suited so it's not that  
**1:44:09-1:44:14:**  we move the animals from one end of the farm to the other just because this living barn  
**1:44:14-1:44:19:**  might be a little better but we have multiple options around the farm so that's something  
**1:44:19-1:44:24:**  that I would recommend if people are considering establishing living barns as well first of  
**1:44:24-1:44:31:**  all don't wait because it'll take time for those trees to grow so the best time to plant  
**1:44:31-1:44:40:**  tree was yesterday right or 30 years ago but it's never too late either so but think about  
**1:44:40-1:44:46:**  having instead of just like one big living barn area where you're beating up on it more  
**1:44:46-1:44:52:**  frequently having multiple smaller living barn areas these living barns really only  
**1:44:52-1:44:59:**  need to be big enough that for whatever the size of your herd is or your flock is that  
**1:44:59-1:45:07:**  they can most of the animals can get shelter for most of the time and we lay in bed during  
**1:45:07-1:45:13:**  a winter blizzard and think oh it's so miserable out there my animals must be miserable too  
**1:45:13-1:45:20:**  well the animals are probably more comfortable than you think but giving allowing them or  
**1:45:20-1:45:24:**  giving them access to these areas where they can get out of the wind a little bit get their  
**1:45:24-1:45:34:**  faces out of that driving sleet like snow that just makes them it's taking one like  
**1:45:34-1:45:42:**  we don't like to stand out there in the blizzard and get pelted in the face by hail like granular  
**1:45:42-1:45:50:**  snow so don't our animals don't enjoy it either and if they can just get out it's it's not  
**1:45:50-1:45:54:**  even that it's necessarily keeping them dry even though if they get under a fairly dense  
**1:45:54-1:46:03:**  canopy of dense conifers they're they're probably gonna get soaked much less and in this by  
**1:46:03-1:46:08:**  the way doesn't necessarily work with all livestock species like goats for example goats  
**1:46:08-1:46:13:**  once they get soaked and they're subjected to cold temperatures they're more vulnerable  
**1:46:13-1:46:21:**  to things like pneumonia respiratory diseases than sheep or cattle but every little bit  
**1:46:21-1:46:27:**  helps so I think living barns is just a very practical and cost-effective way of where  
**1:46:27-1:46:33:**  we can be using trees to meet one of the important needs of our animals versus having to build  
**1:46:33-1:46:41:**  very expensive high maintenance roofed barns or sheds but I feel like listening to you  
**1:46:41-1:46:46:**  it's quite important to be able to rotate between different areas and having multiple  
**1:46:46-1:46:52:**  sites to avoid for example I was thinking one of the things I would like to avoid is  
**1:46:52-1:46:58:**  concentrating manure and one part of the farm where it's actually not needed and might even  
**1:46:58-1:47:03:**  be detrimental but actually by having this constant rotation and just including them  
**1:47:03-1:47:08:**  for short amount of time at certain periods of the year you're still able to distribute  
**1:47:08-1:47:13:**  nutrients where you want them and avoid any damage to those areas either I guess.  
**1:47:13-1:47:19:**  Yeah so to put it in context you know in here in upstate New York it's a we have a real  
**1:47:19-1:47:27:**  winter here so we have six months potentially or more of winter weather but of those six  
**1:47:27-1:47:36:**  months we may have six weeks where it's really feels like winter meaning snow and really  
**1:47:36-1:47:45:**  cold temperatures and of those six weeks we probably only have six days that our animals  
**1:47:45-1:47:54:**  would seek out shelter if they had access to it so it's not like we need to have our  
**1:47:54-1:48:02:**  animals in or around these living barns all winter long but there are certainly days every  
**1:48:02-1:48:10:**  year where the animals they could probably weather out these storms fine without the  
**1:48:10-1:48:16:**  shelter but again the more happy and comfortable we can make our animals the better that works  
**1:48:16-1:48:26:**  for all of us so these living barns it's just taking something that is there or that we  
**1:48:26-1:48:34:**  can pretty practically put there and using it for another important purpose which is  
**1:48:34-1:48:41:**  giving some refuge to our animals when they really need it.

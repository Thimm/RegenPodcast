### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Thu, 09 Jun 2022 15:32:13)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:33:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:33-0:00:34:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:34-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:45:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:48:**  Welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:50:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:50-0:00:55:**  In this episode, I talk with Felix Riecken who is planting out silver pastoral and silver  
**0:00:55-0:00:59:**  arable systems on his family farm in the north of Germany.  
**0:00:59-0:01:03:**  He explains the journey that led him to agroforestry and integrating these techniques into the  
**0:01:03-0:01:05:**  family business.  
**0:01:05-0:01:10:**  His systems being still quite young, we focus the conversation on the design, the objectives  
**0:01:10-0:01:13:**  and the establishment of the tree systems.  
**0:01:13-0:01:18:**  This goes from choosing the right genetics to protecting the trees and managing the weeds.  
**0:01:18-0:01:23:**  Felix also explains how he successfully funded the agroforestry systems.  
**0:01:23-0:01:28:**  Unfortunately we had many technical issues during the recording with Felix so the quality  
**0:01:28-0:01:30:**  of the recording is not perfect.  
**0:01:30-0:01:34:**  I apologize for that and I hope you still enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:34-0:01:37:**  So hi Felix, welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:37-0:01:40:**  Hey Etienne, very nice to having me.  
**0:01:40-0:01:43:**  It's a great honor to be part of this.  
**0:01:43-0:01:48:**  To kick us off, tell us a bit more about your family farm and a bit of its history.  
**0:01:48-0:01:57:**  Okay, it started in 1899 so we have quite a journey ahead.  
**0:01:57-0:02:03:**  It's been bought from the father of my great-great-grandfather.  
**0:02:03-0:02:06:**  He got the farm to start off.  
**0:02:06-0:02:15:**  I don't know a lot about what happened back then but in one writing it said we now have  
**0:02:15-0:02:23:**  to work for all the stuff that got neglected to make this farm flourish again.  
**0:02:23-0:02:28:**  So this is something that got really into my head, something that moved me.  
**0:02:28-0:02:35:**  I think all of my predecessors on this farm worked their asses off which makes me very  
**0:02:35-0:02:45:**  proud and yeah, career was what was back then but well, this is something nobody can do.  
**0:02:45-0:02:46:**  Nobody can answer me.  
**0:02:46-0:02:58:**  Well I have this writing and I want to do the same to make this farm flourish and yeah,  
**0:02:58-0:03:04:**  benefit the generations after me as my predecessors did.  
**0:03:04-0:03:14:**  So keeping this journey growing, my great-grandfather, he was known to be a guy that really, yeah,  
**0:03:14-0:03:17:**  cared for nature.  
**0:03:17-0:03:23:**  He fed the wildlife during winter and he was known to be always carrying a little tree  
**0:03:23-0:03:33:**  with him and yeah, he was trying to fix holes in the so-called knicks that we have on the  
**0:03:33-0:03:35:**  borderlines of the paddocks.  
**0:03:35-0:03:46:**  We have a lot of wind here in northern Germany between the two oceans so this countryside  
**0:03:46-0:03:51:**  is known for these tree lines that divide different paddocks from each other to reduce  
**0:03:51-0:03:54:**  the wind impact.  
**0:03:54-0:04:01:**  So my great-grandfather, as I said, he was known to always carry a little tree to fix  
**0:04:01-0:04:08:**  a hole somewhere or to plant.  
**0:04:08-0:04:19:**  So back then, the farm got everything that one knows from a child books about farms and  
**0:04:19-0:04:30:**  then my grandfather, he was going with his time after the war doing kind of what most  
**0:04:30-0:04:33:**  of the people, most of the farmers did back then.  
**0:04:33-0:04:35:**  He was specializing.  
**0:04:35-0:04:42:**  In our case, he was specializing on milk production and effectivity that meant to get rid of all  
**0:04:42-0:04:47:**  the small animals that brought diversity but also a lot of work.  
**0:04:47-0:04:53:**  It meant to spray, for example, herbicides to not have 10 people weeding all year long.  
**0:04:53-0:04:58:**  It meant to invest in a big stable outside the village and machinery that makes many  
**0:04:58-0:05:01:**  trees stand in the way.  
**0:05:01-0:05:08:**  He once took me on a walk through a new planted fodder hatch and was kind of apologizing when  
**0:05:08-0:05:14:**  he told me where there were trees he took away during the land clearing.  
**0:05:14-0:05:20:**  I find that very impressive but I never judged him for his actions.  
**0:05:20-0:05:21:**  It was the time.  
**0:05:21-0:05:22:**  You were an outsider.  
**0:05:22-0:05:30:**  I think if you wouldn't take away your trees, maybe the farm wouldn't exist today if he  
**0:05:30-0:05:32:**  wasn't taking these decisions.  
**0:05:32-0:05:36:**  So we're coming closer towards today.  
**0:05:36-0:05:43:**  In 2006, we built our own creamery to get off the global market on milk.  
**0:05:43-0:05:46:**  That was giving us a hard time during the milk crisis.  
**0:05:46-0:05:52:**  And now we produce milk and cheese and fresh cheese and yogurt for customers in the radios  
**0:05:52-0:05:59:**  of about 15 kilometers around the farm, which includes our capital of the state Schleswig-Holstein  
**0:05:59-0:06:05:**  called Kiel with around 250,000 inhabitants.  
**0:06:05-0:06:10:**  We built up a delivery system that brings our goods directly to the front door of our  
**0:06:10-0:06:11:**  customers.  
**0:06:11-0:06:15:**  It's about 1,500.  
**0:06:15-0:06:23:**  And also we sell to some food retailers close by, some cafes, some kindergartens and offices.  
**0:06:23-0:06:30:**  So in 2016, we got our own shop on the farm with a self-service system.  
**0:06:30-0:06:31:**  That was pretty fine.  
**0:06:31-0:06:34:**  So very cheap for us to maintain.  
**0:06:34-0:06:42:**  And during the pandemics, we got more products from different farms in our region to sell  
**0:06:42-0:06:45:**  next to our products.  
**0:06:45-0:06:53:**  And now it's over 300 different products that are also sold over our delivery system.  
**0:06:53-0:07:00:**  And what we also do is like a small kindergarten is placed on our farm.  
**0:07:00-0:07:08:**  And every Monday we get like school kids coming here to learn about nature and how food is  
**0:07:08-0:07:11:**  produced.  
**0:07:11-0:07:20:**  And finally in 2017, we got organic certified without having a lot to change.  
**0:07:20-0:07:25:**  I put a little bit of pressure on my parents because I was amazed by this movement during  
**0:07:25-0:07:27:**  my apprenticeship.  
**0:07:27-0:07:35:**  But well, they did all the work that the certification need to.  
**0:07:35-0:07:44:**  So the last events like that were just a few years ago, we were installing a wood chip  
**0:07:44-0:07:50:**  heating for our whole farm, including the creamery and some more neighbors around in  
**0:07:50-0:07:52:**  the village.  
**0:07:52-0:08:06:**  And so, yeah, this gives us the spaces of a very sustainable place to bring our customers  
**0:08:06-0:08:13:**  and all the people around us the goods of our land in a very nice way.  
**0:08:13-0:08:18:**  Could you give us a sense at this point a bit more about the production system?  
**0:08:18-0:08:20:**  All right.  
**0:08:20-0:08:24:**  So the farm is about 90 hectares big.  
**0:08:24-0:08:28:**  It's 222 acres in total.  
**0:08:28-0:08:36:**  About 1.5 hectares is the yard itself and all the infrastructure.  
**0:08:36-0:08:42:**  And then we have 40 hectares of grazing paddocks and the rest is arable land.  
**0:08:42-0:08:47:**  So yeah, close to 50-50.  
**0:08:47-0:08:52:**  The climate here is temperate.  
**0:08:52-0:09:02:**  We have about 765 millimeters of rainfall with around 700 hours of sun and an average  
**0:09:02-0:09:04:**  temperature of 8.5 degrees.  
**0:09:04-0:09:13:**  So we are a little bit influenced by the Gulf Stream coming here through the North Sea.  
**0:09:13-0:09:19:**  And that gives us a little bit of warmth, which is quite nice.  
**0:09:19-0:09:21:**  Let's the grass grow very good.  
**0:09:21-0:09:25:**  What kind of soil do you have?  
**0:09:25-0:09:29:**  It's clay with some sand inside.  
**0:09:29-0:09:35:**  I'm not sure how the perfect word is for that.  
**0:09:35-0:09:40:**  Yeah, but it's a heavy soil.  
**0:09:40-0:09:49:**  Hard to cultivate perfectly, but has a lot of nutrients inside and holds a lot of water.  
**0:09:49-0:09:52:**  So yeah, beneficial.  
**0:09:52-0:09:53:**  That's for sure.  
**0:09:53-0:09:58:**  It's not sand or something that you can't really work with.  
**0:09:58-0:10:05:**  Well, coming back to the climate in 2018, this was very different.  
**0:10:05-0:10:10:**  So this year we've had a really warm winter with a lot of rain.  
**0:10:10-0:10:21:**  So yeah, I wonder how these numbers are going to change because of the climate change.  
**0:10:21-0:10:26:**  Every year we have some kind of weather phenomena that my grandfather, after more than 60 years  
**0:10:26-0:10:29:**  of living here, hasn't experienced yet.  
**0:10:29-0:10:42:**  So yeah, it's always hard to tell how the climate is or how it's going to be.  
**0:10:42-0:10:51:**  The soil gives us the benefit that, as I said, the water can be hold very long and we have  
**0:10:51-0:10:58:**  a good situation even on a changing climate.  
**0:10:58-0:11:09:**  And as I said, we produce milk in the first hand and that's where we are definitely specialized  
**0:11:09-0:11:11:**  at the moment still.  
**0:11:11-0:11:16:**  But it's a little bit of diversifying going on.  
**0:11:16-0:11:25:**  So last year we seriously started with vegetables, growing garlic and pumpkins and celery alongside  
**0:11:25-0:11:26:**  the trees.  
**0:11:26-0:11:27:**  It's kind of amazing.  
**0:11:27-0:11:31:**  I will talk later about that for sure.  
**0:11:31-0:11:37:**  And we also produced and sold a few tomato plants for our customers in the spring to  
**0:11:37-0:11:40:**  grow in their backyards.  
**0:11:40-0:11:45:**  And every year we have one field of grains on our cropping rotation.  
**0:11:45-0:11:51:**  We grow spelt usually for selling to the open market.  
**0:11:51-0:11:59:**  And yeah, I think that's about what's interesting to the farm.  
**0:11:59-0:12:07:**  One thing is that all our fields are very close by, so we don't have to drive more than  
**0:12:07-0:12:12:**  1.5 kilometers to reach every part of our farm.  
**0:12:12-0:12:14:**  This is very amazing.  
**0:12:14-0:12:21:**  And especially with the cows, the grazing paddocks are just next to our stables.  
**0:12:21-0:12:29:**  So there's 30 hectares of grass where we can just open the doors and let the cows graze.  
**0:12:29-0:12:31:**  Sounds like a pretty epic farm.  
**0:12:31-0:12:34:**  It's amazing.  
**0:12:34-0:12:40:**  For having a little bit of picture of the countryside, it's a little bit hilly, not  
**0:12:40-0:12:44:**  too much, but not flat at all.  
**0:12:44-0:12:51:**  It looks like a little bit from the Lord of the Rings, how it's called, the Shire.  
**0:12:51-0:12:56:**  I always like to compare.  
**0:12:56-0:12:59:**  And how do you come into the picture then?  
**0:12:59-0:13:04:**  You've mentioned it's a family farm, but have you always known that you wanted to farm there?  
**0:13:04-0:13:07:**  Or how did you come about getting started there?  
**0:13:07-0:13:09:**  It's a little bit of a journey.  
**0:13:09-0:13:12:**  I will start with the apprenticeship.  
**0:13:12-0:13:17:**  So when I experienced organic farming in my second year of apprenticeship, there was passion  
**0:13:17-0:13:18:**  being built.  
**0:13:18-0:13:24:**  I truly love to learn how to work with the principles of nature, trying to build nutrient  
**0:13:24-0:13:30:**  cycles instead of chains and trying to interfere with nature to make it more productive in  
**0:13:30-0:13:33:**  terms of producing food.  
**0:13:33-0:13:40:**  So during this apprenticeship, I always wanted to dig deeper than my teachers could answer.  
**0:13:40-0:13:46:**  And I was on my way to understand how agriculture functions.  
**0:13:46-0:13:53:**  At one point, I realized that the main part of agriculture is to solve problems that nature  
**0:13:53-0:13:55:**  is setting.  
**0:13:55-0:14:00:**  So we always work against natural processes in agriculture.  
**0:14:00-0:14:08:**  I figured that was one key event that would have a bigger impact on what I was about to  
**0:14:08-0:14:10:**  experience later on.  
**0:14:10-0:14:19:**  And I went on to study ecological agriculture, agricultural science and pits and housing.  
**0:14:19-0:14:25:**  I was trying to set up myself for the role I was going to play here when I'd be home  
**0:14:25-0:14:30:**  to detach my dad as CEO of this farm.  
**0:14:30-0:14:34:**  And I soon realized that I would have to spend much more time studying if I wanted to get  
**0:14:34-0:14:40:**  the knowledge I needed for taking this position and still doing my bachelor degree.  
**0:14:40-0:14:46:**  So I quit writing exams on topics I wasn't interested in.  
**0:14:46-0:14:50:**  I focused on the candy that the university was able to offer.  
**0:14:50-0:14:58:**  So that led me to not getting the bachelor's, but I figured myself spending time on studying  
**0:14:58-0:15:05:**  way more efficient than most of my fellow students.  
**0:15:05-0:15:11:**  Found myself having much more time for topics that are most valuable for me.  
**0:15:11-0:15:15:**  I learned how I could optimize nutrient cycles on my farm.  
**0:15:15-0:15:21:**  I spent a lot of time in understanding soil and how it functions, how composting works  
**0:15:21-0:15:22:**  and so on.  
**0:15:22-0:15:28:**  I also spent a lot of time to learn and think about sustainability, especially in our system  
**0:15:28-0:15:30:**  of food production.  
**0:15:30-0:15:38:**  The common good economy principle, they caught my focus during studies.  
**0:15:38-0:15:44:**  And in the meantime, I was spending a lot of time learning how to practically grow vegetables  
**0:15:44-0:15:48:**  that I wasn't learning in the apprenticeship.  
**0:15:48-0:15:52:**  Take care of all the plants.  
**0:15:52-0:15:59:**  And one point I figured like mushrooms and fungi, very amazing stuff.  
**0:15:59-0:16:02:**  Had to learn about that a little bit more.  
**0:16:02-0:16:03:**  So I did.  
**0:16:03-0:16:05:**  I had the time.  
**0:16:05-0:16:12:**  And yeah, this all together gave me a much bigger understanding of nature and how we  
**0:16:12-0:16:17:**  could bring it into this food producing system.  
**0:16:17-0:16:26:**  So in 2018, we had like this drought I was mentioning earlier and I was coming home in  
**0:16:26-0:16:27:**  October 2020.  
**0:16:27-0:16:31:**  So it started to rain again after this drought.  
**0:16:31-0:16:45:**  And I realized that this is like, well, if we don't solve the problem of water on this  
**0:16:45-0:16:58:**  farm, it could be like very influencing our future producing system here.  
**0:16:58-0:17:08:**  And so that year we sold 12 animals to the butcher early to be able to feed the others.  
**0:17:08-0:17:12:**  We started to feed our winter fodder in August.  
**0:17:12-0:17:15:**  And one cow died at a heat stroke.  
**0:17:15-0:17:28:**  So very extreme situation on this farm, very extreme situation during my time of experiencing  
**0:17:28-0:17:31:**  agriculture.  
**0:17:31-0:17:37:**  And yeah, I realized that the bigger problem was our climate crisis.  
**0:17:37-0:17:47:**  And with thawing that we'd have to struggle less with extreme weather situations that  
**0:17:47-0:17:53:**  would lead to better yields and stuff everywhere around the globe.  
**0:17:53-0:18:01:**  And when I came here on the farm in that year, I went to the paddocks and I saw it getting  
**0:18:01-0:18:09:**  green first next to these tree lines I was mentioning earlier.  
**0:18:09-0:18:19:**  And I went on the internet and looked it up or start to searching for how trees are influencing  
**0:18:19-0:18:22:**  our agricultural system.  
**0:18:22-0:18:34:**  And that led me to agroforestry and I still had one year and a half to start diving deeper  
**0:18:34-0:18:39:**  into this and start planning the first systems for our farm.  
**0:18:39-0:18:49:**  And yeah, that's what we did first when I came back in October 2020.  
**0:18:49-0:18:51:**  And how did your parents welcome this?  
**0:18:51-0:18:57:**  I mean, you arriving with new ideas and the idea of including trees, for example, did  
**0:18:57-0:19:01:**  they get that project or were they a bit skeptical?  
**0:19:01-0:19:10:**  I was earlier talking a lot about my grand-grandfather that influenced my dad a lot, the guy that  
**0:19:10-0:19:14:**  always carried the tree.  
**0:19:14-0:19:19:**  From that impact, my father always wanted to be a forester.  
**0:19:19-0:19:23:**  But his dad made him to take over the farm.  
**0:19:23-0:19:36:**  So he was a farmer wanting to be a forester that gave me a very easy time to make him  
**0:19:36-0:19:43:**  understand why trees are a good impact to everything else around us.  
**0:19:43-0:19:56:**  So it was a little bit weird for all of them to get these ideas into the system, but it  
**0:19:56-0:20:06:**  was everything else and a hard time for me telling them my ideas and making them know  
**0:20:06-0:20:09:**  that this would be beneficial for us all.  
**0:20:09-0:20:11:**  So what are these tree systems then?  
**0:20:11-0:20:17:**  Give us a description of what they look like and where they are in the landscape.  
**0:20:17-0:20:26:**  So we have both silvopastural systems and silvowarable systems.  
**0:20:26-0:20:29:**  I will start on the silvopasture.  
**0:20:29-0:20:35:**  It's basically three different systems that are connected to each other.  
**0:20:35-0:20:41:**  We have a little chestnut archer, which is a kind of experiment in the first hand.  
**0:20:41-0:20:49:**  And we have an apple and pea orchard on the closest grazing paddock.  
**0:20:49-0:21:00:**  And in between these two, we have a fodder hedge that's planted alongside our pathways  
**0:21:00-0:21:08:**  for the animals we built early on.  
**0:21:08-0:21:23:**  So the orchards are both ally cropping systems, which have spacings of 12 meters between the  
**0:21:23-0:21:28:**  trees and 17 meters in between the tree lines.  
**0:21:28-0:21:35:**  So we are able to work with our biggest machine, the slurry tank, which spreads around 15 meters  
**0:21:35-0:21:38:**  in total.  
**0:21:38-0:21:48:**  And the chestnut orchard also is set up in a keyline system where we'd be able to work  
**0:21:48-0:21:50:**  with the keyline equipment and stuff like that.  
**0:21:50-0:21:53:**  Those fodder hedges, you say they're along the pathways.  
**0:21:53-0:22:00:**  That's the paths that the cows take every day to go back to the milking parlor.  
**0:22:00-0:22:02:**  And how do you plan to manage that then?  
**0:22:02-0:22:07:**  Do you plan to have them outside of the cow's reach and that you give access to the fodder  
**0:22:07-0:22:09:**  when you decide to?  
**0:22:09-0:22:11:**  Or do you just let them browse as they go by?  
**0:22:11-0:22:18:**  Well, at first, we definitely keep them outside to let the trees develop.  
**0:22:18-0:22:27:**  But later on, when the trees are big enough, we let them browse up to the height they can  
**0:22:27-0:22:28:**  reach.  
**0:22:28-0:22:31:**  But not too much inside the fodder hedge.  
**0:22:31-0:22:39:**  So there is going to be an electrified fence around it to space them from the essential  
**0:22:39-0:22:41:**  parts of the trees.  
**0:22:41-0:22:46:**  And everything that grows above, I'd like to harvest.  
**0:22:46-0:22:56:**  And at the moment, we are planning a hay drying system and a new stable for the animals.  
**0:22:56-0:23:04:**  And that we'd like to produce fodder hay or leaf hay.  
**0:23:04-0:23:13:**  I'm not sure how exactly you'd call that.  
**0:23:13-0:23:16:**  So we have some of that for the winter as well.  
**0:23:16-0:23:22:**  I heard and read that there is a lot of minerals in the leaves of the trees.  
**0:23:22-0:23:29:**  And some trees, for example, the mulberry, they have lots of protein that I'd like to  
**0:23:29-0:23:31:**  use for the animals.  
**0:23:31-0:23:39:**  So both scraping and harvesting for winter is going to be the plan over there.  
**0:23:39-0:23:44:**  Have you come across resources on how you could harvest and dry it efficiently?  
**0:23:44-0:23:48:**  Because I think that's one of the main challenges with the tree hay.  
**0:23:48-0:23:53:**  However appealing it might be is like compared to grass hay, which is easily mechanized,  
**0:23:53-0:23:58:**  it doesn't seem so easy to put in place on a large scale.  
**0:23:58-0:24:03:**  I kind of pushed that a little bit towards the future.  
**0:24:03-0:24:04:**  We just planted the trees.  
**0:24:04-0:24:09:**  It's about five, six more years until we really start harvesting.  
**0:24:09-0:24:15:**  And so we still have a little bit of time and maybe let the others who are inventing  
**0:24:15-0:24:20:**  those machines a little bit of time.  
**0:24:20-0:24:30:**  I have two guys that are in the machinery producing industry and they are curious already  
**0:24:30-0:24:33:**  how the fodder hatch is going to look like in a few years.  
**0:24:33-0:24:38:**  So they can make like a little bit of brainstorming as well how the perfect machine would look  
**0:24:38-0:24:40:**  like.  
**0:24:40-0:24:50:**  From another person in Germany who is working with agroforestry, he's curious about the  
**0:24:50-0:25:06:**  winery tools where you drive alongside a vineyard and cut the leaves of the wine grape plants.  
**0:25:06-0:25:12:**  So yeah, still time to figure something out.  
**0:25:12-0:25:16:**  We haven't yet paid the most attention to that.  
**0:25:16-0:25:20:**  So we were continuing our virtual tour of the farm.  
**0:25:20-0:25:25:**  So what other tree systems do you have in addition to the silvopastral ones?  
**0:25:25-0:25:33:**  So there is the Sibero arable system that we planted last year in autumn and this year.  
**0:25:33-0:25:43:**  We have willow trees alongside the road that is next to the field.  
**0:25:43-0:25:50:**  And then in the field we have another ally cropping system with a spacing of 34 meters.  
**0:25:50-0:25:53:**  So double the spacing of the orchards.  
**0:25:53-0:26:00:**  So we can drive a little bit more easily with our big machinery and we always get contractors  
**0:26:00-0:26:07:**  for harvesting the grass for example or harvesting the grains that are growing there.  
**0:26:07-0:26:09:**  And they are getting bigger and bigger.  
**0:26:09-0:26:20:**  So I figured this could be more sustainable for long term decisions to have a bit wider  
**0:26:20-0:26:23:**  spacing in between the tree lines.  
**0:26:23-0:26:35:**  What we are growing there is raspberry at the closest to the ground and honeyberry.  
**0:26:35-0:26:40:**  So these two are the berry varieties in there.  
**0:26:40-0:26:46:**  And then so it's built up.  
**0:26:46-0:26:53:**  The whole system is a little bit going towards the principles of centropic agriculture or  
**0:26:53-0:26:55:**  centropic agroforestry.  
**0:26:55-0:27:06:**  So over the raspberries we grow kind of biodiversity trees and willow trees for organic matter.  
**0:27:06-0:27:14:**  And those are going to be overgrown by walnut trees which is maybe the main part of this  
**0:27:14-0:27:18:**  whole system to grow walnuts and harvest them.  
**0:27:18-0:27:27:**  And the upper level or the last level that is overgrown by value trees.  
**0:27:27-0:27:38:**  So it's for veneer industry in like 60, 70 years when we harvest those trees.  
**0:27:38-0:27:47:**  I hope that every one of those trees, it's about I think 25 or something of those, they  
**0:27:47-0:27:56:**  will at the moment give about 6,000 to 8,000 euros one tree.  
**0:27:56-0:28:04:**  And I figured this could be a nice possibility for future generations to have when they can  
**0:28:04-0:28:07:**  harvest those trees.  
**0:28:07-0:28:11:**  So on the tree line it's planted pretty dense if I understand properly.  
**0:28:11-0:28:12:**  Oh yeah.  
**0:28:12-0:28:13:**  You have all these different strata's.  
**0:28:13-0:28:14:**  Yeah.  
**0:28:14-0:28:22:**  It was hard the whole planting season and to get all the work done.  
**0:28:22-0:28:28:**  So we skipped the raspberries and the honey berries for next year.  
**0:28:28-0:28:33:**  At the moment we just have the walnut trees and the value trees growing there.  
**0:28:33-0:28:37:**  But it's going to be dense, that's for sure.  
**0:28:37-0:28:43:**  And I'm curious to see like, so of course I understood that in the beginning there was  
**0:28:43-0:28:50:**  this context of the drought and everything was dried up and you had to sell cows.  
**0:28:50-0:28:53:**  So I understand the silver arable systems really well.  
**0:28:53-0:28:57:**  What led you to bring trees into your arable fields as well?  
**0:28:57-0:28:59:**  Was it just to maximize the amount of trees?  
**0:28:59-0:29:05:**  Was it because you saw an advantage as well for the crop being grown?  
**0:29:05-0:29:07:**  What was your thought process there?  
**0:29:07-0:29:12:**  My main vision for our farm I'd like to call eco-culture.  
**0:29:12-0:29:19:**  And with me being an eco-culturist, which sounds a lot better in German I have to admit.  
**0:29:19-0:29:24:**  So it's a combination of horticulture, agriculture and forestry.  
**0:29:24-0:29:30:**  And I see a lot of benefits in combining these three systems of land use for maximizing the  
**0:29:30-0:29:39:**  intensity to feed 10 billion humans on earth and fight climate crisis with that.  
**0:29:39-0:29:47:**  So these are the main goals I think I'd like to achieve with eco-forestry in the beginning.  
**0:29:47-0:29:50:**  So it was the idea of intensifying production in a sense.  
**0:29:50-0:29:53:**  You're like how productive can we get this farm?  
**0:29:53-0:29:57:**  How many layers of productivity can we add on top of each other?  
**0:29:57-0:30:00:**  That's the main challenge you're answering.  
**0:30:00-0:30:02:**  That's for sure.  
**0:30:02-0:30:09:**  I mentioned that all of my predecessors they managed to let the farm grow a little bit  
**0:30:09-0:30:11:**  in size.  
**0:30:11-0:30:18:**  I think this is a little bit your top pick in the moment because of the crisis of the  
**0:30:18-0:30:19:**  land are crazy.  
**0:30:19-0:30:24:**  And I really don't see the point.  
**0:30:24-0:30:36:**  But a key of still growing, which is interesting to give more people the opportunity to benefit  
**0:30:36-0:30:47:**  of our farm, is to intensify and produce more from less fuel.  
**0:30:47-0:30:53:**  Tell us a bit about the objectives of each specific system and a bit your methodology  
**0:30:53-0:30:56:**  in designing those systems.  
**0:30:56-0:31:03:**  I think my main motivation was and is to have a serious action against climate change.  
**0:31:03-0:31:08:**  I'm aware my and the existence of those around me depend on it.  
**0:31:08-0:31:13:**  So yeah, this is definitely my main motivation.  
**0:31:13-0:31:20:**  I also like to see our natural sources as four different production factors like water  
**0:31:20-0:31:29:**  and soil and biodiversity and the sun and the three first ones we are able to regenerate.  
**0:31:29-0:31:36:**  So the sun might not be able to be affected by us, but we can try to use it most effective  
**0:31:36-0:31:38:**  as possible.  
**0:31:38-0:31:43:**  So this is what we're trying to do with agroforestry.  
**0:31:43-0:31:52:**  At first over here in Sleswig-Höllstein it's very windy because we have our country in  
**0:31:52-0:32:02:**  between two oceans and the wind reduction and the shade and an increase of organic matter  
**0:32:02-0:32:07:**  saves and stores water in the soil and the ecosystem around it.  
**0:32:07-0:32:12:**  So this is quite essential as we saw in 2018.  
**0:32:12-0:32:20:**  And yeah, there water came into my head and stayed ever since.  
**0:32:20-0:32:26:**  And like when you start to understand what soil really is and what you can do to increase  
**0:32:26-0:32:32:**  its fertility, its ability to grow plants and its ability to store carbon, you'd find  
**0:32:32-0:32:38:**  many similarities between what agroforestry does and what soil needs.  
**0:32:38-0:32:44:**  And with our knowledge now and innovative technology, we can build soil instead of letting  
**0:32:44-0:32:47:**  it erode by wind and water.  
**0:32:47-0:32:54:**  And I think the biodiversity part speaks for itself.  
**0:32:54-0:32:59:**  Definitely a main motivation to connect different wooden structures in our countryside with  
**0:32:59-0:33:06:**  each other to let the smaller wildlife be able to move and find partners.  
**0:33:06-0:33:10:**  So this is basically what the fodder hedge does.  
**0:33:10-0:33:16:**  It's spreading over our grazing paddocks to connect different wooden structures that already  
**0:33:16-0:33:20:**  exist.  
**0:33:20-0:33:25:**  As I already mentioned, I think a lot about nutrient cycles in our farming system.  
**0:33:25-0:33:32:**  And here and there we have leakages with nutrients.  
**0:33:32-0:33:37:**  Sometimes they are concentrated so they would erode through the soil.  
**0:33:37-0:33:43:**  For example, at the pathways of our grazing paddocks where the animals spent a lot of  
**0:33:43-0:33:45:**  time walking.  
**0:33:45-0:33:50:**  And there we planted the forage alongside.  
**0:33:50-0:33:57:**  So the idea was that the trees would grow underneath and keep the nutrients from polluting  
**0:33:57-0:34:02:**  our water bodies by getting eroded vertically.  
**0:34:02-0:34:08:**  So I think this has economic value as well.  
**0:34:08-0:34:12:**  So the nutrients in organic agriculture are quite expensive.  
**0:34:12-0:34:17:**  So I focus on keeping them in our system.  
**0:34:17-0:34:24:**  For sure I find a lot of motivation in making our animals who are like the part of the farm  
**0:34:24-0:34:27:**  that keeps everything running.  
**0:34:27-0:34:32:**  So I'd like to give them a much more enjoyable place on earth.  
**0:34:32-0:34:38:**  I find it unethical to use animals for consumption without trying to give them all they need  
**0:34:38-0:34:42:**  to live the best life.  
**0:34:42-0:34:50:**  So creating a more homogeneous shade and sun ratios in a warming climate plus give them  
**0:34:50-0:34:55:**  something to scratch themselves in case they feel too inexperienced, make them happier  
**0:34:55-0:34:57:**  beings.  
**0:34:57-0:35:03:**  So with stuff like this, I always enjoy to create beautiful pictures in the context of  
**0:35:03-0:35:05:**  food production.  
**0:35:05-0:35:12:**  So last year we started the mother-bonded rearing of our calves.  
**0:35:12-0:35:20:**  And in the fruit orchard on one of our paddocks, we now start to let the cows in with their  
**0:35:20-0:35:28:**  up to 1.5 month old calves and rotate in an Irish grazing system in between the trees.  
**0:35:28-0:35:34:**  So imagine now 50 fruit trees starting to flower in the spring with happy calves and  
**0:35:34-0:35:37:**  moms enjoying their time underneath.  
**0:35:37-0:35:43:**  So those visions gave me the power and motivation and create the emotional impact on those who  
**0:35:43-0:35:50:**  think about what kind of fruit producers they want to support with their consumption.  
**0:35:50-0:36:02:**  And yeah, those are like main ideas and main pictures in my head that we like to transform  
**0:36:02-0:36:07:**  our paddocks and arable lands with.  
**0:36:07-0:36:13:**  But how did you go from those visions and those pictures to actually implementing a  
**0:36:13-0:36:15:**  plan?  
**0:36:15-0:36:20:**  How was the process of actually then deciding what tree to put in and where to put it in?  
**0:36:20-0:36:27:**  Before we planned the tree, there is always like a big process of planning.  
**0:36:27-0:36:37:**  I've had lots of talking to different consultants, especially the company Trieperk from Witzen  
**0:36:37-0:36:38:**  Hausen.  
**0:36:38-0:36:48:**  They are giving me very much help for the arable system and helping me with the trees  
**0:36:48-0:36:50:**  planted already.  
**0:36:50-0:37:02:**  So for example, in the arable system, we were planning for, I think, three quarters of a  
**0:37:02-0:37:07:**  year before we even planted the tree.  
**0:37:07-0:37:13:**  We thought about where the wind is coming from and how the sun goes over the arable  
**0:37:13-0:37:27:**  land and how we would put the tree lines towards the sun and how we'd space the willow trees  
**0:37:27-0:37:43:**  next to the street, which is the opposed side of the paddock for the wind.  
**0:37:43-0:37:51:**  We always think about wind first, where to put trees to shelter off that, and then try  
**0:37:51-0:38:03:**  to use the sun perfectly as we put the allies of the trees in the north to south direction  
**0:38:03-0:38:12:**  to have no place next to the trees, which is always in the shade or always in the sun.  
**0:38:12-0:38:13:**  You understand?  
**0:38:13-0:38:14:**  Yeah, very well.  
**0:38:14-0:38:19:**  But did that conflict with, for example, the usual way machinery would move around in the  
**0:38:19-0:38:26:**  field because sometimes you have these principles, but then you have a field that just the shape  
**0:38:26-0:38:31:**  means that it's much more logical to plant if you had a rectangle, for example, in the  
**0:38:31-0:38:32:**  length.  
**0:38:32-0:38:39:**  Were you able to conciliate this kind of north-south light consideration with efficient movement  
**0:38:39-0:38:41:**  of machinery?  
**0:38:41-0:38:43:**  That's for sure.  
**0:38:43-0:38:54:**  The paddocks we already planted the trees on, we had the beneficial situation that the  
**0:38:54-0:39:05:**  most effective way to drive with the machines are those north-south directions.  
**0:39:05-0:39:11:**  Not perfectly, but nearly.  
**0:39:11-0:39:17:**  It's going to be a little bit different on other paddocks that we are definitely planning  
**0:39:17-0:39:21:**  to grow trees on as well.  
**0:39:21-0:39:24:**  I also see beneficials in that.  
**0:39:24-0:39:38:**  When we have these shade situations behind a tree line that's from east to west and a  
**0:39:38-0:39:45:**  place on the south where always is sun, we diversify our land again and create different  
**0:39:45-0:39:52:**  habitats for animals that then diversify our whole ecosystem.  
**0:39:52-0:39:57:**  I think there is the main key in diversifying.  
**0:39:57-0:40:02:**  Then in the choice of which plants to...  
**0:40:02-0:40:09:**  You mentioned, for example, chestnut orchards, how did you come about choosing what varieties  
**0:40:09-0:40:16:**  of plants to put in, what was most adapted or what you wanted to experiment with?  
**0:40:16-0:40:24:**  Staying at the chestnuts, for example, I figured there's going to be a problem or I think there's  
**0:40:24-0:40:33:**  going to be a problem in the future with the grains we are consuming, like very high-bred  
**0:40:33-0:40:43:**  weeds, for example, makes the consumers sometimes have these gluten intolerances.  
**0:40:43-0:40:48:**  The chestnut is a valuable calorie.  
**0:40:48-0:40:50:**  Carbohydrates.  
**0:40:50-0:41:04:**  Yeah, this could be an alternative to this mainly consumed weed products.  
**0:41:04-0:41:15:**  Also the trees are giving very nice and rich wood that's good for outside furniture or  
**0:41:15-0:41:17:**  the fence posts.  
**0:41:17-0:41:26:**  The leaves for the animals are easy to digest and give a lot of nutrients.  
**0:41:26-0:41:31:**  Then I talked about the shade and the wind reduction.  
**0:41:31-0:41:36:**  This is making the chestnut so interesting for me.  
**0:41:36-0:41:47:**  So that it's going to be hardy when the climate is going to be drier.  
**0:41:47-0:41:52:**  The varieties of chestnuts, were you able to source?  
**0:41:52-0:41:53:**  How did you go about?  
**0:41:53-0:41:56:**  Because I guess it's quite an unusual crop for where you are.  
**0:41:56-0:42:01:**  So where did you go and get the genetics or did you find any nurseries that you were able  
**0:42:01-0:42:03:**  to work with in Germany?  
**0:42:03-0:42:04:**  I did.  
**0:42:04-0:42:16:**  There is one guy in Witzenhausen, he likes to get interesting seeds from the whole world  
**0:42:16-0:42:19:**  to produce the small trees.  
**0:42:19-0:42:26:**  And he is doing some very interesting stuff that the root trainers of the trees are very  
**0:42:26-0:42:29:**  long like up to 90 centimeters.  
**0:42:29-0:42:41:**  And so the root of the chestnuts, the first root that's going down very straight, the  
**0:42:41-0:42:46:**  taproot, I didn't have the word, thank you.  
**0:42:46-0:42:56:**  Needs to be, or doesn't need to be cut or the tree cannot be transplanted and then get  
**0:42:56-0:43:00:**  into the orchard, something like that.  
**0:43:00-0:43:14:**  So he trains this taproot to be one and that gives the tree the beneficial situations in  
**0:43:14-0:43:22:**  more dry climates to get into deeper layers of the soil very fast.  
**0:43:22-0:43:33:**  And so that's how he treats his plants and he got influenced by the British agroforestry  
**0:43:33-0:43:38:**  mentor Martin Crawford.  
**0:43:38-0:43:44:**  He wrote quite a few very recommendable books I think.  
**0:43:44-0:43:55:**  So he has different varieties that fit very well to the northern Europe part.  
**0:43:55-0:43:58:**  I think we are kind of the same height.  
**0:43:58-0:44:06:**  So you also so far mentioned some fodder species, the veneer, the walnuts.  
**0:44:06-0:44:13:**  Is there any other notable choices that you've made in terms of species?  
**0:44:13-0:44:20:**  One very interesting variety to me is the mulberry and the fodder hedge, which has a  
**0:44:20-0:44:34:**  very interesting protein that is more digestible and has more protein in total than alfalfa,  
**0:44:34-0:44:35:**  for example.  
**0:44:35-0:44:47:**  So a very interesting plant, especially in the organic farming of dairy cows, where protein  
**0:44:47-0:44:57:**  is always quite expensive and getting a tree to bring that source into the farm is, I think,  
**0:44:57-0:44:59:**  very interesting to me.  
**0:44:59-0:45:07:**  Also I'd like to farm chickens in the future in these ecosystems and they would benefit  
**0:45:07-0:45:10:**  from the fruits as well.  
**0:45:10-0:45:18:**  I think this mulberry is giving us a lot of benefits in the future.  
**0:45:18-0:45:21:**  So I have a little bit of a focus on that.  
**0:45:21-0:45:26:**  On the other hand, we have six more varieties in the fodder hedge.  
**0:45:26-0:45:39:**  It's elder, it's hazel, chestnuts also, but not the grafted chestnuts, but the ones that  
**0:45:39-0:45:43:**  are just growing out of the nut.  
**0:45:43-0:45:49:**  They are very high in minerals and I think this is something that I'd like to get rid  
**0:45:49-0:45:53:**  of as buying mineral fodder for our animals.  
**0:45:53-0:46:09:**  So one bigger aspect of the whole dairy farming thing over here is getting rid of all the  
**0:46:09-0:46:14:**  deliverers that are bringing us food.  
**0:46:14-0:46:24:**  I figured in crises or in different situations it's more beneficial to be able to produce  
**0:46:24-0:46:26:**  everything on your own.  
**0:46:26-0:46:33:**  So moving on to a bit more like the day-to-day management, my first question might be, obviously  
**0:46:33-0:46:39:**  on a farm full of cows, how did you go about protecting the young trees?  
**0:46:39-0:46:46:**  We have to address quite a few animals to take care of the trees.  
**0:46:46-0:46:58:**  At first the mice in the ground, we try to get them away with garlic and mainly the more  
**0:46:58-0:47:10:**  valuable trees we put wire around the roots for them to develop in the early years.  
**0:47:10-0:47:19:**  During the time it's getting oxygenated, everybody knows what I wanted to say.  
**0:47:19-0:47:24:**  So it's going to vanish over the years and the roots are going to be free when they are  
**0:47:24-0:47:29:**  big enough to take care of the mice.  
**0:47:29-0:47:40:**  And we put places for hawks and predators from the air to sit and relax while hunting.  
**0:47:40-0:47:48:**  And also we put nestings in the trees for them to make the nesting easier.  
**0:47:48-0:47:50:**  So this is how we address the mice.  
**0:47:50-0:47:55:**  The walnuts actually don't need to be addressed for that.  
**0:47:55-0:48:01:**  The mice don't like the roots for everybody who wants to know about that.  
**0:48:01-0:48:06:**  I think that's the thing with the mice.  
**0:48:06-0:48:07:**  Then we have rabbits.  
**0:48:07-0:48:13:**  Those are a pain in the ass, I can tell.  
**0:48:13-0:48:24:**  We put wire cylinders around every tree of the fodder hatch, about 1,300.  
**0:48:24-0:48:26:**  Quite some work.  
**0:48:26-0:48:31:**  And it was 50 centimeters high.  
**0:48:31-0:48:36:**  That's not enough for rabbits, for our rabbits.  
**0:48:36-0:48:39:**  They took a few of the trees over that.  
**0:48:39-0:48:48:**  But the metal wire around it made the tree still live after that.  
**0:48:48-0:48:52:**  So they grow again.  
**0:48:52-0:48:59:**  But yes, that's something that needs to be addressed, that's for sure, over here.  
**0:48:59-0:49:13:**  And over that metal wire we put a bigger wire with about a height of two meters.  
**0:49:13-0:49:25:**  So at the single trees we address all deers and our cattle with those.  
**0:49:25-0:49:33:**  And the spreed we are having here, the Holstein cows, they are quite big.  
**0:49:33-0:49:37:**  I think they are the biggest dairy cows existing.  
**0:49:37-0:49:47:**  So it's necessary to protect the trees up to two meters high, which is quite expansive  
**0:49:47-0:49:49:**  and exhausting.  
**0:49:49-0:49:54:**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**0:49:54-0:49:58:**  It's going to take a while until the trees are fine.  
**0:49:58-0:50:07:**  And I think the protection is one thing you've got to figure out, that's for sure.  
**0:50:07-0:50:12:**  On the silver arable land where we don't have the cows, it's way easier.  
**0:50:12-0:50:17:**  We just have these.  
**0:50:17-0:50:23:**  The protection against the deer, which is the protection against the rabbits as well.  
**0:50:23-0:50:30:**  So way less expensive and much more easy to set up.  
**0:50:30-0:50:40:**  So next to the animals we protect the trees against weeds, especially in the fodder hedge.  
**0:50:40-0:50:45:**  We have to take care of them a lot.  
**0:50:45-0:50:51:**  And what we do over there is I think quite interesting.  
**0:50:51-0:50:55:**  We started to grow vegetables.  
**0:50:55-0:51:03:**  And I think it gives the farm the beneficial situation of having more product for our customers.  
**0:51:03-0:51:12:**  And it makes the weeding process for the trees less expensive or you have a faster capital  
**0:51:12-0:51:16:**  income from the trees again.  
**0:51:16-0:51:17:**  You've got to weed them anyway.  
**0:51:17-0:51:28:**  So we started to grow garlic and celery in between the trees and the rows of the fodder  
**0:51:28-0:51:30:**  hedge.  
**0:51:30-0:51:32:**  And that worked pretty well.  
**0:51:32-0:51:40:**  We had some places where we didn't grow any vegetables and we were weeding I think two  
**0:51:40-0:51:43:**  to three times more in those places.  
**0:51:43-0:51:47:**  And they're still looking worse.  
**0:51:47-0:51:54:**  What I figured is the very best undercrop is the pumpkin.  
**0:51:54-0:52:02:**  We've had in the fodder hedge one big event of planting I think 50 plants last year and  
**0:52:02-0:52:15:**  mulching them with a material of manure and silage and lots of wood chips about 10 centimeters  
**0:52:15-0:52:16:**  thick.  
**0:52:16-0:52:19:**  And that was it for the year.  
**0:52:19-0:52:27:**  And they're still clean in the next autumn after the pumpkins being harvested and sold.  
**0:52:27-0:52:31:**  Yeah, I think.  
**0:52:31-0:52:42:**  Well yesterday we started the seeding of the next pumpkins and I said last year was 15.  
**0:52:42-0:52:44:**  It's going to be 200 this year.  
**0:52:44-0:52:48:**  Because I imagine you need something that's also like you know doesn't require too much  
**0:52:48-0:52:52:**  labor because obviously although the idea of growing vegetables in the tree line is  
**0:52:52-0:52:58:**  quite appealing in terms of piling up uses of the land and really intensifying production  
**0:52:58-0:53:04:**  like it's labor intensive enough to grow vegetables but then to do it like within a tree line  
**0:53:04-0:53:08:**  can be a bit more complicated logistically I assume.  
**0:53:08-0:53:11:**  Yeah, it is.  
**0:53:11-0:53:17:**  What I figured is really annoying is to always go through the fence to the trees.  
**0:53:17-0:53:22:**  Like I have to figure something out that we put like a gate or something but then like  
**0:53:22-0:53:28:**  we have these different paddocks where the cows are grazing and we have to let them in  
**0:53:28-0:53:34:**  to these paddocks so the fodder hedge is divided into different sections.  
**0:53:34-0:53:39:**  And I think to get access to all the different parts of the fodder hedge I would have to  
**0:53:39-0:53:43:**  put 13 different gates.  
**0:53:43-0:53:47:**  And yeah it's a pain in the ass to get there.  
**0:53:47-0:53:54:**  It's not too easy to not stamp on the trees when you weed inside.  
**0:53:54-0:54:04:**  So I think the pumpkin is the very best to get off this problem of weeding and getting  
**0:54:04-0:54:07:**  into there getting out of there and stuff like that.  
**0:54:07-0:54:15:**  What I also figured is at the moment we are feeding humans over the animals.  
**0:54:15-0:54:19:**  So we always feed our animals to get the humans fed.  
**0:54:19-0:54:23:**  And this is something I really dislike.  
**0:54:23-0:54:34:**  I think it's very more effective to grow like vegetables and get the food directly to the  
**0:54:34-0:54:37:**  gate to the humans.  
**0:54:37-0:54:48:**  And this is what the vegetable input is giving me of a good time over here to finally have  
**0:54:48-0:54:57:**  these plants that feed our customers directly.  
**0:54:57-0:55:05:**  But were you never tempted in terms of saving labor to put mats or putting something just  
**0:55:05-0:55:09:**  for the weeds and then having your separate vegetable garden?  
**0:55:09-0:55:14:**  The reason why I push this forward is because with Dimitri and Mazzy Farm we also have this  
**0:55:14-0:55:18:**  temptation at the beginning of wanting to add this on top of this on top of that.  
**0:55:18-0:55:25:**  But then it becomes very hard to make it work on a labor system especially in the current  
**0:55:25-0:55:27:**  farming model.  
**0:55:27-0:55:32:**  If you have a system where you have a lot of labor, I mean these systems are amazing.  
**0:55:32-0:55:35:**  But it's the compromise right?  
**0:55:35-0:55:39:**  Well at the moment it's working.  
**0:55:39-0:55:49:**  So me as managing all this next to the animals and the cropping and the gardening, I have  
**0:55:49-0:55:52:**  a team of mainly three other guys.  
**0:55:52-0:56:01:**  At the moment it's my dad Bert, a five-month intern Hannes from Eberswalde and Juan, an  
**0:56:01-0:56:07:**  employee from Chile who was part of this farm since April 21.  
**0:56:07-0:56:12:**  He was actually doing the most of the work in the agroforestry, mainly the weeding and  
**0:56:12-0:56:15:**  taking care of the pumpkins and the garlic and stuff like that.  
**0:56:15-0:56:23:**  So he got a lot of help from other interns that usually stayed up to two weeks or three  
**0:56:23-0:56:26:**  months in total.  
**0:56:26-0:56:30:**  I think we had 16 or 17 last year.  
**0:56:30-0:56:37:**  So this is basically our crew at the moment when it comes to the maintenance out in the  
**0:56:37-0:56:42:**  open taking care of the rest of the farm.  
**0:56:42-0:56:48:**  For planting of the pumpkins we had help from my mates from university I shared my flat  
**0:56:48-0:56:50:**  with and stuff like this.  
**0:56:50-0:56:58:**  So there's coming lots of people here and I always like to give opportunities with the  
**0:56:58-0:57:05:**  farm to get those people some interesting jobs and make them happy.  
**0:57:05-0:57:13:**  No kidding, they are happy working here, not somewhere else.  
**0:57:13-0:57:19:**  But somehow I feel like this project, this model works for the pioneers and the people  
**0:57:19-0:57:26:**  doing something exciting but somehow if we're going to change the whole of agriculture it's  
**0:57:26-0:57:32:**  going to be hard to scale if for every farm you need 20 friends.  
**0:57:32-0:57:37:**  It's going to work in certain contexts because you're probably able to sell some dream about  
**0:57:37-0:57:44:**  the agroforestry or also about to get some media attention and interns are applying but  
**0:57:44-0:57:49:**  somehow that's still quite exclusive to the first initial exciting pioneers, don't you  
**0:57:49-0:57:50:**  think?  
**0:57:50-0:57:51:**  Oh that's for sure.  
**0:57:51-0:57:59:**  I actually don't even think that it works for the whole scaling of my farm.  
**0:57:59-0:58:10:**  So at the moment we have like 6-10% of all our lands in agroforestry compared with vegetables  
**0:58:10-0:58:21:**  underneath the trees and there is no way that we would make this on all of our lands.  
**0:58:21-0:58:31:**  So not even just the management but the work effort is not doable I think.  
**0:58:31-0:58:40:**  What I think is with the growth of the trees, for example the fodder hatch, the trees need  
**0:58:40-0:58:47:**  maintenance for I think up to 3 years and then they can grow on their own without getting  
**0:58:47-0:58:55:**  weeded and we might be able to start next part of the fodder hatch and then skip to  
**0:58:55-0:59:00:**  machine work in the fodder hatch that is already older.  
**0:59:00-0:59:01:**  You know what I mean?  
**0:59:01-0:59:11:**  So we always have these very intense first 2-3 maybe 4 years of the agroforestry system  
**0:59:11-0:59:23:**  and then skip to a less labor version of the agroforestry during the time it grows older.  
**0:59:23-0:59:28:**  To understand the way you see it scaling on your farm is work by little bits.  
**0:59:28-0:59:33:**  It's like you always have a little bit that you're intensively managing and then that  
**0:59:33-0:59:37:**  kind of becomes independent a bit more and then you start a new plantation.  
**0:59:37-0:59:39:**  Is that how you visualize it through time?  
**0:59:39-0:59:41:**  A little bit.  
**0:59:41-0:59:46:**  I'm curious if it works.  
**0:59:46-0:59:51:**  We're not experienced with that so we will figure that out during the next years and  
**0:59:51-1:00:01:**  I always try to see different agroforestryers who were doing that before.  
**1:00:01-1:00:09:**  I'm not sure whether it's working out but that's why we didn't transfer the whole farm  
**1:00:09-1:00:14:**  into agroforestry at the beginning.  
**1:00:14-1:00:20:**  Learning successionally every time bits by bits.  
**1:00:20-1:00:24:**  That's interesting and you're giving yourself some options as well.  
**1:00:24-1:00:27:**  I quite liked what you were saying of the fodder hedge.  
**1:00:27-1:00:31:**  It's like yeah I don't know how I'm going to harvest it but at least I'm putting the  
**1:00:31-1:00:35:**  trees in and then we'll see in 7 or 8 years probably someone will have come up with something  
**1:00:35-1:00:36:**  interesting.  
**1:00:36-1:00:37:**  So yeah that's cool.  
**1:00:37-1:00:42:**  I can make plans for 60 years, 70 years in the future I think.  
**1:00:42-1:00:46:**  Who knows what's going to be?  
**1:00:46-1:00:55:**  Especially at these times where lots of change is happening in very short time.  
**1:00:55-1:01:02:**  The whole situation is so fast changing around us.  
**1:01:02-1:01:08:**  One thing I wanted to ask you though which I find really interesting is how did you bring  
**1:01:08-1:01:12:**  these innovative systems into the business?  
**1:01:12-1:01:17:**  And I mean of course there's uncertainty, it's highly innovative so it's a fairly high  
**1:01:17-1:01:23:**  risk for the farm to invest on something with such a long cash flow.  
**1:01:23-1:01:27:**  How did you fund these systems?  
**1:01:27-1:01:34:**  The first one we did on our own with a little bit of help of a foundation called Alfred  
**1:01:34-1:01:42:**  Tapferstiftung and the VRDstiftung for renewable energy.  
**1:01:42-1:01:49:**  So the first one gave us money for buying the trees and the other paid the bill of our  
**1:01:49-1:01:53:**  consultant that helped us planting the trees.  
**1:01:53-1:01:59:**  In 2020 we had a very good year with perfect weather for our animals and the grass to grow  
**1:01:59-1:02:04:**  so the budget for the first plantation was quite nice.  
**1:02:04-1:02:11:**  Was this schemes that existed and they usually give money to farmers or did you have to go  
**1:02:11-1:02:14:**  and seek these companies out and explain your project?  
**1:02:14-1:02:17:**  What kind of opportunity is it?  
**1:02:17-1:02:19:**  It came over the consultant.  
**1:02:19-1:02:25:**  He was like hey if you want to plant with me you should ask those guys about a cooperation.  
**1:02:25-1:02:32:**  They want to give you money for that and they want to have like more agroforestry systems  
**1:02:32-1:02:42:**  to fund and have in their system to advertise or something.  
**1:02:42-1:02:52:**  So those existed and are curious and interested about agroforestry and like to get themselves  
**1:02:52-1:02:53:**  in there.  
**1:02:53-1:02:54:**  Interesting.  
**1:02:54-1:02:59:**  Yeah it was very easy to get this done I think.  
**1:02:59-1:03:09:**  I didn't even have to write like a I don't know long texts or business plans or stuff.  
**1:03:09-1:03:12:**  Yeah no not needed.  
**1:03:12-1:03:20:**  It a little bit differently was the funding for the second agroforestry system.  
**1:03:20-1:03:28:**  So we weren't as lucky with the year.  
**1:03:28-1:03:33:**  It wasn't the best weather situations.  
**1:03:33-1:03:46:**  So the budget was lower but I and the farm knew much more people so far with this whole  
**1:03:46-1:03:49:**  agroforestry thing.  
**1:03:49-1:03:55:**  I was now raising 85,000 euros with three different institutions.  
**1:03:55-1:04:03:**  So we have the so-called active region that is supposed to distribute money from the EU  
**1:04:03-1:04:07:**  in innovative projects.  
**1:04:07-1:04:13:**  They will pay the maintenance cost in the first two years of the Walnut system.  
**1:04:13-1:04:21:**  So we can hire a person just for that and our farm which is quite relevant I think.  
**1:04:21-1:04:27:**  As I said the first two years are very intense.  
**1:04:27-1:04:30:**  The second was quite funny to read in the newspaper.  
**1:04:30-1:04:38:**  So our local parliament they wanted to distribute the money they got from the speeding tickets  
**1:04:38-1:04:41:**  into reforestation projects.  
**1:04:41-1:04:47:**  And I was like well it's not quite reforestation but let's let's hear what they think about  
**1:04:47-1:04:48:**  agroforestry.  
**1:04:48-1:04:51:**  I might be able to spread some knowledge as well.  
**1:04:51-1:04:57:**  So they were amazed by that and what I was calling them.  
**1:04:57-1:05:01:**  And yeah we got the funding from them.  
**1:05:01-1:05:09:**  And the third one was I guess I like it most.  
**1:05:09-1:05:16:**  There is a company so-called Deutschland Forsted Auf or like Germany Reforest.  
**1:05:16-1:05:23:**  They are working on connecting companies that search sustainable projects and those like  
**1:05:23-1:05:28:**  us or foresters who plant trees or do something similar.  
**1:05:28-1:05:32:**  In our case this cooperation led to a contract for sustainability.  
**1:05:32-1:05:43:**  A company called GVG Glassfather or like glass fiber company from Kiel about 10 kilometers  
**1:05:43-1:05:48:**  away it gives us money for our business of regeneration.  
**1:05:48-1:05:54:**  In return we provide percentages for their employees in our shop.  
**1:05:54-1:06:01:**  We provide the vegetables that aren't suitable for being sold and would be wasted instead.  
**1:06:01-1:06:04:**  The employees can take them for free if they want.  
**1:06:04-1:06:11:**  There is going to be a little bit of merchandise on social media for our goals and I will hold  
**1:06:11-1:06:15:**  some speeches about sustainability in our food chain.  
**1:06:15-1:06:22:**  Also we plan two hands-on days where their employees are coming for bigger work events  
**1:06:22-1:06:27:**  like planting the pumpkin or pruning or whatever is needed.  
**1:06:27-1:06:32:**  So I really focused on a contract where we can avoid greenwashing.  
**1:06:32-1:06:36:**  That's like kind of my biggest concern I was thinking about.  
**1:06:36-1:06:48:**  And yeah I find it as a very nice kind of symbiosis between the companies of us that  
**1:06:48-1:06:50:**  could be an example for more.  
**1:06:50-1:06:57:**  So we now limited the contract for one year but presumably we'll have another contract  
**1:06:57-1:06:58:**  next year.  
**1:06:58-1:07:04:**  I think what's interesting in the two later examples of funding you gave is that in both  
**1:07:04-1:07:08:**  cases it was also the opportunity for you to tell the agroforestry story and get the  
**1:07:08-1:07:09:**  message out.  
**1:07:09-1:07:12:**  And you know potentially beyond the money you received the fact that you were able to  
**1:07:12-1:07:18:**  make that case for agroforestry to your local parliament or I'm not exactly sure how you  
**1:07:18-1:07:22:**  called it and to a local company and the employees being involved on the farm.  
**1:07:22-1:07:26:**  I think potentially that's just interesting in itself you know.  
**1:07:26-1:07:29:**  Yeah actual financial opportunity.  
**1:07:29-1:07:36:**  I think like the main thing that we should focus about now is on education for sustainable  
**1:07:36-1:07:39:**  development.  
**1:07:39-1:07:41:**  That's what we are focusing on this farm.  
**1:07:41-1:07:46:**  That's for sure like with the kindergarten or the school kids coming here or we make  
**1:07:46-1:07:56:**  like field days for all the practitioners around us or yeah like these workers of these  
**1:07:56-1:08:05:**  companies that are interested in a sustainable lifestyle or a sustainable consumption.  
**1:08:05-1:08:16:**  And on this farm there is a lot of ongoing for the profits of sustainability and the  
**1:08:16-1:08:19:**  education of the...  
**1:08:19-1:08:22:**  Were there any constraints that came with this funding?  
**1:08:22-1:08:24:**  I'm thinking especially of the EU related funding.  
**1:08:24-1:08:28:**  I know that EU funding can be a bit bureaucratic.  
**1:08:28-1:08:33:**  In this case did they have any specific requirements or you know what were the conditions that  
**1:08:33-1:08:34:**  came with it?  
**1:08:34-1:08:37:**  Oh yeah they had a few.  
**1:08:37-1:08:47:**  It was a little bit of writing in the first hand but I think compared to others.  
**1:08:47-1:08:57:**  I'm not an expert in this but I figured like I spent five to six hours for that whole funding  
**1:08:57-1:09:02:**  of 50 000 euros and well I think that was worth it.  
**1:09:02-1:09:04:**  Yeah for sure.  
**1:09:04-1:09:07:**  It's interesting that they fund labor as well like I hadn't heard it yet.  
**1:09:07-1:09:15:**  I'd heard the EU schemes funding tree plantations and the trees and the protections but to actually  
**1:09:15-1:09:19:**  generate like an income for someone to take care of the agroforestry system I think is  
**1:09:19-1:09:22:**  quite interesting.  
**1:09:22-1:09:31:**  I don't know what was the problem but they were like ah we can't invest into ecological  
**1:09:31-1:09:39:**  anything so we can't buy the trees and we can't buy but the labor we could do.  
**1:09:39-1:09:47:**  So yeah whatever they thought about but that was the way we could cooperate in that situation.  
**1:09:47-1:09:53:**  Yeah maybe like taking this interview to an end I'd just like to hear your thoughts about  
**1:09:53-1:09:58:**  your plans for the future and kind of the big questions you're faced with today as you  
**1:09:58-1:10:03:**  think about your agroforestry systems.  
**1:10:03-1:10:08:**  So as I said I definitely want to scale the agroforestry on this farm.  
**1:10:08-1:10:13:**  I want to have the benefits of the trees on each paddock.  
**1:10:13-1:10:26:**  Maybe they are a little bit less labor-y but I think it's necessary to have like this impact  
**1:10:26-1:10:34:**  on climate change and get this resilience for climate change on the farm and then combined  
**1:10:34-1:10:41:**  with the hay drying system which is able to dry everything else like walnuts or chestnuts  
**1:10:41-1:10:46:**  or the different vegetables we are growing or maybe some mushrooms.  
**1:10:46-1:10:51:**  That's a future project for sure.  
**1:10:51-1:11:01:**  And yeah so this is the bigger infrastructure and I think the main path that we are already  
**1:11:01-1:11:12:**  going that's gonna stay I guess pretty much the same.  
**1:11:12-1:11:19:**  I never want to be how's it called dogmatic about something.  
**1:11:19-1:11:31:**  I always kind of try to get different perspectives of other people but I've had so many people  
**1:11:31-1:11:41:**  that told me and us that we are on the same path or on the right track towards the future  
**1:11:41-1:11:50:**  that these principles or these philosophies I think we have pretty much figured out and  
**1:11:50-1:11:57:**  I guess that's a little bit of the visionary thing.  
**1:11:57-1:12:14:**  These whole nutrient cycles and diversifying of our company branches I'd say they are getting  
**1:12:14-1:12:19:**  more complex and they are getting more into each other.  
**1:12:19-1:12:26:**  I find that beneficial so far and I think we can figure out here a little bit more about  
**1:12:26-1:12:27:**  that.  
**1:12:27-1:12:32:**  Felix thank you so much for taking the time to answer these questions and for sharing  
**1:12:32-1:12:36:**  your journey and all your knowledge.  
**1:12:36-1:12:38:**  Thank you Tien.  
**1:12:38-1:12:47:**  As I said I'm very honored to be part of your work and let's get agroforestry towards the  
**1:12:47-1:12:48:**  future.

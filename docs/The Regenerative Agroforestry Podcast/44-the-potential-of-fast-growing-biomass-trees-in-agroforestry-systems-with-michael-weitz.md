### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (2022-08-25)  

**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  our soils and ecosystems?  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  Hello and welcome on the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:50-0:00:56:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we had a fascinating conversation with Michael Weitz from Lignovis.  Michael lives in Germany where he operates a company that specializes in the plantation,  the management and consulting around fast growing biomass crops.  
**0:01:09-0:01:14:**  We're talking here about willows in short rotation coppicing, about poplars in short  and medium term coppicing systems and we had a fascinating conversation.  This is something that we've been wanting to get on the show for a while because there  
**0:01:22-0:01:28:**  is a lot of synergy between these systems and other cropping systems to make solid agroforestry  and today we finally were able to get an expert on and to discuss the nuances, the details,  the technicalities and the big picture around fast growing biomass crops.  
**0:01:39-0:01:43:**  So here we are, I really hope you enjoy it and I'm sure you're going to learn a lot as  I did today.  It's a long interview of an hour and 55 but I'm sure you're going to get through to the  
**0:01:49-0:01:54:**  end because especially the last part we start looking at some really fascinating stuff.  So enjoy and thanks a lot.  Hello Michael and welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:58-0:02:02:**  Hello Dimitri, it's a pleasure to be on your podcast.  Yes we've been trying to get you on for a little while now and to find the time that  worked for everybody and we finally made it and I'm really happy about that because we're  
**0:02:11-0:02:15:**  going to be talking about a really really important topic today, something that we haven't  discussed yet on the podcast and we think that you're going to be one of the perfect  experts that's going to be able to talk about this with us and talk about these fast growing  
**0:02:27-0:02:30:**  biomass crops in the context of agroforestry.  So before going any further maybe you could tell us a bit about your story, how you got  started in this space and just to give us a bit of context about your path until now.  
**0:02:41-0:02:44:**  Yes of course, thank you very much.  I have studied ecological agriculture at the University of Kasselin Witzenhausen where  I've had some exposure to agroforestry in the tropics but not in the context of European  
**0:02:58-0:03:06:**  agroforestry or growing trees in Europe besides maybe fruit trees.  So professionally I've been involved in planting trees since 2004 when I was in responsibility  for developing biomass supply strategies for large scale biorefinery company or like those  
**0:03:21-0:03:28:**  individual projects which had a feedstock demand of roughly a million dry tons of biomass  per year.  So as there are no places in Europe where a million tons are waiting to be utilized  
**0:03:35-0:03:43:**  we started to focus on the large biomass potential of agricultural land and yeah as Woody, I  think crops actually are like the most sustainable kind of biomass production on agricultural  land and also woody feedstock is much easier to utilize for that biorefinery.  
**0:04:00-0:04:05:**  It was high temperature gasification for synthetic biofuels.  So we concentrated on fast growing trees and in that context the first 20 hectare of willow  and also miscanthus, it was three hectare of miscanthus as well, was established in  
**0:04:17-0:04:26:**  2005 and between 2008 and 2010 we have planted another 200 hectare of mainly poplar plantations  with a small expert team at that time in different regions of Germany and Poland and yeah besides  poplars also willow, rubenia, alder, eucalyptus, even eucalyptus we found an expert in UK who  
**0:04:41-0:04:48:**  provided some frost tolerant eucalyptus plants and also native tree species such as hazelnut  and birch trees were tested.  Okay and after that you set up your company Lignovis right?  
**0:04:56-0:05:05:**  Yes, yes Lignovis was actually founded in 2011 when I bought the biomass department  from a refinery company which broke apart during the financial crisis and yeah since  then Lignovis has planted more than 25 million trees on about 4,000 hectare of agricultural  
**0:05:21-0:05:26:**  land in eight EU countries.  Most of it was planted as plantations for energy wood production but also as feedstock  for the wood processing industry.  
**0:05:38-0:05:46:**  One of the larger projects which Lignovis has executed so far was establishing poplar  plantations for IKEA furniture boards in Slovakia.  So IKEA had a large project where Lignovis was actually a contractor to establish and  
**0:05:59-0:06:05:**  manage those poplar plantations in the first year.  And yeah right now Lignovis has a team of five experts and of course additional seasonal  workers during planting material production season as well as during executing the projects.  
**0:06:24-0:06:29:**  Most of the current projects are executed by the experts themselves and maybe we have  one or two helpers but those larger projects when we were like on international projects  like for IKEA also we had a large project in 2016 actually that was the largest one  
**0:06:44-0:06:50:**  for Lignovis so far it was a Polish investment fund which had lots of agricultural land and  wanted to utilize this to convert it to tree plantations and in that single year we planted  roughly 1000 hectares of poplar plantations in Poland across the country more or less.  
**0:07:08-0:07:13:**  And in those projects of course we have many more workers from the fields.  So yeah we are operating more than 40 hectares of nursery fields with 16 poplar varieties  having a capacity of producing several million seedlings per year and being able to execute  
**0:07:32-0:07:37:**  those large projects.  And also Lignovis is developing and building different kinds of planting machines for the  specific planting concepts so it's rotation medium rotation like with different kinds  
**0:07:49-0:07:56:**  of cuttings or planting rods at different spacings.  So for that we have specific machines also for willow plantations which are planted in  a very high density we have specific planting machines that are producing the willow cuttings  
**0:08:08-0:08:19:**  right on the field so we use the willow rods actually and the cuttings themselves are produced  during the planting process with a very high speed so it's possible to plant a hectare  of willow plantations with a density of 13,000 cuttings in less than an hour if the machines  
**0:08:33-0:08:34:**  are working well.  So those machines they are really working fast and efficient and that's also the only  chance to execute those projects efficient enough to be economically viable for our clients  
**0:08:50-0:08:53:**  but also for Lignovis ourselves of course.  Fantastic.  I mean and I think this is really interesting and I'm sure we're gonna you're bringing up  
**0:08:59-0:09:04:**  a lot of different details here that we need to explore and that I think I'm bringing at  least for me a lot of curiosity but maybe you can start by explaining to us you know  what are these fast growing biomass trees that we're talking about why they're so exciting  
**0:09:15-0:09:19:**  why they're so interesting maybe just giving us a bit of an overview of what it is that  we're going to be talking about in the next hour or so.  Usually if we talk about fast growing biomass or like fast growing trees in agriculture  
**0:09:28-0:09:35:**  in general then it's trees that are pioneer tree species that are able to coppice from  the stumps usually.  So actually when we started 15 years ago it was mainly short rotation like in Sweden there  
**0:09:47-0:09:54:**  was a concept developed for willow for this with planting machines with the harvesting  machines there was corporations with different companies and lots of money I guess was poured  into it and they had roughly 20,000 hectares of willow plantations in Sweden at that time  
**0:10:10-0:10:19:**  and from there I think it spread somehow over Europe and part of those concepts were also  used for poplar plantations and then at least we in Germany we realized that poplar actually  is more suitable for our conditions in Germany.  
**0:10:31-0:10:38:**  We have better drought tolerance and also we have more flexibility also in utilizing  those poplar tree species also in the medium rotation like willow is usually growing more  like a shrub and needs to be harvested every three or four years and then it regrows vigorously  
**0:10:53-0:11:00:**  but it's more moisture than poplar.  Specifically during the past I would say five years in Germany we didn't plant much willow  anymore I still believe that willow is an interesting biomass crop for certain conditions  
**0:11:15-0:11:23:**  but we really realized that conditions are changing so far that we are quite happy that  with the different poplar species we have available also with drought tolerant varieties  there is still a good option like with expanding like trees on agriculture specifically also  
**0:11:39-0:11:48:**  on marginal sites where annual cropping is more and more difficult and besides willow  and poplar of course there are other options but like one of the most promising tree species  which is which is rabinia like that's the nitrogen fixing like kind of trees it was  
**0:12:05-0:12:11:**  not allowed anymore it was restricted by law to be planted in Germany because it's not  a native tree and yeah people or environmental legislation is very often more how to frame  that it's more strict in terms of agriculture than maybe in terms of forestry because you  
**0:12:34-0:12:40:**  still allow to plant it on forests but not on agricultural land not on agroforestry and  but also not on biomass plantations so actually poplar is more or less the only fast growing  tree species which is really growing forest and giving cash flow after a few years already  
**0:12:57-0:13:00:**  to farmers which is left.  And so you mentioned that there is a short cycle a medium cycle and I expect also a long  cycle could you just explain to us what's the difference between the three?  
**0:13:09-0:13:16:**  Short cycle means usually you plant at a high density of something between 8,000 and 10,000  for poplar and 13,000 for willow and then you go there with a field shipper and directly  chip those trees every three or four years and those wood chips they can be used of course  
**0:13:32-0:13:42:**  for energy usually they go to larger heating stations or even power plants and are burnt  and of course they can also be used for like particle board production or MDF production  something like that the medium rotation it's planted at the wider density we recommend  
**0:13:58-0:14:09:**  that something between 1,500 and 3,000 trees per hectare and those trees we recommend an  average of eight years to be harvested the first times under very good conditions it  can be even harvested after five or six years with groundwater access but on very marginal  
**0:14:22-0:14:35:**  sites it can also be 10 years so and the long rotation that is for veneer log production  that's actually traditional poplar growing in France and Belgium and Spain in Hungary  in Italy that's the traditional poplar plantations used for higher value logs unfortunately we  
**0:14:52-0:15:00:**  don't have that kind of industries that would require those quality in Germany so we are  more concentrating on the short and medium cycle in Germany and also on the other projects  we are doing because their lignovus is actually adding some efficiency I think to the process  
**0:15:14-0:15:22:**  that is not established but like those long rotation is already established in those regions  or in those countries where there is an industry.  That's very interesting I find it a bit confusing that in Germany there isn't this industry  
**0:15:30-0:15:37:**  for the long term timber like high value log because from poplar because when you look  at what's happening currently in Spain and in France the prices of this of these high  value timber plantations of poplar are going through the roof I mean now in Spain for example  
**0:15:48-0:15:53:**  in Castile Leon which is the main product region producing these things in Spain maybe  in southern Europe or in Europe I'm not sure about this but they're selling now a cubic  meter for between 150 to 200 when it's of a very high quality and it means that I've  
**0:16:05-0:16:11:**  just been modeling it recently and it means that the income is quite fantastic because  it's obviously not a lot of work but a really and you've got to make sure that you're on  a good site of course and that your the the log does become high quality very straight  
**0:16:20-0:16:25:**  and well pruned and it does require a certain it's kind of like intensive forestry management  but still compared to you know compared to managing a tree crop for fruit or whatever  it's very low intensity and it produces a really high return we're looking at about  
**0:16:34-0:16:38:**  16% IRR which is really high.  So I wonder why in Germany where these trees grow really well I would be I'm a bit surprised  that they haven't that an industry hasn't developed around that.  
**0:16:46-0:16:54:**  Yeah it's actually it's the opposite like if you talk to forestry people and also to  the wood consuming industry actually poplar is rather considered to be a weed it's not  a it's not a tree like especially like people from forestry they don't like poplar they  
**0:17:10-0:17:22:**  try to if they reestablish areas they even take it out like if it flies in naturally  they cannot cope with it at the moment just because like it's too many areas that are  deforested because of the drought and the beetle that killed specifically spruce trees  
**0:17:34-0:17:41:**  and in Germany are no very very wide range so I think like the industry will re-adapt  somehow to also utilize like poplar wood but rather as a low quality it is already used  as a low quality I'm not saying it's not done yet but it's not a focus it's just a byproduct  
**0:17:56-0:18:05:**  at the moment and I don't know a single plantation in Germany or a single project plantation  where poplar trees are pruned so that's just not established so I think you really need  to cross the border at least to Netherlands and to Belgium and France to see that happen  
**0:18:19-0:18:27:**  yeah it's just not existing we have a million we have a million ton a million hectare sorry  one hundred thousand hectares of poplar is like on forest area but nobody is really using  it and nobody is managing those areas professionally.  
**0:18:41-0:18:45:**  Very interesting it could be an opportunity for the future but if the industry doesn't  develop itself farmers and landowners are not going to start producing this because  if there isn't a behind a whole processing industry set up to be able to bring value  
**0:18:55-0:18:59:**  to these poplars because what's usually done with these high value poplars in Spain is  that they're cut into very thin boards they just basically cut around the log and then  they create plywood with it and then they sell the plywood for quite a lot.  
**0:19:13-0:19:18:**  I think it's something like a hen egg problem like the industry will not develop if there's  not sufficient supply and farmers or plantation operators would say why should I produce and  put all the labor in it in that high quality if there's no offtake but I think like with  
**0:19:37-0:19:43:**  certain agroforestry concepts like that that can be solved specifically if there's additional  value created for improving the microclimate on farmland because I think specifically this  long rotation planted at a relatively wide spacing can be very attractive to be included  
**0:20:02-0:20:11:**  into agroforestry concepts but at the moment we think maybe that's also an organic process  we plant it as a medium rotation and then we have after several years like six to eight  years we have the option to either thin it and start pruning maybe we will not have specifically  
**0:20:28-0:20:35:**  the same quality but maybe it's good enough even for veneer production maybe the core  that is left with those branch knots in it this will be thicker but maybe that's still  acceptable and then the farmer can decide if it's either like veneer logs or at least  
**0:20:53-0:20:59:**  sawlocks that are produced with the remaining that are only thinned and the other option  is just to clear cut it and wait for the regrow and then again sell it to either energy or  to the wood processing industry like for particle board production and or OSB production and  
**0:21:14-0:21:23:**  I think like those products the demand will increase drastically specifically if we consider  that we need to substitute so many products which are currently produced with a very very  big CO2 footprint and yeah there will not be enough wood available to substitute all  
**0:21:40-0:21:45:**  of it just coming from existing forests so I think it's a quite attractive business case  in the future you need to take some risk at the beginning because those value is not created  at the moment but I think in a time frame of five to ten years those markets will change  
**0:21:58-0:22:04:**  and improve for being more economically attractive.  And you I mean there's lots of things that are being brought up and we'll get into them  little by little but the first thing that comes to mind is when we had talked before  
**0:22:14-0:22:17:**  we had a really interesting conversation that we didn't record for about an hour on the  phone you had mentioned the idea of flexibility and so what you're saying now for example  is that we could be planting poplars and well maybe instead of instead of me saying this  
**0:22:29-0:22:33:**  let me could you explain to us a bit what you meant by you know we can have flexibility  with the poplar let's zoom into the popular and focus on this at the moment to have that  a bit as our case study for this conversation and to help us be a bit more focused and guided  
**0:22:43-0:22:46:**  and so you were saying like we can plan the poplars and then we can do many different  things with it depending on the management and that was the idea of flexibility so could  you just explain to us a bit more what that means how that works and why it's an interesting  
**0:22:54-0:22:59:**  you know why it's interesting for a farmer or a landowner.  Once you start with a spacing planted for medium rotation then you have many options  if you plant it for short rotation like with a density of eight to ten thousand like you  
**0:23:10-0:23:17:**  are set to the direct chipping and that's very efficient at slow harvesting costs and  it's easy to establish that's a concept that's done since 20 years in Germany and on several  thousand hectares so there's not much improvement and not much flexibility with that so concentrating  
**0:23:33-0:23:41:**  on the medium rotation spacing and planting layout something 1000 to 3000 trees per hectare  of tree area if it's done as a plantation or as a agroforestry system it actually doesn't  much matter you know it can be the same concept behind then you either use it just to produce  
**0:23:58-0:24:07:**  maximum amount of cash flow you clear cut it after a certain time when you think well  that's the stumps are at the diameter at the stump will be something like 25 centimeters  then you go there with forestry equipment like with fellow bundler equipment and harvesters  
**0:24:23-0:24:30:**  as quick and as efficient as possible then they will completely regrow you sell it either  as small logs or as or you chip it on site and sell it as wood chips I think that is  something that would be used to create a cash flow model and a business case for the moment  
**0:24:44-0:24:56:**  because there we have the numbers available there we can yeah even in some cases sign  contracts with off takers specifically like with energy markets and those actors like  heat and power stations they sometimes are already or since many years they're interested  
**0:25:12-0:25:21:**  but they are willing to sign long term agreements with farmers often they even finance the establishment  of those those short rotation plantations to have those wood chips available in the  area at a certain quality at a certain time and on their decision when it's harvested  
**0:25:36-0:25:44:**  also but I think for the farmers it's very interested also specifically if you look at  agroforestry systems that they can optimize the ecological benefits and the microclimate  benefits they get from the tree at least so then they might decide or they might test  
**0:26:00-0:26:10:**  themselves well on that field I will clear cut on another field I will selectively take  out maybe two thirds of trees and just do a thinning like in the forest or in a pine  plantation in the US for example it's done as well you thin it down to a certain amount  
**0:26:26-0:26:32:**  of trees which will be grown to produce solocs or maybe even veneer logs I think it will  be rather solocs in Germany I think there will be markets developing much quicker for  solocs than for veneer logs but maybe based on that tradition which will be hopefully  
**0:26:45-0:26:53:**  build up through the next 10 years maybe also veneer log production will come to those countries  it's not only Germany but to other countries as well where it's not available so far.  So it would be kind of in practice it would be like you have 20 lines of poplars and you  
**0:27:05-0:27:10:**  would cut 9 of them leave one and then they cut the next line leave one and then you would  something like this you mean in order to leave the tell me.  And but no what what I'm talking about is within those poplar rows you take maybe three  
**0:27:22-0:27:31:**  out and leave one so it always depends maybe you take like two thirds out and leave one  third growing that's what's actually happening in forestry you know and we just take that  concept of selective thinning we don't decide from the beginning which one will be left  
**0:27:43-0:27:50:**  you know like when we plant it maybe that can also be a concept if you say for example  with one farmer we have planted it in a way that he said well okay every fifth one I will  plant a longer rot which is which I will prune he will he's just eager to test it but I think  
**0:28:04-0:28:10:**  that will usually not be the concept usually it will be just planted and when it's thinned  then the the operator of the harvesting phalabanture machine will just decide which one is straight  and nice and growing better than the others and that one will not be harvested and the  
**0:28:26-0:28:31:**  others other one will will be harvested of course they will regrow from the stumps again  but like the shade of the remaining trees and also the the more competition like from  having the photosynthesis from from the big tree will help those remaining trees to be  
**0:28:46-0:28:53:**  more competitive also for water and nutrients and and so just to clarify this is interesting  for agroforestry because you are harvesting you're having a medium cycle harvest so you're  cash flowing early whilst also maintaining trees in place they keep providing windbreak  
**0:29:06-0:29:13:**  action microclimate action impact they keep impacting the landscape biodiversity etc and  they are harvested at a medium cycle that's a long-term cycle sorry so you're leaving  a medium term cycle you're having a medium term and a long-term harvest and this is why  
**0:29:24-0:29:29:**  right this is why you're saying that this is interesting for agroforestry specifically  yes but I think it doesn't need to be that way I mean it's we have to be careful like  for farmers generally it's it's such a big decision to plant trees to start planting  
**0:29:42-0:29:52:**  trees that even like those three four-year harvesting cycles are something they they  really have to push themselves to do it and if you now say well we have a concept now  with a medium harvest and then the rest will be like growing for 25 years or something  
**0:30:04-0:30:13:**  until you can sell solox that's already like a time horizon a farmer usually is not placing  business models on so that would need to be I think not be on the on the responsibility  of the farmer but maybe on a specialized investor company like doing those kind of agroforestry  
**0:30:27-0:30:33:**  projects and concepts in cooperation with the farmer and involving the farmer also financially  but actually having like all the specific work that needs to be done and decisions that  be taken which variety is planted on which side and yeah maybe it's the wrong one maybe  
**0:30:46-0:30:52:**  we know like in 15 years that another varieties would have given 10 percent higher yields  whatever but I think all of that if even with the popular which is probably the simple highest  simplicity like in planting trees in agriculture even that is quite complex and farmers are  
**0:31:07-0:31:14:**  avoiding that kind of risks and long-term decisions so for many farmers it's if there  is like a biomass even power plant in the area and demanding wood chips and offering  a cooperation with the farmer then it's just easiest to to to start a cooperation and say  
**0:31:29-0:31:41:**  okay here like plant some 10 or 20 meter wide tree alleys on the field and you you are dividing  more or less a hundred hectares into like five or ten hectare blocks of annual cropping  and in between you have like one or two hectares of trees and that can be harvest very efficiently  
**0:31:56-0:32:01:**  and it has a very very big effect already on the microclimate so those effects even  on from like three year old poplar trees like it's astonishing how like the for example  the wind erosion is reduced and how the microclimate is improved so like there's for example one  
**0:32:17-0:32:26:**  reference agroforestry system which was planted by the University of Khatpos close to the  Polish border in Brandenburg where they have investigated also how the interaction will  be to to the annual crops already and they they measured like a significant reduction  
**0:32:43-0:32:51:**  of wind erosion actually they have no extreme winds anymore on that field which is completely  changed from before and also they have measured a small increase in the in the production  of the annual crop and besides that of course if you plant trees in an alley like you have  
**0:33:05-0:33:13:**  that the effect on the sides like where you have more photosynthesis and more more available  like better growing conditions and you have an average you have a higher much higher growth  rate per hectare of tree area and so all together like this is the term of land equivalent ratio  
**0:33:34-0:33:41:**  like which in France you're probably aware of like they they communicate something like  between 120% to 160% of total productivity on on the same hectare and most of it relates  to the the productivity of the trees which is increased and some some of it also to the  
**0:33:59-0:34:07:**  productivity of the annual crops but yeah it's maybe if you have some 10% of tree area  maybe like you can expect that you have more or less the same yield on the 90% of the annual  crop area that you had before with the 100% okay very interesting and this and this system  
**0:34:22-0:34:29:**  was a short rotation or a medium rotation system rotation okay and so my leading question  is if you're going to be maximizing biomass production as opposed to having a bit more  flexibility through you know through the medium rotation as you suggested if you were optimizing  
**0:34:39-0:34:44:**  for biomass production is it best to go for short rotation or do you get the same biomass  production in a medium rotation only that it takes there's a larger let's say larger  frequency of harvest so you harvest less often yeah probably it might change from side to  
**0:34:59-0:35:05:**  side but i would say in general it's the same like the poplar if you do it as as a poplar  like for willow you definitely need to do it as short rotation but with poplar in the  first two years or three years of course the dense plantation will have a much higher increment  
**0:35:19-0:35:30:**  but later on like the poplar very much likes to grow longer than three years so it's the  growth rate will accelerate and so i think the eight year rotation is something that  is that is very suitable actually for the poplar tree but you have to consider that  
**0:35:43-0:35:48:**  the harvesting costs will be higher if you grow it in the medium rotation just because  you cannot directly chip it anymore so you need to be there like with different kind  of equipment and yeah then then it depends of course you have also a higher wood quality  
**0:35:59-0:36:06:**  you have less bark and less fines let's find like those those fine branches and depends  where it's going at the end it depends where you're going to be selling it of your objectives  that's very interesting you know one of the things i really wanted to get into is kind  
**0:36:16-0:36:21:**  of the management requirements of these systems again we're taking into account we are you  know a lot of the people listening to these podcasts have farms and they want to diversify  with trees they want to do agroforestry so taking into account the context of a farmer  
**0:36:30-0:36:38:**  that is or or a company a landowner that does not specialize in wood production i'm you  know it's concerning often that this that this farmer that's specialized in grain production  then needs to learn and to manage a tree crop which requires new new new knowledge it requires  
**0:36:51-0:36:58:**  it can require new machinery this is often the case with more higher intensity of or  higher sensitivity crops like for example planting walnuts in an alley cropping and  you know this is of course we're talking about a completely different type of crop now it's  
**0:37:07-0:37:12:**  tree crops but could you introduce us to what are the management complexities you know and  how easy it is for a farmer to take on a tree crop project  actually if you compare to other types of agroforestry it's extremely simple if you  
**0:37:28-0:37:36:**  compare it to annual crops it's difficult for the farmer and the farmer usually doesn't  give the priority to those trees because he he doesn't know in the beginning how important  which kind of management application will be so usually the trees are starting to grow  
**0:37:54-0:38:00:**  then they are green and then there is some weeds and there's so much other stuff to do  and then the weeds are too big and the trees are already suffering and even if you try  to eliminate the weeds at that moment you already put the trees under stress and even  
**0:38:14-0:38:23:**  if it's poplars they will suffer and the the growth rate will be much smaller also like  in the in the months after so it's all about letting those trees growing without competition  in the first growing season like we we i don't know how many times i've repeated myself and  
**0:38:41-0:38:53:**  usually in the first year it's not it's not like achieved on on those on those projects  if the farmers themselves are managing them but in the second year they already know how  important it is because they realized themselves and they also see that it might be the difference  
**0:39:07-0:39:16:**  between like three year like three meters growth from the small cutting for example  or like three meters shoot from a planted rot and to 50 centimeters so 50 centimeter  like the usually the poplars well they they will not completely die if they are not managed  
**0:39:32-0:39:37:**  of course under drought conditions they will but if it's a normal year but they will only  develop something like 50 centimeter long shoots and the leaves will be yellow and small  and it's not as it could be and the farmers is realizing how much difference that is and  
**0:39:49-0:39:57:**  he also knows that from his annual crops for example silage like corn like it's it's totally  the same if you have too many weeds on a field and there's too much competition then your  crop will give maybe 30 percent of the productivity then a well-managed crop and with the popular  
**0:40:12-0:40:19:**  it's the same but the complexity itself is really low it's only keep it free of weeds  and then actually it's that that's it there's no pests and diseases for example that need  to be managed attentively no thinning removal of trees i mean you know no i'm thinking horticultural  
**0:40:35-0:40:40:**  nearly trying to compare it with with other types of production systems like walnuts etc  so if you if you planned if you planned cuttings there's nothing to do but keep it free of  competition you can do it with herbicides you can do it totally manual or mechanically  
**0:40:55-0:41:00:**  but of course that's that's not so easy like you need to have special equipment you have  either adapt the tools you have on the farm to achieve that or you have to cooperate for  example also ligno is operating lots of machines for plantation management and sometimes we  
**0:41:12-0:41:18:**  rent it out to farmers and sometimes we also do the management in larger projects as a  contract and yeah that's that's very very important and if you planned larger rods like  usually if we planned the like the smaller the agroforestry systems tree area is the  
**0:41:36-0:41:45:**  rather we would recommend planting not cuttings but at least medium-sized rods that are planted  60 centimeters deep and then maybe 30 centimeters are left like out of the soil or plant one  meter 50 to one meter 80 long rods which are also planted 60 centimeters deep and then  
**0:42:03-0:42:14:**  like something like one meter is like out of the soil and like that's that kind of rods  are more competitive like in terms of weeds but also if there's like browsing by deer  you know if if it's only a small cutting like with 20 30 centimeters and the the deers are  
**0:42:30-0:42:35:**  eating the fresh shoots there's not much energy left in the cutting it will regrow but it  will be really small and then the weeds are much faster and you have a catastrophic result  on the plantation if you have a big field you know like 10 hectares or five hectares  
**0:42:47-0:42:54:**  with a planting density of 10 000 then it's not so many deers that can eat all of it you  know and so it will be a little bit here and a little bit there but the total plantation  will be okay but if you only have an agroforestry system with like one hectare of tree area  
**0:43:06-0:43:12:**  and you you want to do the medium rotation actually you need to plant those rods if you  don't put a fence around it that's the other option you have but usually we try to avoid  that because it's much more affordable to plant those rods and maybe talk to the hunter  
**0:43:22-0:43:29:**  you have on site sometimes farmers are hunting themselves but often it's other people and  convince them to to take a look at it like in the first six weeks or something after  planting it's most important or when they start to grow very interesting you brought  
**0:43:39-0:43:47:**  up something that i really wanted to get into and that we we often see having a big impact  on the ultimate economic viability of the project it's scale you know and and so of  course as you mentioned that there's technicalities around you know differences in the way that  
**0:43:59-0:44:04:**  we're going to be implementing and managing between a small scale and a large scale project  but there's a question before that which is you know what is the minimum scale for this  to be economically viable taking into account that we're selling let's say a medium density  
**0:44:13-0:44:18:**  popular plant yeah sorry a medium cycle then medium cycle popular plantation that we're  going to be selling for energy or for the production of light constructed woods not  woods but materials woody materials i don't know what the name of those are i've forgotten  
**0:44:29-0:44:37:**  now the one that ikea was using in your project for example anyways you know what is there  a minimum size for it to be valuable for us to be able to bring in a person to harvest  under certain size maybe the harvester will say no i'm not going to come just for five  
**0:44:47-0:44:52:**  hectares with my machine for example so you know what's the situation on on scale often  in agroforestry systems of course the scale is much smaller than than than a full plantation  so it's it's a big topic in agroforestry this one actually that's one of the reasons why  
**0:45:02-0:45:09:**  we recommend medium rotation for those agroforestry systems because usually it's not proper profitability  of wood production that is in the focus but it's rather those microclimate benefits and  also animal-based welfare is actually the main reason for most of the agroforestry projects  
**0:45:23-0:45:30:**  we have planted throughout the past few years on free-range chicken areas so like chicken  are forest birds and those farmers they just want to have a yeah a good yeah or at least  a decent environment for the chicken where they which is similar to a natural habitat  
**0:45:48-0:45:57:**  and so the profitability of the wood production itself it's absolutely not in the focus so  they some some farmers even say well i don't know how will it be harvested and okay i have  to organize that but it's rather a burden sometimes i'm specifically during the past  
**0:46:13-0:46:22:**  years where we had very low wood prices in germany because of all the pine beetle killed  trees and the drought problem so there was excess wood from the forests on the market  and like farmers didn't feel like planting trees for for producing wood so that that  
**0:46:36-0:46:41:**  was the recent years it completely changed now we have attractive prices for wood chips  for energy use and like if you consider the high price of natural gas at the moment like  it's per energy unit like wood chips can be produced at a tenth of the current gross market  
**0:46:55-0:47:00:**  price of natural gas in germany or in europe wow very interesting that's that's uh that  i think that will be a huge market in the future but it also takes a little bit time  to develop because yeah i mean you cannot just um like uh sell so much amounts of wood  
**0:47:14-0:47:18:**  right away you have to plant the trees before and at least you have to wait like three four  years until the first harvest that's a minimum for the medium rotation it's longer so like  those those um energy projects they are also hesitant to to start into those complex market  
**0:47:33-0:47:38:**  in cooperating with farmers i think that will take some time to develop when the dust has  settled and people realizing it's not only like co2 it's not only climate but it's also  um security of supply that is very important and that's an another argument which will  
**0:47:52-0:48:01:**  be maybe even more relevant than co2 for creating those business models very interesting but  everything is just right now pointing in the direction that it will be a good um a good  business in planting trees and selling wood in the in the near or mid-term future but  
**0:48:15-0:48:21:**  sorry i think i lost your question no no but you you brought up a very interesting topic  uh yeah we diverted a bit but it was it was fascinating to understand that bigger economic  context so so in it was it was profitability and the minimum size exactly for i think for  
**0:48:33-0:48:39:**  short rotation um which is interesting for alley cropping cropping systems like for silver  arable system where you combine um trees with annual like crops on on cropland so um i think  the minimum size should be something like five hectares of tree area um when like the  
**0:48:56-0:49:03:**  when the offtaker and also some other short rotation plantations are not too far away  if you are in the middle of whatever no other farmer is growing short rotation plantations  there and there is not like harvesting contractors available then it might be even bigger so  
**0:49:21-0:49:28:**  but like i'm talking now about like the northeastern part of germany like that's where we are mostly  active but also northwestern part of germany like there are some contractors um like available  so um but below five hectares of tree area it's difficult for the short rotation plantations  
**0:49:45-0:49:53:**  because you have to order a specific field chipper with a specific like cutting head  and also usually the chipper in the future is modified a little bit so yeah that's quite  expensive to to have it um coming to your farm and then it just started and then it's  
**0:50:09-0:50:14:**  already finished again so it really depends on the wood price if you have an attractive  wood price then it's okay but um if the wood price is rather low then it's not profitable  to do that below a certain tree area so you take the minimum is five but 50 is better  
**0:50:30-0:50:35:**  in a way yeah but that's really for the short rotation and well sometimes we have very small  farms that say well we don't want to to to sell it for energy and we don't want to ship  it like with a field chipper we do that ourselves and we use it as remyalch wood to improve  
**0:50:47-0:50:54:**  our soul so you can do that on half an hectare and they have i don't know a few intern uh  ships like um looking for work and then you can harvest it manually with a chainsaw and  then you have a small chipper and you chip it and then you use it on your composter just  
**0:51:04-0:51:11:**  spread it on your soil and um that's very much depending um actually what is what is  your focus but if you're like let's say you have 300 hectare farm and you're looking into  agroforestry and say well it would be good to improve the microclimate so what is the  
**0:51:22-0:51:29:**  easiest thing to do okay i will start with um like two hectares of tree lines and do  that as short rotation and i would say no that you should do that as medium rotation  because um the harvesting costs might be higher per ton in a scaled efficient system but having  
**0:51:41-0:51:46:**  those small scale you always find something like you know with a with a shear like on  an excavator with a shear something like that is that is available in in your area that  is harvesting those those trees and then maybe the harvesting costs would not be like harvesting  
**0:51:59-0:52:06:**  means um cutting for rooting chipping or cutting and piling them up on the field and go with  the chipper on the field and ship it there but probably for the medium rotation um it  would be somewhere around 70 euros per ton of dry matter like those kind of until you  
**0:52:16-0:52:23:**  have the chipped and maybe transported um to to to your storage or something not to  the client but um like where you can store it the wood chips um something maybe like  70 euros and with the um with the direct chipping with the field chipper um you have harvesting  
**0:52:36-0:52:44:**  cost maybe something like 40 euros per ton of dry matter so so but but if you apply the  the field chipper on only two actors and you have a thousand or two thousand euros um you  have to pay to for for the contractor to even arrive then um your economics would look much  
**0:53:02-0:53:10:**  more unfavorable so you run into to to to totally other um economics so you're you're  you're favoring the medium cycle mostly because of the access to harvesting well let's say  that the the yeah the access or the wider range of harvesting machinery possible to  
**0:53:22-0:53:27:**  use that's your main if you're if we're talking about a smaller scale alley cropping system  you're favoring medium cycle as compared to short cycle mainly for that reason or are  there other reasons as well because you've brought it up quite a few times this and i  
**0:53:35-0:53:40:**  wanted to inquire a bit more uh you know what is the you know to clarify a bit the arguments  of for and against um medium cycle vs short cycle in an alley cropping context of course  there are more arguments you have a better quality of work you have more options what  
**0:53:52-0:54:01:**  we discussed before you can you can selectively take our trees and you have more options to  grow zorlocks if you want and probably in the future you can also sell into other markets  where it's not wood chips but it's like small logs where they produce for example osp boards  
**0:54:14-0:54:21:**  and probably pay your higher price per per ton for that and the other thing of course  is that if you have a longer rotation cycle you have more ecological benefits like improving  the microclimate and reducing erosion for example with a lower tree area involved so  
**0:54:36-0:54:43:**  if you're a farmer usually if it's on a on a good field or like decent soil you're you're  a little bit worrying like giving away too much too much of the field to the trees and  maybe only planting a double row or even a single row and um like if you do that with  
**0:55:00-0:55:07:**  that short rotation like you need a big farm actually to to to get something like 10 hectare  tree area and the next thing of course is also like like if it's only a single row then  like a few deer will just eat it completely and so you actually cannot plant a single  
**0:55:19-0:55:25:**  row with cuttings for short rotation if you plant like a short rotation plantation with  those rods then it's too expensive of course you can do that we've done that before um  but um it doesn't make sense actually so it's because the investment will be too high and  
**0:55:36-0:55:43:**  then it's not the harvesting costs only that is um resulting in in a business case but  of course also the establishment cost like the harvesting cost is most important because  it's on every turn it's more less the same and the planting cost it's only once in the  
**0:55:53-0:56:00:**  beginning and then you can harvest several times very interesting that makes a lot of  sense it makes a lot of sense we're bringing together a bit everything that we said uh  earlier on and and putting it uh into into one bag right now that's that's great for  
**0:56:11-0:56:16:**  me there's the next thing that you something else that you had brought up um earlier on  is concerning the marginal land vs productive land and again you're talking about it now  and you said that we've got you know on marginal sites we can have a medium rotation that can  
**0:56:25-0:56:30:**  go up to 10 years as compared to if you've got access to groundwater we'd be around five  to six years um and so my question is is it still worth planting in germany of course  because this is very you know marginal in in portugal it means a different thing than  
**0:56:41-0:56:47:**  marginal in germany probably um relating to popular productivity so you know in germany  in your context is it still worth planting on marginal land popular trees taking into  account that you know they're gonna need a certain amount of water it's likely to be  
**0:56:59-0:57:04:**  more than an annual crop for example like winter wheat you know due to the fact that  we've got you know different cycles ones in the winter the others in is needing water  in the summer so you know are people actually planting and viably um in marginal sites and  
**0:57:15-0:57:19:**  what's required for it to work well on a marginal site is it only for short rotation is it only  for a certain amount of scale where do we where do we stand there yeah that's a complex  question but i mean it always depends what what are your alternatives on on that um kind  
**0:57:34-0:57:40:**  of marginal land very often the alternative is to do nothing you know like to set it aside  and only get the eu um money and do nothing because you're not sure if you're like preparing  the soul if you're sewing if you're fertilizing and and putting the putting the chemicals  
**0:57:55-0:58:02:**  or whatever on it um if you harvest like anything or if you get at least your money back and  like right now we have certainly some farmers that realizing on that kind of sites on that  kind of soils it's um they rather treat it like for they try to go maybe in an environmental  
**0:58:17-0:58:25:**  program to to to get some more money from the government but they cannot continue to  use it um with the annual crops in a productive way and of course on those sites trees like  poplar trees will not grow as fast as um on other sites but if you consider that like  
**0:58:44-0:58:49:**  that land is more or less available for free because the farmer i mean those eu premium  payments they will receive anyway and then you can decide well does it does it cover  the planting and the harvesting costs and if there's some something left usually and  
**0:59:03-0:59:10:**  as it's a perennial crop usually it will not be totally destroyed it will not be like it  will not just die in the drought but it will drop at least and stop accumulating biomass  but um in the next year it will start growing again and maybe your harvesting cycle will  
**0:59:21-0:59:27:**  not be four years or three years what you expected maybe it will be five or six years  um it's it's very hard to to say that from the beginning but i was astonished like like  in 2018 we had an extremely dry year at least in germany i think also in other european  
**0:59:42-0:59:51:**  countries and i was very much worried um because of like one of our largest projects was latin  fall like in eastern part of germany like around berlin the state of brandenburg and  in western poland they have planted some 2000 hectares to supply a heat and power station  
**1:00:05-1:00:13:**  in berlin with 50 percent of short rotation wood chips and i was very worried um like  if in that year because it was not raining at all more or less and it was extremely odd  that some of the plantations at least will just die because it was planted on marginal  
**1:00:25-1:00:34:**  sites usually they had contracts with farmers um and if you go to those farms and you ask  them for providing some land they will not give you average land but they will yeah say  well um of course they try to get as much money as possible um but they will try to  
**1:00:50-1:00:56:**  get rid of the very marginal sites where they had problems before with the annual crop annual  crops and i think that's okay of course that's that what makes sense and if those poplars  are growing on those sides then like they are they're really suitable for marginal sites  
**1:01:07-1:01:16:**  and like the result when i asked them how did they develop like in the the year 2018  it was well of course we had um we had not much increment like the yield or the growth  was much lower than in an average year but actually we had no sites which completely  
**1:01:28-1:01:36:**  had died so and that i think this year it will be about the same of course um the profitability  will suffer um but given that also the annual crops um having big problems under those conditions  and uncertainties then i think um the perennial trees in a short rotation they are actually  
**1:01:56-1:02:01:**  the best option you still have to keep those sites productive at a low productivity but  at least they're capturing co2 they're producing a raw material which is either be used as  feedstock for energy or as feedstock for the wood processing industry and that's actually  
**1:02:18-1:02:26:**  what we need actually we need to keep those areas productive and um at the same time also  improve the the ecological benefits from those sites and i think um even if it's poplar trees  even if they are clones even if they're genetically the same like because um it's clones you know  
**1:02:40-1:02:50:**  you you produce it um like not through seeds but through cuttings from the mother um the  tree more or less like uh so they are genetically identical like they are giving much more diversity  even in a plantation compared to traditional farming and on those marginal sites it's it's  
**1:03:06-1:03:11:**  working so far i'm really happy to say that many people thinking popular as well that's  for wet sites and they will not grow on dry sites but we are having them on the driest  sites and marginal most marginal sites in germany and they are performing decently they  
**1:03:23-1:03:31:**  are not delivering delivering the yield um which which is possible on on medium soil  qualities but at least they are not dying and producing some biomass that's very very  interesting and you know it seems like rubinia if you're allowed to plant it would perform  
**1:03:41-1:03:46:**  even better in these dry sites right because rubinia has a higher capacity to a high drought  tolerant capacity is that am i correct in saying this i i would assume that it's the  case and in the very extreme conditions like we had in 2018 and like this year um we actually  
**1:03:59-1:04:06:**  we we stopped um planting rubinia in 2010 i think or no like we had some very small  fields which we've planted even afterwards because we didn't see the yield difference  between um rubinia and popular on the marginal sites under like normal conditions um like  
**1:04:20-1:04:27:**  an average like when we harvest it and rubinia also has um the disadvantages that it's more  costly to establish and you have like thorns on it like it's nasty to um to to to be in  that kind of plantation and the next thing is that new sprouts are coming out of the  
**1:04:42-1:04:49:**  roots um once you harvest it and so it's um it's difficult to keep it like in the row  and um that might be a problem to to puncture your tires for example like if if you have  have some some shoots that like with the second time is maybe they're cut but with the third  
**1:05:03-1:05:12:**  harvest they are they're destroying your tire or whatever and so farmer are rather um yeah  hard to convince also to to plant the rubinia i think rubinia would be rather suitable for  um if you if you have higher higher value creation from the trees you're planting for  
**1:05:25-1:05:35:**  example if you use it as fence posts or something or if you're for like playground structures  something like that where rubinia or maybe also for fridge furniture garden furniture  something like that like it's such a robust um wood and um you don't need to use tropical  
**1:05:48-1:05:53:**  tree species but you could use rubinia as well that's interesting but it's it's very  interesting to hear that poplar is performing very well even on these marginal sites it's  very dry sites um and so you know there's there's there's also something there's a whole  
**1:06:03-1:06:08:**  conversation and i'm i'm sure that you've had this kind of critique brought up to you  as to should we be converting high value land to wood biomass production instead of it being  uh i see you smile a bit there instead of it being produced a useful food production  
**1:06:23-1:06:28:**  i'm very curious firstly the fact that there is marginal land that can also be used for  popular plant plantations and etc yet at a slower productivity okay but that's that's  also very interesting um and that would also enable to kind of release a bit of pressure  
**1:06:39-1:06:44:**  potentially from high productivity land but assuming we're in high productivity land what  would you say to somebody that says this you know should we really be producing woody crops  here instead of producing wheat legumes things that feed animals and humans what would be  
**1:06:56-1:07:03:**  what's usually replied to that yeah it's it's it's very important to discuss this and i  think it really depends if you if you consider um like wood to like to to be not as um as  as important to have it um like to to to service the needs of civilization as as food and i  
**1:07:23-1:07:32:**  would consider it maybe um on a similar level as um the other option of not um using wood  would be like to to to use more usually is to use more like fossil fields feedstock and  actually that's that's no alternative at all so um i would say like we need to optimize  
**1:07:47-1:07:54:**  those systems and make them as productive as possible and not discuss either or because  we need to do two to both like if there is an option to to have a relatively higher productivity  on marginal land with the with the trees and you or we as a civilization or as a as a society  
**1:08:10-1:08:15:**  produce enough wood as we need on those sides okay then that's fine of course then we don't  need those highly productive sites but if there are options that we um even increase  the productivity on the highly productive land including trees um as agroforestry systems  
**1:08:31-1:08:37:**  as you had suggested earlier on with a higher land equivalent ratio of between 120 and 160  percent yeah yeah then then then it's absolutely part of the picture yeah and um every project  probably would look somehow differently but um in general i wouldn't exclude um trees  
**1:08:56-1:09:03:**  from highly productive land in the beginning like specifically also as we know that um  the ecological benefits that we also need on the on on the proactive land are so easily  achieved by only a very small ratio of the land that is used for trees and it's not the  
**1:09:17-1:09:24:**  trees themselves mainly that um like have those ecological benefits for biodiversity  but it's also like even if it's only three meters of soil that is undisturbed underneath  the trees then like it's a complete range of um like flora fauna different species that  
**1:09:39-1:09:45:**  are developing underneath and actually using those trees or double tree double rows like  as a protect protection um physical protection more or less and also like giving some moisture  giving some shade giving some like mixed um habitat um functionality which is so important  
**1:10:01-1:10:09:**  for um for the high biodiversity and i think that's much better like if you in include  some biodiversity aspects to to to highly proactive land but probably is general assumption  that we need to do that then it's then it's even advantages to include productive trees  
**1:10:24-1:10:33:**  on that area i think that's maybe how to um how to puzzle it together it seems that the  conversation changes a lot if we're looking at agroforestry as compared to say okay i'm  going to take this high productivity land and i'm going to uh plant a monoculture of  
**1:10:44-1:10:49:**  poplars which which which could be i'm not judging it i'm just saying like that's the  conversation there between a monocrop of for example winter wheat or you know focus on  annual grains and a focus on perennial biomass that's one conversation but if you start talking  
**1:11:01-1:11:06:**  about mixing the various ecological benefits that come out of this the ecosystem services  that go beyond biodiversity that also talk about cleaner water you know and and and and  soil water purification removing nitrates from the soil for example which we know in  
**1:11:17-1:11:22:**  high intensity land there's a lot of also like highly highly valuable highly productive  land is highly intensified and so there's a lot of fertilizer use because it responds  well to fertilizer so you know and so there's a lot of leaching and there's that so anyways  
**1:11:31-1:11:36:**  that we we've talked a lot about this and um in other episodes etc and people are kind  of familiar with these with these concepts um so it changes you know yeah maybe one more  um argument would be that usually like tree biomass whatever is is not like um like densified  
**1:11:55-1:12:03:**  as grain so it's not so easy to transport it over a wider distance so like if you if  you have demand for if it's energy if it's whatever and wood chips are part of the solution  so if there is consumption like in that area which is just as existing or will be existing  
**1:12:16-1:12:23:**  in the future then i would assume if you put a on it a full life cycle analysis it would  be like um reasonable and really makes lots of sense to to produce that wood and use it  as as a raw material in the process instead of like producing grain which can be produced  
**1:12:39-1:12:46:**  in areas far away like very efficiently as well and transport costs are relatively low  instead of transporting maybe wood chips from the baltic states from canada from i don't  know or densified before produce pellets from it i mean grain it's a pellet already like  
**1:12:59-1:13:04:**  it has the same density as a wood pellet so and if you're in your process it doesn't need  to be a wood pellet but it can be a wood chip um then you can save that money and you save  that energy and all the effort to to densify wood chips and you just um yeah have a local  
**1:13:17-1:13:24:**  cycle so i think that's that's adding some complexity into the discussion but it shows  it's not so easy that you can say like productive land is for food production and and marginal  sites are for biomass i think we need to do both and probably we also need to change our  
**1:13:36-1:13:44:**  habits a bit that we don't throw away i don't know 20 or 30 percent of the food it's actually  not not consumed but it's um somewhere in the the production chain or at least like  in the supermarket or in the restaurant or in the household it's just thrown away like  
**1:13:56-1:14:03:**  i mean if we have that reality for me it's a little bit hard to to to discuss if if we  can grow trees there because like i think the biggest problem we have at the moment  is climate change and trees are so important it's actually the only viable option we have  
**1:14:14-1:14:19:**  at the moment to capture this here too to to draw it down like besides of course soil  organic matter and things like that but it's all related to to natural systems to to um  to existing um land use practices which we need to change and i think trees are almost  
**1:14:36-1:14:45:**  almost ever a part of it and like poplars um are growing faster so like they are um  capturing um carbon like at the same rate as they are they are producing wood so it's  one ton dry matter of wood captures 1.8 tons of co2 so that's um that's a fact and it's  
**1:15:00-1:15:07:**  more or less the same for for every kind of tree and like we kind of run out of time and  we have to start somewhere and also maybe that's maybe yeah some some thing we can go  a little bit deeper that it's not doing an agroforestry system with poplars and it will  
**1:15:22-1:15:28:**  stay popular forever but those agroforestry system also can start with poplar and then  additional tree species can be included or the agroforestry system will adapt to the  to a wider variety and more complexity in the future like it's it's a nature like the  
**1:15:43-1:15:49:**  first thing is the pioneer tree species they fly in they prepare the site they improve  the microclimate and then the more valuable tree species they will come later on and maybe  that's also an idea for agroforestry system then that we can yeah in the beginning maybe  
**1:16:02-1:16:11:**  use the simple options or the simple business models we have from the plantations like in  Germany it's poplars and Sweden it's willows and Portugal it's maybe eucalyptus and bring  those on the agricultural sites and I think every tree that is planted is better than  
**1:16:24-1:16:30:**  no tree and even if you only achieve 80 percent of biodiversity or even if it's only 50 percent  it's achieved and usually for the farmer it's not a decision if they will plant something  easy like poplars or if they will plant a complex agroforestry system on a 20 hectare  
**1:16:44-1:16:52:**  side but it's if you will some do something easy or the farmers will not do anything at  all.  That's very interesting and yeah you're bringing in the next you've discussed the next topic  
**1:17:01-1:17:06:**  which I wanted to talk with you is about diversification and you know how that's another kind of easy  critique that comes about when we're thinking about you know so you've we've had we had  wheat we had sorry grains and now we're just adding clones of poplar is that really helpful  
**1:17:16-1:17:20:**  for biodiversity and then there's the something that always comes up is about you know the  reality of farmers it's like yes of course psychologically we would have everything be  as it was a while ago and we would have hyper diversified systems but the complexity of  
**1:17:30-1:17:34:**  these systems the cost of these systems the economics of these systems do not convince  farmers and so the next best step that we can take and this is something that we had  talked about in our prequel together the next best step can be diversifying with a single  
**1:17:43-1:17:47:**  crop an economically viable crop a crop where the farmer is learning how to manage trees  where the industry around that is developing as well so we're having a tree industry develop  which as you had suggested will then open up other opportunities for other tree species  
**1:17:58-1:18:04:**  for diversification and and and then you know it's kind of the succession as we had said  doesn't just start in the field it also needs to take place in the industry in the supply  chain in the processing facilities and and in the in the market as well there needs to  
**1:18:15-1:18:20:**  be an evolution and there needs to be a certain maturity that develops itself there and so  it's a we need to go step by step because that one step forward as you said really well  is actually we're going forward here we're taking one step it may be not big enough based  
**1:18:29-1:18:32:**  on the challenges we have but it's the first step and that's going to lead to the next  step it's it's about a sudden being a bit practical there which is something that I  find farmers really you know a value that farmers carry a lot yes and and it's also  
**1:18:44-1:18:52:**  I mean talking about business models even with the popular agroforestry system it's  at the moment like at the last year prices I don't know about the prices we have at the  moment for woodchips is it's only a short term if it will it remain the same like we  
**1:19:04-1:19:10:**  need to be a little bit careful like talking farmers into something but to be honest it's  very hard to build a business model only on tree production at the moment like like I'm  I'm very careful with that telling the farmers like it's it's a no brainer you should just  
**1:19:22-1:19:29:**  do it like the what price will increase at that rate and so you like here are the numbers  that's your profitability so that's that's also something like for the plantations it  might work already like if you have a contract with heat and power station for example and  
**1:19:43-1:19:50:**  I think like many municipalities and also industry they will now convert away back from  natural gas and yeah other fossil fuels and try to to get something else to burn like  everybody is looking at hydrogen but it will not be available really quickly and it will  
**1:20:04-1:20:13:**  not be quite expensive I assumed so like woody biomass might be attractive so but that the  most attractive business model would be not an agroforestry system because that's complex  that you need to have lots of farmers to convince you have to to involve some expertise to do  
**1:20:26-1:20:32:**  it right it's much easier to do it as a plantation so maybe for the plantation we will have business  models in the future but for the for the agroforestry systems where we are adding so much more of  value to societies like ecological benefits that sometimes farmers feel not fairly treated  
**1:20:52-1:20:58:**  in that discussion because everybody is expecting them to just do it because like they can improve  their profitability of the annual crops and they have some numbers but we don't know so  much how it is in Germany even if the numbers from France are really convincing those farmers  
**1:21:14-1:21:21:**  are businessmen they have to be sure that it's working that way and if they are taking  that investment and putting all the effort in it and right at the moment even although we were  planting I would say probably more than half or even two-thirds of the modern agroforestry  
**1:21:39-1:21:48:**  systems in Germany throughout the past years in area wise because with populace it's quite  easy compared to two fruit trees and other trees even though I would say like it's not the driver  at the moment and that's the reason why we only have a very few projects as I said before it's  
**1:22:03-1:22:12:**  animal welfare and it's some convinced farmers that say well I don't care so much about pioneers  yes the pioneers they just know it's the right thing to do and I have the responsibility and I  have the motivation to be part of it and that's really important but we cannot scale it on that's  
**1:22:29-1:22:38:**  expectations if we want to scale it then it needs to be a business model and I'm really frustrated a  little bit that like political decision-makers are not performing and making it a business model  because like I mean there is no silver bullet probably but if there would be one in agriculture  
**1:22:53-1:23:07:**  then probably it's agroforestry so like why not rewarding farmers for like doing the right thing  and taking the risk and like making it the no-brainer for farmers just to start it and so  in Germany we have it's it's a pity I mean we have we have like new legislation starting next year  
**1:23:26-1:23:31:**  which defines agroforestry which is good thing which is really important that if we have a  definition for agroforestry but then it comes along with 60 euro of additional premium payments  per hectare of tree area so if you put it on 10% of your field and for your for example if you have  
**1:23:47-1:23:54:**  a 10 hectare field but you're converting to an agroforestry system then you get 6 euro per hectare  extra bonus so and like you have to adhere to some certain relation you have to use like certain  distances and you have to whatever you have to make a plan which needs to be approved by like  
**1:24:09-1:24:20:**  official office whatever so like for farmers it's still a hustle and it's nothing like where  political decision-makers are taking down the hurdles and saying well we will support you with  any means that it requires that it actually happens yeah it's not taken fully seriously yet  
**1:24:33-1:24:40:**  in a way yeah but I mean that that is something where we where we also think like besides business  models like that are that are relying on wood production I think it will get much easier in  the future the wood price increased significantly throughout the past month specifically also for  
**1:24:55-1:25:04:**  energy would but like we need to have like business models which are also taking into  account the climate benefits and the environmental benefits and there's opportunities there as well  with carbon credits which are now prominent and hopefully soon biodiversity credits as well which  
**1:25:17-1:25:23:**  should also complement that this could be I mean just quickly maybe what's your take on those do  you see that as a real opportunity to favor these kinds of systems yes definitely and like Lignobus  is also working on a concept where like your two credits are sold to companies maybe also  
**1:25:39-1:25:48:**  individuals and with the money that is raised agroforestry systems are established so like that  money will pay for the planting it will pay for the management and it will also pay for compensating  the farmer to provide the land but that will be not Lignobus itself but it will be another purpose  
**1:26:01-1:26:09:**  on company and yeah that company is just cooperating with farmers in a way that farmers can get involved  if they want to and learn and take some risks and also take profit from the the growth but they can  also decide well I I want some trees but I have no time at all and I have no interest in actually  
**1:26:28-1:26:35:**  I'm getting involved in that so like you can do it on your own and then like the trees are also  harvested marketed by that new company it will be called Vivo carbon like living carbon and like if  there are any profits left when the wood price is effective enough then those profits will be  
**1:26:50-1:26:56:**  reinvested in additional agroforestry system so the idea is to get some kind of pet peeve to  mobility it like running by doing that yes and but I think like we need this kind of startup  seed investment like what we still set co2 certificates I mean there's a billion dollar  
**1:27:11-1:27:21:**  market developing and we need to get some lever on it to channel some some money into the agroforestry  it cannot like it cannot cannot be reality that that we think we don't need to do anything in  Europe ourself or only a little bit and most of the co2 certificates and co2 capturing actually  
**1:27:39-1:27:46:**  has done like in like some developing countries with reforestation or things like that and also  from the discussions we had with many companies they also not convinced of those projects they  really want to something to invest in something or to do something get involved what they can visit  
**1:27:59-1:28:05:**  where they can see what what is actually happening so we are quite confident that that is a good idea  to to realize very interesting you some a few quick questions about what you said you you  believe that the price of wood not just wood as I had recently mentioned this high value  
**1:28:22-1:28:28:**  wood timber being produced in in southern Europe in France and Spain the prices is shooting up do  you see also wood chip derived products such as energy such as other types of woody materials wood  material for construction do you see the price gonna as going to be rising in the future actually  
**1:28:42-1:28:51:**  I cannot imagine a scenario where it doesn't it may be a very irrational scenario where we where  we where we abandon all our climate targets maybe then we just continue in digging up coal and using  that and of course that's that's cheaper than growing wood but if we like if we are honest  
**1:29:16-1:29:22:**  and we say well we we try to achieve probably we will not achieve our climate targets but at least  we try then like so much hydrocarbons which are fossil based at the moment needs to be substituted  directly or indirectly and I cannot imagine a scenario where on the one hand we substitute  
**1:29:38-1:29:46:**  part of it with wood which is probably easier than using hydrogen and co2 from the air like  hydrogen from the renewable electricity and co2 from the air like those if you'll so whatever and  like e plastics like or actually you can produce anything like from carbon and hydrogen so wood is  
**1:30:01-1:30:10:**  mainly carbon and hydrogen so but it's already in a solid form and you can you can use it in a very  multifunctional way even if it's only building materials if we if you try to do a certain  percentage of our buildings which are now based on concrete on steel on glass if we if you convert  
**1:30:25-1:30:32:**  part of it to the wood and consider it as a co2 sink because like the co2 is stored there for  like decades so then even that alone would increase the wood value significantly specifically  also if we stop destroying rainforests if we stop destroying natural forests like if we even if you  
**1:30:49-1:30:57:**  continue to use forests as productive forests as we did before but we if we stop the deforestation  worldwide then I cannot imagine a scenario that wood is not getting more valuable the demand  certainly will increase and probably the availability from the traditional sources  
**1:31:11-1:31:20:**  like from forestry will be reduced because we consider like a forest being rather an object  that needs to be protected at least not being destroyed may be utilized in a less less intensive  way than before so there will be less wood supply in average and probably also with those climate  
**1:31:38-1:31:45:**  extremes now that the growth field the growth of those forests will be less at least in Germany  probably in France this it will be the same that like this year will affect forest drastically it  doesn't need to be forest fires that are completely destroying the forest but it it's like some trees  
**1:31:59-1:32:09:**  that are just dying and like not being productive and we need to protect the forest more and maybe  diversify it also and use it less intensively so we need to find ways where we produce the wood  which is actually required by society and like providing product providing raw materials and as  
**1:32:29-1:32:34:**  you had said there's it makes multiple it makes sense on multiple levels to be using more trees  more biodiversity more carbon sequestration and all the agroforestry benefits that we know  sensitive lands which isn't just land that's on a steep slope which is also land in riparian areas  
**1:32:45-1:32:50:**  land that pollutes our waterways which are vital for our ecosystems there's such an and it's such  an intense area for biodiversity and ecosystem health the whole riparian area and so you know  anyways there's it's we can we can get you know we can we can get two birds with one stone even  
**1:33:04-1:33:09:**  five birds with one stone on this one if we do it correctly I wanted to bring up another question  and then I have a few things a few questions after it's just finishing off about you know  specifically agroforestry systems with these with these types of crops but before that one of the  
**1:33:19-1:33:25:**  one of them the models is developed for example by by propagate ventures propagate who's our partner  on the podcast they are they're looking at being at creating let's say it's separating the tree  production on farmland from the actual farmer or the landowner in the sense for example an investor  
**1:33:43-1:33:49:**  or a company can come and can help the farmer by including the trees which we know will benefit  the farmer in agroforestry systems and then have either a profit-shared system or a rent that they  pay to the farmer and but they are the ones that manage the trees they plant the trees they manage  
**1:33:59-1:34:03:**  the trees and they will also be taking care of they will take care of the whole tree system and  commercialization etc but there it's separated from the farmer I'm not sure if I explained it  in the best way possible apologies after an hour and a half of interviewing things start to get a  
**1:34:14-1:34:21:**  bit slower but you know I think you've understood me here so you know is that something that you  think is possible with short rotation and medium rotation by my streets as we have been talking  about yeah it definitely isn't I think that's absolutely the way to go if you want to scale  
**1:34:31-1:34:41:**  it fast very interesting it's it's it's also like the same strategy which we apply when like we are  talking about Vivo carbon that co2 driven agroforestry venture or idea and I think we it's  we cannot expect that that farmers are going to specialize on trees like there will be some  
**1:35:03-1:35:09:**  farmers and we should support them wherever we can and it's actually the best thing that can happen  also if those farmers are like like talking to their colleagues and then they catch fire as well  but I think that's that's an idea which is not reality usually like our experiences like they  
**1:35:26-1:35:35:**  like in the agroforestry systems for example what we planted like on free range chicken areas like  they're happy if we come if we plant if we are gone after one day and the trees just grow and  they do some mulching or some rototiller like two times a year at the tree lines and that's it so  
**1:35:51-1:35:59:**  and if you want to to convince them that they need to care in a certain way and for the trees  then they just don't have the time then I will not do it at all so I think farmers are generally  like open to improving productivity they are open to improving ecological benefits of their  
**1:36:18-1:36:27:**  land but they get allergic if it's too complex and if you're expecting too much of them and so  maybe their interest maybe not allergic in terms of agroforestry but if if at the they feel at the  end they should invest they should be the expert they should take care for everything and then it's  
**1:36:39-1:36:49:**  unclear if it's at the end like viable in somehow so and then like they they will just stop the  discussion I mean we have to either as you mentioned that we have to have specialized companies  that grow fruits berries whatever on those agroforestry systems and market them making sure  
**1:37:06-1:37:13:**  it's the right variety that the market demands it's it's managed in the right way then the quality is  done you need to have some scale if you're not directly marketing I mean I'm I'm happy about all  the small farmers that have direct marketing and have a wide range of diversity it's perfect for  
**1:37:28-1:37:34:**  them but it's it's not many I mean we have a labor problem in agriculture in general and we are  talking in Germany about 17.5 hectare of farmland million hectare of farmland and 70.5 million  hectares of farmland and we should have the ambition to have trees on a wide range of maybe  
**1:37:54-1:38:04:**  on 50% of that farmland in 10 or 20 years so we will not achieve that if we expect farmers to  take the risk and farmers to do the operation it's very important that we involve specialized  companies I think that's in that's everywhere else in in other areas of businesses it's the same like  
**1:38:20-1:38:30:**  it's it's it's not so much the user of an instrument or the technique that is developing  the instrument themselves so it's rather specialized companies that also are operating those  instruments and using them more efficiently for example if you have like need to dig a trench or  
**1:38:43-1:38:49:**  something then you ask somebody to come with an excavator you're not trying to find a solution  yourself and I think same thing with irrigation systems which is very typical there's an irrigation  company that will come and that will install things for you they're not gonna start playing  
**1:38:57-1:39:03:**  with tubes and pressure regulators etc yourself or you can we've done it at Massey Farm and we've  suffered from it and we and it's best to rely on professionals lesson learned I think that's  different that whole discussion like I listened also to some of your podcasts and it's very much  
**1:39:16-1:39:22:**  about farmers that needs to get motivated is very much about scientists it's very much about  political decision makers but I think something which is actually not really existing there are  not so many specialized companies so probably that's the reason why it's not like there's  
**1:39:35-1:39:41:**  there's no business case so far so why should there be specialized companies so but I think  that's something that really needs to put focus on that they are pooling like services they're  pulling now how they are providing jobs to motivated young people coming from university  
**1:40:00-1:40:06:**  but are in lack of practical experience and so that will speed up the process very much  that's very very very interesting and you know when we're looking at agroforestry there's something  that's coming up in my view all the time it's you know what is agroforestry you know I before she's  
**1:40:19-1:40:24:**  putting elements together but these elements we need to look at them individually and we need to  we need to understand the details and the nuances of each element in order to put the elements  properly together and in practice we need to be managing these elements very well in order to have  
**1:40:39-1:40:46:**  a successful combined system so if we're looking at for example you know another system let's talk  about a I mentioned earlier on a walnut agroforestry system well we need to be specialized  in walnuts we need to have you know make all the right decisions around walnuts have the right  
**1:40:56-1:41:01:**  varieties manage the walnut properly prune the walnut properly we need to be applying the proper  fight sanitary products on the walnut to manage it you know fertilize it correctly irrigate it  correctly because you know that that's and that's can be integrated in an agroforestry field but  
**1:41:11-1:41:17:**  you cannot just forget about all of the agronomy of the walnut and and and put it into an agroforest  system and expect it to work so that's the that's the complexity there which regardless we're  talking about biomass tree crops now fast growing tree crops you know and they may be of less let's  
**1:41:29-1:41:36:**  say of less management intensity than a walnut but still we need to be treating this as you had said  there's many details many nuances the right variety how to be planting it on what how to  protect it from different pressures so anyways all of this needs to be done very very well and then  
**1:41:46-1:41:51:**  there's the whole other side half of agriculture is going to be the how it's going to be set sold  marketed commercialized etc and so you know this needs to be very professionally managed in order  to be successful and an individual farmer may not have the capacity nor the time nor the interest in  
**1:42:02-1:42:07:**  doing that so that's something that's coming up a lot but i wanted i wanted to close a bit this this  this this parenthesis just to be because we're getting on quite a lot of time now and before our  brains completely fry um i had one or two more questions for you about agroforestry and one of  
**1:42:19-1:42:27:**  them is i see a lot of potential in having a riparian buffer um actually wait i'm gonna i'm  gonna just take care of this question again i'm gonna ask this question that's gonna be my second  question um this question so one of the things that i wanted to talk about as well is is  
**1:42:40-1:42:44:**  diversification and i just wanted us to have a bit because this is going to come up a lot for people  that want to for example plant an agroforestry system that is more focused on diversity  but that stills pay for itself or can generate profits ideally so how can we work with with  
**1:42:57-1:43:04:**  fast growing timber or fast growing biomass crops um in in a diversified context i'll just give you  one example in france there they've there's a beautiful book actually on hedges and an  association called agrof and they have looked at developing the economics the economics of a hedge  
**1:43:20-1:43:26:**  that is planted with native species diversified speech species and that is coppiced on a nine to  ten year cycle obviously the biomass production will be much lower than if we had than the systems  we're talking about now but they've opted for that option because they want to have diversified hedge  
**1:43:36-1:43:43:**  whilst providing so providing benefits especially for biodiversity but whilst also generating wood  chips that they then advise to of course selling directly so selling directly to for example  gardening centers or to different people in urban areas that need wood chips for because that's the  
**1:43:53-1:43:56:**  because that's the way to be able to pay for this kind of system but that's just that may be an  extreme of what i'm talking about and i just wanted to get your opinion on on the idea of  diversifying you know we talked about diversifying varieties together but also maybe diversifying  
**1:44:08-1:44:14:**  species maybe you could tell us about about how that would work i think it's very very difficult  to do that in a um in a way that you base it on the business model if you don't have a sponsor for  it that's clearly projects where you need a sponsor that are interested that this happens and  
**1:44:30-1:44:36:**  i think like those kind of sponsors they are also available like for at least for individual  projects now at the beginning and maybe in the future we have government funding for that kind  of more complex projects but i would be really careful to expect that they will pay for themselves  
**1:44:52-1:45:00:**  even if you wouldn't factor in that you have lost some land and you need to be aware that at least  in germany that's the case if it's not productive and it's there for some years then you might lose  the status of being cropland so then it's an environmental element which you cannot take away  
**1:45:13-1:45:18:**  anymore in the future so you lose the value of the cropland for that certain area and if you are  aware of that and if you're happy to take that um disadvantage and if you say well that's my  responsibility like as a farmer giving back to nature then it's just fine but for me that's  
**1:45:31-1:45:37:**  something which is not fair because it's actually punishing those people wanting to do good and  rewarding those that are not doing and being more productive and more profitable like and maybe  can grow faster and buy more land which is not available and for for those other farmers that  
**1:45:54-1:46:00:**  are doing it the more sustainable way so i think that is really something where we need to have  the society involved first through sponsorships and second through like government funding like  there's so much money in the eu basket for agricultural funding i think that should be  
**1:46:15-1:46:21:**  partly directed and specifically that way and we also already have it to be honest like in germany  like if you plant a hedge and you get some subsidies for that so which which is okay i  think it's not really attractive also what we would we did in the past um actually we realized  
**1:46:34-1:46:44:**  two projects one was on the farm um that sold the um sold it as a substitution measure for  somebody who planned or who built a factory or something or it was just an industrial  building or something so and and they need to compensate for that by doing something ecological  
**1:46:57-1:47:04:**  and like that like benefits from that hetero which we've planted is what was a kilometer  long hetero more or less that that was sold to to to to those projects so that that might be  an option but it's actually not agroforestry we are talking about something else there  
**1:47:17-1:47:24:**  if we talk about a mixture of diversity and productive agroforestry i think that is  really difficult to to achieve it's maybe too much expectation in the beginning  and i think the problem is if there's too many promises from experts towards farmers  
**1:47:39-1:47:49:**  and those promises are not fulfilled then it could harm um the the agroforestry movement in  general because that that happens really fast that farmers are um talking about  unsuccessful um trials and and tests and and projects and the neighbors will not touch it  
**1:48:05-1:48:13:**  the neighbors will not touch it anymore that we had that with for example already with with  vegetation plantations if it was just planted and not managed um many years ago we had other  companies doing that um also energy companies it was not button for it was another one  
**1:48:24-1:48:31:**  with with other service providers and like yeah they they thought it was not existing after a  certain period they just stopped it and and those farmers they they felt left alone and they didn't  know what to do with it and so it's really difficult and of course they're talking about  
**1:48:41-1:48:47:**  it because it's a problem for them and i think we really need to avoid that in the field of  agroforestry you have to be very open and start easy start um with um with lots of um like support  systems um for the farmers and not put too much burden on the farmer themselves  
**1:49:07-1:49:13:**  it's very interesting so in a system where you would be like okay i'm gonna put willow popular  miscanthus three lines alternating for on a short rotation system to produce biomass and have a mixed  uh a mixed species you would you would rule that out it's being unmanageable and unpractical and  
**1:49:28-1:49:35:**  therefore not be economically viable and be planted for other reasons than economic viability  yes i i think like it's it's possible what we also do like in or in the past when we had more willow  also in our general um yeah standard plantations and we planted like a block of willow for let's  
**1:49:52-1:50:00:**  say 30 meters and then 50 meters popular and then like that was two variety different varieties  than willow again and then um then popular so it maybe yeah that that that would be some some  diversity like for the chart rotation plantations what we usually always do we either mix the  
**1:50:15-1:50:23:**  popular varieties even within the row in the medium rotation um project like this gives  different colors different tree shapes um like to um to those um agroforestry tree alleys like it's  looking a little bit more diverse it's not as uniform if it's that would be only one variety  
**1:50:39-1:50:45:**  and i would be so happy if we would have more trees available that would grow with a similar  speed of the poplar but it's just not existing yeah it's um everything else is maybe 50 percent  of the growth rate at max probably lower and combined with much higher establishing costs  
**1:51:01-1:51:09:**  not only um the planting is a little bit more complex um as if it's rooted we can plant also  rooted um plants with our planting equipment where we plant those rods 60 centimeters deep  that's no problem that's also what we are offering to farmers when they ask us or can we do it more  
**1:51:20-1:51:26:**  diverse things and we you organize whatever trees you want to plant we plant them for you but you  have to make sure that you have to irrigate them when it's really getting dry you have to do the  weed control even more intensively and you have to do it not only in the first year but for several  
**1:51:40-1:51:51:**  years until those trees are strong enough to to um to to take care for themselves also like with  mice um it's a problem like we like usually you have those like wire baskets around the roots um  very often like we have lots of mice now in the feeds because it's so dry usually with poplar we  
**1:52:06-1:52:15:**  don't have that problem um yeah it's it's it's it's complexity that needs to be taken into account  and if it's not possible for those fast growing poplars to make a business model on that um in  agroforestry system or if it's just starting now and if you are willing to take some risk and if  
**1:52:27-1:52:35:**  you if you put a bet actually on a rising wood price then um yeah how can it be profitable for  something else that has a life cycle of maybe 30 or even 60 years i mean that's that's not  the kind of business models farmers want to think of and i think nobody else is actually doing that  
**1:52:48-1:52:57:**  that's a generation thing and in i i don't know of any modern business that is thinking in those  cycles like usually it's even shorter like than than short rotation like or medium rotation  business models i think we that to to to be even more clear i think what we need is actually  
**1:53:13-1:53:19:**  business models that are through after 10 years actually if you can offer that to farmers then  that would be um a huge benefit and in terms of scalability because we have so much leased land  like it's not owned by the farmers themselves like maybe it's a 100 hectare plot but the farmer only  
**1:53:34-1:53:42:**  owns like 20 30 50 percent of it and it's not one block of it half of it but it's just mixed all  over so if you plant a tree line or several tree lines through that 100 hectare block then you  always always are getting in in in leased land so but these contracts are usually something like  
**1:53:59-1:54:07:**  10 years maximum sometimes shorter even but i think 10 years is something that is somehow  realistic to achieve and if we have for example that kind of medium rotation and if the business  the business model is good enough that planting management harvesting and recultivation is just  
**1:54:24-1:54:32:**  covered by the by the profits of the wood sale then we are we are much further in what we  actually can offer to farmers because of course most likely those trees they can regrow again  because the farmer is extending the lease contract but just in case he wants to get his money back  
**1:54:48-1:54:52:**  and very interesting and that's that's really something i i don't know how it is in  in other countries but i think it's about the same and for the moment we can scale fast enough i mean  it's it's it's not that we could plant 10 000 hectare of tree area but we could plant like  
**1:55:09-1:55:16:**  1 000 hectare of tree area like next year if there would be enough clients and enough projects  asking for us to to provide our services and that converts in like 10 000 hectares of agroforestry  but we couldn't do a hundred thousand hectares at the moment and we are talking about 17.5 million  
**1:55:31-1:55:39:**  hectares alone in germany and like i think we need to start discussing the scale and we need to  to discuss how we can provide sufficient services how we can provide sufficient planting materials  and the whole industry behind and that that is that is something that is really really  
**1:55:56-1:56:05:**  important across euro that's fascinating and it brings in the topic of of of specialized  companies as you said yes need for specialized companies but also the need for government  incentives the need for education in the agricultural space all of this together in  
**1:56:13-1:56:19:**  order for it to to to to scale but it's very very interesting yeah and we are running out of time  that's that's the problem i mean like everybody you talk to that is in the climate  research or or like this expert in that field like we'll say well we we cannot wait for the  
**1:56:37-1:56:44:**  the golden rim solution like what i don't know oh that's how that's called in english like we  cannot wait to have it perfect we just need to start we need to start planting trees now and we  need to take them that are available and can be scaled fast we at the current rate of emissions  
**1:56:55-1:57:03:**  we have seven years left and then it's done then we need to draw down carbon from the atmosphere  and we have the solutions right not only to capture that carbon but also like um keeping  the civilization running like covering all the needs we have and if we don't have those  
**1:57:15-1:57:22:**  hydrocarbons available anymore it will not all be hydrogen that's that's taking too long to develop  and probably is also much less efficient and also hydrogen hydrogen is not uh producing building  materials so and what probably the the problem is it's too easy actually people thinking well if it  
**1:57:38-1:57:44:**  is that easy just planting trees on agricultural land where no trees are at the moment like it's  and making it more productive and so that's that's too easy and you cannot put a patent on it i don't  know and you cannot monopolize it um that it's hard to make a business case on it where which  
**1:57:59-1:58:05:**  is not um taken over also by newcomers it's so easy i mean it's planting trees we are aware of  that as ligno is as well like it's um once um the wheel is rolling then there will be many more  companies like trying to take profit from it as well and yeah but but it just needs to be done  
**1:58:20-1:58:26:**  it's it's um it's the private sector that also needs to get involved and of course also farmers  have a responsibility at least to to to put their share to the to the big picture but um  the expectation shouldn't be too high i think like we we we as experts in that field we should  
**1:58:41-1:58:50:**  be creative and and put solutions on the table how to involve all the other parts of our society to  to get that done and and make it attractive i think like everybody actually wants to plant trees  and it's a it's a important task to to to demonstrate it and and make people  
**1:59:09-1:59:16:**  feel comfortable of um of sponsor maybe multi-diverse agroforestry systems or or  also agroforestry systems that are just maximize carbon capture things like that and  talk about it to their friends and so on and and get the ball rolling and then i think  
**1:59:29-1:59:36:**  political decision makers um will jump on it as well at the moment they ask farmer associations  and maybe the farming industry and they say well it's too complicated i don't know where to start  we don't know how to make a business model out of it um that's nothing um we we want to do actually  
**1:59:53-2:00:03:**  so the the energy needs to come from somewhere else and we as experts probably can yeah create  that very very interesting it's a high responsibility and and but there's definitely  this is also part of the reasons why we're doing the podcast it's an investigation to understand  
**2:00:16-2:00:23:**  you know what works where what's practical what is you know what inspires farmers what creates  actual or leads to actual planting of trees on the landscape what makes these plantations successful  or not so anyways we're on a bigger adventure here as well to try and work out all these big  
**2:00:36-2:00:41:**  questions but um i think this is a beautiful place to finish the part the podcast interview  um and definitely at least i can talk for myself and i'm sure for most of our listeners we've  learned a lot uh from from from this conversation yeah so please um feel free to check out the  
**2:00:58-2:01:06:**  podcast and feel free to get in contact with us if you have more specific questions to realizing  agroforestry systems we also have a web shop like where it's small amounts of  planting material that can be bought in boxes which will just then be sent by mail and then we  
**2:01:21-2:01:32:**  can advise how to to to plant those projects whatever it is and yeah for bigger projects  we also have specific machinery available to to be realized if there's some someone listening  that that catched fire and wants to wants to start next year we have still capacities left  
**2:01:47-2:01:53:**  fantastic we're definitely gonna put in the link below the episode all of the information  of your work though everything will be present for all the listeners that want to to check out  website social media etc it's all going to be there very easy to to click on and and to find  
**2:02:04-2:02:11:**  out more so um yes i think that's uh that's it for us and thank you so much everybody for  listening and see you next time yes thank you very much dimitri it was a pleasure talking to you and  congratulations for your great podcast it's really very important for like networking  
**2:02:28-2:02:31:**  throughout um yeah the whole agroforestry center  thank you so much for listening to this episode i hope you enjoy it don't hesitate to reach out  to us on social media waiting for you there and see you next time

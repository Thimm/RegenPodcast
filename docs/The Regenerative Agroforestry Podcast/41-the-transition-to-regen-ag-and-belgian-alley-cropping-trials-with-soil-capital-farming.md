### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Thu, 16 Jun 2022 20:55:20)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:30:**  a promising technique called agroforestry.  
**0:00:30-0:00:35:**  In order to find out how it can help us with these challenges, we'll be interviewing farmers,  
**0:00:35-0:00:40:**  scientists, and other experts to share with you their experiences, practical advice, and  
**0:00:40-0:00:45:**  scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:48:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:52:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we had the immense pleasure of interviewing Guillaume  
**0:00:52-0:00:55:**  and Thomas from Sol Capital Farming.  
**0:00:55-0:00:59:**  Sol Capital Farming offers farm management services and independent advice in the field  
**0:00:59-0:01:01:**  of regenerative agriculture.  
**0:01:01-0:01:04:**  They mostly operate in Europe but they have many projects running internationally.  
**0:01:04-0:01:10:**  They're experts in farm transitions from conventional to regenerative agriculture and with their  
**0:01:10-0:01:15:**  vast experience, their team has developed a unique transition approach with a deep consideration  
**0:01:15-0:01:20:**  and understanding of local contexts and farm economics.  
**0:01:20-0:01:23:**  The first part of this interview will focus on this approach and regenerative agriculture  
**0:01:23-0:01:24:**  in general.  
**0:01:24-0:01:28:**  In the second part, we'll talk about some fascinating work they're doing in alley cropping  
**0:01:28-0:01:29:**  systems.  
**0:01:29-0:01:34:**  Agroforestry is clearly becoming an increasingly important part of their work and we're excited  
**0:01:34-0:01:36:**  to share their story here.  
**0:01:36-0:01:40:**  This is quite a long information dense interview so make sure that you use the table of contents  
**0:01:40-0:01:44:**  we have prepared for you below to navigate to your favorite parts.  
**0:01:44-0:01:45:**  I hope you enjoy.  
**0:01:45-0:01:48:**  Guillaume, Thomas, welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:01:48-0:01:54:**  It's really nice to have you here and yeah, I'm looking forward to this conversation.  
**0:01:54-0:01:55:**  Thank you Dimitri.  
**0:01:55-0:01:56:**  Thanks for having us.  
**0:01:56-0:01:57:**  Yeah, thanks Dimitri.  
**0:01:57-0:02:03:**  It's nice to see you today and to take part of this nice project.  
**0:02:03-0:02:07:**  Thank you very much for you guys accepting to come on and I know you're super busy traveling  
**0:02:07-0:02:14:**  around the world consulting and doing your work and actually that would be a good way  
**0:02:14-0:02:19:**  to start is to explain to our guests what is soil capital farming?  
**0:02:19-0:02:22:**  What do you guys do in your day to day?  
**0:02:22-0:02:25:**  What's your job and how do you interact with farmers?  
**0:02:25-0:02:27:**  Yeah, thanks.  
**0:02:27-0:02:35:**  Maybe to give a bit of background we can introduce a bit ourselves where you come from and how  
**0:02:35-0:02:41:**  we came to create this project and this company somehow.  
**0:02:41-0:02:43:**  So maybe I can start.  
**0:02:43-0:02:48:**  I'm Thomas LeCun, I'm an agronomist by training.  
**0:02:48-0:02:56:**  I actually grew up in a cattle ranch in Africa when I was a kid and I spent the first nine  
**0:02:56-0:03:04:**  or ten years in large scale livestock operations since my father was an agronomist and it quite  
**0:03:04-0:03:12:**  quickly immersed me into large scale farming activities and gave me the taste of continuing  
**0:03:12-0:03:15:**  to be in contact with such operations.  
**0:03:15-0:03:25:**  And when I finished my agronomy study in Belgium I quickly decided that I wanted to continue  
**0:03:25-0:03:32:**  having this type of experience and I've been working in Africa basically somehow following  
**0:03:32-0:03:38:**  a little bit the same tracks of my father because I've been working the same large scale  
**0:03:38-0:03:46:**  farming operation for five years which gave me the opportunity to be exposed to operations  
**0:03:46-0:03:56:**  like mob grazing and handling large herds of livestock for grass fed beef production.  
**0:03:56-0:04:02:**  And then I moved to another project for another five years when I was in charge of a large  
**0:04:02-0:04:10:**  scale crop farming operation which by the way is the project where we met with Guillaume.  
**0:04:10-0:04:15:**  We've been already traveling together by then and I will let Guillaume explain also maybe  
**0:04:15-0:04:25:**  this part of the project but this is how finally being a general manager of farming operations  
**0:04:25-0:04:31:**  in that crop farming business I was in charge of also the finance and the commercial aspects  
**0:04:31-0:04:38:**  and because we were managing farming operations together with financial reporting I quickly  
**0:04:38-0:04:43:**  understood how changing farming practices and looking at soil health has a direct impact  
**0:04:43-0:04:50:**  on the profitability of the business and I really wanted to continue making something  
**0:04:50-0:05:00:**  out of it and when we came back my wife and kids from Africa to Belgium in 2015 I joined  
**0:05:00-0:05:08:**  Soil Capital who was just freshly founded by a friend of mine and two other partners  
**0:05:08-0:05:15:**  Nicola, Chuck and Alex who are the original founders and this is now seven years ago and  
**0:05:15-0:05:23:**  I've been since then working in the business as an agronomist and then coordinating different  
**0:05:23-0:05:31:**  operations into farm management and advisory. That's a bit of my background Guillaume I  
**0:05:31-0:05:34:**  don't know if you were.  
**0:05:34-0:05:43:**  Thanks Thomas. Yeah on my side I'm also a Belgian agronomist based here. Originally  
**0:05:43-0:05:54:**  I grew up on a farm. My father was a farmer in the center of Belgium until my 14th probably  
**0:05:54-0:06:02:**  and then that actually and obviously led me to get fascinated about farming since I was  
**0:06:02-0:06:08:**  little so I always grew up on different farms on my father's side and father's sides and  
**0:06:08-0:06:16:**  then after my studies I also quickly went into some advisory here in Belgium working  
**0:06:16-0:06:22:**  for a small cooperative in the southern part of Belgium advising farmers on their operations  
**0:06:22-0:06:28:**  but more technically let's say regarding chemical application and fertilization and all those  
**0:06:28-0:06:34:**  kind of things and then after a couple of years I got a bit tired of the commercial  
**0:06:34-0:06:45:**  aspect of that profession so I wanted to divert a little bit my career into something that  
**0:06:45-0:06:54:**  is more independent in terms of selling stuff and then I decided to also take my backpack  
**0:06:54-0:07:04:**  and leave for Africa and I started working in 2007 in Cameroon and then moved to DRC  
**0:07:04-0:07:11:**  where I stayed for 10 years and I've been starting to work in DRC in perennial crops  
**0:07:11-0:07:17:**  plantations in central DRC in the middle of nowhere with my girlfriend at that time who  
**0:07:17-0:07:23:**  became my wife later and then as Thomas said we met on a project a couple of years later  
**0:07:23-0:07:31:**  when we collaborated on the management of a large scale farming operation and where  
**0:07:31-0:07:38:**  we really had the opportunity to test and implement a very interesting farming principle  
**0:07:38-0:07:46:**  on that farm and led us and let's say formed our DNA in terms of or transformed our DNA  
**0:07:46-0:07:53:**  in terms of agronomy I would say and that's also together with that experience what convinced  
**0:07:53-0:07:59:**  me throughout the years all these years that I'm talking about to really shift my mind  
**0:07:59-0:08:06:**  in terms of agronomy is the fact that I was trying to travel back to Belgium every year  
**0:08:06-0:08:11:**  to say hello to the family and when we were traveling it was during Christmas time or  
**0:08:11-0:08:19:**  New Year because it was end of the no no not New Year sorry but really end of the winter  
**0:08:19-0:08:24:**  time so more March something like that after the planting period and everything in Congo  
**0:08:24-0:08:30:**  and each time we were traveling back to Belgium I was seeing the farmland in Belgium that  
**0:08:30-0:08:37:**  was tilled and from the past autumn and left there without enough cover crops and without  
**0:08:37-0:08:45:**  enough you know soil coverage and throughout this year I could see really that the soil  
**0:08:45-0:08:50:**  was depleting and it's something that really struck me after 10 years when I came back  
**0:08:50-0:08:58:**  to Belgium and did a full year of farming advising or farming works in the family farms  
**0:08:58-0:09:04:**  that I understood that there was a really drop in organic matter around my area and  
**0:09:04-0:09:12:**  that led me really to get my agronomical DNA stronger in terms of how can we try to revert  
**0:09:12-0:09:28:**  the system and that also made me willing to join that company, soil capital at that time  
**0:09:28-0:09:33:**  where I met back when I came back from Congo where I met back Thomas and Nicolas and we  
**0:09:33-0:09:43:**  decided to work together and keep on advising and working with different clients around  
**0:09:43-0:09:49:**  Africa and Europe trying to really foster this kind of agronomy around and that's really  
**0:09:49-0:10:00:**  the emergence of the idea of another agronomy in my mind anyway and why that led me to be  
**0:10:00-0:10:03:**  what I am today anyway.  
**0:10:03-0:10:11:**  And I'm curious as to when you joined soil capital farming, when did that shift happen  
**0:10:11-0:10:16:**  when you started seeing things differently and thinking wow I need to change something  
**0:10:16-0:10:17:**  here?  
**0:10:17-0:10:22:**  Well it's actually, I started a little bit throughout all these years when I came back  
**0:10:22-0:10:33:**  from when I was in Congo and I was only coming back every year to say hi to the family and  
**0:10:33-0:10:41:**  really that shift to me was around I would say between 2008 and 2010, something like  
**0:10:41-0:10:47:**  that around those times where really that struck me a lot because we have this kind  
**0:10:47-0:10:52:**  of climate where it rains a lot during the winter and less and less during the spring  
**0:10:52-0:10:54:**  like we have this year.  
**0:10:54-0:11:00:**  We are in the middle of a drought in Belgium and you see these outstanding rainfalls in  
**0:11:00-0:11:06:**  the winter that are actually slacking the soil down and making that thick crust that  
**0:11:06-0:11:12:**  isn't allowing the water to penetrate anymore through the soil surface and that's striking  
**0:11:12-0:11:18:**  for an agronomist you know when you grew up in that region and you've seen the change  
**0:11:18-0:11:27:**  across those decades just by observation I would say that's really something and it's  
**0:11:27-0:11:34:**  being translated today through the figures when you talk to soil labs in this area they  
**0:11:34-0:11:38:**  confirm that there is a huge change across these decades, there has been a huge change  
**0:11:38-0:11:46:**  across these decades in soil organic matter and we know the reasons and we know also that  
**0:11:46-0:11:51:**  there are solutions but we need to design the pathways for these solutions so that's  
**0:11:51-0:11:58:**  my motivations today to work together with the team and to do what we do.  
**0:11:58-0:12:04:**  And that's what I imagine that's the problem that soil capital at the beginning and now  
**0:12:04-0:12:06:**  soil capital farming has set out to solve.  
**0:12:06-0:12:12:**  Yeah exactly so you just nailed one of the interesting topics.  
**0:12:12-0:12:17:**  Soil capital was and is still the original company which today really focusing on the  
**0:12:17-0:12:24:**  carbon programme for farmers in Europe and probably soon more globally and soil capital  
**0:12:24-0:12:33:**  farming is like a sister entity that we created now about a year and a half ago with the idea  
**0:12:33-0:12:42:**  to keep on proposing to farmers, landowners and other corporate farming entities solutions  
**0:12:42-0:12:50:**  in terms of services for farm management and advisory or technical support to help and  
**0:12:50-0:12:59:**  accompany farmers into a transition towards more regenerative practices.  
**0:12:59-0:13:07:**  So we clearly on a daily basis apply what we call today regenerative agriculture principles  
**0:13:07-0:13:13:**  that can also be compared to agroecology but I mean we have our definitions that we try  
**0:13:13-0:13:22:**  to stick to it and the idea is really to focus on soil health as the main driver to profitability  
**0:13:22-0:13:30:**  but also the main driver towards better impacts in terms of climate change mitigation, soil  
**0:13:30-0:13:36:**  erosion mitigation as well and all the rated positive impacts.  
**0:13:36-0:13:42:**  So that's the I would say the quick definition and what soil capital farming is doing more  
**0:13:42-0:13:53:**  concretely today so we are a team of five persons today in the business.  
**0:13:53-0:14:00:**  We are very much farmers oriented actually like Guillaume and Nicolas they both have  
**0:14:00-0:14:05:**  their own farming operations so they you know kind of have a skin in the game as well when  
**0:14:05-0:14:09:**  we advise farmers we somehow know where we come from.  
**0:14:09-0:14:14:**  And with a small team we deliver different services.  
**0:14:14-0:14:20:**  In Belgium what we do is really managing farmland on a daily basis and Guillaume is really in  
**0:14:20-0:14:28:**  charge of that he will probably explain better than I but then we also more remotely more  
**0:14:28-0:14:34:**  away from our home we provide consulting or advisory services.  
**0:14:34-0:14:38:**  We've been doing that quite a lot in Africa thanks to our network and then we shift a  
**0:14:38-0:14:46:**  bit we shifted a bit to Eastern Europe and then more recently to Latin America since  
**0:14:46-0:14:52:**  about four years now where we are quite involved especially in Argentina and probably now in  
**0:14:52-0:14:59:**  the neighboring countries like Uruguay or Chile where we engage with farmers and landowners  
**0:14:59-0:15:08:**  who are again willing to change their practices who believe in the role that farmlands play  
**0:15:08-0:15:13:**  in our today's societies challenge.  
**0:15:13-0:15:24:**  And it has been quite an amazing experience so far to see how far we can impact and accompany  
**0:15:24-0:15:29:**  these farming systems both in Europe and outside Europe to change.  
**0:15:29-0:15:35:**  Yeah and what's amazing also is to see the difference in speed you know and context because  
**0:15:35-0:15:41:**  obviously when Thomas is traveling over there or Nicolas and we meet back in Europe or in  
**0:15:41-0:15:47:**  Belgium to discuss our trip it's always very funny to and exciting to hear the stories  
**0:15:47-0:15:53:**  on how do we how do they do over there to meet these objectives and what are the nice  
**0:15:53-0:15:58:**  ideas that you guys have brought back to the table this time so that we can test new things  
**0:15:58-0:16:02:**  in Belgium and also the opposite I hope.  
**0:16:02-0:16:03:**  Yeah.  
**0:16:03-0:16:11:**  So that we can balance out a little bit our experience and get these movements somehow  
**0:16:11-0:16:17:**  going faster in the different programs that we have under our own responsibilities here  
**0:16:17-0:16:20:**  in Belgium and also abroad.  
**0:16:20-0:16:29:**  And to conclude on our operational experience I would say that the main difference between  
**0:16:29-0:16:40:**  what we were willing to have in our own company DNA is really the farmers aspects.  
**0:16:40-0:16:42:**  We want to stay farmers.  
**0:16:42-0:16:48:**  We have as Thomas said, two of us, myself and Nicolas and myself, we have a small farming  
**0:16:48-0:16:55:**  operation for our own but we also wanted to keep in the DNA of the company a real farming  
**0:16:55-0:17:00:**  experience on a daily basis and the only place where we could do that is in Belgium because  
**0:17:00-0:17:02:**  we are here.  
**0:17:02-0:17:10:**  We can take the care and be anywhere in less than an hour because Belgium is small obviously  
**0:17:10-0:17:17:**  and therefore we started designing and building up a network of relationship which slowly  
**0:17:17-0:17:26:**  led us to a list of customers who started being interested in our approach and gave  
**0:17:26-0:17:28:**  us the responsibility of their farm land.  
**0:17:28-0:17:36:**  So what we do here is that we are communicating and interacting with them on a very open,  
**0:17:36-0:17:41:**  transparent and regular basis so that they understood what are the plans and they can  
**0:17:41-0:17:43:**  rectify the objective if they want to.  
**0:17:43-0:17:49:**  And aside from that, based on the objective that we designed with these people is that  
**0:17:49-0:18:00:**  we also engage with contractors, mechanical contractors that are selected within the region  
**0:18:00-0:18:05:**  to realize the operation that we want to do and we have, I would say across the whole  
**0:18:05-0:18:10:**  farm land that we are managing here in Belgium, we have 40% that is inorganic and the rest  
**0:18:10-0:18:19:**  is unconventional but the whole area is managed under those regen practices I would say.  
**0:18:19-0:18:24:**  That's fascinating and you've got a unique experience of being able to accompany all  
**0:18:24-0:18:28:**  these farms and so many hectares through a regenerative transition and I mean I've got  
**0:18:28-0:18:35:**  way too many questions to ask you in order for it to be reasonable for an interview but  
**0:18:35-0:18:40:**  one of them that I'm going to have to select and I've been dying to ask somebody who can  
**0:18:40-0:18:45:**  give me a proper answer is, you know, often we say when you transition to regenerative  
**0:18:45-0:18:50:**  that's going to imply a reduction in yields and an increase in costs.  
**0:18:50-0:18:54:**  It's not necessarily, it's not something we hear everywhere but I think it's a belief  
**0:18:54-0:19:00:**  that many farmers carry with them and I'd like to ask you that question.  
**0:19:00-0:19:05:**  How does that play out in practice through the farm transitions in Belgium or abroad?  
**0:19:05-0:19:07:**  Well it's a good question, it's true.  
**0:19:07-0:19:11:**  It's something that we also hear very often.  
**0:19:11-0:19:17:**  Something that we are always keeping in our mind because it's very important to be able  
**0:19:17-0:19:26:**  to address this question with maximum of security and also with a maximum of credibility so  
**0:19:26-0:19:28:**  that the movement carries on, you know.  
**0:19:28-0:19:35:**  But what I'd like to say is that when we are willing to embark into a transition, the first  
**0:19:35-0:19:42:**  step is to design a pathway of that transition and that's what we try to do with the farmers  
**0:19:42-0:19:50:**  or with the landowners is to engineer the pathway that is split on the timeline which  
**0:19:50-0:19:55:**  may be from one to five years, one to ten years, one to fifteen years depending on the  
**0:19:55-0:19:59:**  context and the objectives.  
**0:19:59-0:20:07:**  First of all I would say that the baseline should be well understood for us to be able  
**0:20:07-0:20:16:**  to generate a sound scoring of the farming activity as it is at the start or the farmland  
**0:20:16-0:20:23:**  I would say and allowing us also to understand where are the weak and the better spots in  
**0:20:23-0:20:31:**  the farms that could be for example through yields, historical analysis, soil analysis  
**0:20:31-0:20:32:**  and everything.  
**0:20:32-0:20:38:**  And this enables us then to set up a reasonable milestone throughout that timeline so that  
**0:20:38-0:20:42:**  at least you don't rush into something that you have read on the paper or listened to  
**0:20:42-0:20:48:**  the radio but you actually design what you have read or seen into something that is more  
**0:20:48-0:20:56:**  adapted to your own context but also into a timeframe that is making sense regarding  
**0:20:56-0:21:02:**  to your own context in terms of farming perspective but also in terms of markets, in terms of  
**0:21:02-0:21:07:**  farmland fertility I would say, in terms of organic matter restoration and all these kind  
**0:21:07-0:21:09:**  of things.  
**0:21:09-0:21:14:**  And that's to us it's really a crucial point because if you don't do that and you start  
**0:21:14-0:21:22:**  rushing into no till or minimum tillage, let's say while your fields aren't ready for that,  
**0:21:22-0:21:27:**  it's true that you start experiencing these drops in yields and these high cost of production  
**0:21:27-0:21:33:**  and these kind of things but if you allow yourself to milestones your objectives and  
**0:21:33-0:21:39:**  give you enough time I would say that this enables the farmers to approach the project  
**0:21:39-0:21:47:**  carefully and maximise this chance of success and also reduce the risk of yield decrease  
**0:21:47-0:21:51:**  and cost of production increase.  
**0:21:51-0:22:00:**  In terms of profitability and the fear that farmers have by potentially losing profitability,  
**0:22:00-0:22:07:**  when you say lower yields, higher cost, it's not always the case from what we see, is that  
**0:22:07-0:22:16:**  what we try to do is keep the same levels of yield in general and we do that by also  
**0:22:16-0:22:18:**  increasing the diversity of the cropping systems.  
**0:22:18-0:22:24:**  Most of the farmers in conventional would go with two, three crops, four crops a year,  
**0:22:24-0:22:32:**  we try to increase the level of diversity when you have more diverse cropping system,  
**0:22:32-0:22:37:**  cropping rotation you have more resilience and basically it helps to keep on average  
**0:22:37-0:22:47:**  basis the yields stable and in terms of cost because we're going to try to reduce gradually  
**0:22:47-0:22:51:**  pesticide use but also synthetic fertiliser, I mean all these costs especially today in  
**0:22:51-0:22:58:**  the context of wars and the international challenge that everyone knows automatically  
**0:22:58-0:23:04:**  will not going to increase the cost, most of the time they reduce the cost.  
**0:23:04-0:23:09:**  So on the longer term, same yields, lower cost means better profitability.  
**0:23:09-0:23:16:**  It's sometimes easy to say like that but that's what we see in general.  
**0:23:16-0:23:22:**  And so the techniques that you usually, like the top three techniques or the first techniques  
**0:23:22-0:23:27:**  that you use when you go into a farm and you want to create a transition, you started mentioning  
**0:23:27-0:23:31:**  one of them that's diversity, so you're diversifying the crop, which is really interesting from  
**0:23:31-0:23:35:**  our perspective in terms of, as we're going to talk about later, agroforestry, which one  
**0:23:35-0:23:40:**  of the opportunities but challenges of agroforestry is diversifying the farm and that's an interesting  
**0:23:40-0:23:41:**  one.  
**0:23:41-0:23:42:**  Sure.  
**0:23:42-0:23:46:**  But then you've also got, I imagine that you're also working with cover crops as like one  
**0:23:46-0:23:50:**  of the top techniques, you just get in there as soon as possible, you know, tell me a bit  
**0:23:50-0:23:53:**  about those like initial steps for a farmer.  
**0:23:53-0:24:00:**  Yeah, I think the first thing to say is it depends a bit on the region or even the continent  
**0:24:00-0:24:05:**  where we work because the contexts are a bit different, even though we always end up using  
**0:24:05-0:24:10:**  the whole set of principles, the whole toolbox, I would say.  
**0:24:10-0:24:18:**  If I talk about Latin America, just to compare a bit with Europe and Belgium, in countries  
**0:24:18-0:24:22:**  like Argentina, most of the farmers are already using no-till techniques.  
**0:24:22-0:24:26:**  So the tillage is not so much of a problem.  
**0:24:26-0:24:32:**  And it's one of the main principles of regenerative agriculture is to reduce as much as possible  
**0:24:32-0:24:33:**  tillage.  
**0:24:33-0:24:38:**  So we don't need to start with tillage because it's already done and quite well managed,  
**0:24:38-0:24:39:**  I have to say.  
**0:24:39-0:24:45:**  In Europe, most of the farmers are using ploughing and deep tillage.  
**0:24:45-0:24:53:**  On the other hand, what we see missing in farming systems like Argentina or similar  
**0:24:53-0:25:00:**  countries is that the level of diversity in the conventional cropping system is very low.  
**0:25:00-0:25:05:**  And they would crop only spring crops, maize and soybean, most of the time based on GMO  
**0:25:05-0:25:11:**  techniques and technology, which means very low diversity and also most of the time very  
**0:25:11-0:25:12:**  low ground cover.  
**0:25:12-0:25:17:**  So they would not use cover crops all along the year.  
**0:25:17-0:25:24:**  We can see now there's a very interesting movement of people and farmers reintegrating  
**0:25:24-0:25:26:**  permanent covers and cover crops.  
**0:25:26-0:25:32:**  And we are trying to accompany that and convince farmers to use cover crops between the cash  
**0:25:32-0:25:39:**  crops and if possible, to have multi-species cover crops, which is a great opportunity  
**0:25:39-0:25:45:**  to increase the vegetal diversity in the farming system.  
**0:25:45-0:25:58:**  For Europe, it's a bit what we're going to do today is really complete the explanation  
**0:25:58-0:26:03:**  from one end of the world with what we see in Europe, let's say.  
**0:26:03-0:26:08:**  And our experience, I would say in Belgium is a bit different because of the reason Thomas  
**0:26:08-0:26:10:**  mentioned.  
**0:26:10-0:26:16:**  And here often what we've been experiencing with the farmers as a first step is actually  
**0:26:16-0:26:21:**  a phytochemical reduction, or I would say even optimisation.  
**0:26:21-0:26:26:**  Not only speaking about the numbers of litres per hectare that you're applying, but just  
**0:26:26-0:26:35:**  trying to focus on the environment of that chemical, which is the water, where it is  
**0:26:35-0:26:36:**  mixed with.  
**0:26:36-0:26:42:**  So working on the water quality is really something that is necessary to guarantee a  
**0:26:42-0:26:50:**  very good spraying operation so that you can actually put the chemical in an environment  
**0:26:50-0:26:56:**  that maximises its chance of success, just by working on buffering the water, trying  
**0:26:56-0:27:02:**  to adjust its pH, trying to adjust its calcium content, its temperature sometimes.  
**0:27:02-0:27:12:**  And it's pH, as I already said, so it's really something that allows the active ingredient  
**0:27:12-0:27:15:**  to be more performant.  
**0:27:15-0:27:21:**  And once you've started to solve these kinds of things, you can start being a bit more  
**0:27:21-0:27:25:**  accurate on the quantity that you're applying per hectare.  
**0:27:25-0:27:33:**  And then we've seen across some of the farms in Western Europe that we are engaged with,  
**0:27:33-0:27:45:**  is that a reduction of 20 to 30% of the chemical is quickly achievable just by adjusting those  
**0:27:45-0:27:49:**  first factors.  
**0:27:49-0:27:57:**  And then once you start discussing with the farmer, you just decide to reinvest that buffer  
**0:27:57-0:28:03:**  of money into cover crops into something that is more diverse because usually cover crops  
**0:28:03-0:28:14:**  are something that is quite routinely adopted here across Europe, but a better diverse cover  
**0:28:14-0:28:19:**  crop mix is something that is sometimes missing for economical reasons.  
**0:28:19-0:28:24:**  So let's say, okay, if you take some savings on your chemical side, just reinvest them  
**0:28:24-0:28:32:**  into cover crops and you start having denser cover crops with not necessarily plenty of  
**0:28:32-0:28:38:**  species, but more than three, four, you start having five, six different species and try  
**0:28:38-0:28:44:**  to resonate also the cost so it doesn't start costing a huge amount of money, I would say  
**0:28:44-0:28:50:**  around 40 to 60 euro per hectare in terms of seed mix.  
**0:28:50-0:28:55:**  And then once you start having these cover crops that are well developed, certainly well  
**0:28:55-0:29:00:**  established as well, you start to have better biomass, then you start having a better root  
**0:29:00-0:29:02:**  density into your soil profile.  
**0:29:02-0:29:09:**  And that's where you start having the discussion of how to approach tillage simplification  
**0:29:09-0:29:16:**  in my system because I see that my soil structure is better, I have better rooting system in  
**0:29:16-0:29:23:**  the top 20 centimeter, which would allow us to go for no till or minimum tillage and stop  
**0:29:23-0:29:32:**  actually ploughing because I can use the plants as a guarantee for my soil structure maximization.  
**0:29:32-0:29:38:**  It's a gradual transition, reducing costs, reinvesting that in seeds, gradually reducing  
**0:29:38-0:29:44:**  tillage, diversification of annual crops and of grain crops produced or cereals produced,  
**0:29:44-0:29:50:**  it doesn't necessarily require a radical shift in strategy by the farmer.  
**0:29:50-0:29:53:**  It's not like the farmer suddenly needs to do, you know, like selling through different  
**0:29:53-0:29:57:**  channels and, you know, invest in new machinery.  
**0:29:57-0:30:03:**  We're talking about something quite, you know, something where the status quo is a bit maintained.  
**0:30:03-0:30:09:**  Yeah, exactly, but that's why I was trying to explain with the transition that we try  
**0:30:09-0:30:18:**  to design and it's also nice for us, but for them as well, because they don't fear that  
**0:30:18-0:30:24:**  there is a huge workload to overcome a new workload on top of the ones that they already  
**0:30:24-0:30:31:**  have to overcome suddenly so that they can really aim for these kind of objectives.  
**0:30:31-0:30:40:**  It's really about gradual transition, incremental step by step transition, because it really  
**0:30:40-0:30:46:**  reflects with the nature of farming and agriculture, which is a long term process.  
**0:30:46-0:30:50:**  There's never something you can change in one or two years.  
**0:30:50-0:30:57:**  And especially in challenging farming environments, we see that the best, in general, the best  
**0:30:57-0:31:01:**  farmers are the ones who are proactive instead of being reactive.  
**0:31:01-0:31:07:**  The farmers who are proactive really are able at some point to set a vision at more than  
**0:31:07-0:31:10:**  maybe 10 years or even 30 years.  
**0:31:10-0:31:14:**  How do I want my farm to look at in 2050, for example?  
**0:31:14-0:31:17:**  These are really the questions that make the difference.  
**0:31:17-0:31:23:**  It doesn't mean that next year you will completely change it into the visions you see in 30 years.  
**0:31:23-0:31:30:**  But once you set the vision, then you can gradually, with taking into consideration  
**0:31:30-0:31:35:**  the various challenges and contexts of climate, of maybe political situations or economical  
**0:31:35-0:31:40:**  crisis, then you can follow a path.  
**0:31:40-0:31:46:**  That makes a difference in a quite safe way for the farmers.  
**0:31:46-0:31:52:**  Another aspect as well, I think, is that we constantly try to look at farms transition  
**0:31:52-0:31:58:**  in a very holistic approach, meaning that we mainly look at agronomical practices, of  
**0:31:58-0:32:00:**  course.  
**0:32:00-0:32:06:**  The majority of our systems are cropping systems, but we also work in livestock operations.  
**0:32:06-0:32:08:**  Now we do a bit of agroforestry.  
**0:32:08-0:32:10:**  We will probably discuss a bit about that.  
**0:32:10-0:32:18:**  We also look at other aspects of the farming operations, like human resources, organizations,  
**0:32:18-0:32:19:**  the financial aspects of a farm.  
**0:32:19-0:32:25:**  How can we sometimes better structure costs and revenue?  
**0:32:25-0:32:31:**  And this holistic approach, I think, is maybe one of our differences.  
**0:32:31-0:32:35:**  The way we like to work is to consider all the aspects, because they are crucial at some  
**0:32:35-0:32:36:**  point.  
**0:32:36-0:32:44:**  A farming system is a wall, something complex, and you cannot change one detail or you cannot  
**0:32:44-0:32:51:**  push in one level without affecting the other, so you need to understand that globally.  
**0:32:51-0:32:58:**  In Belgium, one more thing that needs to be added to that is the organization pressure,  
**0:32:58-0:33:02:**  the social pressure that is existing around the farms.  
**0:33:02-0:33:05:**  We have a huge population.  
**0:33:05-0:33:08:**  We are a dense populated country.  
**0:33:08-0:33:14:**  We have less and less farmers, but these farmers are all surrounded by houses, gardens, kids,  
**0:33:14-0:33:17:**  food, whatever.  
**0:33:17-0:33:23:**  And there is a strong split or a strong gap between what the farmers are living today,  
**0:33:23-0:33:28:**  the reality of their life, and what the people are understanding from the farmers and vice  
**0:33:28-0:33:29:**  versa.  
**0:33:29-0:33:31:**  And we need to rehabilitate that gap as well.  
**0:33:31-0:33:38:**  So considering that into a transition allows the landowners or the farmers to actually  
**0:33:38-0:33:48:**  build up slowly a story around their farms, a story that is making sense for the consumers.  
**0:33:48-0:33:56:**  So that means that at the end, you start reactivating a little bit this communication with the direct  
**0:33:56-0:34:02:**  neighbors and they start getting back, getting an interest back into what the farmers are  
**0:34:02-0:34:09:**  doing and stop saying, okay, the guy is polluting again or spraying stuff that I don't want  
**0:34:09-0:34:11:**  to see around my house.  
**0:34:11-0:34:14:**  So it's also something that is interesting.  
**0:34:14-0:34:20:**  Yeah, I can just imagine that being one of the big strengths of regenerative agriculture  
**0:34:20-0:34:25:**  and even more so about agroforestry because now it's become such a hype subject.  
**0:34:25-0:34:29:**  You hear it nearly, not in the news, but I mean, it's something that people are hearing  
**0:34:29-0:34:35:**  more and more about and everybody loves, you know, trees on landscape, it's for trees everywhere.  
**0:34:35-0:34:38:**  And it's, of course, this is not the case in all contexts.  
**0:34:38-0:34:41:**  I've already been in places where people said, I don't like trees so much because I like  
**0:34:41-0:34:42:**  to see far away.  
**0:34:42-0:34:45:**  And that was the cultural, that was the cultural.  
**0:34:45-0:34:47:**  And I think there's quite a few places like this.  
**0:34:47-0:34:54:**  I know two places actually in France, as a local subculture, but let's save agroforestry  
**0:34:54-0:34:56:**  chat for just a bit.  
**0:34:56-0:35:06:**  For me, one of the things that it's making me think about is, you know, you're presenting  
**0:35:06-0:35:12:**  a transition here, which is slow, gradual, which is, which seems to have less risk for  
**0:35:12-0:35:18:**  the farmer as compared to a radical change in practices, something that you can also,  
**0:35:18-0:35:26:**  we now have the knowledge to create this transition safely, thanks to companies like yours, et  
**0:35:26-0:35:27:**  cetera.  
**0:35:27-0:35:31:**  So what are the biggest challenges for the farmers to actually transition?  
**0:35:31-0:35:35:**  I mean, why are we not seeing more farmers transitioning, for example?  
**0:35:35-0:35:40:**  I mean, there is, of course, an increase, we're aware of this, but we're always trying  
**0:35:40-0:35:44:**  to think from the farmer's perspective here in the sense, what are farmers fearing?  
**0:35:44-0:35:49:**  What do they perceive as being an issue?  
**0:35:49-0:35:53:**  What kind of psychological barriers are you guys solving for them, for example?  
**0:35:53-0:36:00:**  Yeah, it's a good question, because that's often why we try to understand why it's not  
**0:36:00-0:36:03:**  taking a, you know, a faster rhythm into conversion.  
**0:36:03-0:36:09:**  But the first point that comes to my mind when I hear these questions is, and that's  
**0:36:09-0:36:16:**  an observation from what we can see in Western Europe anyway, elsewhere we need to see, but  
**0:36:16-0:36:24:**  in Western Europe, I would say in the farming systems is the family pressure and the neighbour  
**0:36:24-0:36:34:**  pressure, I would say, because the risk of seeing your neighbours starting to, you know,  
**0:36:34-0:36:44:**  discussing your new adoptions and trying to make you lose your confidence into what you  
**0:36:44-0:36:45:**  are trying to do.  
**0:36:45-0:36:50:**  And also the elders pressure, the grandfather and the father, they've always been doing  
**0:36:50-0:36:51:**  these kind of things that way.  
**0:36:51-0:36:57:**  But who are not taking their time to try to understand what the new generation wants to  
**0:36:57-0:37:01:**  put in place into the farming family business.  
**0:37:01-0:37:06:**  But at the same time, also, they are not leaving enough room to that younger generation who  
**0:37:06-0:37:11:**  is trying to, you know, open up a little bit the farming perspective on the family system  
**0:37:11-0:37:18:**  to shift a little bit or to redesign the farm into a new way of farming.  
**0:37:18-0:37:23:**  So I would say that's the problem number one.  
**0:37:23-0:37:29:**  But that can be solved through, you know, communication, education, knowledge and everything.  
**0:37:29-0:37:35:**  So knowledge would be probably the second point that is a limiting factor of the adoption  
**0:37:35-0:37:37:**  of this kind of system.  
**0:37:37-0:37:44:**  And that's what we try to also overcome based on the experience that we have in Belgium,  
**0:37:44-0:37:53:**  when we are traveling, is to try to initiate or stimulate the farmers to gather, to work  
**0:37:53-0:37:59:**  together because, you know, farmers are very independent in their job, in their responsibilities,  
**0:37:59-0:38:02:**  in their objectives.  
**0:38:02-0:38:08:**  Most of them are working alone and that's developing a mindset which is sometimes not  
**0:38:08-0:38:14:**  allowing them to easily gather, share experience, tell them, okay, I'm doing this, this, this  
**0:38:14-0:38:19:**  for that reason and also build up a system that is probably stronger together.  
**0:38:19-0:38:24:**  But that's one of the things that we have tried to do at Soil Capital.  
**0:38:24-0:38:33:**  So at Soil Capital we have participated at the set up of a farmers association, which  
**0:38:33-0:38:43:**  is today gathering 80 farmers in the southern area of Belgium.  
**0:38:43-0:38:50:**  We just wanted to meet that objective of trying to have these farmers meeting together, exchanging,  
**0:38:50-0:38:59:**  building up knowledge and communication so that it helps them exchange and also get them  
**0:38:59-0:39:04:**  more comfortable in their change or in their choices anyway.  
**0:39:04-0:39:12:**  And then the third one I would say is market for me, market access, which is also something  
**0:39:12-0:39:14:**  that's sometimes difficult.  
**0:39:14-0:39:21:**  Yeah, probably depending also on the region again and the geographies, but market access  
**0:39:21-0:39:25:**  can be a barrier to more regional adoptions.  
**0:39:25-0:39:33:**  And I think that's also why in every, almost of the project where we work, we try to raise  
**0:39:33-0:39:40:**  the awareness of the farmers to try to access or develop when they can new markets with  
**0:39:40-0:39:46:**  the more added value products that will help the farmers to keep more of the added value  
**0:39:46-0:39:54:**  of the margins that he is creating in the farm by his operation.  
**0:39:54-0:40:02:**  So we can see that somehow the wind is changing directions in Europe, in different continents,  
**0:40:02-0:40:09:**  the consumer wants something different, zero pesticides or also more looking at climate  
**0:40:09-0:40:12:**  change impact or zero carbon products.  
**0:40:12-0:40:19:**  And there are some interesting opportunities as well for farmers when they can pull together  
**0:40:19-0:40:26:**  and maybe sometimes co-invest into developing new value chains or new supply chains for  
**0:40:26-0:40:33:**  local markets, but also that are integrating new practices that will really differentiate  
**0:40:33-0:40:37:**  a product in the end in the hands of a consumer.  
**0:40:37-0:40:42:**  But that will also reward the farmers for the practices he's doing.  
**0:40:42-0:40:43:**  That's one of the opportunities.  
**0:40:43-0:40:49:**  It can be a barrier at some point, but that's the challenge now is to transform the problem  
**0:40:49-0:40:50:**  into a solution.  
**0:40:50-0:40:58:**  A sentence that we love is saying that stop thinking per tonne, but start thinking per  
**0:40:58-0:41:05:**  kg, per kilo, which when you start understanding or explaining what we mean behind that is  
**0:41:05-0:41:13:**  really when the farmers are regrouping themselves into small cooperative or small initiatives  
**0:41:13-0:41:21:**  anyway to gather higher volume of differentiated products, they can start, as Thomas was saying,  
**0:41:21-0:41:24:**  to keep the added value by themselves, start investing in a mill, start investing in a  
**0:41:24-0:41:32:**  press or whatever pieces of equipment that allows them to actually stop selling their  
**0:41:32-0:41:39:**  product per tonne to the local cooperative, but start selling per kilo direct to the consumer.  
**0:41:39-0:41:44:**  And that's where you keep the added value for yourself actually, and start building  
**0:41:44-0:41:49:**  up a little bit more and better the financial aspect of your operation.  
**0:41:49-0:41:55:**  I think this subject is one of the most important and fascinating subjects to talk about.  
**0:41:55-0:42:03:**  It seems to me that the food industry is not necessarily cooperating at the moment with  
**0:42:03-0:42:06:**  the scaling of the regenerative practices.  
**0:42:06-0:42:11:**  We're hearing stories here and there of certain multinationals that are starting to really,  
**0:42:11-0:42:17:**  at least you see it on the websites, starting to back RegenAg, Cargill, for example, et  
**0:42:17-0:42:18:**  cetera.  
**0:42:18-0:42:22:**  But it seems like it's a challenge for the farmers that are practicing these regenerative  
**0:42:22-0:42:25:**  agricultural practices to get a higher price for it.  
**0:42:25-0:42:29:**  I don't exactly understand the mechanisms behind it in the food industry, and it may  
**0:42:29-0:42:36:**  not be the right time to talk about this, but not all farmers will be necessarily interested  
**0:42:36-0:42:42:**  to or want to be starting to invest themselves in marketing.  
**0:42:42-0:42:48:**  And I don't know what feedback you provide from your experiences, personal and of your  
**0:42:48-0:42:49:**  clients.  
**0:42:49-0:42:53:**  No, no, it's a super interesting topic.  
**0:42:53-0:42:59:**  It's coming daily, a topic of discussion, basically, in farms and in different value  
**0:42:59-0:43:02:**  chains.  
**0:43:02-0:43:09:**  I think it's not super clear yet, but what we can see is that all these food and ag industries  
**0:43:09-0:43:14:**  are really now understanding they have a role to play.  
**0:43:14-0:43:20:**  They can bring interesting solutions also to farmers, and they are definitely part of  
**0:43:20-0:43:23:**  the games in terms of changing the practices.  
**0:43:23-0:43:30:**  I think there are interesting initiatives more and more that are coming on the sector,  
**0:43:30-0:43:36:**  where some companies now try to work with premiums for farmers when they agree to change  
**0:43:36-0:43:43:**  practices or to support, then transition into some specific guidelines of crop or livestock  
**0:43:43-0:43:45:**  production.  
**0:43:45-0:43:55:**  And these premiums or these systems are really, I think they are the initiation of something  
**0:43:55-0:44:00:**  that will really help more and more the farmers to get more value from what they're doing.  
**0:44:00-0:44:05:**  It's a super interesting topic to observe.  
**0:44:05-0:44:15:**  They have, as you said, a huge role to play because they have the whole marketing chain,  
**0:44:15-0:44:17:**  let's say distribution chain already set up.  
**0:44:17-0:44:23:**  They have the capacity to be able to create that, to create a transition there and to  
**0:44:23-0:44:32:**  be able to put pressure on the supermarkets, provide new concepts, new marketing, also  
**0:44:32-0:44:33:**  ideas to the customer.  
**0:44:33-0:44:39:**  It seems that we need them to be able to create solutions for the farmers.  
**0:44:39-0:44:43:**  Some farmers, as I said, will be happy to be able and have the capacity to do direct  
**0:44:43-0:44:46:**  selling whilst others will just not.  
**0:44:46-0:44:55:**  That's why most of the farmers, the best way to do that is really to gather farmers around  
**0:44:55-0:45:02:**  one initiative, one cooperative, for example, so that they can be together, share the story  
**0:45:02-0:45:11:**  together and try to build up one message for that cooperative that actually discuss with  
**0:45:11-0:45:20:**  the different parties of the supply chains that are interacting with these kinds of products.  
**0:45:20-0:45:28:**  Because small farmers that are alone in their regions, they don't always take the time to  
**0:45:28-0:45:35:**  address these major factors, why everybody is completely aware that it's something that  
**0:45:35-0:45:36:**  is necessary.  
**0:45:36-0:45:38:**  But when we are, it's the group effect anyway.  
**0:45:38-0:45:44:**  So that group effect will actually help you getting faster and better into these kinds  
**0:45:44-0:45:51:**  of communications and added value to your product.  
**0:45:51-0:45:57:**  And probably one of the last points that is probably keeping the farmers from transitioning  
**0:45:57-0:45:59:**  is the capital.  
**0:45:59-0:46:05:**  That's something that we hear as well sometimes, the capital requirements in terms of investment  
**0:46:05-0:46:09:**  into equipment and machinery and everything.  
**0:46:09-0:46:16:**  I say that, but I'm not convinced that it is a limiting factor.  
**0:46:16-0:46:21:**  We are just observing that it's often the subject that comes back into the table and  
**0:46:21-0:46:25:**  say, yeah, but I don't have the money to buy a direct seeder or to buy a specific hauler  
**0:46:25-0:46:33:**  or other type of equipment because my yard is equipped in such a way and I'm not going  
**0:46:33-0:46:34:**  to change anything.  
**0:46:34-0:46:39:**  So once again, these kinds of things are taken into account when we are designing the transition  
**0:46:39-0:46:40:**  pathway.  
**0:46:40-0:46:48:**  I say, okay, we're not going to ask you in two, five or 10 years to shift, two or five  
**0:46:48-0:46:54:**  years to shift all your equipment into something that is more specific, but we are going to  
**0:46:54-0:46:59:**  take our time to walk into your yard with you and try to see whether there isn't any  
**0:46:59-0:47:05:**  adjustment that is able to be done in the equipment that you have.  
**0:47:05-0:47:12:**  Or sometimes, and back to my point where I was explaining that we've participated to  
**0:47:12-0:47:18:**  the creation of a small non-profit association here in Belgium that is gathering farmers  
**0:47:18-0:47:21:**  around the region.  
**0:47:21-0:47:27:**  What that non-profit did is actually the non-profit bought the equipment and rented to the farmer  
**0:47:27-0:47:33:**  members that are part of the group at cost so that the farmers could start experiencing  
**0:47:33-0:47:40:**  with that planter, that hauler, that specific equipment, how to use it in my context, how  
**0:47:40-0:47:44:**  to use it in my cover crops, in my soil type and everything.  
**0:47:44-0:47:51:**  And they were able to take their time adjusting and testing different parameters and our adjustment  
**0:47:51-0:48:00:**  on the planters without spending too much money because it was just rented at a very  
**0:48:00-0:48:03:**  low cost per hectare.  
**0:48:03-0:48:07:**  What that non-profit is seeing now is that some of the farmers have actually stopped  
**0:48:07-0:48:14:**  renting it, but they both were convinced that that's the good machine, I know exactly how  
**0:48:14-0:48:21:**  to use it, I've been renting it for five to six years now, so okay, I've got the capital  
**0:48:21-0:48:28:**  requirements now after that period of time that allowed me to test it, test the technique,  
**0:48:28-0:48:32:**  let's just go for a new one.  
**0:48:32-0:48:33:**  Very interesting.  
**0:48:33-0:48:37:**  I'm going to throw one last question about the regenerative agriculture transition before  
**0:48:37-0:48:39:**  we shift to agroforestry.  
**0:48:39-0:48:45:**  We hear stories from farmers in the US for example, those are the stories that I've heard,  
**0:48:45-0:48:49:**  farmers that have been doing this for 20 years, practicing no-till, no-till organic at times,  
**0:48:49-0:48:56:**  and that have managed to reach a point where they have immensely reduced their fertilizer  
**0:48:56-0:49:04:**  inputs and their cost of production whilst maintaining yield, but especially whilst having  
**0:49:04-0:49:09:**  much healthier plants, plants that are much more resilient and resilient in the face of  
**0:49:09-0:49:12:**  illnesses, pests and diseases, but also climate change.  
**0:49:12-0:49:18:**  Is that something that you're expecting to happen or is that something that is more of,  
**0:49:18-0:49:22:**  is that just a story or is that something that you're expecting to see in the future?  
**0:49:22-0:49:27:**  I'm talking about this plan that Thomas, you suggested of farmers thinking about 30, 40,  
**0:49:27-0:49:28:**  50 years down the line.  
**0:49:28-0:49:31:**  Where do you expect this to go?  
**0:49:31-0:49:38:**  Well, I'm not sure he directly answered the question, but let's try to get to that.  
**0:49:38-0:49:47:**  But I think that there's a nice definition of what a farmer is, and that definition comes  
**0:49:47-0:49:53:**  from Duane Beck, which is a renowned researcher and farmer in the US.  
**0:49:53-0:49:59:**  And he said that the best definition of a farmer is someone who takes sunlight, water  
**0:49:59-0:50:04:**  and carbon dioxide and turn them into products that can be sold.  
**0:50:04-0:50:11:**  And the more efficient you are in using all these sources of input, I would say, being  
**0:50:11-0:50:16:**  sunlight, water or carbon, the more efficient would be your system.  
**0:50:16-0:50:23:**  And when you look at, again, the next 50 years ahead of us in terms of farming operation,  
**0:50:23-0:50:29:**  well, the farms that will really get through it and be more efficient will be the ones  
**0:50:29-0:50:37:**  who are efficient in nutrient cycling, who store carbon more than they emit, who are  
**0:50:37-0:50:39:**  energy positive as well.  
**0:50:39-0:50:44:**  You know, when you make kind of a balance of the calories that are going out in the  
**0:50:44-0:50:50:**  system, it's a nice point of perspective, a point of view, but also efficiency in terms  
**0:50:50-0:50:55:**  of water, water storage and harvesting in a farm.  
**0:50:55-0:51:03:**  Then we also mentioned here the ability of soils to store water, the water sequestration  
**0:51:03-0:51:05:**  capacity of soils.  
**0:51:05-0:51:14:**  And then the last two aspects, I think, are zero synthetic pesticides into the systems.  
**0:51:14-0:51:18:**  It's clearly also a big trend today in Europe.  
**0:51:18-0:51:24:**  I think each year there are more than 10 or 20 active ingredients that are canceled and  
**0:51:24-0:51:26:**  removed from the market.  
**0:51:26-0:51:35:**  So it's a never ending, I would say, race, like we say in French, towards zero pesticide  
**0:51:35-0:51:36:**  situation.  
**0:51:36-0:51:42:**  It's quite clear in 15 years from now, 20 years from now, there will be more and more  
**0:51:42-0:51:45:**  farmers who don't use pesticide at all.  
**0:51:45-0:51:48:**  So we start to think about it right now.  
**0:51:48-0:51:55:**  And then the last topic is maximizing the ecosystem services because it's clear that  
**0:51:55-0:52:02:**  the farmers will, they will bear the cost of the externalities of their system.  
**0:52:02-0:52:06:**  You can have positive externalities, which means a revenue from them.  
**0:52:06-0:52:11:**  If they store carbon into their system, it means they can probably monetize that and  
**0:52:11-0:52:14:**  transform that into a positive externalities.  
**0:52:14-0:52:21:**  But there are also negative externalities, can be pollution, can be soil erosion.  
**0:52:21-0:52:26:**  And unfortunately, these negative externalities are a cost to farmers.  
**0:52:26-0:52:34:**  So they need to be aware of that and make things happen so that they can avoid these  
**0:52:34-0:52:39:**  negative externalities by maximizing the ecosystem services, increasing the biodiversity.  
**0:52:39-0:52:44:**  It's really not anymore only about cropping the fields of corn or potatoes.  
**0:52:44-0:52:50:**  It's really about understanding and managing a complex system that has many, many impacts.  
**0:52:50-0:52:53:**  When you're talking about this, it's not anymore looking at a field.  
**0:52:53-0:52:58:**  It's looking about the farmers, a holistic system, as you mentioned earlier on.  
**0:52:58-0:53:00:**  How does agroforestry fit into that?  
**0:53:00-0:53:06:**  What's the role that you see agroforestry play in order to solve some of these, the  
**0:53:06-0:53:09:**  problems that the farmers are facing?  
**0:53:09-0:53:19:**  I think, as you know, as we all know, trees are definitely part forest as an advanced  
**0:53:19-0:53:26:**  biodiverse ecosystem and a farm can be a biodiverse ecosystem as well.  
**0:53:26-0:53:34:**  So trees serve multiple ecosystem services such as windbreaks for crops and livestock.  
**0:53:34-0:53:37:**  They protect as well from pesticide drift.  
**0:53:37-0:53:46:**  They can be used as new ecological habitats for biodiversity island, for wildlife, also  
**0:53:46-0:53:47:**  for livestock.  
**0:53:47-0:53:51:**  They provide flowers for pollinators.  
**0:53:51-0:53:59:**  They interact at root level in the soils, helping to recycle nutrients, improve water  
**0:53:59-0:54:00:**  dynamics.  
**0:54:00-0:54:07:**  I mean, there's plenty of positive reasons why we should use more trees in farming systems.  
**0:54:07-0:54:09:**  Again, it's very easy to say.  
**0:54:09-0:54:14:**  The question is, how do you really make that happen in a profitable way?  
**0:54:14-0:54:16:**  There's different approach.  
**0:54:16-0:54:22:**  We have this small scale trial of agroforestry here in Belgium.  
**0:54:22-0:54:28:**  I will let Guillaume present that a bit more in detail.  
**0:54:28-0:54:36:**  But I think, you know, if we take a bit, a little step back, something that I really  
**0:54:36-0:54:43:**  like about trees in a cropping system or trees in a farm is that at the moment you, at the  
**0:54:43-0:54:50:**  moment a farmer or a farm manager start integrating trees, planting trees, taking care of the  
**0:54:50-0:54:56:**  trees, pruning, fertilizing, of course, a tree is about long term, is about minimum  
**0:54:56-0:54:58:**  20 or 30 years.  
**0:54:58-0:55:05:**  So at the moment you integrate that into an annual cropping system, you directly really  
**0:55:05-0:55:10:**  help changing the mindset of the farmers who start thinking long term, because now from  
**0:55:10-0:55:17:**  one day to the other, he has some living organism that will be there for the next 30 years.  
**0:55:17-0:55:24:**  So it's a very interesting, I think, way to encourage farmers to start setting a long  
**0:55:24-0:55:29:**  term vision for the farming system for whom most of the farmers sometimes are thinking  
**0:55:29-0:55:30:**  year by year.  
**0:55:30-0:55:33:**  This year I do some weeds, let's see what next year will bring.  
**0:55:33-0:55:36:**  And I don't know yet when you have a tree, you cannot do that.  
**0:55:36-0:55:37:**  You have to think long term.  
**0:55:37-0:55:41:**  And it's a nice way to, I think, to help that transition.  
**0:55:41-0:55:47:**  And to complement on your point, Thomas, I would say that it's also an opportunity for  
**0:55:47-0:55:53:**  the farmer to allow complexity in the system, because if you want, one of the definitions  
**0:55:53-0:56:00:**  that we could also try to play with is the definition of a region ag farmer.  
**0:56:00-0:56:10:**  And that's a tough one, actually, but if we try to tell it or to get the definition on  
**0:56:10-0:56:18:**  a piece of paper, we could say that it's a manager that is ready to adopt or integrate  
**0:56:18-0:56:23:**  or manage complexity, first of all.  
**0:56:23-0:56:34:**  And that can be through different types of diverse, more rotational system into his farmland,  
**0:56:34-0:56:41:**  through better cover crops, to less soil disturbance, lower input usage, but also through the fact  
**0:56:41-0:56:49:**  that that manager is ready to host more complexity into a system.  
**0:56:49-0:56:57:**  And trees are bringing complexity, because it's slowly shifting towards, like we used  
**0:56:57-0:57:03:**  to say, a 3D farming, because you're adding one dimension into your system.  
**0:57:03-0:57:10:**  And it's becoming an extra dimension from the one that you used to see, because you  
**0:57:10-0:57:21:**  are trying to play in a system that is expanding a bit higher, and that has the potential to  
**0:57:21-0:57:27:**  go and fetch nutrient deeper in the soil.  
**0:57:27-0:57:31:**  But that has also the potential to come and compete with your crops, so you need to be  
**0:57:31-0:57:37:**  aware of that right from the start and try to address that issue.  
**0:57:37-0:57:47:**  So the fact that we are integrating either agroforestry or just a patch of tree or hedgerows,  
**0:57:47-0:57:56:**  for example, in the surrounding of your fields is actually another complexity that is entering  
**0:57:56-0:58:03:**  into your business and that you will need to grow and to get educated about, because  
**0:58:03-0:58:10:**  it's a new technology, a new system that you need to integrate and new mechanisms also  
**0:58:10-0:58:17:**  that you need to put in your mind and in your management system.  
**0:58:17-0:58:24:**  Do you think that you absolutely need to integrate agroforestry in order to be able to call yourself  
**0:58:24-0:58:29:**  a regenerative farmer, taking into account that it's very complex to define regenerative  
**0:58:29-0:58:36:**  and maybe nobody here is actually regenerative, it's a pathway rather than an end goal, but  
**0:58:36-0:58:38:**  is it, you know, do we absolutely need it?  
**0:58:38-0:58:49:**  Agroforestry is not a must, but it's a principle, it's a tool, let's say, and if we agree together  
**0:58:49-0:58:57:**  that complexity is a must, you need to become a region ag farmer or region ag manager, you  
**0:58:57-0:59:01:**  need to understand how you will bring complexity in your system, because complex systems are  
**0:59:01-0:59:09:**  systems that are more resilient and that will be more prone to, you know, to find again  
**0:59:09-0:59:16:**  disease or drought, all bunch of different stress that can act into your cropping system  
**0:59:16-0:59:25:**  and the farmers or the managers in this transition pathway needs to choose from in the toolbox  
**0:59:25-0:59:31:**  what kind of tool you want to use to bring more complexity into your system, because  
**0:59:31-0:59:36:**  that will solve your system and will help you meet the objectives.  
**0:59:36-0:59:41:**  And I would say that agroforestry is one of them, but it can be something else.  
**0:59:41-0:59:46:**  I can hear the thoughts of Thomas saying it's context dependent.  
**0:59:46-0:59:47:**  Exactly.  
**0:59:47-0:59:56:**  With a little bit in mind, it's exactly that, it's really context dependent.  
**0:59:56-1:00:03:**  There are farms where it's obvious that you can start with agroforestry directly and others  
**1:00:03-1:00:10:**  when you understand that you would probably have to work on soils and other aspects before  
**1:00:10-1:00:15:**  reaching the situation where you integrate trees actually.  
**1:00:15-1:00:19:**  So yeah, it depends.  
**1:00:19-1:00:24:**  I'm going to share some feedback that we had from or some thoughts that was shared to us  
**1:00:24-1:00:32:**  by Rowan Reed from an interview that we did focusing on, you know, trees on farms, etc.  
**1:00:32-1:00:37:**  And he was saying that the problem with agroforestry and especially alley cropping systems is that  
**1:00:37-1:00:41:**  it really reduces the flexibility of the farmer, the ability of the farmer to say, you know,  
**1:00:41-1:00:44:**  oh, this year I'm going to do this and next year the market says that, so I'm going to  
**1:00:44-1:00:46:**  use this crop.  
**1:00:46-1:00:51:**  You know, in the sense it limits you because, you know, not all crops are tolerant to shading,  
**1:00:51-1:00:55:**  at least later on in the system when the trees have grown.  
**1:00:55-1:00:59:**  And you know, you're limited mechanically, it's much more limiting.  
**1:00:59-1:01:03:**  But I really like your perspective as well, which is like, you know, actually agroforestry  
**1:01:03-1:01:10:**  pushes the farmer to be looking beyond the short term and to be starting to think strategically  
**1:01:10-1:01:11:**  over 30, 40, 50 years.  
**1:01:11-1:01:16:**  And start to have a plan, an agroecological transition plan over that time.  
**1:01:16-1:01:20:**  So it's, I see that as two kind of different thoughts, different approaches.  
**1:01:20-1:01:22:**  Yeah, yeah, sure.  
**1:01:22-1:01:23:**  It's really about that.  
**1:01:23-1:01:29:**  It's really about a point of view that can be different from one family to another.  
**1:01:29-1:01:35:**  We think that agroforestry or more specifically alley cropping, since you were mentioning  
**1:01:35-1:01:44:**  that, can be limiting a few of the operations, but really when it is well structured, well  
**1:01:44-1:01:50:**  planned in advance, and I think every alley cropping with tree planting with crops needs  
**1:01:50-1:01:53:**  to be well designed thinking about long term.  
**1:01:53-1:02:00:**  When it is well designed, it's not so much limiting the options in the end, because like  
**1:02:00-1:02:04:**  I was like Guillaume was saying, you know, in opposition to annual crops, trees are exploring  
**1:02:04-1:02:07:**  additional space above and below the soil surface.  
**1:02:07-1:02:14:**  So you start really farming three dimension, which means you can have like a constant double  
**1:02:14-1:02:22:**  cropping operations if you do fruit trees production, for instance, walnut.  
**1:02:22-1:02:26:**  That's when the trees are producing, you have a constant annual cropping operations together  
**1:02:26-1:02:32:**  with walnut, which means you are probably more flexible also in terms of market opportunities  
**1:02:32-1:02:39:**  when the cereals are less interesting, you still have the walnuts and you can continue  
**1:02:39-1:02:45:**  increasing the complexity as well by adding other species maybe or looking at other ways  
**1:02:45-1:02:47:**  to integrate trees.  
**1:02:47-1:02:54:**  But it's really like a point of view in the end, who's more flexible, who's more restricted.  
**1:02:54-1:03:00:**  Yeah, I don't think it's that simple to say.  
**1:03:00-1:03:02:**  Of course, of course, very interesting.  
**1:03:02-1:03:08:**  Maybe it's a good time for Guillaume for you to describe a bit the five hectare trial,  
**1:03:08-1:03:14:**  alley cropping trial that you've set up in Belgium.  
**1:03:14-1:03:19:**  Maybe it's understand what was the objective, why did you decide to do this experiment?  
**1:03:19-1:03:22:**  What's the objective of the project?  
**1:03:22-1:03:35:**  It's a plot that is located in central Belgium, south of Brussels.  
**1:03:35-1:03:41:**  It's a block of land that was managed under conservation agriculture since probably 15  
**1:03:41-1:03:48:**  to 20 years, so no till and cover crops and lots of organic manure.  
**1:03:48-1:03:58:**  And then in 2016, we decided to shift this block into organic farming, organic agriculture.  
**1:03:58-1:04:03:**  So today it's fully converted and it's producing organic crops.  
**1:04:03-1:04:12:**  Globally, it's a system that is, I would say, 80% low in terms of soil quality.  
**1:04:12-1:04:13:**  So it's quite rich soil.  
**1:04:13-1:04:17:**  We have 2%, 2.5% organic matter.  
**1:04:17-1:04:25:**  And the reason why we wanted to go to agroforestry there is one of the reasons is that we just  
**1:04:25-1:04:30:**  wanted to bring back complexity into that zone.  
**1:04:30-1:04:36:**  It's a middle of an open field, a huge open field of several hundred or even thousand  
**1:04:36-1:04:40:**  hectares where you see roughly no trees, no hedgerows.  
**1:04:40-1:04:47:**  It's slightly undulating and the landscape is a bit, you know, disappointed anyway.  
**1:04:47-1:04:56:**  So what we just wanted to do, first of all, our first thought was to replant hedgerows  
**1:04:56-1:04:58:**  across around the field or around the plots.  
**1:04:58-1:05:05:**  So in 2019, was it, we started replanting double row hedgerow around the fields, around  
**1:05:05-1:05:14:**  the whole surface of the field so that we could have some edges from the drift of the  
**1:05:14-1:05:21:**  neighbors that are operating conventionally because there is also a risk of drift from,  
**1:05:21-1:05:29:**  you know, from the chemicals that the neighbors may be spraying in some windy conditions that  
**1:05:29-1:05:35:**  drift into your organic crops and then you don't get the certificate for that specific  
**1:05:35-1:05:36:**  year and you cannot sell your crops.  
**1:05:36-1:05:38:**  So that was our goal.  
**1:05:38-1:05:42:**  First of all, put hedgerows down so that we can protect ourselves from the neighbors and  
**1:05:42-1:05:45:**  then it's going to be also nice looking.  
**1:05:45-1:05:51:**  And so the hedgerows first, we started designing them by maximizing the biodiversity of the  
**1:05:51-1:05:52:**  species.  
**1:05:52-1:05:55:**  So we have 11 species in the hedgerows.  
**1:05:55-1:06:03:**  So all bunch of different species that were selected based on pollinators on the fact  
**1:06:03-1:06:11:**  that we would like to host some herds of animals at some time so that they can come and graze  
**1:06:11-1:06:20:**  but they can also graze the hedgerows to feed from the leaves, the buds and the different  
**1:06:20-1:06:27:**  pieces of small woods that they can fresh wood, green wood that they can get.  
**1:06:27-1:06:34:**  And then after that, we wanted to push the second gear and let's say, okay, let's start  
**1:06:34-1:06:36:**  talking about agroforestry.  
**1:06:36-1:06:37:**  What can we do?  
**1:06:37-1:06:38:**  Is it feasible?  
**1:06:38-1:06:39:**  Is it not feasible?  
**1:06:39-1:06:44:**  We hesitated for a long time simply because the fact that this plot of land is connected  
**1:06:44-1:06:52:**  to a concrete road, a small country road, and that's the only road that you can use  
**1:06:52-1:06:55:**  to access that farmland.  
**1:06:55-1:07:01:**  And we said, okay, but if we want to put agroforestry down, we should try to aim for north to south  
**1:07:01-1:07:10:**  alignment so that we are equal and well balanced in terms of sunlight on the crops that keeps  
**1:07:10-1:07:11:**  on growing between the alley.  
**1:07:11-1:07:15:**  And you say, yeah, but if we do that, we are parallel to the road.  
**1:07:15-1:07:21:**  So that means that we need to recreate a road inside to access all these little plots that  
**1:07:21-1:07:23:**  we will create in between the alley.  
**1:07:23-1:07:28:**  So we were losing land, you know, and the land in Belgium, it's not like the land in  
**1:07:28-1:07:30:**  terms of value and elsewhere.  
**1:07:30-1:07:33:**  So it's quite expensive.  
**1:07:33-1:07:37:**  So we wanted to stay rational about that.  
**1:07:37-1:07:43:**  So we said, okay, forget about that north to south axis that everybody is strongly advising  
**1:07:43-1:07:49:**  and that is completely understandable and turn it into an opportunity.  
**1:07:49-1:07:57:**  Let's say that in 15 years, we will have more and more heat stress, sunlight stress, dry  
**1:07:57-1:08:02:**  spell, all these kind of things, maybe it will become an opportunity because we will  
**1:08:02-1:08:05:**  shade the crop.  
**1:08:05-1:08:10:**  Who knows whether we are right, whether we are wrong, we don't know, but we actually,  
**1:08:10-1:08:17:**  we have a northeast to southwest alignment, so it's not perfect, but we'll see what's  
**1:08:17-1:08:19:**  the impact in terms of shade.  
**1:08:19-1:08:27:**  But we did it anyway because otherwise that was a criteria to just unselect the option  
**1:08:27-1:08:29:**  and go for something else.  
**1:08:29-1:08:31:**  So that's what we did.  
**1:08:31-1:08:37:**  And then we started playing with a whole bunch of different ideas in terms of species.  
**1:08:37-1:08:42:**  Do we go for fresh fruit, do we go for dry fruit, do we go for wood, do we go for biomass,  
**1:08:42-1:08:45:**  do we go for different other options?  
**1:08:45-1:08:53:**  And in our network, we knew a guy that is 10 kilometers away from us and that's got  
**1:08:53-1:09:04:**  40 hectares in walnut, orchard walnut with pasture underneath that are being grazed by  
**1:09:04-1:09:06:**  animals.  
**1:09:06-1:09:14:**  And we met him a couple of times and the relationship was quite nice, we were exchanging a whole  
**1:09:14-1:09:18:**  bunch of ideas, discussions on different topics and everything.  
**1:09:18-1:09:23:**  And he said, listen guys, if you guys want to put walnuts there, do it.  
**1:09:23-1:09:29:**  My harvester is five kilometers away, when you need it, I can just rent it to you and  
**1:09:29-1:09:37:**  then I will build up facilities also to sort, to dry, to break the shell, all these kinds  
**1:09:37-1:09:44:**  of things so that we can maximize the output of the production in terms of added value.  
**1:09:44-1:09:53:**  And then we started going down that option of planting walnuts in our block.  
**1:09:53-1:09:59:**  And then came the question of the variety, what kind of walnuts do we plant?  
**1:09:59-1:10:03:**  Where do we find these young seedlings and everything?  
**1:10:03-1:10:12:**  So we started studying a little bit the market and France is producing grafted walnuts that  
**1:10:12-1:10:25:**  are quite well suited to our areas in terms of climatic conditions, because we are way  
**1:10:25-1:10:30:**  north from the main walnut production centers of France, which are Grenoble and the other  
**1:10:30-1:10:32:**  side, the Atlantic side.  
**1:10:32-1:10:39:**  So I started discussing with these guys and with the different nurseries there and we  
**1:10:39-1:10:46:**  identified one variety that could shoot us.  
**1:10:46-1:10:53:**  And we bought 200 trees of that variety, plus the pollinators that need to pollinate the  
**1:10:53-1:10:56:**  main varieties that were selected.  
**1:10:56-1:11:02:**  And the pollinators, it was a bit of a difficulty here because we don't know really the variety  
**1:11:02-1:11:08:**  reaction of these seedlings or grafted seedlings in our context.  
**1:11:08-1:11:17:**  So I took three different pollinators that have been planted on the western side of the  
**1:11:17-1:11:23:**  tree line so that they are on top of the prevailing winds so they can blow their pollen all through  
**1:11:23-1:11:32:**  down the line and pollinate all the crops, the main variety that are on the rest of the  
**1:11:32-1:11:33:**  line.  
**1:11:33-1:11:37:**  And we took three different pollinators that are starting to, supposed to start flowering  
**1:11:37-1:11:43:**  in I think it's on the 15th of April until the 15th of May.  
**1:11:43-1:11:49:**  And that's roughly coinciding with the main variety that we chose.  
**1:11:49-1:11:54:**  So that's really the story and how we came to identify exactly what we wanted in terms  
**1:11:54-1:12:06:**  of diversity complexity, what do we choose, which species and which variety as well.  
**1:12:06-1:12:10:**  Just as a quick wrap-up, what's interesting here is again, like we said previously, the  
**1:12:10-1:12:17:**  importance of identifying local value chain or supply chain that can absorb the market.  
**1:12:17-1:12:24:**  Going into an agroforestry production, just make sure that there is market and logistical  
**1:12:24-1:12:29:**  capabilities in the area to evacuate the production.  
**1:12:29-1:12:30:**  Exactly.  
**1:12:30-1:12:36:**  It's a huge help to have that, the local farmer five kilometres away.  
**1:12:36-1:12:37:**  Well, exactly.  
**1:12:37-1:12:42:**  And he was actually, we understood afterwards that the guy is actually passing pretty much  
**1:12:42-1:12:47:**  in front of our block because he's harvesting the walnuts of another farmer that is five  
**1:12:47-1:12:48:**  kilometres on the other side.  
**1:12:48-1:12:55:**  So actually he's getting close to our field every year.  
**1:12:55-1:13:00:**  But he's not going to come to our field for the next two to three years anyway, because  
**1:13:00-1:13:05:**  we are expecting the production to start only in a couple of years and full production in  
**1:13:05-1:13:07:**  15 to 20 years from now.  
**1:13:07-1:13:09:**  So it's 10 to 15 years from now.  
**1:13:09-1:13:11:**  So it's going to take time.  
**1:13:11-1:13:16:**  But yeah, it's true that it's something that needs to be well sawed ahead.  
**1:13:16-1:13:21:**  And today the walnut market in organic is quite strong.  
**1:13:21-1:13:26:**  The demand is strong, the prices are quite high.  
**1:13:26-1:13:35:**  So it's even more interesting for us to start integrating our production into storage facilities  
**1:13:35-1:13:42:**  so that, and handling facilities so that we can get the most out of the production and  
**1:13:42-1:13:45:**  start selling fresh nuts.  
**1:13:45-1:13:49:**  So that's the end goal of it.  
**1:13:49-1:13:56:**  The production is supposed to be, I think it's going to be 25 kg per tree per year on  
**1:13:56-1:13:57:**  full production.  
**1:13:57-1:14:03:**  So you multiply that by 200, you've got the tonnage that we'll have on a yearly basis.  
**1:14:03-1:14:09:**  So it's not going to be a whole silo of walnut, but anyway, it's sufficient for us to acquire  
**1:14:09-1:14:19:**  experience to be able to test the system and to be good at advising the type of varieties  
**1:14:19-1:14:28:**  that we need because we are now building up our experience into pruning, into disease,  
**1:14:28-1:14:33:**  also monitoring because that's something that needs to be addressed.  
**1:14:33-1:14:37:**  This year it's quite dry, so we don't have any issues, but maybe next year it will be  
**1:14:37-1:14:43:**  foggy and more moist so you can start having coletotrichum, problems of bacteria, all these  
**1:14:43-1:14:45:**  kinds of things.  
**1:14:45-1:14:49:**  That variety has been selected for its natural resistance also or tolerance to these kinds  
**1:14:49-1:14:54:**  of diseases.  
**1:14:54-1:14:58:**  This is interesting to look at the diseases in pests and how do you expect farmers to  
**1:14:58-1:15:01:**  really, I'm thinking now about scaling the system, right?  
**1:15:01-1:15:06:**  So thinking about you doing this as a demonstration and to gain experience to advise others, how  
**1:15:06-1:15:11:**  do you expect farmers to react to the issue of like, okay, I'm focused on grain farming.  
**1:15:11-1:15:12:**  This is my job.  
**1:15:12-1:15:16:**  This is where my knowledge is and now I need to diversify or I want to diversify to implement  
**1:15:16-1:15:20:**  agroforestry and I need to learn how to be a tree farmer now.  
**1:15:20-1:15:25:**  I need to learn how to observe the tree illnesses, how to treat the tree illnesses.  
**1:15:25-1:15:27:**  How do you think that's going to sit with farmers?  
**1:15:27-1:15:31:**  Because when we're looking at complexity, it's a huge topic that we're really passionate  
**1:15:31-1:15:36:**  about with Etienne and it's about, we understand the value of adding complexity to farms, but  
**1:15:36-1:15:44:**  often that comes with huge costs and challenges, especially around knowledge and infrastructure  
**1:15:44-1:15:46:**  as well, which is what you've said right now.  
**1:15:46-1:15:52:**  But in terms of this knowledge to learn to manage a new crop, how do you see that?  
**1:15:52-1:16:01:**  What I would advise is to start small by just planting a couple of trees like that in a  
**1:16:01-1:16:09:**  pasture where you, that are next to your place and observe these kind of trees, the behavior  
**1:16:09-1:16:14:**  of these trees into your context so that you can start building up an eye that is different  
**1:16:14-1:16:23:**  than the arable eye that the farmer may have more routinely and try to build up a knowledge  
**1:16:23-1:16:30:**  that is sufficient so that you can address the investment that you would make on a later  
**1:16:30-1:16:35:**  stage to a larger area.  
**1:16:35-1:16:43:**  And also it's, there are more and more support that are becoming available locally by groups  
**1:16:43-1:16:51:**  of farmers or small technical groups that are trying to assist farmers, advising farmers  
**1:16:51-1:16:59:**  independently also to shift their system into everything, all the principles that we're  
**1:16:59-1:17:00:**  talking about.  
**1:17:00-1:17:08:**  And some of them are, some associations are really willing to see more and more trees  
**1:17:08-1:17:10:**  into the system.  
**1:17:10-1:17:15:**  So are delivering together with the rest of the technical assistance, a permanent assistance  
**1:17:15-1:17:21:**  that can help farmers being alerted about the different pests and disease that needs  
**1:17:21-1:17:28:**  to be followed and monitored throughout the season.  
**1:17:28-1:17:39:**  Yeah, and maybe to complete another way to fill the gap of this knowledge, lax, if I  
**1:17:39-1:17:46:**  can say, is the other way to say that is one of the best ways to convince the farmers to  
**1:17:46-1:17:50:**  do something or change their practices is when the neighbor is doing it.  
**1:17:50-1:17:57:**  So again, exchange between farmers, associations, et cetera, are one of the best ways also to  
**1:17:57-1:18:03:**  slowly convince and raise the awareness of the farmers towards new practices that are  
**1:18:03-1:18:08:**  not so complex in the end, when you're already a farmer, you could understand how a tree  
**1:18:08-1:18:13:**  grows and what he needs to do to plan them.  
**1:18:13-1:18:21:**  And then probably one additional information is to go back to our plot of land, Dimitri,  
**1:18:21-1:18:26:**  is the way we designed the system, because I haven't, we haven't said anything on that  
**1:18:26-1:18:27:**  yet.  
**1:18:27-1:18:34:**  It's so it's, I just said it's 200 trees, but you don't know which, how it's planted.  
**1:18:34-1:18:40:**  It's actually, we decided to plan the trees that, if I, you know, the axle now it's north,  
**1:18:40-1:18:42:**  east, south, west, roughly.  
**1:18:42-1:18:50:**  And then you have in between the alleys, you have 34 meters and in the alleys, you have  
**1:18:50-1:18:54:**  one tree every eight meters.  
**1:18:54-1:19:02:**  And obviously that's another difficulty also, because you need to take into account the  
**1:19:02-1:19:08:**  fact that we are inorganic and that we have all bunch of equipment that are activated  
**1:19:08-1:19:12:**  for making mechanical weeding.  
**1:19:12-1:19:19:**  And whether you are under cereal grains or in chicory or in sugar beets or in whatever,  
**1:19:19-1:19:24:**  because we are farming all these kinds of crops on that small plot, you need to adapt  
**1:19:24-1:19:32:**  the width of your planting, the width of the distance between the alley to the width of  
**1:19:32-1:19:33:**  this equipment.  
**1:19:33-1:19:41:**  So we are expecting the canopy of the walnut to grow five meters on the right and five  
**1:19:41-1:19:44:**  meters on the left from the trunk of the tree.  
**1:19:44-1:19:56:**  So we will lose 10 meters in the distance of, in that space of 24 meters.  
**1:19:56-1:20:04:**  So at the end, we will be left with 24 meters that will be used for arable crops.  
**1:20:04-1:20:11:**  And that corresponds to two times 12, which is the width of the mechanical arrow that  
**1:20:11-1:20:20:**  we use there and that also fits in terms of hoeing, also fits in terms of sugar beet planting  
**1:20:20-1:20:24:**  or chicory planting, maize planting, planters, etc.  
**1:20:24-1:20:31:**  So it's really playing with the numbers at the start to see what is the width that you  
**1:20:31-1:20:40:**  need and today you put 34, okay, that's not ideal because today we are farming 33, obviously.  
**1:20:40-1:20:48:**  But as the years pass on, we will start reducing down to 24, but you need every year to adjust  
**1:20:48-1:21:00:**  a little bit your system to the space reduction and also to add some permanent crops or permanent  
**1:21:00-1:21:08:**  pasture underneath the canopy so that you can keep your system clean from any weed and  
**1:21:08-1:21:13:**  also adapt it to a mechanical harvester, walnut harvester that will come and actually harvest  
**1:21:13-1:21:20:**  the walnut that may be present on the ground.  
**1:21:20-1:21:26:**  So it's really playing with the numbers and understanding what you have in terms of equipment  
**1:21:26-1:21:37:**  or what the contractors that are making the mechanical work has got.  
**1:21:37-1:21:44:**  It's really interesting to see with intercropping, imagine doing this at scale on a 100 hectare  
**1:21:44-1:21:50:**  farm for example, or field, a variety of fields, but let's say on 100 hectares, it seems to  
**1:21:50-1:21:58:**  be difficult to be able to justify the costs that are incurred and the reduction in plantation  
**1:21:58-1:22:04:**  area without having a crop that produces walnuts, for example, like a nut, a high value cash  
**1:22:04-1:22:08:**  crop, which we'll produce every year.  
**1:22:08-1:22:12:**  Because what we're seeing, for example, in the experiments in Southern France, as you're  
**1:22:12-1:22:20:**  very familiar, they've been testing this with black locust, with robinia absurdoacacia.  
**1:22:20-1:22:23:**  And so the harvest happens in 20, 25 years.  
**1:22:23-1:22:29:**  So for 20, 25 years, little by little, you're reducing what you get out of the land in order  
**1:22:29-1:22:32:**  to cash crop, in order to get your cash back in 25 years.  
**1:22:32-1:22:35:**  And that seems to be really challenging for farmers to accept.  
**1:22:35-1:22:38:**  And that's what's also really interesting with your system of looking at how we can  
**1:22:38-1:22:41:**  work with the crop that produces every year.  
**1:22:41-1:22:49:**  If you stick to a fresh fruit, I think it's possible to keep on reducing that part of  
**1:22:49-1:22:59:**  the unfarmable portion of land that grows under the canopy because it depends also on  
**1:22:59-1:23:05:**  your pruning system, what you want to have in terms of fruiting system.  
**1:23:05-1:23:13:**  Here you must imagine a walnut, it needs to grow tall and wide so that you maximize the  
**1:23:13-1:23:21:**  production, the flowering capacity and the global production on a yearly basis.  
**1:23:21-1:23:30:**  Now if you have pears or apples, you can keep your tree down, not as much as possible, but  
**1:23:30-1:23:35:**  to a reasonable size so that you minimize the loss of farmland and you can minimize  
**1:23:35-1:23:42:**  also the potential loss in terms of revenue from your arable production.  
**1:23:42-1:23:49:**  It really, for next year, we will have another, we'll open up another project that will be  
**1:23:49-1:23:51:**  on 20 hectares.  
**1:23:51-1:23:52:**  Agroforestry?  
**1:23:52-1:24:02:**  Well, hopefully, not hopefully, but agroforestry, either dry nut or probably and hopefully fresh  
**1:24:02-1:24:04:**  fruits or apples.  
**1:24:04-1:24:11:**  There's Stephen Briggs in the UK that has been working like this with the apple system  
**1:24:11-1:24:17:**  and he's got an interesting approach where he says he's not an apple grower and he struggles,  
**1:24:17-1:24:21:**  he doesn't think he has the nicest apples, but because he's decided to invest in transforming  
**1:24:21-1:24:27:**  into juice, he doesn't need to have big beautiful apples without any marks on it because he's  
**1:24:27-1:24:28:**  juicing them.  
**1:24:28-1:24:34:**  And so he's playing with the processing in order to fix his problem of not wanting to  
**1:24:34-1:24:36:**  become an expert apple grower.  
**1:24:36-1:24:38:**  Yeah, we know Stephen quite well.  
**1:24:38-1:24:40:**  We've been to his farm several times.  
**1:24:40-1:24:41:**  Very nice.  
**1:24:41-1:24:43:**  Yeah, he's been there as well.  
**1:24:43-1:24:48:**  So yeah, he's a great farmer, very innovative and super inspiring.  
**1:24:48-1:24:53:**  Is there anything else that you wanted to share about the intercropping, alley cropping  
**1:24:53-1:24:57:**  system that you've set up in Belgium here?  
**1:24:57-1:25:10:**  An interesting question that comes often is who is founting these kind of initiatives.  
**1:25:10-1:25:14:**  We see different possibilities.  
**1:25:14-1:25:20:**  What we've seen in one part of Belgium is on one project what I've heard is crowdfunding,  
**1:25:20-1:25:26:**  so people that are gathering together to help the farming investing into that project.  
**1:25:26-1:25:34:**  I don't know whether that was successful or not, but it's something that I've heard already.  
**1:25:34-1:25:43:**  Otherwise, what we can get in our region in the southern part of Belgium is regional subsidies  
**1:25:43-1:25:45:**  for tree lines.  
**1:25:45-1:25:53:**  So you're subsidized partly for the cost of the investment or it's just being funded by  
**1:25:53-1:25:55:**  the farmers.  
**1:25:55-1:26:05:**  So in terms of cost, it's really depending on what you have, but in our system, because  
**1:26:05-1:26:16:**  we bought the one that in France, they are grafted, they were certified by the local  
**1:26:16-1:26:18:**  authorities in terms of origin and genetics.  
**1:26:18-1:26:26:**  So it's CTEFL who certified this type of tree production.  
**1:26:26-1:26:33:**  The one that itself cost us 20 euro or 19.8 per tree.  
**1:26:33-1:26:39:**  But when we did the calculation and the planting cost and everything, we ended up with pretty  
**1:26:39-1:26:42:**  much 35 euro per tree.  
**1:26:42-1:26:46:**  All included, all planted, labor included and everything.  
**1:26:46-1:26:56:**  The subsidy that we can get here in Walloon area is 6 euro per tree, roughly.  
**1:26:56-1:26:59:**  That's for an investment.  
**1:26:59-1:27:04:**  One shot.  
**1:27:04-1:27:13:**  The yearly cost roughly per tree when it will be in production or a couple of years before  
**1:27:13-1:27:19:**  is expected to be around 42 euro in terms of pruning, in terms of labor.  
**1:27:19-1:27:28:**  That's one threat that I see is the access to labor in large agroforestry systems.  
**1:27:28-1:27:30:**  But we can talk about that later.  
**1:27:30-1:27:36:**  So fertilization in organic is an issue because you need at the early stage of the walnut,  
**1:27:36-1:27:38:**  you need massive amount of nitrogen.  
**1:27:38-1:27:46:**  So that's massive, I'm not going to exaggerate, but you need a good amount of nitrogen to  
**1:27:46-1:27:53:**  stimulate the crop so that you can expect a production to be fairly reasonable as soon  
**1:27:53-1:27:56:**  as possible.  
**1:27:56-1:27:59:**  So that's the cost per year, per tree.  
**1:27:59-1:28:05:**  And the expected revenue per tree per year is around 140.  
**1:28:05-1:28:11:**  Because you take 25 kg, I said, on your own, times four, times six, that's the cost per  
**1:28:11-1:28:15:**  kg of organic walnut.  
**1:28:15-1:28:20:**  So around year 12, you start paying back your investment.  
**1:28:20-1:28:24:**  You brought up a really interesting aspect, the labor one.  
**1:28:24-1:28:30:**  And that's something that in the region we're working here, they've got olives now and everybody's  
**1:28:30-1:28:35:**  shifting towards super intensive olives because they've worked out techniques to just need  
**1:28:35-1:28:39:**  hardly any labor to manage.  
**1:28:39-1:28:43:**  Every four or five years, you need some labor to come in with a chainsaw to prune the trees  
**1:28:43-1:28:52:**  because the mechanical pruning, the tree needs to be aerated and needs to be chosen in a  
**1:28:52-1:28:57:**  more specific way, selecting, removing whole branches instead of just topping and creating  
**1:28:57-1:28:58:**  a hedge.  
**1:28:58-1:29:01:**  But that's very unique to the olive tree that's a hedge.  
**1:29:01-1:29:05:**  It's like, I mean, in a sense, it's a bush, sorry.  
**1:29:05-1:29:12:**  And so, but it's enabled them to really scale their systems here and to be able to, and  
**1:29:12-1:29:16:**  many farmers are now implementing this and are planting these systems.  
**1:29:16-1:29:18:**  Farmers that were previously doing, for example, cattle and stuff.  
**1:29:18-1:29:24:**  So it's enabling the system to be scaled and farmers to actually diversify within a super  
**1:29:24-1:29:25:**  intensive system, of course.  
**1:29:25-1:29:30:**  But how do you plan to solve that issue in the future when you, for example, scale to  
**1:29:30-1:29:32:**  20 hectare apple?  
**1:29:32-1:29:38:**  And I've worked in apple, which is seven months, two years ago, and it was so much work.  
**1:29:38-1:29:39:**  It was scary.  
**1:29:39-1:29:48:**  It's a question and I'm going to answer by a question because we don't have the solution.  
**1:29:48-1:29:53:**  We will see today for our small plot, it's just a question of a couple of hours with  
**1:29:53-1:29:55:**  one or two colleagues.  
**1:29:55-1:29:58:**  And we do that on a Sunday, you know.  
**1:29:58-1:30:03:**  But it's true that it needs to be scaled, it needs to be explained, it needs to be considered  
**1:30:03-1:30:16:**  into a project because you cannot be just an outsider from that big need in terms of  
**1:30:16-1:30:17:**  labor for picking.  
**1:30:17-1:30:22:**  But it's for picking, it's also for pruning, it's also for fertilization, it can be for  
**1:30:22-1:30:25:**  anything, you know.  
**1:30:25-1:30:27:**  So it needs to be addressed.  
**1:30:27-1:30:37:**  We have large orchids in northern Belgium and they used to suffer from labor lack.  
**1:30:37-1:30:44:**  These days it seems to be solved because they are convincing people to come back into the  
**1:30:44-1:30:48:**  agricultural sector to work.  
**1:30:48-1:30:56:**  So I think there will be solutions, it just needs to be adapted also, it needs to be fairly  
**1:30:56-1:31:06:**  reasonable in terms of intensity of work, in terms of design and difficulties.  
**1:31:06-1:31:12:**  If it's a very high tree, it's dangerous because you need to climb up some ladders or whatever  
**1:31:12-1:31:15:**  and that's putting people at risk.  
**1:31:15-1:31:21:**  If it's a lower tree like I was explaining for fruits, that's less risky so people will  
**1:31:21-1:31:24:**  probably become easier.  
**1:31:24-1:31:26:**  That's really depending on the fact.  
**1:31:26-1:31:32:**  And they could have some couple of kg of walnuts at the end of the day.  
**1:31:32-1:31:35:**  That's something that is interesting as well.  
**1:31:35-1:31:40:**  Anyway, that's something that we are taking into consideration when we are discussing  
**1:31:40-1:31:44:**  with people who want to implement this kind of project.  
**1:31:44-1:31:45:**  Okay, that's good.  
**1:31:45-1:31:51:**  Very interesting idea but are you comfortable with the labor approach?  
**1:31:51-1:31:53:**  Do you see solutions in the region?  
**1:31:53-1:31:58:**  And if we see that it's not a limiting factor, we can consider it.  
**1:31:58-1:32:03:**  It really seems like it's a transition because, for example, a pioneer starting without the  
**1:32:03-1:32:10:**  infrastructure will need to find solutions and possibly invest in infrastructure himself  
**1:32:10-1:32:13:**  or herself.  
**1:32:13-1:32:18:**  But once you already have, imagine we have a landscape or like what's happening here,  
**1:32:18-1:32:23:**  let's not imagine in Portugal here, there's more and more olives, super intensive olives.  
**1:32:23-1:32:27:**  The machines are there to be rented easily.  
**1:32:27-1:32:34:**  And also they have teams that come in and that do training, do pruning, training of  
**1:32:34-1:32:35:**  the trees.  
**1:32:35-1:32:37:**  They come in, they do pruning.  
**1:32:37-1:32:39:**  I mean, in the sense it's all organized.  
**1:32:39-1:32:43:**  There's a whole industry there that's set up and so it's very easy for farmers to think,  
**1:32:43-1:32:45:**  okay, I'm going to diversify now.  
**1:32:45-1:32:49:**  And of course it could be done in a way that's planting olive trees on a riparian area to  
**1:32:49-1:32:50:**  be able to diversify.  
**1:32:50-1:32:54:**  It doesn't necessarily need to be done in the way that it's being done now because we're  
**1:32:54-1:32:58:**  actually designing systems like this here where the infrastructure is set up and the  
**1:32:58-1:33:00:**  industry is already very developed here.  
**1:33:00-1:33:03:**  And so the answers are easier.  
**1:33:03-1:33:09:**  Whereas, for example, in your situation there, the pioneer was already here, the local farmer  
**1:33:09-1:33:11:**  with the 30 hectares.  
**1:33:11-1:33:13:**  He's going to be investing in infrastructure and it's going to help a lot.  
**1:33:13-1:33:18:**  But the transition, as we're coming back to what we're saying, Elron, about going regenerative  
**1:33:18-1:33:19:**  takes time.  
**1:33:19-1:33:24:**  It's slow and it's about organizing ourselves little by little to create rural areas that  
**1:33:24-1:33:30:**  can have the capacity to manage, process tree crops and to integrate agroforestry, to develop  
**1:33:30-1:33:34:**  knowledge, communities of farmers that connect with each other and share experiences.  
**1:33:34-1:33:37:**  And I think that's a pattern we're seeing everywhere.  
**1:33:37-1:33:38:**  It takes time.  
**1:33:38-1:33:54:**  We need to understand that it's a slow process that is slower than what we are usually seeing  
**1:33:54-1:34:01:**  around and that needs to be addressed with sound decision.  
**1:34:01-1:34:07:**  The flip side of the coin is to do it at a certain scale.  
**1:34:07-1:34:15:**  So for example, imagine a project coming in and setting up a walnut orchard at a solid,  
**1:34:15-1:34:21:**  I'm talking about maybe doing it on 50 hectares or agroforestry with wide spacing, possibly  
**1:34:21-1:34:24:**  on even more hectares.  
**1:34:24-1:34:30:**  And then there is the investment in there and the investment in technicians, in consultants,  
**1:34:30-1:34:39:**  but also infrastructure to be able to carry out all of these different needs by the farmer  
**1:34:39-1:34:41:**  or by the project itself.  
**1:34:41-1:34:46:**  And that would be another approach to doing it, to reach those economies of scale, to  
**1:34:46-1:34:51:**  be able to invest, to be able to bring in teams of pruners, to have the capital and  
**1:34:51-1:34:54:**  to have the revenue in order to do so.  
**1:34:54-1:34:59:**  I don't know what you think about that, but we're seeing now with the work of companies  
**1:34:59-1:35:03:**  like Propagate Ventures, which are really organizing and professionalizing tree crop  
**1:35:03-1:35:10:**  and agroforestry systems that they will go maybe at a point where we can start to implement  
**1:35:10-1:35:13:**  these systems at a much larger scale.  
**1:35:13-1:35:17:**  But I'd love to know your point of view on that.  
**1:35:17-1:35:24:**  We must keep in mind the definition of agroforestry where actually the tree or the crop is there  
**1:35:24-1:35:27:**  to help the crop or the tree.  
**1:35:27-1:35:38:**  So once the revenue is a little bit outside of the expected results in terms of tree,  
**1:35:38-1:35:47:**  you can count on the crops to buffer it back to better levels and the opposite as well.  
**1:35:47-1:35:55:**  So I think it's also important to consider these kinds of things, that it's a system  
**1:35:55-1:36:01:**  that is diversifying the revenue of the farming operation.  
**1:36:01-1:36:09:**  And that is also helping the fact that on less profitable years, you have the other  
**1:36:09-1:36:16:**  crop that is there to take the relay on the global revenue.  
**1:36:16-1:36:18:**  So that's something that is interesting.  
**1:36:18-1:36:26:**  And what we have kept on doing in that specific plot that we were talking about here is just  
**1:36:26-1:36:38:**  common annual cropping organic, under-organized organic system like weed, like spelt, like  
**1:36:38-1:36:45:**  chicory, like sugar beet, temporary pasture, all bunch of crops that some of these crops  
**1:36:45-1:36:49:**  are really interesting in terms of revenue as well.  
**1:36:49-1:36:55:**  And they are compensating the fact that the world is not producing anything today yet.  
**1:36:55-1:37:01:**  And in a couple of years, the world will actually generate, maybe not on our case, but on the  
**1:37:01-1:37:08:**  example that you're taking, which seems to be way larger, that the expected revenue from  
**1:37:08-1:37:15:**  the world would be way more important, would be way more important compensating the fact  
**1:37:15-1:37:20:**  that you would probably lose a little bit of farmland and revenue from your crop.  
**1:37:20-1:37:23:**  And I think it's an important one as well.  
**1:37:23-1:37:30:**  And one little thing that we did also to try to even the production of the tree across  
**1:37:30-1:37:38:**  the year, because it's the bet that you are doing also is the fact that you are planting  
**1:37:38-1:37:45:**  a tree in the middle of a winter and expected that tree in five to 10 years to grow in terms  
**1:37:45-1:37:49:**  of production at a steady rate across these years.  
**1:37:49-1:37:56:**  And what we've seen since a couple of years now is severe dry spell in the spring.  
**1:37:56-1:38:03:**  And that can impact quite seriously the fact that the tree can start actually decreasing  
**1:38:03-1:38:08:**  its trend of production across the first year.  
**1:38:08-1:38:12:**  So a small trick that I wanted to share, and that's why I say it here, because I will forget  
**1:38:12-1:38:20:**  afterwards is that when we were digging the hole, it's a 40 centimeter auger that was  
**1:38:20-1:38:26:**  traveling on a straight line that was defined by an RTK tractor that ran in front of the  
**1:38:26-1:38:27:**  auger.  
**1:38:27-1:38:32:**  And that auger was digging every 8 meters, as I said.  
**1:38:32-1:38:41:**  So before planting the trees, we took a drainage pipe that we bought to a local retailer here,  
**1:38:41-1:38:45:**  and we cut section of one and a half to two meter, and we actually put that down the hole  
**1:38:45-1:38:52:**  and then put the trees and then backfill with the soil so that when it's becoming dry, like  
**1:38:52-1:38:59:**  this year probably in two, three weeks, if we don't have rain, we'll go with the tank.  
**1:38:59-1:39:02:**  And here we get directly at the root system.  
**1:39:02-1:39:07:**  So that's a system because you're just going to pour a couple of liters of water down the  
**1:39:07-1:39:14:**  pipe and it will feed directly into the rooting system and get the efficiency of the irrigation  
**1:39:14-1:39:18:**  way better than what you could get if you put it on the top.  
**1:39:18-1:39:24:**  And that's really helping the tree to guarantee a steady progression into its development  
**1:39:24-1:39:29:**  and then to meet the full production capacity as early as possible.  
**1:39:29-1:39:33:**  And then that will probably mitigate a little bit the risk in terms of overnures you were  
**1:39:33-1:39:34:**  asking.  
**1:39:34-1:39:36:**  Thomas, you wanted to add something?  
**1:39:36-1:39:43:**  Yeah, because I was thinking about your comment on the scalability of agroforestry, which  
**1:39:43-1:39:48:**  is for sure interesting and a real challenge.  
**1:39:48-1:39:56:**  I think what's also important to take into consideration is the overall heterogeneity  
**1:39:56-1:40:05:**  of farmlands and how a redesign of these farms will somehow accept or will be aligned with  
**1:40:05-1:40:06:**  agroforestry.  
**1:40:06-1:40:14:**  And in other words, when you start small scale in general, you focus on the best areas where  
**1:40:14-1:40:19:**  you're quite sure that the trees will grow and you will have a revenue out of it.  
**1:40:19-1:40:24:**  When you want to scale, you need to take, the more you scale, the more you go wide,  
**1:40:24-1:40:34:**  the more you need to take into consideration other aspects of farming, such as the overall  
**1:40:34-1:40:43:**  topography, drainage problems, soils, probably irrigation because of slopes and hills.  
**1:40:43-1:40:49:**  And I think it's also interesting to, I mean, I see two points here.  
**1:40:49-1:40:59:**  First to take, to keep the best places that are most suitable for trees production and  
**1:40:59-1:41:03:**  agroforestry and probably give the other one to focus on crop production when there's a  
**1:41:03-1:41:09:**  clear difference to be made so that you still have a diverse system that are maximizing  
**1:41:09-1:41:13:**  the production on both sides.  
**1:41:13-1:41:21:**  And on the other hand, when farmers want to scale, it's sometimes relevant to first start  
**1:41:21-1:41:26:**  with a more global redesign of the farm as well.  
**1:41:26-1:41:33:**  Design or redesign, taking into consideration all the aspects of the, again, geology, water  
**1:41:33-1:41:42:**  infrastructures, to be sure that the end product or the end design of the farm will be the  
**1:41:42-1:41:43:**  best suited.  
**1:41:43-1:41:48:**  What do you mean by global redesign?  
**1:41:48-1:41:54:**  It's something we do probably less in Europe because in Europe, like Guillaume was saying,  
**1:41:54-1:41:57:**  especially Belgium, there is a high density of population.  
**1:41:57-1:42:06:**  So the fields are really quite small and already quite scattered and already quite, you don't  
**1:42:06-1:42:09:**  have a lot of freedom to redesign.  
**1:42:09-1:42:10:**  That's what I say in Europe.  
**1:42:10-1:42:16:**  In countries where agriculture is more rangeland and large scale, like Latin America, they  
**1:42:16-1:42:23:**  have much more liberty to think out the box and to rethink about optimizing the redesign.  
**1:42:23-1:42:30:**  And that's what we do quite a lot in Argentina, for example, where we focus on aspects like  
**1:42:30-1:42:36:**  topography, drainage, irrigation.  
**1:42:36-1:42:44:**  And we try to follow these principles of key lines we design, which is a principle that  
**1:42:44-1:42:51:**  is based on a series of principles of coordinated principles and systems where the different  
**1:42:51-1:42:57:**  components of the fields are designed and organized with functional and logic areas  
**1:42:57-1:43:01:**  and purposes of the farms.  
**1:43:01-1:43:09:**  And we follow what we call the scale of permanence that starts very high level going down to  
**1:43:09-1:43:11:**  the detailed level, if I can say.  
**1:43:11-1:43:15:**  And you start with, first, you look at the climate, you understand the global context,  
**1:43:15-1:43:24:**  and then you get down to topographical aspects of the farm or maybe the geology as well.  
**1:43:24-1:43:32:**  So we would use some high precision topographical survey to generate accurate digital elevation  
**1:43:32-1:43:39:**  map to understand how the land is shaped, where the water cores are going, where are  
**1:43:39-1:43:44:**  the water accumulations area where the farms might lack water.  
**1:43:44-1:43:49:**  And then you take into consideration roads in the farms because they're already set,  
**1:43:49-1:43:54:**  you're not going to change that much the road, you can adapt but not completely change.  
**1:43:54-1:43:59:**  And then you get down to the trees, natural trees or forests that are already present.  
**1:43:59-1:44:05:**  And there you go, more details, infrastructure, constructions, then the fences, and in the  
**1:44:05-1:44:07:**  end, you look at farm practices.  
**1:44:07-1:44:16:**  I think that's an interesting strategy to follow, this scale of permanence, applying  
**1:44:16-1:44:20:**  the key lines redesign, which we do in large-scale farms in Argentina.  
**1:44:20-1:44:26:**  So the key lines principle is basically you use the control lines from your topographical  
**1:44:26-1:44:33:**  survey and you try to reach the optimised or ideal control lines in between them to  
**1:44:33-1:44:39:**  minimise the slope, but still keeping a natural slope.  
**1:44:39-1:44:45:**  And these key lines that you redesign in the farms will help you basically draw future  
**1:44:45-1:44:51:**  lines of irrigations or future roads into your farming systems in the middle of which  
**1:44:51-1:44:55:**  you will then start to say, okay, this is where I can put trees, this is where I can  
**1:44:55-1:45:03:**  really better integrate my pastures with trees or my cropping system with trees.  
**1:45:03-1:45:11:**  And it's just another step, I would say, backwards into thinking about growth for us, too, is  
**1:45:11-1:45:19:**  also to start with a more global redesign thinking instead of, I mean, before going  
**1:45:19-1:45:24:**  into the agroforestry design itself.  
**1:45:24-1:45:30:**  It's very interesting that you mentioned the difference between the European context and  
**1:45:30-1:45:35:**  as you mentioned now the South American context, because the landscape that we have is different  
**1:45:35-1:45:40:**  and it forces us to play with agroforestry in this case in a different way.  
**1:45:40-1:45:43:**  We have to be interacting with it in a different way.  
**1:45:43-1:45:47:**  Yeah, this is something that we've, it's very interesting in our interviews because we're  
**1:45:47-1:45:50:**  interviewing people from all around the place.  
**1:45:50-1:45:56:**  And you can see that the context is like the organisation of the land and ownership of  
**1:45:56-1:46:01:**  land as well, which is another huge topic, which I don't think we shouldn't go into this  
**1:46:01-1:46:05:**  because I've already taken too much of your time.  
**1:46:05-1:46:10:**  But it has such big influence on the type of system that can be implemented.  
**1:46:10-1:46:12:**  And again, we go back to the same thing.  
**1:46:12-1:46:14:**  This is so context dependent.  
**1:46:14-1:46:15:**  Yeah, exactly.  
**1:46:15-1:46:16:**  Yeah.  
**1:46:16-1:46:19:**  And agroforestry again is a large definition.  
**1:46:19-1:46:25:**  What we do or try to do in Latin America is not exactly what I like cropping.  
**1:46:25-1:46:27:**  It's not alley cropping what we're doing.  
**1:46:27-1:46:35:**  It's more like building biodiversity islands or using trees as natural fences or windbreaks.  
**1:46:35-1:46:42:**  But always with the idea to build complexity and biodiversity.  
**1:46:42-1:46:51:**  For instance, we've been planting a lot of willow and poplar trees into lowlands, where  
**1:46:51-1:46:57:**  there's accumulation of water, because they are trees totally adapted to these humid areas.  
**1:46:57-1:47:03:**  But also they are quick growing, I mean, high biomass production trees.  
**1:47:03-1:47:08:**  So they can be used at some point also for biomass production, if it makes sense.  
**1:47:08-1:47:15:**  And then we try to mix these species with other local species like gum tree, eucalyptus,  
**1:47:15-1:47:17:**  acacia or others.  
**1:47:17-1:47:27:**  And what's interesting also is the nursery story in this context, because trees and agroforestry  
**1:47:27-1:47:31:**  is really far from being mainstream in countries like Argentina.  
**1:47:31-1:47:33:**  It's very the beginning.  
**1:47:33-1:47:42:**  So when you want to plant large amount of trees, you are struggling a bit finding seedlings  
**1:47:42-1:47:44:**  or cuttings.  
**1:47:44-1:47:51:**  And what we did in both of the farms where we are working is we've been basically starting  
**1:47:51-1:47:56:**  from scratch creating a nursery with irrigation so that the farm the farms can already have  
**1:47:56-1:48:01:**  their own seedlings and cuttings production themselves on the farms.  
**1:48:01-1:48:08:**  It really reduced the cost of investment on the medium terms before long term.  
**1:48:08-1:48:13:**  And the interesting story is that when you have a nursery, then you are sure you're going  
**1:48:13-1:48:17:**  to be planting like every year because you renew the nursery, you've invested with irrigation  
**1:48:17-1:48:19:**  and everything.  
**1:48:19-1:48:24:**  And then you also create somehow a potential source of revenue because you can start selling  
**1:48:24-1:48:29:**  seedlings and cuttings to neighbor farms because you have the infrastructure.  
**1:48:29-1:48:34:**  So that's also an interesting story I wanted to share is that when you have the scale and  
**1:48:34-1:48:41:**  the size and you want to go agroforestry, then it's probably worth it to have your own  
**1:48:41-1:48:44:**  nursery at some point.  
**1:48:44-1:48:47:**  And you get the knowledge because yes, exactly.  
**1:48:47-1:48:52:**  And you can make more mistakes easily because you can start much, you can test much more  
**1:48:52-1:48:54:**  species on your nursery.  
**1:48:54-1:48:59:**  It costs way less and quickly you say, okay, that species, that variety basically does  
**1:48:59-1:49:00:**  not grow.  
**1:49:00-1:49:01:**  I can see that.  
**1:49:01-1:49:07:**  So I quickly remove it and you do your own selection and you adapt your system in terms  
**1:49:07-1:49:10:**  of variety to your context.  
**1:49:10-1:49:18:**  At Massey Farm in Greece, we save thousands by planting our own nursery, even though we  
**1:49:18-1:49:23:**  made so many mistakes by having sometimes trays of trees that had half full, you know,  
**1:49:23-1:49:28:**  maybe we lost whole trays, but still it was worth it because it was such a huge saving.  
**1:49:28-1:49:30:**  And that's fascinating.  
**1:49:30-1:49:36:**  And it shows the potential of agroforestry or let's say of, there's a lot of creativity  
**1:49:36-1:49:43:**  and a lot of different opportunities for farmers there in terms of diversifying.  
**1:49:43-1:49:48:**  And yeah, and very interesting that you're, I would love to hear so much more about these  
**1:49:48-1:49:53:**  experiences in South America, but I think we're reaching at a point now where it's quite,  
**1:49:53-1:49:58:**  I've taken a lot of your time and I don't want to take much more.  
**1:49:58-1:49:59:**  I want to be respectful.  
**1:49:59-1:50:07:**  And maybe that's an opportunity for a conversation in the future to come back on and to talk  
**1:50:07-1:50:13:**  to this time shift, get some more feedback as to what's happening in Belgium in your  
**1:50:13-1:50:18:**  plot, but also understand what's happening in the projects that you've been working internationally.  
**1:50:18-1:50:23:**  And I think there's a lot of interesting stuff that you're going to be able to share with  
**1:50:23-1:50:24:**  us.  
**1:50:24-1:50:26:**  It's always a pleasure.  
**1:50:26-1:50:32:**  It's fascinating sharing experience and ideas and yeah, congrats again for the podcast.  
**1:50:32-1:50:36:**  It's super exciting listening to all these stories and feedbacks.  
**1:50:36-1:50:43:**  So yeah, keep on doing that longterm again and happy to reconnect again.  
**1:50:43-1:50:49:**  We'll reach some, once we reach the fruit production, for example, in Walnut trees.  
**1:50:49-1:50:50:**  Yeah.  
**1:50:50-1:50:53:**  Thank you so much for making it this far.  
**1:50:53-1:50:56:**  I hope you enjoyed the interview as much as we did.

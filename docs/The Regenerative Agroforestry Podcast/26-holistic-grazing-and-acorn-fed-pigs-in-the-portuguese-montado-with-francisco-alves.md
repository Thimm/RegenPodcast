### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sun, 08 Aug 2021 15:19:29)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:46:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:46-0:00:53:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we interviewed Francisco Alves from Portugal.  
**0:00:53-0:01:01:**  Francisco is the manager and owner of Herdade de San Luis in Portugal where he manages 700  
**0:01:01-0:01:04:**  hectares of montado.  
**0:01:04-0:01:09:**  This is a very interesting episode because not only are we delving into one of the most  
**0:01:09-0:01:18:**  traditional and old agroforestry systems still alive in Europe which is the montado savanna,  
**0:01:18-0:01:26:**  but on top of this Francisco started holistic grazing his animals amongst the system.  
**0:01:26-0:01:35:**  And so what we have is a combination of agroforestry and dynamic grazing system together which  
**0:01:35-0:01:39:**  is fascinating for us to get into.  
**0:01:39-0:01:42:**  So I hope that you enjoy this episode.  
**0:01:42-0:01:45:**  Okay hello Francisco welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:45-0:01:49:**  Hello Dimitri and thank you for the invitation.  
**0:01:49-0:01:52:**  My pleasure.  
**0:01:52-0:01:59:**  So I thought that maybe we could start with a quick intro as to how you got into farming.  
**0:01:59-0:02:03:**  What's the story of your farm?  
**0:02:03-0:02:15:**  So the story of the farm beginning a few generations ago with my grand grandfather and my family  
**0:02:15-0:02:25:**  was a family of farmers and my parents work all life in the farm and I start working the  
**0:02:25-0:02:29:**  farm at 20 years old.  
**0:02:29-0:02:43:**  And at the beginning the child I always like the farm like animals and in the middle of  
**0:02:43-0:02:54:**  the college I decide to don't make the whole course, the whole college and to do different  
**0:02:54-0:03:04:**  formations in different areas of farm and start early to work in the farm.  
**0:03:04-0:03:18:**  My life in the farm beginning is like this at the 20 and work with my father the first  
**0:03:18-0:03:30:**  years and then I like the life of the farm and then now I work in the farm at about I'm  
**0:03:30-0:03:37:**  39 years old so at 19 years I work here.  
**0:03:37-0:03:43:**  Okay so the farm started was in your family's hands generations ago.  
**0:03:43-0:03:54:**  Yes the family of my father are a family of farmers and started this farm with my grandfather  
**0:03:54-0:04:06:**  where in this time horses, cows, a little number of cows and pigs.  
**0:04:06-0:04:16:**  But in 17 years ago the farms changed a lot and when the grandfather passed the farm for  
**0:04:16-0:04:26:**  my father they changed everything, they continued with the cows and with the pigs because in  
**0:04:26-0:04:31:**  the time of my father the cows and the horses are to work the land.  
**0:04:31-0:04:40:**  Yes and so the people don't eat meat of the cow, the meat is for work and eat very meat  
**0:04:40-0:04:54:**  of the pigs but with the times all change and in the time of my father the production  
**0:04:54-0:05:07:**  of cows increased a lot and now I am in the transition of a number of cows to a different  
**0:05:07-0:05:10:**  species now in the farm.  
**0:05:10-0:05:21:**  So in the last 90 years the farm has been passed for three different management.  
**0:05:21-0:05:27:**  Okay I think throughout the interview we'll get into these changes because this is what  
**0:05:27-0:05:33:**  we want to understand right is like why these changes happen and etc but before that maybe  
**0:05:33-0:05:38:**  we can delve a bit more into understanding your farm.  
**0:05:38-0:05:44:**  So could you tell us a bit about the scale you're working at, what soil you're on, what  
**0:05:44-0:05:47:**  system you're on.  
**0:05:47-0:05:57:**  Yes the farm, we're a farm of montado, the Spanish is a farm with a lot of trees, corn  
**0:05:57-0:06:07:**  trees, the home oak and the oak hole, it's in the name of Portuguese is azinara and subreiro,  
**0:06:07-0:06:14:**  subreiro is the tree that you have to improve the cork and the corn and so it's an aggressive  
**0:06:14-0:06:17:**  opus ristum system.  
**0:06:17-0:06:26:**  We only end in the 700 hectares, we only have 25 of flat area with no trees, the most of  
**0:06:26-0:06:36:**  the farm is a lot of trees, we have a density, average density of 14 trees per hectare but  
**0:06:36-0:06:43:**  we have areas that we pass the 17 trees per hectare.  
**0:06:43-0:06:51:**  With different water lines in the farm, we are in the microclimb, we are in Lentejo near  
**0:06:51-0:07:04:**  the centre of the north south of Portugal, it's a microclimb, it's a different Lentejo  
**0:07:04-0:07:12:**  because Lentejo is an area of very long landscape, flat area and the farm are in the microclimb  
**0:07:12-0:07:24:**  with the most degliff areas with a lot of trees and so we have a very complex system  
**0:07:24-0:07:39:**  with very trees, rain much more than 50 kilometres more south in our place, rain a little more.  
**0:07:39-0:07:45:**  So it's a complex system, it's a montado, it's an aggressive opus ristum system, you  
**0:07:45-0:07:53:**  can do the animals, you have the part of the florist, so you can do everything you imagine  
**0:07:53-0:07:58:**  here.  
**0:07:58-0:08:06:**  What you want to do, it happens, if you want to do cereals in a small land, a flat area,  
**0:08:06-0:08:15:**  you can do it, if you can put more trees, do fruit trees, management animals, different  
**0:08:15-0:08:17:**  species of animals, you can do it.  
**0:08:17-0:08:28:**  It's a good farm because you have different kind of things that it supports.  
**0:08:28-0:08:29:**  Very interesting.  
**0:08:29-0:08:35:**  Just confirming one detail, you said 40 or 14 at the beginning, it was 4-0, right?  
**0:08:35-0:08:36:**  4-0.  
**0:08:36-0:08:41:**  And what's the soil like?  
**0:08:41-0:08:45:**  Would you consider it for the region, is it quite high quality soil?  
**0:08:45-0:08:57:**  Yes, you have two different, the farm is divided in one row and you have 315 hectares of one  
**0:08:57-0:09:07:**  side and the other of another side and they are a little different because of the right  
**0:09:07-0:09:18:**  side of the road, the farm have more the clives, more mountains and more density of trees.  
**0:09:18-0:09:23:**  So the soil is not happening so much sun.  
**0:09:23-0:09:34:**  We don't, the management of the animals, we can do it different because you can't put,  
**0:09:34-0:09:39:**  it's very difficult to create a good impact when you have a lot of trees.  
**0:09:39-0:09:42:**  So the soil is more complex here.  
**0:09:42-0:09:50:**  You have more weeds to grow, you have more difficult to put more organic matter or do  
**0:09:50-0:09:55:**  correct management in the part of the tree.  
**0:09:55-0:10:06:**  But the complex of our system is that, because in this part you have a lot of corn, a lot  
**0:10:06-0:10:15:**  of food in the winter that the trees give you, a lot of shadow in the winter, in the  
**0:10:15-0:10:22:**  summer and a lot of, it's like a home in the winter for the animals because it's amazing.  
**0:10:22-0:10:26:**  You have good things and bad things in this context.  
**0:10:26-0:10:34:**  And the other side is a more flat area, more easy to work, more easy to put animals, more  
**0:10:34-0:10:40:**  easy to do a great impact, more rest in the soil.  
**0:10:40-0:10:45:**  So we have the two scenarios in the farm.  
**0:10:45-0:10:53:**  The soil is a clay, yes.  
**0:10:53-0:11:05:**  And in the best part of the farm and the other farm is a more acid soil with more rocks.  
**0:11:05-0:11:11:**  It's a less profiled soil and so it's more poor.  
**0:11:11-0:11:13:**  Okay, more poor.  
**0:11:13-0:11:14:**  Okay, nice.  
**0:11:14-0:11:15:**  Very interesting.  
**0:11:15-0:11:20:**  And so maybe we could understand a bit better what you're producing.  
**0:11:20-0:11:25:**  So we talked about earlier on in our other conversation, you said cows, there's pigs,  
**0:11:25-0:11:26:**  there's goats.  
**0:11:26-0:11:30:**  Could you give us a bit of a quantity maybe just so we know how many animals are on your  
**0:11:30-0:11:31:**  landscape?  
**0:11:31-0:11:42:**  For you to understand, when I start, more or less the interest for generative agriculture,  
**0:11:42-0:11:47:**  we change the species or we increase the species.  
**0:11:47-0:11:49:**  We don't change, but we increase.  
**0:11:49-0:11:56:**  When I start in the farm, only have pigs and cows.  
**0:11:56-0:12:05:**  And when I learn about the principles of generative agriculture and I know what the potential  
**0:12:05-0:12:09:**  of the farm, I increase the chips and the goats.  
**0:12:09-0:12:18:**  And now we management for different species because the farm wants to want it.  
**0:12:18-0:12:24:**  I think it's the correct way to management the farm because we have a lot of different  
**0:12:24-0:12:29:**  pieces of plants and the cows don't eat all of them.  
**0:12:29-0:12:38:**  And we have lots of dry matter that the cows don't eat and we increase the different species  
**0:12:38-0:12:47:**  to win more kilos with these different plants that the cows don't eat.  
**0:12:47-0:13:05:**  So now we have 230 cows, we have 70 goats, 120 mothers of pigs and 30 sheep.  
**0:13:05-0:13:09:**  30 sheep, okay.  
**0:13:09-0:13:12:**  We are in the balance of the different species.  
**0:13:12-0:13:16:**  I want to grow in the chips and in the goats.  
**0:13:16-0:13:24:**  I think the balance of the cows and the chips, we are already in the correct number.  
**0:13:24-0:13:33:**  Then I want to increase the chips and the goats because we have a heterogeneous farm.  
**0:13:33-0:13:44:**  It's not the same in all sense, they are very different contest in the farm.  
**0:13:44-0:13:49:**  And I think the chips are doing amazing job.  
**0:13:49-0:13:59:**  The goats too because it's hit everything that another species don't eat.  
**0:13:59-0:14:10:**  For the fire, the fire is an amazing animal to eat a lot of biomass that we produce.  
**0:14:10-0:14:19:**  I want to keep with the four different species and perhaps in the future, I want to put birds  
**0:14:19-0:14:23:**  to chicken eggs or pasture chicken.  
**0:14:23-0:14:25:**  Very interesting.  
**0:14:25-0:14:34:**  I think the farm support everything and beneficiate with different species, not project the farm.  
**0:14:34-0:14:38:**  I think it's the way.  
**0:14:38-0:14:41:**  Interesting.  
**0:14:41-0:14:50:**  If I understood correctly, you rotate these animals following the techniques of Alan Savory  
**0:14:50-0:14:53:**  and holistic management, right?  
**0:14:53-0:15:04:**  Yes, I made a different course that I tell you and what I learned is you have to respect  
**0:15:04-0:15:08:**  the precipiles of the Christianity of the Greek culture.  
**0:15:08-0:15:12:**  And so we have a different species.  
**0:15:12-0:15:23:**  We have to have the most profit in the land with the capacity of the different species.  
**0:15:23-0:15:32:**  So in the cows, we do the rotational management with the intensity at some seasons of the  
**0:15:32-0:15:34:**  year because in the summer it's impossible.  
**0:15:34-0:15:35:**  It's 14 degrees.  
**0:15:35-0:15:39:**  You can't move the cows three times per day.  
**0:15:39-0:15:40:**  It's a crazy thing.  
**0:15:40-0:15:46:**  You have the protein is very low on the pasture.  
**0:15:46-0:15:47:**  I think it's not in my contest.  
**0:15:47-0:15:52:**  I think it's not the better way to do it.  
**0:15:52-0:15:57:**  And the goats, now we are working the water lines.  
**0:15:57-0:16:06:**  We do the electric fence near the water lines and they go forward and back.  
**0:16:06-0:16:13:**  And I have a lot of grumbles in the farm because the water in the soil.  
**0:16:13-0:16:18:**  And so the goats are amazing for eating the grumbles.  
**0:16:18-0:16:28:**  And we work with the goats and with very, very good results because in the past, in  
**0:16:28-0:16:34:**  the time of my father, when we only have the two different species, the cows and the pigs,  
**0:16:34-0:16:43:**  my father don't ever till the soil, don't put pesticides, don't do anything bad for  
**0:16:43-0:16:44:**  the land.  
**0:16:44-0:16:47:**  But the management is a traditional management.  
**0:16:47-0:16:55:**  And the cows are in the big fence with no impact in the soil.  
**0:16:55-0:17:03:**  And he has four different groups of cows that are pregnant, that are not pregnant, maybe  
**0:17:03-0:17:05:**  with the little cows.  
**0:17:05-0:17:13:**  And so when we start with this system, we put all together and it's very easy to understand  
**0:17:13-0:17:18:**  the benefits of this management because you have a lot of rest in the fence.  
**0:17:18-0:17:30:**  You move one day in one fence, the cows, we work in the montado under the trees.  
**0:17:30-0:17:34:**  We can do it one day, seven hectares.  
**0:17:34-0:17:39:**  It's the average inside the montado and the flat areas.  
**0:17:39-0:17:43:**  You can do 0.3 hectares per day.  
**0:17:43-0:17:47:**  It depends on the season.  
**0:17:47-0:17:54:**  The chips, we start because my father 20 years ago started different management of the pigs  
**0:17:54-0:18:05:**  and he projects a maternity system who allows to a mother of pig have 800 square meters  
**0:18:05-0:18:07:**  for one mother.  
**0:18:07-0:18:20:**  And so my father put the mother pig in this box and stay two months with the piglets.  
**0:18:20-0:18:31:**  But in summer when the box are very time at rest, we have a lot of grass, dry grass and  
**0:18:31-0:18:34:**  the pigs don't hit the dry grass.  
**0:18:34-0:18:38:**  So we are very afraid of the fires.  
**0:18:38-0:18:47:**  And so we start with the chips to eat, to clean the summer maternity of the pigs in  
**0:18:47-0:18:55:**  summer and to improve more quality of the soil, to fertilize the soil.  
**0:18:55-0:19:00:**  The pigs we have 220, we change the management too.  
**0:19:00-0:19:06:**  We start with two groups of mothers.  
**0:19:06-0:19:10:**  Now we have three because with a small group we manage them better.  
**0:19:10-0:19:17:**  We control better all the situation.  
**0:19:17-0:19:20:**  We don't buy animals in other farms.  
**0:19:20-0:19:26:**  We made our own genetic.  
**0:19:26-0:19:37:**  We want only animals that have the capacity to have a good conditional cooperation in  
**0:19:37-0:19:39:**  the only heat grass.  
**0:19:39-0:19:46:**  We don't animals who need to depends off supplements of flowers.  
**0:19:46-0:19:48:**  We don't want it.  
**0:19:48-0:20:00:**  So a few years ago we started to choose only the animals who have the capacity to eat grass  
**0:20:00-0:20:01:**  and the corn.  
**0:20:01-0:20:09:**  In summer we made the different mixes of pumpkins, surrogate grass, mustard, different things  
**0:20:09-0:20:19:**  that allows us to do a rotational management and the mothers heat this mix.  
**0:20:19-0:20:29:**  We buy potato, soup product or anything like that to feed them in the summer.  
**0:20:29-0:20:34:**  The only stage that we give a supplement is a mix of cereal.  
**0:20:34-0:20:46:**  It's when they have the piglets because you imagine eight piglets with the mother and  
**0:20:46-0:20:51:**  it's a crazy thing for the pig.  
**0:20:51-0:20:57:**  She has a lot of space but she needs help in these two months.  
**0:20:57-0:21:06:**  And then we keep the pigs and we start to rotate the fence like the cows.  
**0:21:06-0:21:15:**  They go behind the cows or in the summer they go to these different mix.  
**0:21:15-0:21:24:**  I want to create a balance with different species but the correct number is the number  
**0:21:24-0:21:32:**  that tells me that I don't depend on to buy food in the exterior.  
**0:21:32-0:21:40:**  So I think I'm now in the balance with the cows and the pigs and I want to grow in the  
**0:21:40-0:21:42:**  other two species.  
**0:21:42-0:21:51:**  A few years ago what's happened is we have a lot of sanitary problems in the pigs.  
**0:21:51-0:21:56:**  Our prophylactic plant is very very heavy.  
**0:21:56-0:21:59:**  We have to vaccinate every month.  
**0:21:59-0:22:04:**  It was a crazy crazy thing.  
**0:22:04-0:22:13:**  One time I have 40 mothers of piglets that are not productive for abortions or they hit  
**0:22:13-0:22:17:**  the piglets or they are very skinny.  
**0:22:17-0:22:30:**  I tell my father, today this group of mothers we put in the most distant fence of the farm  
**0:22:30-0:22:37:**  where they have corn and they put it with three males and three months later we go there  
**0:22:37-0:22:45:**  and view what is pregnant or not pregnant and what is not pregnant we fed them and sell  
**0:22:45-0:22:48:**  to the hams.  
**0:22:48-0:22:59:**  And three months later we put in the coral to see what happened and 38 are pregnant.  
**0:22:59-0:23:06:**  So in this moment the management in the farm changed completely.  
**0:23:06-0:23:16:**  We don't in the last seven, eight years do any intervention in the pigs, we don't vaccinate  
**0:23:16-0:23:17:**  with nothing.  
**0:23:17-0:23:27:**  Only rotate the animals, only give space to the animals and so the change is the hate  
**0:23:27-0:23:29:**  for hating.  
**0:23:29-0:23:31:**  It changed a lot.  
**0:23:31-0:23:34:**  It's the day for the night.  
**0:23:34-0:23:38:**  We don't do any nothing, nothing.  
**0:23:38-0:23:45:**  Rotate animals, keep the animals who are genetic better with the morphology.  
**0:23:45-0:23:51:**  Our pigs compared with the Spanish pigs are much more little with much more capacity to  
**0:23:51-0:24:04:**  put fat and the Spanish pigs are a lot bigger with the capacity to put muscle.  
**0:24:04-0:24:07:**  Our pigs are more...  
**0:24:07-0:24:18:**  How do you say it in Portuguese?  
**0:24:18-0:24:19:**  Not so big.  
**0:24:19-0:24:20:**  Not so big.  
**0:24:20-0:24:21:**  Not so big.  
**0:24:21-0:24:22:**  That's small.  
**0:24:22-0:24:23:**  Okay.  
**0:24:23-0:24:24:**  Yeah, small.  
**0:24:24-0:24:25:**  Sorry.  
**0:24:25-0:24:26:**  Sorry my English.  
**0:24:26-0:24:31:**  Yeah, no, for me I wanted to, I saw on a lot of your resources online and also on the  
**0:24:31-0:24:36:**  Ray Gerens platform that you're really using the pigs to prepare the soil as well.  
**0:24:36-0:24:41:**  If we look at the functions of the animals, you're using the cows to graze the grass,  
**0:24:41-0:24:44:**  especially in the winter and spring.  
**0:24:44-0:24:49:**  The goats and the sheep to do more impact on shrubs and on brambles, et cetera.  
**0:24:49-0:24:55:**  You're also using the pigs to use, of course, all the whole milk and the cocoa producing  
**0:24:55-0:24:59:**  acorns but also you're using them to work the soil, right?  
**0:24:59-0:25:04:**  Maybe you could tell us a bit more about why you're using them in this way, how it went  
**0:25:04-0:25:08:**  for you, what were some of the results there?  
**0:25:08-0:25:14:**  I went to have four different species now because I went to tell, I have four different  
**0:25:14-0:25:20:**  species but because they allowed me to do things that one species don't allow.  
**0:25:20-0:25:32:**  So the pigs, the crazy thing with our farm is a pig farm.  
**0:25:32-0:25:40:**  We have different species but the farm is a farm with lots of acorn production.  
**0:25:40-0:25:42:**  So it's a pig farm.  
**0:25:42-0:25:53:**  And so the management that my father designed of the materialities is unique in Portugal.  
**0:25:53-0:25:59:**  Many people go to the farm to view the materiality system.  
**0:25:59-0:26:05:**  And what we are trying to do, I start with the pigs and then we go to the other species,  
**0:26:05-0:26:13:**  it's to tell the people that the pig can do regenerative impact in the system because  
**0:26:13-0:26:20:**  the pigs in Portugal are very, in Portugal and I think in the rest of the world, the  
**0:26:20-0:26:24:**  people don't like the pigs.  
**0:26:24-0:26:29:**  The people think the pigs do always negative impact in the system.  
**0:26:29-0:26:32:**  So we want to prove the opposite.  
**0:26:32-0:26:38:**  We want to work with the pigs with the correct way that the pigs are one species who do part  
**0:26:38-0:26:46:**  of the ecosystem and you can get very beneficial when you management correctly.  
**0:26:46-0:26:49:**  And so we start with a different experience.  
**0:26:49-0:26:58:**  I start with a small area then I put the pigs to do the impact in the first layer of the  
**0:26:58-0:27:07:**  soil and then I seed after the pigs and I watch what's happening.  
**0:27:07-0:27:10:**  The seeds go very, very well.  
**0:27:10-0:27:20:**  And one year after I do a bigger study with three hectares, I put 18 pigs one day when  
**0:27:20-0:27:29:**  they rain a lot and in one day to 12 hours of impact, it's good for seed.  
**0:27:29-0:27:42:**  And in another fence, near this fence, in another fence with the same area, I seed with  
**0:27:42-0:27:52:**  the direct seed and it was amazing the difference of production went with the impact of the  
**0:27:52-0:27:55:**  pigs and another of the direct seed.  
**0:27:55-0:28:01:**  So I think I don't tell the pigs are better than the direct seed.  
**0:28:01-0:28:12:**  No, I don't want to tell you this, but I want to, it's more to show that if you work  
**0:28:12-0:28:17:**  correctly with the pigs, you can do amazing things.  
**0:28:17-0:28:22:**  You can do a great impact in the brambles.  
**0:28:22-0:28:33:**  You can't remove the layer of the trees because the core tree goes down a very, very number  
**0:28:33-0:28:35:**  of leaves.  
**0:28:35-0:28:36:**  Sorry.  
**0:28:36-0:28:38:**  Yeah, leaves.  
**0:28:38-0:28:48:**  Sorry, sorry, leaves, corn goes on a lot of leaves into the soil covering this is difficult  
**0:28:48-0:28:56:**  to grow grass in the, if you put the pigs in correctly, they disturb the first layer  
**0:28:56-0:29:00:**  of the soil and the grass happen.  
**0:29:00-0:29:07:**  So we can use the pigs for different ways.  
**0:29:07-0:29:13:**  We can put the pigs behind the cows and the pigs three or four days behind the cows and  
**0:29:13-0:29:23:**  the pigs broken the manure of the cows helps to disintegrate, help you to discompact the  
**0:29:23-0:29:29:**  soil when the soil, I think it's amazing what the pigs can do it.  
**0:29:29-0:29:38:**  And I don't know any species, neither the cow, the goat or the sheep who have the capacity  
**0:29:38-0:29:43:**  to produce so much with so little.  
**0:29:43-0:29:51:**  What I'm trying to tell it, the porco leche, it's similar to Ibaric pig, but when a genetic  
**0:29:51-0:30:01:**  more ancestral and not modified because the Portuguese farmers who have the pigs have  
**0:30:01-0:30:05:**  small productions and don't modify the genetic to industrial.  
**0:30:05-0:30:09:**  And so the genetic are very, very ancestral.  
**0:30:09-0:30:11:**  And so the animal is amazing.  
**0:30:11-0:30:18:**  They can produce with four degrees to 14 degrees in the fields.  
**0:30:18-0:30:25:**  You don't have to do nothing and with the minimum of feed, the minimum of inputs that  
**0:30:25-0:30:28:**  you give to the animal, they produce a lot.  
**0:30:28-0:30:29:**  It's amazing thing.  
**0:30:29-0:30:36:**  And the capacity to put kilos with the corn and the magnetic products that you give is  
**0:30:36-0:30:40:**  a unique thing.  
**0:30:40-0:30:46:**  Today's everything talk about the more meat.  
**0:30:46-0:30:57:**  It's the infiltrate grass, but the genetic of the pig allows that the animal do it with  
**0:30:57-0:30:59:**  only with grass and the corn.  
**0:30:59-0:31:01:**  For me, it's an amazing thing.  
**0:31:01-0:31:02:**  Yeah.  
**0:31:02-0:31:03:**  For sure.  
**0:31:03-0:31:10:**  If you give a little of certain, it's an amazing animal.  
**0:31:10-0:31:18:**  The goats, we work with Portuguese breeds, the goats are Portuguese breed, the sheep  
**0:31:18-0:31:25:**  are Portuguese breed, black marino, the sheep is black marino, it's a rustic breed.  
**0:31:25-0:31:36:**  And the goat is a Portuguese breed too, who have the capacity of milk and meat.  
**0:31:36-0:31:41:**  But we only keep the animals to the meat.  
**0:31:41-0:31:49:**  We don't want animals with a lot of production of milk because it is a problem when you keep  
**0:31:49-0:31:50:**  the little goats.  
**0:31:50-0:32:00:**  So we management and we choose the animals who have the capacity to produce more meat.  
**0:32:00-0:32:13:**  In the cows, we have the base of our cows is a Portuguese breed too, very rustic with  
**0:32:13-0:32:20:**  the capacity to cross with everything you want and they don't have problems in the burst.  
**0:32:20-0:32:23:**  They can cross with everything.  
**0:32:23-0:32:31:**  And we put the angles to do a better quality of meat and we put bulls cross with BBB, the  
**0:32:31-0:32:45:**  blue-blonde cows to give more muscovy, to give more morphology, more growth, more fast.  
**0:32:45-0:32:54:**  And now we are in this stage, we only keep with our animals.  
**0:32:54-0:33:02:**  The sheep is the only thing I buy to another farm because I have a small group.  
**0:33:02-0:33:08:**  But this is the difference management than we do in the farm.  
**0:33:08-0:33:18:**  It's working to these different species and try to recover the soil, try to do more productive  
**0:33:18-0:33:22:**  and more profit things with the different species.  
**0:33:22-0:33:30:**  And the results, it's happening.  
**0:33:30-0:33:40:**  If I tell you the easy thing to understand, I increase more two species in the farm and  
**0:33:40-0:33:45:**  I don't put more people to work.  
**0:33:45-0:33:56:**  So I think this is the beginning of understanding the capacity of the farm allows us to do more  
**0:33:56-0:34:04:**  profit things with the same work.  
**0:34:04-0:34:09:**  If you have to do two or three new fence, we do it.  
**0:34:09-0:34:23:**  But the results in the kilos of the production of the new species pay the new infrastructure.  
**0:34:23-0:34:30:**  And the farm benefit with this because you don't have to put the tractor to cut the rumbles  
**0:34:30-0:34:38:**  or you have the small risk of fires.  
**0:34:38-0:34:51:**  When you start to view our farming in a different dynamic, I think I can put more different  
**0:34:51-0:35:01:**  species because you have space, you have lots of pasture that stay in the farm year after  
**0:35:01-0:35:08:**  year in different areas that the cows don't eat.  
**0:35:08-0:35:10:**  So you think you could increase the amount of cows?  
**0:35:10-0:35:11:**  Is that what you're saying?  
**0:35:11-0:35:16:**  You could have more cows, more animals?  
**0:35:16-0:35:18:**  I don't want to increase the number of cows.  
**0:35:18-0:35:25:**  I want to increase the number of the other species because what I'm trying to do in the  
**0:35:25-0:35:34:**  farm is the montage of farms like our farm have a problem in Portugal and Spain.  
**0:35:34-0:35:45:**  In Portugal, these appear per year, 5,000 of trees in Portugal, of corn trees in Portugal,  
**0:35:45-0:35:50:**  5,000 of hectares disappeared every year in Portugal.  
**0:35:50-0:35:52:**  So it's a crazy thing.  
**0:35:52-0:35:58:**  The certification, bad management, a lot of things.  
**0:35:58-0:36:09:**  And so I don't want to put my farm like I want to increase the possible numbers of the  
**0:36:09-0:36:16:**  young trees that the farm produces.  
**0:36:16-0:36:23:**  Some people can tell, no, but 30 or 40 trees per hectare is good.  
**0:36:23-0:36:27:**  Yes, but we don't have the young trees.  
**0:36:27-0:36:28:**  You understand me?  
**0:36:28-0:36:30:**  You only have trees with four or five years.  
**0:36:30-0:36:33:**  We don't have trees with 20 years.  
**0:36:33-0:36:38:**  And the old trees that we have with the farm have 200 years.  
**0:36:38-0:36:45:**  So we have to start now to change very fast the things to have more and more young trees  
**0:36:45-0:36:52:**  because we don't know how much time the old trees are alive.  
**0:36:52-0:36:59:**  So I want to do the things to increase the much possible of trees in the farm.  
**0:36:59-0:37:05:**  So I think the cows are in a good number.  
**0:37:05-0:37:13:**  It's much more important to increase the number of chips to enter behind the trees and do  
**0:37:13-0:37:18:**  a good impact and the correct impact in this soil.  
**0:37:18-0:37:24:**  But also, the more oaks you have, cork oaks you have, and the more ilex oaks you have,  
**0:37:24-0:37:27:**  also the more acorns you're going to have for your pigs, right?  
**0:37:27-0:37:28:**  And that's one of your main production.  
**0:37:28-0:37:29:**  Yes.  
**0:37:29-0:37:32:**  And the corn, I have amazing thing.  
**0:37:32-0:37:33:**  All the species eat the corn.  
**0:37:33-0:37:34:**  The cows eat the corn.  
**0:37:34-0:37:35:**  The corn.  
**0:37:35-0:37:38:**  Yes, all of the species.  
**0:37:38-0:37:44:**  If you put chickens, the chickens eat the corn behind the pigs because the pigs broken  
**0:37:44-0:37:53:**  the corn and the small pieces, the old birds and the old animals who live in the farm like  
**0:37:53-0:37:55:**  montado eat corn.  
**0:37:55-0:38:04:**  Corn is a dry matter, it will follow free in the soil for all animals.  
**0:38:04-0:38:06:**  So it's amazing.  
**0:38:06-0:38:08:**  It is really amazing.  
**0:38:08-0:38:09:**  It's so rich.  
**0:38:09-0:38:17:**  It's such a rich food full of different micro elements, proteins, etc.  
**0:38:17-0:38:19:**  It's very fats as well.  
**0:38:19-0:38:21:**  It's very interesting food source.  
**0:38:21-0:38:31:**  Yes, I think another thing that I don't understand why people don't start with this kind of agriculture  
**0:38:31-0:38:35:**  in Portugal is Portugal have everything.  
**0:38:35-0:38:40:**  The agro-civil-posterites system that you have in Portugal, every guy in the world want  
**0:38:40-0:38:41:**  to have it.  
**0:38:41-0:38:48:**  The Australian guys, what's happening in Australia, they put trees in the system.  
**0:38:48-0:38:52:**  Very trees, very number of trees.  
**0:38:52-0:39:01:**  In Brazil, when the people want to put a correct number and the correct species and the correct  
**0:39:01-0:39:06:**  management in the place, there are very, very number of trees.  
**0:39:06-0:39:21:**  So in Portugal, we have the perfect scenario for this kind of multi-species and the farm  
**0:39:21-0:39:24:**  projects with these different management.  
**0:39:24-0:39:32:**  So I think you have to do it for the good of all.  
**0:39:32-0:39:38:**  You said right now that you would like to have more and more trees.  
**0:39:38-0:39:42:**  And I understand that one of the reasons is the food produced and the other one is also  
**0:39:42-0:39:45:**  rejuvenating your montado system.  
**0:39:45-0:39:49:**  But is there any other reasons why you want more trees?  
**0:39:49-0:39:58:**  And what other ways or more subtle ways do the trees benefit your farm?  
**0:39:58-0:40:05:**  I think if you have 30 trees per hectare, you produce much more grass.  
**0:40:05-0:40:16:**  To a silver-posterite with a cow, with a lot of chips, 30 trees are perfect, 30-40 trees  
**0:40:16-0:40:18:**  are perfect.  
**0:40:18-0:40:33:**  But the different clives of the farm don't allow that you have 30 trees and another place  
**0:40:33-0:40:37:**  you have 70.  
**0:40:37-0:40:46:**  If you increase the number of trees, you will see the corn, you will see the cork, you sell  
**0:40:46-0:40:48:**  more cork.  
**0:40:48-0:41:00:**  But I think the most important thing is to maintain this unique ecosystem in the world.  
**0:41:00-0:41:09:**  I think it's the first thing you have to have in mind.  
**0:41:09-0:41:11:**  We have to maintain this.  
**0:41:11-0:41:15:**  It's not happening in another part of the world.  
**0:41:15-0:41:24:**  In Spain, Spain is our neighborhood and the farms are not so good as in Portugal.  
**0:41:24-0:41:28:**  Portugal is the most productive part of the world of cork.  
**0:41:28-0:41:41:**  So you have a unique ecosystem and you have to preserve and it's dying.  
**0:41:41-0:41:46:**  The whole year after this, millions of hectares.  
**0:41:46-0:41:55:**  So I think we have to do anything to put more trees in the system.  
**0:41:55-0:41:57:**  The benefits for the animals.  
**0:41:57-0:42:08:**  Imagine if in 7 or 8 years I have a lot of trees, I can reduce the cows and put more  
**0:42:08-0:42:13:**  sheep or more pigs.  
**0:42:13-0:42:17:**  Your decisions are made for your context.  
**0:42:17-0:42:22:**  If my context changes, I change the way I do the things.  
**0:42:22-0:42:31:**  I don't have to do cows for my life.  
**0:42:31-0:42:36:**  The balance I tell you of the different species is for more context now.  
**0:42:36-0:42:43:**  If the context changes, I rebalance the way I produce.  
**0:42:43-0:42:49:**  But that's where also you have such a diversity and market channels that you've established  
**0:42:49-0:42:57:**  to sell the different breeds and the different animals that you're raising on your land.  
**0:42:57-0:42:59:**  It gives you flexibility.  
**0:42:59-0:43:02:**  Because you have a system in place, you have selling systems in place.  
**0:43:02-0:43:08:**  So if for example there is more pasture developing or there is more oak tree developing or even  
**0:43:08-0:43:13:**  you're diversifying with other types of trees, you can just adjust the quantities of each  
**0:43:13-0:43:16:**  animal adapting to the evolving context.  
**0:43:16-0:43:26:**  So that diversity gives you also flexibility.  
**0:43:26-0:43:31:**  When we start with the chips and the goats, we start with a small number to understand  
**0:43:31-0:43:37:**  how it's the best work with a small group and then grow, grow, grow slow and not put  
**0:43:37-0:43:40:**  more people to work.  
**0:43:40-0:43:51:**  But do the things more in the correct way with more good decisions and more infrastructure  
**0:43:51-0:43:58:**  that's allowed to not put more people and grow in the number of the animals.  
**0:43:58-0:44:07:**  We start to sell the meat of the goats and the sheeps to the restaurant by direct sales  
**0:44:07-0:44:14:**  because in Portugal it's very, very difficult to do it with the cows because I don't have  
**0:44:14-0:44:18:**  the infrastructure to fed the calves.  
**0:44:18-0:44:31:**  And so in my management I prefer to sell the calves and fed the little ruminants, the goats  
**0:44:31-0:44:36:**  and the sheeps because the carcass is more easy to work for the restaurant and for the  
**0:44:36-0:44:43:**  chefs and we start to work with them with the sheeps and the goats.  
**0:44:43-0:44:53:**  And it goes very, very well because we don't do any supplement, any flower to the sheeps  
**0:44:53-0:45:01:**  and the goats and we sell in medium 6, 7 months of life.  
**0:45:01-0:45:16:**  We don't sell small animals and the meat makes a big difference and more restaurants are  
**0:45:16-0:45:22:**  interested in this kind of different production.  
**0:45:22-0:45:31:**  So I think if the farm allows me to produce different species, if I grow slow and if I  
**0:45:31-0:45:36:**  have more sheeps or more goats now I sell it whole.  
**0:45:36-0:45:43:**  I want to grow little by little because I don't want to sell any sheep or any goat to  
**0:45:43-0:45:51:**  a conventional market or to a guy who has fed them in the farm.  
**0:45:51-0:46:00:**  I want to sell the direct and I want to grow slow because I want to catch my partners,  
**0:46:00-0:46:05:**  more people, more restaurants and more chefs.  
**0:46:05-0:46:19:**  Another thing we do in last year, we did a Michelin chef, the name is João Rodríguez,  
**0:46:19-0:46:27:**  it's very good in Portugal and they have a crazy project to show the better producers  
**0:46:27-0:46:34:**  of Portugal and the different kinds of products that we do in Portugal.  
**0:46:34-0:46:43:**  And then we do a open day in the farm with different chefs and three different chefs,  
**0:46:43-0:46:50:**  one cook the lamb, another cook the goat, the other cook the pig.  
**0:46:50-0:47:01:**  And very people go to the farm, we made a visit of the farm for the different systems,  
**0:47:01-0:47:06:**  explain the management, explain the benefits of every animals in the system, explain that  
**0:47:06-0:47:10:**  the cows don't, it's not the cow, it's the cow.  
**0:47:10-0:47:22:**  And the people stay very happy and very comfortable to think that a beef is not a crazy thing.  
**0:47:22-0:47:32:**  And I see in the visit a couple and the guy tells the girl, you see, it's not a problem  
**0:47:32-0:47:36:**  to eat a beef of the cow because the cow is not a problem.  
**0:47:36-0:47:44:**  So I think this kind of thing is very good to change the mindset of the people.  
**0:47:44-0:47:45:**  It's very good.  
**0:47:45-0:47:53:**  And now we receive a lot of people in the farm who are interested in this management.  
**0:47:53-0:47:57:**  And I think it's the beginning of things, of different things happen.  
**0:47:57-0:48:00:**  I think it's very good.  
**0:48:00-0:48:01:**  Very interesting.  
**0:48:01-0:48:08:**  Yeah, that's, it's fascinating to zoom into also the way that these practices, they transform  
**0:48:08-0:48:11:**  into communication and they are attractive.  
**0:48:11-0:48:17:**  You know, you're managing a native, beautiful and respected ecosystem with your animals.  
**0:48:17-0:48:22:**  And so it's just a story that people must really jump on and enjoy.  
**0:48:22-0:48:31:**  But I wanted to zoom in a bit on the interaction between, you know, the animal production side  
**0:48:31-0:48:35:**  and the montado system and the oak tree.  
**0:48:35-0:48:40:**  And, you know, one of the first things that comes to mind is when you're looking at holistic  
**0:48:40-0:48:45:**  management and moving these animals around because you're constantly moving them, you  
**0:48:45-0:48:49:**  know, a bit here, a bit there.  
**0:48:49-0:48:54:**  How does the trees there that are not spaced in lines, you know, they're big trees are  
**0:48:54-0:48:56:**  dotted around the landscape.  
**0:48:56-0:49:00:**  How does the movement of the animals?  
**0:49:00-0:49:03:**  How does it interact with the trees?  
**0:49:03-0:49:05:**  Does it make things much more difficult?  
**0:49:05-0:49:09:**  Do you have to adapt the way that you move the animals to this tree system?  
**0:49:09-0:49:13:**  I'm talking about the logistics right now.  
**0:49:13-0:49:20:**  The logistics is a crazy thing that's invented that allows you to do that.  
**0:49:20-0:49:21:**  It's electric fence.  
**0:49:21-0:49:24:**  Electric fence is amazing thing.  
**0:49:24-0:49:31:**  When you want, you design the fence in the cycle, in the triangle, what you want and  
**0:49:31-0:49:33:**  the animals respect them.  
**0:49:33-0:49:43:**  But I tell you a little story that we have a fence with 14 actors and we divide the fence  
**0:49:43-0:49:46:**  three actors per day.  
**0:49:46-0:49:54:**  And we have in these fence a lot of young trees and we put the cows in the morning.  
**0:49:54-0:50:02:**  We open at eight o'clock and at four or five o'clock, we change for another fence of three  
**0:50:02-0:50:06:**  actors, 200 cows.  
**0:50:06-0:50:25:**  And we do different fence at the finish of the old fence of 14 actors.  
**0:50:25-0:50:31:**  The little trees, it's not one broken for the cow in the small fences where they do.  
**0:50:31-0:50:35:**  The cows don't broke any little tree.  
**0:50:35-0:50:46:**  In the last day, I thought, if you made a lot of small fences, now I can put the cows  
**0:50:46-0:50:57:**  one day with the old fence with no electric fence.  
**0:50:57-0:51:02:**  And in the last day, they broke three or four little trees.  
**0:51:02-0:51:05:**  So what happened?  
**0:51:05-0:51:15:**  They run for all the fence and they don't hit like a group.  
**0:51:15-0:51:29:**  They walk separate and three hours after they hit the grass, they think, now what I'm doing?  
**0:51:29-0:51:38:**  Now I'm hitting a little tree or I have to rub myself.  
**0:51:38-0:51:49:**  This is the little experience that tell you it's not the cow, it's the how, it's the management.  
**0:51:49-0:51:55:**  If you put in the place that we have a lot of young trees, you put the cows concentrate  
**0:51:55-0:52:04:**  a little number of hours and then in three, four hours, we look and if it hits, we move  
**0:52:04-0:52:05:**  them.  
**0:52:05-0:52:13:**  And this place is after this day, rests six months, six or seven months.  
**0:52:13-0:52:21:**  So not any problem with the cow, with the young trees, but with the cow and a lot of  
**0:52:21-0:52:31:**  old trees, it's more difficult because when you have the poor soil, a lot of old trees  
**0:52:31-0:52:39:**  don't produce a quantity of grass who allows you to do impact with the animals.  
**0:52:39-0:52:47:**  So in the winter, you can do well-dressed and you put hay here, it's what's happened,  
**0:52:47-0:52:55:**  what are we doing now, we put the hay in the winter and to put impact to create a disturbance  
**0:52:55-0:52:59:**  in the soil and function.  
**0:52:59-0:53:06:**  But I think after the cows, if you put the sheep, the soil, it's going better.  
**0:53:06-0:53:15:**  So the cows are amazing animals, are the most efficient animal, the most heavy, the species  
**0:53:15-0:53:20:**  that hit more quantity of food, it's amazing for doing impact.  
**0:53:20-0:53:31:**  But I think with another different species behind, the benefits are big.  
**0:53:31-0:53:33:**  Interesting.  
**0:53:33-0:53:40:**  Just to clarify, when you say you don't manage to have a lot of impact, I understand that  
**0:53:40-0:53:45:**  it's a question of quantity of grass and the amount of cows and the amount of time they  
**0:53:45-0:53:46:**  stay on the same place.  
**0:53:46-0:53:50:**  But what's the objective of the impact?  
**0:53:50-0:53:53:**  Why are you looking for impact?  
**0:53:53-0:54:03:**  Because the soil is very poor, the production of grass is very low, the soil they have 100  
**0:54:03-0:54:15:**  years of bad management, so you have to do a great disburd to disperse the soil.  
**0:54:15-0:54:19:**  To wake up the soil.  
**0:54:19-0:54:27:**  So I think in our contest, in our farm, it's more easy to do in the winter.  
**0:54:27-0:54:34:**  In the winter, with the rain, the soil is better for doing impact.  
**0:54:34-0:54:43:**  When you put the hay, we do the belt raising, you distribute the hay in the area that we  
**0:54:43-0:54:51:**  make the impact and then we change the electric fence for other place and we do a rotational  
**0:54:51-0:55:00:**  management only with the hay because we want to create a lot of impact because the soil  
**0:55:00-0:55:04:**  is very compact, don't grow anything.  
**0:55:04-0:55:18:**  And I have videos and photos of the seeds of the hay we brought, born a few days ago,  
**0:55:18-0:55:23:**  a few days behind the cows.  
**0:55:23-0:55:24:**  It's amazing.  
**0:55:24-0:55:29:**  I think it's the correct way because I don't want to till the soil, I don't want to till  
**0:55:29-0:55:31:**  because the roots of the trees.  
**0:55:31-0:55:36:**  I want to do it with the animals.  
**0:55:36-0:55:49:**  The cows give lots of manure in this compact, in this high density of number of the animals  
**0:55:49-0:55:50:**  grouped.  
**0:55:50-0:55:54:**  But I made a different experience.  
**0:55:54-0:56:00:**  I made with the cows, I made with the pigs.  
**0:56:00-0:56:11:**  The pigs disturb the first layer and then we put a lot of seeds and the function, the  
**0:56:11-0:56:13:**  different experience results well.  
**0:56:13-0:56:22:**  But the farm is very big and the problem is if you can't, one month or two months of the  
**0:56:22-0:56:32:**  year, you can't catch the cows of the neighborhood to do more impact in one month or two and  
**0:56:32-0:56:36:**  then give the cows again.  
**0:56:36-0:56:39:**  You walk fast.  
**0:56:39-0:56:43:**  In Portugal it's a crazy thing to do that.  
**0:56:43-0:56:52:**  So you have to do when the species, the different animals that we have in the farm and you have  
**0:56:52-0:56:54:**  to walk slow.  
**0:56:54-0:56:55:**  Interesting.  
**0:56:55-0:56:59:**  You just brought up lots of questions for me.  
**0:56:59-0:57:05:**  One of the things is have you seen that in these poor areas or in general on the farm,  
**0:57:05-0:57:10:**  have you seen that after this impact, after this bale grazing for example, bringing in  
**0:57:10-0:57:15:**  like nutrition converted into manure and etc.  
**0:57:15-0:57:17:**  Do you notice the trees benefits as well?  
**0:57:17-0:57:22:**  Because you talked about pasture now, but there's also the cork oaks all around.  
**0:57:22-0:57:27:**  Have you seen them respond to this impact or are they kind of on another cycle?  
**0:57:27-0:57:34:**  I think the most important thing for the quality of cork is the time of rest.  
**0:57:34-0:57:44:**  If you have a great impact, I think it's where we are talking about one hour and we talk  
**0:57:44-0:57:51:**  about three days and I tell you that I think the most important thing is the time of rest.  
**0:57:51-0:57:57:**  You will do a great impact, but then it's the time of rest who allows you to do the  
**0:57:57-0:58:00:**  soil recovery.  
**0:58:00-0:58:08:**  I think for the cork, it's very good for the trees, the rest time.  
**0:58:08-0:58:16:**  If you have the animals in all the months or two and two months, go to the fence, not  
**0:58:16-0:58:21:**  with the management, not with the electric fence, not with the density of animals.  
**0:58:21-0:58:30:**  The animals go to the tree and hit any leaves and broken a young tree.  
**0:58:30-0:58:34:**  This is the worst thing you can do.  
**0:58:34-0:58:40:**  When you give rest time, everything changes.  
**0:58:40-0:58:52:**  And so this year we have cork season, we produce the cork and it's the better production we  
**0:58:52-0:58:53:**  have.  
**0:58:53-0:58:56:**  Interesting, very interesting.  
**0:58:56-0:59:08:**  Because you have the big layers of cork and another thing that you tell you your production  
**0:59:08-0:59:12:**  of cork is bad or not is the small pieces.  
**0:59:12-0:59:26:**  Because the tree, when you go with the hex at the tree, if the cork goes entire, it unwraps  
**0:59:26-0:59:28:**  itself in a whole piece.  
**0:59:28-0:59:31:**  Yes, in all pieces, very good.  
**0:59:31-0:59:34:**  We do a lot of small pieces.  
**0:59:34-0:59:39:**  It's not good because the tree doesn't want to give the cork.  
**0:59:39-0:59:47:**  So this year it's the better production that we have.  
**0:59:47-0:59:49:**  That's really interesting.  
**0:59:49-0:59:52:**  What about the acorns?  
**0:59:52-0:59:57:**  Have you also seen changes since you've been managing this way?  
**0:59:57-1:00:02:**  In your most difficult areas, are you seeing acorn production changing?  
**1:00:02-1:00:12:**  The acorn production depends on the elix and the cork.  
**1:00:12-1:00:18:**  Because when I have three different fruitifications, the cork has three different fruitifications  
**1:00:18-1:00:22:**  and the elix only has one.  
**1:00:22-1:00:30:**  And for the pigs it's better the cork of the elix because it's more sweet and we have more  
**1:00:30-1:00:32:**  percentage of fat.  
**1:00:32-1:00:39:**  But the perfect thing is when you have the two things because you have much more acorn  
**1:00:39-1:00:42:**  for a long time.  
**1:00:42-1:00:56:**  And so I think if you have water in the soil, if you have the ecosystem more resilient,  
**1:00:56-1:01:02:**  much more capacity to drink the water of the rain, to reserve the water, the production  
**1:01:02-1:01:08:**  of the corn is like the olive, it's like the almonds.  
**1:01:08-1:01:11:**  It's a tree fruit.  
**1:01:11-1:01:15:**  The corn is a tree fruit, the elix is a tree fruit.  
**1:01:15-1:01:24:**  So if you treat them well, if you have a good quality of soil, nutrients and water, the  
**1:01:24-1:01:28:**  production are good.  
**1:01:28-1:01:34:**  You view that when you have a year that's rain a lot, you have a good production.  
**1:01:34-1:01:40:**  If you have a spring that rains a lot in the autumn, you have a good production of fruit.  
**1:01:40-1:01:53:**  So it's a tree animal or a plant, they need all the same.  
**1:01:53-1:02:06:**  They need to have a good quality of life and then the disponibility of nutrients, they  
**1:02:06-1:02:11:**  have time to rest.  
**1:02:11-1:02:18:**  When you see a plant or a tree, you have to see equal and we look at the animal.  
**1:02:18-1:02:20:**  I try to do it.  
**1:02:20-1:02:27:**  Yeah, yeah, for sure, it's interesting.  
**1:02:27-1:02:34:**  We talked about the pasture earlier on and too many trees that are too high density which  
**1:02:34-1:02:36:**  compromises the pasture.  
**1:02:36-1:02:42:**  For you, what's an optimum tree level to maintain a pasture?  
**1:02:42-1:02:48:**  For example, if you have an open field, an open pasture, how many trees can you put on  
**1:02:48-1:02:52:**  there without seriously diminishing the quantity of pasture production?  
**1:02:52-1:02:55:**  Do you have an idea?  
**1:02:55-1:02:59:**  I think 30 to 40.  
**1:02:59-1:03:02:**  That's your optimal for pasture production.  
**1:03:02-1:03:08:**  I think it's good because when you have open areas, the beaks are much more trees than  
**1:03:08-1:03:11:**  you have very number of trees.  
**1:03:11-1:03:14:**  If you have number of trees, the trees are small.  
**1:03:14-1:03:21:**  If you have 30 or 40 trees per hectare, you have big trees.  
**1:03:21-1:03:26:**  We have a lot of big trees in these areas with this number of trees per hectare and  
**1:03:26-1:03:33:**  they are very productive and they are very healthy because they don't have a tree to  
**1:03:33-1:03:36:**  push another tree.  
**1:03:36-1:03:42:**  They don't have to fight for the sun.  
**1:03:42-1:03:48:**  So I think 30 or 40 trees per hectare is a good number.  
**1:03:48-1:03:56:**  Not only does it let more light go through, but it also has a strong acorn production.  
**1:03:56-1:03:58:**  It's the best of both worlds.  
**1:03:58-1:03:59:**  Yes.  
**1:03:59-1:04:04:**  Indeed, the best quality of cork is better too.  
**1:04:04-1:04:06:**  It's better too.  
**1:04:06-1:04:09:**  Okay, interesting.  
**1:04:09-1:04:15:**  When you have, oh, let me start again.  
**1:04:15-1:04:22:**  What's the interaction between the oak in general and the pasture in the sense, do you  
**1:04:22-1:04:29:**  see the pasture around the oak be better or worse depending on the years, right?  
**1:04:29-1:04:34:**  Because there's drought years and then there's non-drought years, but how does it impact  
**1:04:34-1:04:39:**  on a micro level?  
**1:04:39-1:04:49:**  In the beginning of summer, you have more green pasture at the beginning of the summer  
**1:04:49-1:04:53:**  behind the tree.  
**1:04:53-1:05:02:**  In the winter, when you follow the ice, behind the trees, you don't have ice.  
**1:05:02-1:05:07:**  So the grass grows more fast.  
**1:05:07-1:05:10:**  So it's very good.  
**1:05:10-1:05:19:**  And if you look at the pasture behind the tree or inside the tree, it's completely different  
**1:05:19-1:05:23:**  because behind the tree, it's a different ecosystem.  
**1:05:23-1:05:25:**  It's a different...  
**1:05:25-1:05:26:**  Microclimate.  
**1:05:26-1:05:32:**  Yeah, this pointability of the nutrients of the rain, of the sun, it's different.  
**1:05:32-1:05:38:**  So it's very, I have photos of this, it's an amazing thing.  
**1:05:38-1:05:55:**  You, the green pasture behind the trees, it's green more 20 days than the other.  
**1:05:55-1:06:07:**  But if you go to the 70 trees per hectare, they disappear first.  
**1:06:07-1:06:10:**  What about on a drought year?  
**1:06:10-1:06:14:**  When there's like a drought spring?  
**1:06:14-1:06:15:**  What is a drought?  
**1:06:15-1:06:19:**  A drought is when there's no rain.  
**1:06:19-1:06:22:**  It's a much less rain than normal.  
**1:06:22-1:06:24:**  It's a drought.  
**1:06:24-1:06:25:**  Yes.  
**1:06:25-1:06:26:**  What happens?  
**1:06:26-1:06:35:**  The first green grass appears, it's behind the trees.  
**1:06:35-1:06:44:**  So if the grow is more fast in the winter, in the spring, you have more green tea behind  
**1:06:44-1:06:45:**  the tree.  
**1:06:45-1:06:56:**  So if you have a dry year, you have more production behind the trees.  
**1:06:56-1:07:03:**  But better production, more production, I don't know.  
**1:07:03-1:07:06:**  It's difficult to respond.  
**1:07:06-1:07:15:**  I think you have more quality behind the tree, but you can have more production because the  
**1:07:15-1:07:30:**  if you have a few days of rain, the grass who have inside the tree can grow.  
**1:07:30-1:07:33:**  Can grow, we can put a very density.  
**1:07:33-1:07:44:**  But if you talk about a very dry year, you only have a little grass behind the trees  
**1:07:44-1:07:54:**  because they have the microclimbing with the leaves, the shadow of the trees, improve the  
**1:07:54-1:07:59:**  water to grow fast and early.  
**1:07:59-1:08:05:**  So even in terms of drought, you have a better, this is a big generalization, but a better  
**1:08:05-1:08:07:**  production of pasture.  
**1:08:07-1:08:09:**  Yes.  
**1:08:09-1:08:10:**  Even in dry years.  
**1:08:10-1:08:11:**  Is that right?  
**1:08:11-1:08:12:**  Yes.  
**1:08:12-1:08:20:**  No, the trees only give benefits.  
**1:08:20-1:08:23:**  You have only benefits with the trees.  
**1:08:23-1:08:36:**  But when you pass a number, it's complex and it's a challenge to management and get good  
**1:08:36-1:08:42:**  results in the soil.  
**1:08:42-1:08:47:**  For you, it may seem more obvious this, but for people that are coming from an outside  
**1:08:47-1:08:52:**  system that are a lot of people now establishing trees on their pasture, they're not managing  
**1:08:52-1:08:58:**  old in the sense that the system that you're managing in Portugal now, the Montado system  
**1:08:58-1:09:04:**  is what some people will be managing in 20, 30 years when their silver pastoral systems  
**1:09:04-1:09:07:**  have got big trees, established root systems.  
**1:09:07-1:09:13:**  So it's very interesting to look at those details of these interactions to give a bit  
**1:09:13-1:09:17:**  of an idea for these people, for the people planting trees right now, how they're going  
**1:09:17-1:09:24:**  to, how their management and how their capital, their natural capital will change in the future.  
**1:09:24-1:09:31:**  So yeah, it's really fascinating to talk to a person with your experience on that.  
**1:09:31-1:09:38:**  I think the people are doing this today in 30 or 40 years.  
**1:09:38-1:09:46:**  The farms of them is the much productive farms you have in the world, if you management correctly,  
**1:09:46-1:09:55:**  because you design the system, you have a number of trees who allowed you to do a perfect  
**1:09:55-1:09:56:**  management.  
**1:09:56-1:10:03:**  So I think it's a crazy thing, I think it's the future.  
**1:10:03-1:10:11:**  It's the perfect contest, it's the perfect way to produce different species of animals.  
**1:10:11-1:10:15:**  They can do what they want in the system like that.  
**1:10:15-1:10:24:**  You can do anything, vegetables, cereals, any cover crop, and you can't put any animal,  
**1:10:24-1:10:25:**  any species.  
**1:10:25-1:10:30:**  So I think it's the future and I think it's a very, very good investment.  
**1:10:30-1:10:36:**  You put the trees correctly because the trees are amazing.  
**1:10:36-1:10:41:**  When a farm without trees, it's not completely farm.  
**1:10:41-1:10:42:**  Interesting.  
**1:10:42-1:10:48:**  And when you say put them on correctly, do you mean, is the main thing the quantity of  
**1:10:48-1:10:52:**  trees or are there other things that you would like to tell these people?  
**1:10:52-1:10:56:**  I think it depends on the contest.  
**1:10:56-1:11:05:**  The wrong thing we can do in this kind of agriculture is to mimic anyone.  
**1:11:05-1:11:12:**  We don't have to mimic anyone, we have to mimic the system and the nature of our contest.  
**1:11:12-1:11:21:**  You have to mimic it, we have to see what you have in our area and you have to organize  
**1:11:21-1:11:24:**  it and then management.  
**1:11:24-1:11:29:**  The only work for the man is management.  
**1:11:29-1:11:35:**  It's not invented different than the crazy things.  
**1:11:35-1:11:44:**  I think it's more important you stop and view what you have around and in our area that  
**1:11:44-1:11:52:**  you go to the YouTube and see a lot of videos and a lot of confusion and a lot of things.  
**1:11:52-1:11:56:**  This guy has this and I want to have this.  
**1:11:56-1:11:58:**  I think it's the wrong way.  
**1:11:58-1:12:07:**  If it depends on the contest, depends on what you want to do, you can put trees to feed  
**1:12:07-1:12:11:**  the animals, you can put trees to produce fruits.  
**1:12:11-1:12:19:**  It's a decision you have to make and the decisions today have consequences in 13 years.  
**1:12:19-1:12:31:**  So you have to think a lot about what you want to do and what is a serious decision.  
**1:12:31-1:12:40:**  You have to understand and then when you decide, you have to work the better way to resolve.  
**1:12:40-1:12:50:**  I wanted to understand a bit better what feed does the system, the tree systems produce.  
**1:12:50-1:12:55:**  We mentioned acorns, which as you said, all animals eat the acorns.  
**1:12:55-1:12:59:**  They get them from the ground and they eat them there.  
**1:12:59-1:13:01:**  Is there any fodder that's produced?  
**1:13:01-1:13:03:**  Do they also eat leaves?  
**1:13:03-1:13:09:**  Is there any biomass from the tree that they also eat?  
**1:13:09-1:13:16:**  You can in a specific season of the year, you can clean the tree.  
**1:13:16-1:13:25:**  You can do a very soft clean the tree and the cows eat the leaves.  
**1:13:25-1:13:32:**  So it's a help for winter season, very important because it's fiber.  
**1:13:32-1:13:34:**  You give fiber for the animals.  
**1:13:34-1:13:42:**  Imagine if you have an ear that doesn't rain or rain very low.  
**1:13:42-1:13:44:**  You don't have food.  
**1:13:44-1:13:48:**  The corn starts to fall.  
**1:13:48-1:13:56:**  If you only have a corn, it's a problem for you because the cows go crazy behind the trees  
**1:13:56-1:13:59:**  to eat the corn.  
**1:13:59-1:14:11:**  The first corn is not mature, it's a green fruit and causes a lot of problems in the  
**1:14:11-1:14:14:**  stomach of the cows.  
**1:14:14-1:14:25:**  If you clean the tree and you give fiber to the goats, these problems don't happen.  
**1:14:25-1:14:34:**  So it's a reserve that your system produces.  
**1:14:34-1:14:37:**  If you have to do it, you do it.  
**1:14:37-1:14:47:**  Some guys think they are not good to clean, soft or not soft, no touch in the tree.  
**1:14:47-1:14:55:**  Other guys tell you, no, but it's a fruit tree, every fruit tree you have to cut, you  
**1:14:55-1:14:56:**  have to management.  
**1:14:56-1:14:59:**  It's not a problem.  
**1:14:59-1:15:02:**  Different opinions.  
**1:15:02-1:15:07:**  When we do it, we do very, very soft.  
**1:15:07-1:15:20:**  I've seen in Portugal, they create a lot of open, V-shaped or U-shaped, cup-shaped oak  
**1:15:20-1:15:21:**  trees.  
**1:15:21-1:15:24:**  Do you do that or do you leave them there, their central leader?  
**1:15:24-1:15:27:**  No, I do it open.  
**1:15:27-1:15:28:**  You do an open cup.  
**1:15:28-1:15:30:**  Open cup.  
**1:15:30-1:15:40:**  What we want is not the very big tree.  
**1:15:40-1:15:45:**  You want a circular tree.  
**1:15:45-1:15:54:**  You want more down and more circular to produce more shadow, to produce more…  
**1:15:54-1:16:01:**  And the fruitification happens more when you have a tree, a circular tree and more down  
**1:16:01-1:16:02:**  tree.  
**1:16:02-1:16:06:**  You don't have so much problems with the wind.  
**1:16:06-1:16:17:**  When you have very old trees, the wind is a problem because if you don't balance the  
**1:16:17-1:16:28:**  height of the tree with the wind, they're broken very easily.  
**1:16:28-1:16:29:**  So it's a problem.  
**1:16:29-1:16:39:**  So if you clean the trees that are not balanced, they have more height one side or the other,  
**1:16:39-1:16:40:**  help the tree.  
**1:16:40-1:16:44:**  I think there is little management.  
**1:16:44-1:16:46:**  It's good for the trees.  
**1:16:46-1:16:52:**  You know, when we're looking at the fodder of trees, especially oaks with their tannins  
**1:16:52-1:16:59:**  and etc., there's a lot of people that talk about the benefits for parasites, animal parasites.  
**1:16:59-1:17:02:**  How do you manage parasites on your farm?  
**1:17:02-1:17:04:**  Do you see a benefit?  
**1:17:04-1:17:09:**  Do you use them as a tool for parasites or is it not effective?  
**1:17:09-1:17:19:**  No, the corn is first for the pigs, for the fat season of the pigs.  
**1:17:19-1:17:21:**  The name is Montagnara.  
**1:17:21-1:17:32:**  Montagnara is the four or five months of you have a corn in the farm and the pigs enter  
**1:17:32-1:17:41:**  in October in Montagnara with another 100 kilos and save four months later with another  
**1:17:41-1:17:42:**  18 kilos.  
**1:17:42-1:17:47:**  So they eat seven kilos of corn per day and two kilos of grass.  
**1:17:47-1:17:49:**  It's an amazing thing.  
**1:17:49-1:18:01:**  And I think we don't put ivermectin in our animals long years ago.  
**1:18:01-1:18:07:**  I think the secret of the parasites is the rest time in the fence.  
**1:18:07-1:18:17:**  When you put the long rest time in the fence, it's impossible to the parasites grow and  
**1:18:17-1:18:19:**  multiplicate.  
**1:18:19-1:18:28:**  So I think for me, it makes more sense to do it this time because I need to fat the  
**1:18:28-1:18:29:**  pigs too.  
**1:18:29-1:18:38:**  For example, depend on the species for species because we know different plants that are  
**1:18:38-1:18:49:**  toxic and the cows go and touch these plants to repel the insects.  
**1:18:49-1:18:52:**  But the goats eat them.  
**1:18:52-1:18:57:**  So depend on the species.  
**1:18:57-1:19:08:**  The goats are very clever, the goats discover any plant they need to not have parasites.  
**1:19:08-1:19:18:**  The cows, I think it's better to do the rest time in sanitary empty fence for a long time.  
**1:19:18-1:19:25:**  The pigs, I don't have problems with the pigs.  
**1:19:25-1:19:34:**  We made very very rotation with the pigs and very long times of rest to in the fence.  
**1:19:34-1:19:41:**  And if I see an animal who don't fat or have a problem, we sell it.  
**1:19:41-1:19:43:**  They don't stay in the farm.  
**1:19:43-1:19:51:**  So the capacity of the pig, it's very different of ruminant.  
**1:19:51-1:19:54:**  They put kilos and kilos very fast.  
**1:19:54-1:20:01:**  So in my experience, I don't see any problem with parasites in the pigs.  
**1:20:01-1:20:03:**  So you don't treat animals for parasites?  
**1:20:03-1:20:04:**  No.  
**1:20:04-1:20:05:**  No.  
**1:20:05-1:20:06:**  Okay.  
**1:20:06-1:20:09:**  You don't give vaccines, you don't treat for parasites?  
**1:20:09-1:20:11:**  No.  
**1:20:11-1:20:15:**  When I stop to use, I want to stop at all.  
**1:20:15-1:20:24:**  I don't, if I have a serious problem in the animal, of course I treat them.  
**1:20:24-1:20:35:**  But I want to choose the better animals, the more adaptable animals to stay in the farm.  
**1:20:35-1:20:41:**  And the others, yes, then the others, we have to sell it.  
**1:20:41-1:20:42:**  Very interesting.  
**1:20:42-1:20:44:**  Fantastic.  
**1:20:44-1:20:51:**  I wanted to talk, to finish off on the subject that I find really fascinating is the way  
**1:20:51-1:20:55:**  that you're using the impact of the animals to bring back.  
**1:20:55-1:20:59:**  I mean, I've seen some pictures and hopefully we can share some of these pictures to our  
**1:20:59-1:21:04:**  listeners on our social media as well to show them a bit visually what this means.  
**1:21:04-1:21:12:**  But I saw some amazing pictures where you have a montado with, so the oaks are there  
**1:21:12-1:21:14:**  with brambles and small trees.  
**1:21:14-1:21:17:**  It's hard to say exactly what it is, growing everywhere.  
**1:21:17-1:21:23:**  And with the impact of the animals, you've just taken them all down and you've reestablished  
**1:21:23-1:21:24:**  a pasture.  
**1:21:24-1:21:28:**  So, I mean, maybe you could tell us a bit more about what animals, what species, what  
**1:21:28-1:21:33:**  tool do you use to make it happen?  
**1:21:33-1:21:36:**  Depend off the area, depend off the area.  
**1:21:36-1:21:41:**  Imagine, like I said, in the water lines, I don't want to finish the brambles.  
**1:21:41-1:21:47:**  I want to hit and I want the brambles to grow again and I want to hit again.  
**1:21:47-1:21:52:**  In the more flat areas, then we have a group of brambles.  
**1:21:52-1:21:56:**  I want to transform the brambles in pasture.  
**1:21:56-1:22:00:**  So I do intensive impact.  
**1:22:00-1:22:03:**  And I start in the winter with the cows.  
**1:22:03-1:22:10:**  I put hay in the middle to the cows, broken the brambles and hit the hay in the middle  
**1:22:10-1:22:11:**  of the brambles.  
**1:22:11-1:22:14:**  Then I put the pigs.  
**1:22:14-1:22:20:**  The pigs are amazing because they like to eat the roots.  
**1:22:20-1:22:28:**  And so when you have the brambles down, they catch the roots because the roots have humidity,  
**1:22:28-1:22:33:**  they have water and they broken them.  
**1:22:33-1:22:41:**  The hay that we put has seeds, so with the start, the beginning of the rain season, the  
**1:22:41-1:22:44:**  seeds grow.  
**1:22:44-1:22:50:**  The seeds grow but the brambles have an extraordinary capacity to recover and the brambles recover.  
**1:22:50-1:23:02:**  Imagine if you have, you don't kill the brambles, hold the brambles, you don't kill 20% or 30%  
**1:23:02-1:23:06:**  or again and re-row again.  
**1:23:06-1:23:11:**  And then when the brambles re-row, we put the goats.  
**1:23:11-1:23:19:**  And the goats are specialized to eat like a medicine guy with a history.  
**1:23:19-1:23:22:**  They eat leaf by leaf to the brambles.  
**1:23:22-1:23:29:**  And then I think it's the better way to control the brambles.  
**1:23:29-1:23:37:**  Three different species that changed your landscape.  
**1:23:37-1:23:45:**  The soil behind the cow, behind the brambles is amazing.  
**1:23:45-1:23:46:**  It's a crazy thing.  
**1:23:46-1:23:48:**  It's black, black, black.  
**1:23:48-1:23:51:**  It's a crazy thing, very productive.  
**1:23:51-1:23:58:**  And I think if I can do the correct management after the cows broke and after the pigs broke  
**1:23:58-1:24:06:**  the roots, after the goats hit the rip-rods, if you can put the sheep to fertilize the  
**1:24:06-1:24:09:**  soil, I think it's amazing.  
**1:24:09-1:24:22:**  And I do a little experience and the photos that you are talking about, you can view what  
**1:24:22-1:24:23:**  you are talking about here.  
**1:24:23-1:24:24:**  It's amazing.  
**1:24:24-1:24:27:**  It's very fast.  
**1:24:27-1:24:30:**  If you do in the winter, next spring you have results.  
**1:24:30-1:24:31:**  It's very, very fast.  
**1:24:31-1:24:32:**  It's a crazy thing.  
**1:24:32-1:24:37:**  But how many cycles of this would you need to do to really take out brambles?  
**1:24:37-1:24:39:**  Or is that not even your objective?  
**1:24:39-1:24:40:**  No, no.  
**1:24:40-1:24:42:**  In the flat areas it is.  
**1:24:42-1:24:44:**  In the water lines, not.  
**1:24:44-1:24:52:**  But in the areas that it's better for me, produce grass and brambles, I want to change  
**1:24:52-1:24:53:**  for pasture.  
**1:24:53-1:25:01:**  I think in one year and a half you change it.  
**1:25:01-1:25:09:**  If you begin in the winter, imagine now, if I can share photos of the system that you  
**1:25:09-1:25:15:**  talk about, beginning in October.  
**1:25:15-1:25:27:**  Now today I see this place and we have the 30% of reward of the brambles.  
**1:25:27-1:25:29:**  Then I put the goats.  
**1:25:29-1:25:32:**  I put the goats in the beginning of the summer.  
**1:25:32-1:25:41:**  So the goats hit the brambles and in the summer, I think in the beginning of the winter, only  
**1:25:41-1:25:49:**  5% of the 30% of the goats hit, only 5% grow again in the beginning of the winter.  
**1:25:49-1:25:57:**  So these 5% in the winter, when I put the cows again, disappear.  
**1:25:57-1:26:04:**  We are talking about one year because I start in October, but we can talk about one and  
**1:26:04-1:26:06:**  a half year.  
**1:26:06-1:26:18:**  I think it's a very short time for a big and complex transformation in the soil because  
**1:26:18-1:26:23:**  the color of the soil, the smell of the soil behind the brambles is a crazy, crazy thing.  
**1:26:23-1:26:33:**  I want to put vegetables in the soil.  
**1:26:33-1:26:35:**  You can really use the brambles in your rotation.  
**1:26:35-1:26:40:**  I mean, because it's such a fantastic tool and they grow so fast.  
**1:26:40-1:26:41:**  They have an impact really fast.  
**1:26:41-1:26:47:**  Yes, but the brambles don't grow in very poor areas.  
**1:26:47-1:26:49:**  The brambles are very clean.  
**1:26:49-1:26:50:**  Too dry.  
**1:26:50-1:26:53:**  Yes, too dry and the brambles don't grow.  
**1:26:53-1:27:02:**  We have a different plant in the dry areas, in the poor areas, but this plant is very  
**1:27:02-1:27:05:**  important to feed the cows in winter.  
**1:27:05-1:27:16:**  If you give hay in winter, in these areas that we do a very intensive impact in winter,  
**1:27:16-1:27:28:**  you have a plant that is very good for equilibrating the digestion of the cow.  
**1:27:28-1:27:35:**  When you do an impact only without this plant, the manure of the cow is one thing.  
**1:27:35-1:27:46:**  Then when you change the fence and you have this kind of plant, the manure changes completely.  
**1:27:46-1:27:57:**  You have two months of young leaves after the first rain and the cows eat everything.  
**1:27:57-1:28:08:**  I do impacts in the fence and we can finish with them and put the productive soil.  
**1:28:08-1:28:19:**  But you have to be patient and you have to do small areas all the years.  
**1:28:19-1:28:24:**  I can't do it in four or five years.  
**1:28:24-1:28:25:**  It's a long journey.  
**1:28:25-1:28:34:**  But I think with different species, I can walk fast.  
**1:28:34-1:28:39:**  And you need the cows of the neighbor in these strategic moments.  
**1:28:39-1:28:40:**  This is what you're saying.  
**1:28:40-1:28:45:**  It's like in these strategic moments, you need to have a bigger impact.  
**1:28:45-1:28:49:**  You need more animals, but then they need to get out before the summer where the resources  
**1:28:49-1:28:50:**  drop a lot.  
**1:28:50-1:28:57:**  Yes, because we need a lot of cows, a lot of number of cows to a great impact.  
**1:28:57-1:29:02:**  But then the farm doesn't produce so much food for all the cows.  
**1:29:02-1:29:11:**  So if I can put the cows in winter and do a great impact and then give the cows to the  
**1:29:11-1:29:19:**  neighbor again and do a lot of rest, I walk more fast.  
**1:29:19-1:29:24:**  It's more fast to recover the soil.  
**1:29:24-1:29:28:**  But when we walk slowly, it's good too.  
**1:29:28-1:29:32:**  We understand the different things.  
**1:29:32-1:29:47:**  We learn a lot and it makes us to improve different things and to grow and to learn  
**1:29:47-1:29:54:**  more and not have in a comfort area.  
**1:29:54-1:30:02:**  You have to run, you have to do anything.  
**1:30:02-1:30:05:**  You have to work, you have to learn more.  
**1:30:05-1:30:06:**  It's good.  
**1:30:06-1:30:16:**  We don't have to have the proclification to walk very, very fast.  
**1:30:16-1:30:28:**  It's the job you choose and you have your life to do the better day by day.  
**1:30:28-1:30:29:**  Very nice.  
**1:30:29-1:30:40:**  I think in our farming experience in Greece as well, going slow was something that we  
**1:30:40-1:30:48:**  didn't do enough of and going slow to learn, to make the mistakes on small scale.  
**1:30:48-1:30:59:**  Yes, but when I tell you to walk slow, it's different than don't make nothing or wait  
**1:30:59-1:31:11:**  for the change happening like a miracle.  
**1:31:11-1:31:14:**  Like a miracle.  
**1:31:14-1:31:22:**  You have to get this pump.  
**1:31:22-1:31:36:**  So I know that my decision, the good and the better, I walk slow but every day I want to  
**1:31:36-1:31:40:**  do more and more different things.  
**1:31:40-1:31:46:**  I want to put more chips, I want to put more goats, I want to start when I can, I want  
**1:31:46-1:31:50:**  to start with the chickens, I want to do different things.  
**1:31:50-1:32:02:**  But if you have the thinking, I go to the fence and the fence is equal to one ear.  
**1:32:02-1:32:06:**  So you don't feel good in your work.

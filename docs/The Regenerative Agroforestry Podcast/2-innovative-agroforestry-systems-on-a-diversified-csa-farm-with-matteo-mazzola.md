### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 13:39:53)
**0:00:00-0:00:19:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:19-0:00:21:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:21-0:00:26:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:26-0:00:30:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:30-0:00:35:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:35-0:00:36:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:36-0:00:41:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:41-0:00:45:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:50:**  Hi everyone, welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:50-0:00:55:**  Today we're delighted to have with us Matteo Mazzola from Myside Farm.  
**0:00:55-0:01:08:**  Today we received finally the genetic core of our future sheep flock, actually not flock  
**0:01:08-0:01:22:**  but herd, because we got our male, which is a blue-faced lister, a young boy of four months  
**0:01:22-0:01:30:**  old, and it's very, for all the English farmers, it's a very normal breed, like you find it  
**0:01:30-0:01:38:**  everywhere, it's basically the most used male breed which is used in England, but in Italy  
**0:01:38-0:01:46:**  I think there are possibly four or five of these, animals of this breed.  
**0:01:46-0:01:52:**  And that's very important because with the male we are going to change the genetics to  
**0:01:52-0:01:59:**  direct, to orientate the genetics of the whole herd and it's a very important day.  
**0:01:59-0:02:07:**  It was very expensive, it's a very funny animal and so we got one blue-faced lister and one  
**0:02:07-0:02:13:**  textile female, that's going to be for another project.  
**0:02:13-0:02:18:**  Also with the animals, which are going to be the core of the whole system, the element  
**0:02:18-0:02:28:**  of activation, of potentiation, of the dynamic elements also for the agroforestry systems.  
**0:02:28-0:02:36:**  So it's very important to work out an important plan from an ecological point of view, so  
**0:02:36-0:02:41:**  you need to choose the right breeds, you need to choose, actually you need to choose the  
**0:02:41-0:02:49:**  right species, you need to choose then the right breed, or the right breeds, and then  
**0:02:49-0:02:58:**  you need to understand the numbers connected to how the season changes, how the pasture  
**0:02:58-0:03:04:**  changes, if one year is more dry or one year is more wet, again you will change the numbers  
**0:03:04-0:03:07:**  and the behaviour of the animals.  
**0:03:07-0:03:15:**  So we are basically now in the process of trying to find the compatibility between our  
**0:03:15-0:03:23:**  landscape, our microclimate, the type of animals that we are choosing and the way we want to  
**0:03:23-0:03:24:**  manage them.  
**0:03:24-0:03:27:**  The objectives are mainly two.  
**0:03:27-0:03:41:**  One is to speed up the regeneration and the maintenance process of our ecosystem, agroecosystem.  
**0:03:41-0:03:53:**  And the second one is to have another, a new produce to sell for our clients on our market.  
**0:03:53-0:03:57:**  And did this sheep come all the way from England?  
**0:03:57-0:04:02:**  It was sent to a live animal from there, or you found it closer to home?  
**0:04:02-0:04:12:**  No, luckily there are a few enlightened Italians, which they did the work for me a few years  
**0:04:12-0:04:13:**  ago.  
**0:04:13-0:04:22:**  So we got the son of English animals, but again he was born in Italy.  
**0:04:22-0:04:33:**  So I will, with the COVID issue, everything sort of stopped, like the import and export  
**0:04:33-0:04:37:**  of animals slowed down a lot.  
**0:04:37-0:04:44:**  But I will possibly at the end of summer try to get more animals from England because we  
**0:04:44-0:04:51:**  have a precise idea of what we want, not just the breeds, but also the genetic lines of  
**0:04:51-0:04:53:**  every single breed.  
**0:04:53-0:04:57:**  That's something that we'll definitely want to get into during this podcast, understand  
**0:04:57-0:05:02:**  a bit more about the decisions and why you're choosing these breeds.  
**0:05:02-0:05:08:**  But what we like to do at the beginning is to understand a bit the context of the farm  
**0:05:08-0:05:13:**  and so that we can present our listeners an image of what it looks like at I SIDE.  
**0:05:13-0:05:18:**  So do you think you could tell us a bit about who are the key players on the farm and who's  
**0:05:18-0:05:20:**  working there at the moment?  
**0:05:20-0:05:32:**  Yeah, basically the farm is managed by my partner Paola, by me, by Jessica, which is  
**0:05:32-0:05:39:**  our colleague and friend since nearly four years.  
**0:05:39-0:05:48:**  And then we are helped by volunteers, which are interested in spending a few weeks or  
**0:05:48-0:05:56:**  months at our farm to learn a little bit more and to check how is the system that we are  
**0:05:56-0:05:57:**  creating.  
**0:05:57-0:06:06:**  And yeah, plus a few local people that come here and there during the week, one or two  
**0:06:06-0:06:10:**  days just to help us because they like the project.  
**0:06:10-0:06:18:**  Not necessarily interested in deeply understanding everything which is behind the regenerative  
**0:06:18-0:06:21:**  agriculture and agroforestry and so on.  
**0:06:21-0:06:30:**  But still they play possibly the most important role, which is like supporting us when a big  
**0:06:30-0:06:35:**  portion of the community don't understand yet what we are doing or actually also tries  
**0:06:35-0:06:40:**  to create problems.  
**0:06:40-0:06:50:**  And so on a typical day, how many people are working in the field?  
**0:06:50-0:06:52:**  It really changes a lot.  
**0:06:52-0:06:57:**  It changes a lot because we are not a farm, we are a building site.  
**0:06:57-0:07:02:**  So it can be one person, it can be 10 people.  
**0:07:02-0:07:07:**  So it really changes.  
**0:07:07-0:07:15:**  There are too many things which make up our farm.  
**0:07:15-0:07:22:**  There is the family layer, there is the relationship layer, there is the bureaucracy layer, there  
**0:07:22-0:07:29:**  is the customer-client layer, there is the experimentation research and the demonstration  
**0:07:29-0:07:31:**  layer.  
**0:07:31-0:07:39:**  There is the productive of course, the agronomic layer and really is very complex and we are  
**0:07:39-0:07:42:**  very young farm.  
**0:07:42-0:07:47:**  Many things are working, many other ones we already abandoned them, many we are changing  
**0:07:47-0:07:48:**  them.  
**0:07:48-0:07:52:**  How do you even have the time to talk to us, Matteo?  
**0:07:52-0:07:56:**  Because you're beautiful people.  
**0:07:56-0:08:09:**  Because for us it's very important to do what we can to support well-structured projects  
**0:08:09-0:08:10:**  like yours.  
**0:08:10-0:08:21:**  It's because either we don't have the capacity or the time to organize, to give more equal  
**0:08:21-0:08:24:**  to what we are doing.  
**0:08:24-0:08:26:**  Because of course it's not our job.  
**0:08:26-0:08:34:**  Our job is to be in the field, to observe, to get feedback from the systems and to change  
**0:08:34-0:08:42:**  them and to have the flexibility and the resources in order to completely change the system.  
**0:08:42-0:08:47:**  Because then when I consult or I give courses, I don't want to tell them what it could be  
**0:08:47-0:08:57:**  if I tell them, look, with this soil, this climate is like this or has been like this.  
**0:08:57-0:09:04:**  And then from there on we can start, we can continue with more precise planning, with  
**0:09:04-0:09:15:**  more precise protocols either for disease management or water management or soil fertility  
**0:09:15-0:09:23:**  or any brick of the system.  
**0:09:23-0:09:26:**  So, yeah.  
**0:09:26-0:09:30:**  Could you tell us a bit about what are you producing on the farm at the moment?  
**0:09:30-0:09:34:**  What are you selling and where to or who to?  
**0:09:34-0:09:35:**  Yeah.  
**0:09:35-0:09:40:**  Again, this is changing all the time because we are setting the system.  
**0:09:40-0:09:47:**  Basically every place has its own identity, social identity and cultural identity.  
**0:09:47-0:09:56:**  So it already has changed a lot since the beginning here, but even more from the farm  
**0:09:56-0:10:01:**  I was managing a few kilometers away from here, far from here, is completely different.  
**0:10:01-0:10:05:**  So we are selling, we have a CSA.  
**0:10:05-0:10:13:**  I think now we have around 80 families which are on our CSA.  
**0:10:13-0:10:17:**  And then we sell to I think five restaurants.  
**0:10:17-0:10:24:**  And we have extra boxes like veg and fruit boxes that we are selling to people that don't  
**0:10:24-0:10:28:**  want to join the CSA.  
**0:10:28-0:10:36:**  And then we have, which is becoming a quite interesting economic part of our project,  
**0:10:36-0:10:46:**  which is this small trust market that we have just at the entrance of the property where  
**0:10:46-0:10:53:**  we just place bags with the price and the weight of the produce.  
**0:10:53-0:11:01:**  And people just leave their money, which is quite normal to find this type of selling  
**0:11:01-0:11:07:**  system in the north of Europe or in Australia, in places where I've been.  
**0:11:07-0:11:10:**  But here it's just like everybody look at us and say, what?  
**0:11:10-0:11:11:**  Are you crazy?  
**0:11:11-0:11:13:**  Aren't they stealing everything?  
**0:11:13-0:11:16:**  Yeah, many times it happens.  
**0:11:16-0:11:21:**  But again, this is for us, for us has been very important to do something like that,  
**0:11:21-0:11:30:**  to build trust and to show something completely different than they are used to, to the people  
**0:11:30-0:11:34:**  that are living here, to the people from here.  
**0:11:34-0:11:40:**  So it was amazing, it was very important also the answer of the mayor to what we did and  
**0:11:40-0:11:47:**  to the people that really like, people that are leaving messages inside the money box,  
**0:11:47-0:11:50:**  which is of course is open and someone can take the money as it happens sometimes or  
**0:11:50-0:11:56:**  as it happens many times, people are leaving more money than we are asking.  
**0:11:56-0:12:04:**  I remember when I was there, you were saying that there was more money in the box usually  
**0:12:04-0:12:10:**  than what was expected with the amount of produce on the shelf, right?  
**0:12:10-0:12:15:**  So people were probably enjoying this kind of trusting and leaving a bit of a tip in  
**0:12:15-0:12:16:**  a way.  
**0:12:16-0:12:17:**  Yeah.  
**0:12:17-0:12:18:**  Is that still the case there?  
**0:12:18-0:12:19:**  It is, it is.  
**0:12:19-0:12:27:**  Now we, it starts to be an interesting, as I was saying, economic future because really  
**0:12:27-0:12:33:**  we are starting to pay off our rents, like for our houses, thanks to that market.  
**0:12:33-0:12:38:**  So it's increasing more and more, more people know it, more people want to support us, more  
**0:12:38-0:12:46:**  people through that are understanding that behind that gate, there is a farm, people  
**0:12:46-0:12:54:**  didn't know it because we didn't have time to advertise our presence and many local people  
**0:12:54-0:13:01:**  were speaking, were saying bad things about us because they don't even knew us, they just  
**0:13:01-0:13:09:**  listened to people that had interest on our land and so it's very therapeutical, that  
**0:13:09-0:13:14:**  market, very therapeutical for many people in different ways.  
**0:13:14-0:13:27:**  So yeah, we sell vegetables, we sell fruits, we have olive oil, eggs, the honey, I mean  
**0:13:27-0:13:32:**  we have bees but now they're managed by one of our friends which is, let's say, external  
**0:13:32-0:13:40:**  to the farm but still producing the honey from our land and then we started a few months  
**0:13:40-0:13:52:**  ago producing edible medicinal mushrooms and we have a small nursery where we produce multifunctional  
**0:13:52-0:14:00:**  plants for agroforestry systems and then I'm sure I'm forgetting, ah we have berries, many,  
**0:14:00-0:14:06:**  many berries and possibly something else which I forget now.  
**0:14:06-0:14:11:**  What about the sheep, what are you planning on doing with the sheep on the land?  
**0:14:11-0:14:19:**  The sheep is, at the moment we have meat sheep, so we just started a few months ago so it  
**0:14:19-0:14:25:**  will take some time to have the produce the next year and basically the sheep we want  
**0:14:25-0:14:34:**  to work on a particular quality of meat because in Italy, sheep meat at least in north is  
**0:14:34-0:14:42:**  not much known, not much used and yeah we want to work on the quality, like on the taste,  
**0:14:42-0:14:47:**  on the experience that people are not used to and this is one thing.  
**0:14:47-0:15:01:**  Not working with lambs but with adults and then we have some ideas for the hool, we would  
**0:15:01-0:15:10:**  like to make organic pillows with the hool and then again one very important part is  
**0:15:10-0:15:21:**  like selling alive animals, so the genetic and for this we work on producing mules, so  
**0:15:21-0:15:32:**  that means like hybrids between the blue-faced lister and other breeds and then we'll see  
**0:15:32-0:15:38:**  maybe also to start at some point to sell like pure breeds which are not really known  
**0:15:38-0:15:48:**  or present in Italy because we can have a strong eco about new things in Italy because  
**0:15:48-0:15:55:**  many people know us, many people trust us, no debt behind a new project, there is lots  
**0:15:55-0:16:00:**  of study, lots of research, lots of trials, lots of money that we have been spending in  
**0:16:00-0:16:12:**  order to arrive to something very solid, I don't know how to say in English, very...  
**0:16:12-0:16:14:**  Sure.  
**0:16:14-0:16:21:**  Maybe you could explain to us a bit what the land is like in terms of or what your context  
**0:16:21-0:16:27:**  there is like in terms of the climate, the soil, to have an idea or a picture of what  
**0:16:27-0:16:28:**  it all looks like.  
**0:16:28-0:16:41:**  Yeah, basically we are just in front of Lake Iseo which is a glacial lake, very pretty  
**0:16:41-0:16:46:**  and the farm is located on the...  
**0:16:46-0:16:54:**  I don't know how to say in English, I think it's the moranic deposits of the glacier.  
**0:16:54-0:17:04:**  Basically in few thousands of years or even more of glacier activity moving sediment,  
**0:17:04-0:17:17:**  moving soil, rocks, sand and seals and clay, basically our farm is on 80 meters, around  
**0:17:17-0:17:29:**  80 meters deep glacier sediment which come from mainly, it comes from Balcomonica valley  
**0:17:29-0:17:37:**  which is a very diverse valley from geological point of view, is where the acidic Alps meet  
**0:17:37-0:17:44:**  the limey and the alkaline Alps so you can find granite, you can find flintstone, you  
**0:17:44-0:17:52:**  can find limestone, you can find gypsum, you can find all sorts of stones.  
**0:17:52-0:17:59:**  I counted around 13 different minerals in our soil.  
**0:17:59-0:18:05:**  So does that mean it's very rich in its very fertile soil, is that what it means?  
**0:18:05-0:18:12:**  It's very rich in certain elements, very poor in other elements.  
**0:18:12-0:18:24:**  It's not alluvial soil, so basically an alluvial soil is the sum of many moranic or many non-alluvial  
**0:18:24-0:18:34:**  soil, we have many excesses like copper, like zinc, like calcium, like magnesium, we have  
**0:18:34-0:18:38:**  them in very high quantities.  
**0:18:38-0:18:47:**  But still it's very interesting and the interesting thing is that the moranic deposits, they were  
**0:18:47-0:18:57:**  left by the glacier on the side of a mountain which gets to 1500 meters in height and that  
**0:18:57-0:19:05:**  mountain on the top is still not deposited from the glacier but is like gypsum, sorry,  
**0:19:05-0:19:11:**  is dolomite which gives some of the characteristics of our soil.  
**0:19:11-0:19:28:**  And the property is basically developing on 70 meters of altitude and is around 60,000  
**0:19:28-0:19:33:**  square meters, so 6 hectares around.  
**0:19:33-0:19:42:**  And what can I say, we have a mountain, sorry, a water spring which is very important for  
**0:19:42-0:19:53:**  us because it runs I think around 20 to 40,000 liters of water per day but of a very alkaline  
**0:19:53-0:20:02:**  water with very high active calcium, active lime inside, so it's very interesting to be  
**0:20:02-0:20:06:**  working with that water.  
**0:20:06-0:20:12:**  And from microclimate point of view, we are in front of a lake but at the beginning of  
**0:20:12-0:20:23:**  the valley of the lake that created the lake, there are glaciers so temperature can be not  
**0:20:23-0:20:31:**  extremely low but still we have winters with low temperatures and very hot summers.  
**0:20:31-0:20:37:**  It can get to 40 degrees and in the winter, in the last year not really but it can get  
**0:20:37-0:20:45:**  to minus 15, minus 10 but normally it would be around zero or a little bit below.  
**0:20:45-0:20:53:**  Of course climate is changing, it's increasing the temperature but still more or less this  
**0:20:53-0:20:55:**  is about the microclimate.  
**0:20:55-0:21:06:**  We have around 800 to 1,000 millimeters of rain per year with peaks of 1,200 or 700 millimeters  
**0:21:06-0:21:08:**  in the driest seasons.  
**0:21:08-0:21:15:**  Yeah Matteo, we thought before we go into really exploring the detail of how you're  
**0:21:15-0:21:19:**  managing the systems, maybe you could start explaining the different agroforestry systems  
**0:21:19-0:21:23:**  you have on the farm.  
**0:21:23-0:21:29:**  It's a very diverse farm from a morphology point of view.  
**0:21:29-0:21:39:**  We have billions of different niches and we have huge diversity of, especially of grasses  
**0:21:39-0:21:46:**  and forbs and herbaceous plants.  
**0:21:46-0:21:51:**  This makes things very interesting but very difficult together with the soil which is  
**0:21:51-0:21:54:**  not, it's changing, every meter of soil is changing.  
**0:21:54-0:22:04:**  So on one line of peaches you will see huge differences in health and production and plant  
**0:22:04-0:22:06:**  behavior.  
**0:22:06-0:22:18:**  So the thing, I have to start from not really the system but why we are implementing so  
**0:22:18-0:22:21:**  many different systems.  
**0:22:21-0:22:29:**  I do consultancies, I do courses and I like to experiment and research in order to have  
**0:22:29-0:22:43:**  informations, material that can be spread, that can be given to farmers, not just to  
**0:22:43-0:22:52:**  become more regenerative, more organic, but also to go faster in the transition for a  
**0:22:52-0:22:55:**  more regenerative agriculture.  
**0:22:55-0:23:02:**  And at the same time, for us it's very important, maybe even more than the regenerative agriculture  
**0:23:02-0:23:07:**  part, is that it has to be economically viable.  
**0:23:07-0:23:13:**  Either the implementation but also the outcome.  
**0:23:13-0:23:25:**  So we are trying to understand by implementing so many systems, first what grows well locally  
**0:23:25-0:23:38:**  because we would like to create a wave of interest from the concept but also from economical  
**0:23:38-0:23:41:**  perspective.  
**0:23:41-0:23:47:**  We would like to have people that surround us that start to do similar or the same things  
**0:23:47-0:23:55:**  in order to become stronger in the market and maybe to have a nice produce from Sulzano  
**0:23:55-0:24:01:**  that we don't produce just in few hundreds of kilos but it can be a few thousands and  
**0:24:01-0:24:06:**  to get maybe also to bigger cities.  
**0:24:06-0:24:15:**  So we started with a quite big olive growth especially for these areas, it's big because  
**0:24:15-0:24:21:**  it's more than 250 trees with some trees which are quite big yielding.  
**0:24:21-0:24:28:**  We are in the north of Italy so it's not really the best place for olives to grow but still  
**0:24:28-0:24:37:**  we have some trees which are yielding up to 130 kilos of olives per year, so quite big  
**0:24:37-0:24:39:**  trees.  
**0:24:39-0:24:45:**  And then we had to interact at the beginning with those trees.  
**0:24:45-0:24:52:**  To me the olive growth together with the pasture underneath it is already a system.  
**0:24:52-0:25:01:**  We can't and we don't want to work too much in complexifying the olive growth system because  
**0:25:01-0:25:03:**  for two reasons.  
**0:25:03-0:25:12:**  First on our latitude we are already needing to prune the trees in order to have more light  
**0:25:12-0:25:19:**  to come from the center, from the middle of the tree because there is a lack of light  
**0:25:19-0:25:24:**  in certain months of the year.  
**0:25:24-0:25:30:**  Especially then connected also to average moisture during the year is an evergreen tree  
**0:25:30-0:25:40:**  so during the coldest month you want the air flow, it keeps on flowing otherwise we have  
**0:25:40-0:25:52:**  many, many, many fungi and bacterial diseases and this already tells you, ok, we can't play  
**0:25:52-0:26:00:**  too much with top canopy or emergent trees which grows above the olive tree.  
**0:26:00-0:26:07:**  We are doing few experiments but still I think it will be not the direction we will be taking  
**0:26:07-0:26:09:**  with the olive trees.  
**0:26:09-0:26:15:**  The second most important thing with olive trees is that you need to put nets on the  
**0:26:15-0:26:22:**  ground so you can't really mess up with bushes and too many trees underneath the trees because  
**0:26:22-0:26:29:**  otherwise when you go to harvest the olives it takes too long to harvest them and we should  
**0:26:29-0:26:35:**  sell the olive oil for too much, too expensive and people wouldn't buy it.  
**0:26:35-0:26:39:**  We are already selling it for a lot because in this area it costs a lot, like between  
**0:26:39-0:26:46:**  18 and 25 euros per litre when in the south of Italy, in Basilicata, which quality is  
**0:26:46-0:26:53:**  also higher than ours, they are selling it for 4-6 euros a litre.  
**0:26:53-0:26:59:**  So you're still able to sell that olive oil then even if it's not competitive with better  
**0:26:59-0:27:02:**  olive oil from the south you still have a local customer?  
**0:27:02-0:27:08:**  Yeah, we sell it all no problem, we could have even more because people either like  
**0:27:08-0:27:15:**  to buy local or like our project and then they want to support us.  
**0:27:15-0:27:24:**  Most of the olive oil goes to family members, friends and close customers because really  
**0:27:24-0:27:32:**  we are producing between 300 and 750 litres of oil per year so it's not a lot.  
**0:27:32-0:27:40:**  Just our family I think uses 60-70 litres per year, maybe even more so it's not much.  
**0:27:40-0:27:44:**  It will be increasing because the trees were abandoned and we are managing them in order  
**0:27:44-0:27:47:**  to have an increased production.  
**0:27:47-0:27:58:**  When we want to manage the system in a very simple way, at least from a plant species  
**0:27:58-0:28:05:**  point of view, the diversity comes in the pasture and the pasture has to be managed  
**0:28:05-0:28:12:**  by animals then the increasing value from a functional biodiversity point of view is  
**0:28:12-0:28:15:**  brought by the animals and their activity.  
**0:28:15-0:28:26:**  The sheep and the olive tree if they are well managed is a beautiful relation, they work  
**0:28:26-0:28:29:**  very well together, extremely well together.  
**0:28:29-0:28:36:**  That's great and I think we'll come back a bit later to really the interactions between  
**0:28:36-0:28:40:**  trees and animals and that's something we're really interested in.  
**0:28:40-0:28:45:**  But just to continue our overview then, you also I think understand and associate vegetables  
**0:28:45-0:28:52:**  with trees and just finishing our little virtual tour of your tree systems.  
**0:28:52-0:29:01:**  The second most important system, at least by now, is the fruit orchard.  
**0:29:01-0:29:10:**  It's a really experimental orchard from many points of view because we have 88 fruit tree  
**0:29:10-0:29:15:**  varieties which is a bit of a nightmare from one point of view but very interesting from  
**0:29:15-0:29:21:**  an observation point of view and the learning curve point of view.  
**0:29:21-0:29:32:**  We have planted the most used known species, peaches, apricots, apples, pears, plums, figs  
**0:29:32-0:29:34:**  and table grape.  
**0:29:34-0:29:42:**  We planted the orchard on a keyline pattern in order to show and observe also the effect  
**0:29:42-0:29:47:**  also on a small bit of land because we are talking about less than a hectare orchard.  
**0:29:47-0:29:55:**  I think it's around 7,000 square meters if I'm right.  
**0:29:55-0:30:04:**  We have monoculture line which means that on one tree line we have the same species  
**0:30:04-0:30:13:**  but every four trees it changes varieties so we have this pattern of starting with the  
**0:30:13-0:30:24:**  earliest flowering, actually the earliest fruiting varieties and going forward the latest  
**0:30:24-0:30:27:**  fruiting varieties.  
**0:30:27-0:30:35:**  And then we have for every species we created different experimental consortiums with other  
**0:30:35-0:30:36:**  trees.  
**0:30:36-0:30:43:**  For example with the plums on one line, we have two lines of plums, on one line we have  
**0:30:43-0:30:54:**  planted of course the plums, in between the plums we have two quite closely planted pollonias  
**0:30:54-0:30:57:**  which I don't remember what's the name in English.  
**0:30:57-0:31:01:**  There we go.  
**0:31:01-0:31:09:**  So pollonias, we have pollonias planted from seeds but also three hybrid varieties in order  
**0:31:09-0:31:16:**  to check the behavior and the management and the resistance to the climate.  
**0:31:16-0:31:23:**  And then between one plum and the other then we will have the pollonias in the middle between  
**0:31:23-0:31:31:**  the trees and then under the pollonias and between the plums we have gooseberries, it's  
**0:31:31-0:31:45:**  like the bush layer and then on, because it's on a slight slope on the upper part we planted  
**0:31:45-0:31:55:**  a consortium of every one meter, sort of it will be an edge.  
**0:31:55-0:32:07:**  So we planted mulberries, willows and some elderberries and different let's say wild  
**0:32:07-0:32:20:**  trees which will be kept like bushes in order to have proteins, minerals or those biochemical  
**0:32:20-0:32:26:**  elements that the grazing animals can't find on the pasture.  
**0:32:26-0:32:33:**  Then we are increasing dramatically the amount of active roots in the free tree lines but  
**0:32:33-0:32:44:**  keeping those trees very young all the time like sort of either coppicing or very low  
**0:32:44-0:32:47:**  pollarding system.  
**0:32:47-0:32:56:**  In order, every time that the animals pass from that area they have their choice, pre-choice  
**0:32:56-0:33:03:**  like tree fodder and they will eat whatever they will need.  
**0:33:03-0:33:07:**  So they will eat the leaves, they will eat the twigs and then when it will be needed  
**0:33:07-0:33:14:**  we will go and cut and re-nuate those branches.  
**0:33:14-0:33:18:**  Do you want me to tell you other examples of consortiums?  
**0:33:18-0:33:25:**  I think it already gives us quite a good idea of the, as the conversation keeps going we  
**0:33:25-0:33:31:**  can maybe explain them when needed, some other consortiums but already here there's a lot  
**0:33:31-0:33:33:**  of questions that come up with what you've said.  
**0:33:33-0:33:37:**  Why are you integrating paulownias in the orchard for example?  
**0:33:37-0:33:38:**  What's the purpose there?  
**0:33:38-0:33:41:**  What's the role of the paulownia?  
**0:33:41-0:33:53:**  Well behind it there is a little bit of a mental disease which is that disease that  
**0:33:53-0:33:58:**  all of the agroforestry and regenerative agriculture farmers have which is like I want to grow  
**0:33:58-0:34:01:**  biomass, I want to grow biomass.  
**0:34:01-0:34:07:**  We don't even know why, I mean of course we know why but it's something that comes out  
**0:34:07-0:34:15:**  very natural like if you see a mound of wood chips on the side of the road you're already  
**0:34:15-0:34:19:**  thinking oh wow I have to come here and take it to my farm.  
**0:34:19-0:34:25:**  Yeah it's a sort of a cleptomania of biomass.  
**0:34:25-0:34:31:**  The paulownias is one of the fastest growing trees in this climate and this year we have  
**0:34:31-0:34:36:**  seen it like in two and a half months they reached four meters high and now while I'm  
**0:34:36-0:34:42:**  speaking probably they are growing five six centimeters so they're just amazing.  
**0:34:42-0:34:51:**  So production of biomass local like on C2 and then a very important feature is which  
**0:34:51-0:34:59:**  we already experimented in the last three weeks with two strong hail events that has  
**0:34:59-0:35:04:**  ruined many different crops we have especially the apples.  
**0:35:04-0:35:09:**  After the paulownias, the paulownias were destroyed like they are full of holes, the  
**0:35:09-0:35:18:**  tips of the paulownias were broken but the trees that were already protected by them  
**0:35:18-0:35:20:**  they didn't have any problems.  
**0:35:20-0:35:29:**  So they did reach a quite high level I'm thinking to have them growing at least to seven eight  
**0:35:29-0:35:37:**  meters and to unbranch them so to prune all the bottom branches and to keep this protective  
**0:35:37-0:35:45:**  cap at the top at seven eight meters height it could be that we go even higher because  
**0:35:45-0:35:53:**  we want light to penetrate through but we also want to create this protective layer.  
**0:35:53-0:35:58:**  Are you worried about the shade and how that will look?  
**0:35:58-0:36:02:**  I've been there I've seen the paulownias so I know that they're located in between fruit  
**0:36:02-0:36:07:**  trees so maybe that needs to be clear for the listeners.  
**0:36:07-0:36:12:**  What are you expecting the shade how are you expecting the shade created by the paulownia  
**0:36:12-0:36:18:**  to impact the different fruit trees that you have in the orchard?  
**0:36:18-0:36:24:**  To me that's not a problem it's like if there is too much shade you understand it because  
**0:36:24-0:36:33:**  the trees depending the species either they will curve they will move their branches new  
**0:36:33-0:36:39:**  branches toward the light so you already understand that there is too much shade or they will  
**0:36:39-0:36:48:**  make darker leaves or bigger leaves and then you understand you have to observe if what  
**0:36:48-0:36:55:**  is the extent to which that particular species can tolerate the shade if there is too much  
**0:36:55-0:37:04:**  shade you just prune more more branches or you just you just cut like polar the tree  
**0:37:04-0:37:13:**  in the more sensible periods normally during summertime for any crop here the sun is too  
**0:37:13-0:37:24:**  strong yeah so it's very important by the summer to reach a good protection.  
**0:37:24-0:37:34:**  Paulownia that is unpruned it will reduce also the size of the leaves the first year  
**0:37:34-0:37:39:**  they're huge they are there we have some leaves which are like 60 centimeters in diameter  
**0:37:39-0:37:48:**  they're really a roof but while the tree gets older the trees are becoming smaller and more  
**0:37:48-0:37:58:**  light passes through so I'm not concerned again of early shade which is the most damaging  
**0:37:58-0:38:08:**  especially to flowering trees and to the first important enlarging of the fruits the paulownia  
**0:38:08-0:38:18:**  is a c4 is the only c4 tree that we have around here so it wakes up very late during this  
**0:38:18-0:38:26:**  during the season so meanwhile all the fruit trees have already fruited the paulownia is  
**0:38:26-0:38:33:**  still there which is still sleeping so that's that's it doesn't concern me.  
**0:38:33-0:38:40:**  Okay and going back to what you were to the the functions of the paulownia I also expect  
**0:38:40-0:38:44:**  that you know by pruning the paulownia on the sides you're gonna be able to sell the  
**0:38:44-0:38:47:**  wood at some point no is that something that you you're hoping to do are you hoping to  
**0:38:47-0:38:55:**  leave it there and to and to act as a support to the fruit trees around?  
**0:38:55-0:39:04:**  Is what I want to do like of course the what we can't do is to apply is to fully apply  
**0:39:04-0:39:16:**  the the syntropic principles of sort of rhythmic forest falling in order to restart the the  
**0:39:16-0:39:25:**  succession process because this will take many years and of course a lack of a lack  
**0:39:25-0:39:32:**  of production for for certain periods but we can play with different crops so maybe  
**0:39:32-0:39:39:**  now the paulownia is not growing meanwhile we will be planting another silvicultural  
**0:39:39-0:39:49:**  crop like woods woods crop and when the paulownia will be ready to be cut will be already have  
**0:39:49-0:39:58:**  another tree that will grow at the same height so eventually that's the idea to grow the  
**0:39:58-0:40:05:**  wood that we're using the farm to build stuff to build the the barns to build all sorts  
**0:40:05-0:40:11:**  of things that we are building right now and we have to buy the wood we want to grow fast  
**0:40:11-0:40:18:**  wood on our farm and there are many ideas also with the paulownia woods but we can speak  
**0:40:18-0:40:23:**  later or another time if you want to.  
**0:40:23-0:40:30:**  Maybe I was thinking of staying on the paulownia kind of track here but looking going below  
**0:40:30-0:40:37:**  the soil what are you expecting to happen on on the soil level with the roots and just  
**0:40:37-0:40:43:**  elaborate a bit more like one of the the typical concerns that would arise here because if  
**0:40:43-0:40:48:**  we understand correctly you've got on the tree line you have fruit trees in between  
**0:40:48-0:40:52:**  you have paulownias you could also you will also integrate some other trees there and  
**0:40:52-0:40:57:**  you also have berries underneath right what do you you know some people may be can may  
**0:40:57-0:41:02:**  be concerned by competition for example so what would you what would you say to what  
**0:41:02-0:41:09:**  what do you have to say about the whole root aspect and and competition factor?  
**0:41:09-0:41:16:**  I have to admit that this is something too complex to be sure to say oh it's like this  
**0:41:16-0:41:24:**  I mean nobody really knows well the soil especially when you are applying agroecological principles  
**0:41:24-0:41:38:**  and and you are sort of letting yourself accepting all the all the diversity and all the possibilities  
**0:41:38-0:41:44:**  that that a natural system brings with it so I don't know what will will be happening  
**0:41:44-0:41:53:**  with the roots of course we have very powerful tools which are pruning branches but also  
**0:41:53-0:42:05:**  pruning roots to reduce or to stimulate the activity of of the trees and the only problem  
**0:42:05-0:42:11:**  then because we already said that the shade it can be managed with the with the pruning  
**0:42:11-0:42:19:**  or the correct management the only problem then it will it will be possibly the the fertilization  
**0:42:19-0:42:23:**  and and the lack of nutrients for the fruit trees or or or the berries or the poll onions  
**0:42:23-0:42:33:**  which are trees that that require a huge amount of nutrients we already have set drip irrigation  
**0:42:33-0:42:44:**  system and also the possibility to to use rain rain irrigation so we use already every  
**0:42:44-0:42:48:**  time that we irrigate something especially the vegetables because of fruit trees we don't  
**0:42:48-0:42:57:**  really irrigate them but every time that arrives water the water is is is with a sort of fertilizer  
**0:42:57-0:43:08:**  so we use a lot how do you call them macerates like macerations ferments yeah not really  
**0:43:08-0:43:18:**  ferments but it's more like we we we chuck leaves from dynamic accumulators or just crops  
**0:43:18-0:43:26:**  in the in the water they they decompose in the in the water and when the water is is  
**0:43:26-0:43:35:**  it gets colored we we dilute that water into the irrigation water and so every time that  
**0:43:35-0:43:40:**  we irrigate the trees and the plants they they get nutrients this is the simplest thing  
**0:43:40-0:43:45:**  but then of course we have many many other different produce that we use to stimulate  
**0:43:45-0:43:56:**  to to to bring the nutrients which are difficult for the trees to get in quantity and in quality  
**0:43:56-0:44:08:**  so through water via gravity we spend very little time nearly no energy effort to to  
**0:44:08-0:44:13:**  bring a lot of nutrients to the trees then if there are not enough nutrients because  
**0:44:13-0:44:22:**  there are too many trees then we will be bringing them through a fertiligation system but in  
**0:44:22-0:44:26:**  your experience on the farm with all the different experiments that you have could could you  
**0:44:26-0:44:32:**  say that as could you say could you generalize that planting densely hasn't impacted performance  
**0:44:32-0:44:39:**  or has impacted performance no because we the the first year we grew together with the  
**0:44:39-0:44:46:**  trees the vegetables so on the tree lines on this let's say 60 to 80 centimeters wide  
**0:44:46-0:44:55:**  fruit trees beds we we we planted vegetables and I mean we produce good vegetables and  
**0:44:55-0:45:05:**  and and and the trees they grew more than we expected very very fast very robust actually  
**0:45:05-0:45:13:**  we we had too much fertility too much nitrogen from organic matter release we have a sandy  
**0:45:13-0:45:21:**  loam soil so the organic matter it just like burns in like like the wood in a stove and  
**0:45:21-0:45:30:**  it releases a lot and and also we have been mulching with with the grass that grows between  
**0:45:30-0:45:37:**  the fruit trees lines which again I should have stopped the second year and started to  
**0:45:37-0:45:47:**  be using wood chips or to plant more herbaceous layer to cover the soil which is what we will  
**0:45:47-0:45:55:**  be doing the next winter we already reproduced lots of herbaceous layer plants to do that  
**0:45:55-0:46:05:**  then no I I can I can answer on most of the crops we didn't have absolutely any of of  
**0:46:05-0:46:14:**  those competition problems maybe is important to study the whole issue of allopathy because  
**0:46:14-0:46:21:**  for example where we I knew it but I don't know too many things to do I forgot when we  
**0:46:21-0:46:26:**  were planting that when we put table grape we have two lines of table grape on the right  
**0:46:26-0:46:37:**  line on the south line we we placed we transplanted parsley very densely planted parsley under  
**0:46:37-0:46:46:**  the the grape and parsley has an extremely strong allopathy effect on on many plants  
**0:46:46-0:46:51:**  and those grapes for that year they didn't grow I mean their cousins on on the on the  
**0:46:51-0:46:58:**  left side they grew from a very small plant like we planted like 20 centimeter long twig  
**0:46:58-0:47:06:**  and the first year we had on some plants like nine meters growth on the ones with parsley  
**0:47:06-0:47:12:**  we had like 60 70 centimeter growth with small leaves a little bit yellowish then we we took  
**0:47:12-0:47:20:**  away the parsley and the next year they just grew like like crazy that shows how you know  
**0:47:20-0:47:24:**  it's important to carefully choose the species that you put together right you can't just  
**0:47:24-0:47:30:**  put anything with anything or could you totally no no no I mean you should plant anything  
**0:47:30-0:47:38:**  and then with that soil you will observe what crops they are they are damaging or they are  
**0:47:38-0:47:44:**  stopping or or they're decreasing the speed of growth of the of your commercial or your  
**0:47:44-0:47:51:**  fruit trees for example but the first year at least starting from a small experimental  
**0:47:51-0:47:55:**  plot try everything when someone tells me oh this tree you shouldn't put it with that  
**0:47:55-0:48:02:**  and I do it if someone tells me don't do it I do it because I want to see in my soil because  
**0:48:02-0:48:09:**  if I think that that tree has got certain functions that that important functions that  
**0:48:09-0:48:14:**  my system needs I will try to use it people everybody is telling me oh don't plant eucalyptus  
**0:48:14-0:48:20:**  what are you doing in the north of Italy and now we choose between those 750 species of  
**0:48:20-0:48:27:**  eucalyptus we found the three most cold resistant and we're plant we planted them and now they  
**0:48:27-0:48:34:**  are growing this year we have like four meters tall eucalyptus between between the fig trees  
**0:48:34-0:48:40:**  between the peaches and and nothing at the moment has changed if compared to the peaches  
**0:48:40-0:48:46:**  and the fig trees that don't have those eucalyptus trees so it's very important to study a lot  
**0:48:46-0:48:53:**  to go to courses to go to visit farms but then to to experiment because every single  
**0:48:53-0:49:02:**  soil will be suppressing or will be enhancing a certain characteristic of a determined species  
**0:49:02-0:49:11:**  and is it would be a pity not to try a tree just because someone told you don't don't  
**0:49:11-0:49:19:**  do that so I always tell people look do whatever you think is good for you if you have time  
**0:49:19-0:49:27:**  energy money resources do it on a small piece of your farm while you're producing organically  
**0:49:27-0:49:34:**  or organically from a conventional point of view in order to get the money that you need  
**0:49:34-0:49:42:**  to to run your operation then a small part of farmer you have to experiment I don't know  
**0:49:42-0:49:51:**  what it would be with the paulownia roots what I can do is is just to keep light coming  
**0:49:51-0:49:58:**  coming through in the amount that the trees needed and to fertilize my my crops which  
**0:49:58-0:50:02:**  produce fruits that that I need maybe I will understand that it's better to cut down the  
**0:50:02-0:50:06:**  fruit trees and to plant more paulownias to produce wood right we don't know yet  
**0:50:06-0:50:14:**  Mateo I wanted to ask just to clarify going back to this idea of you know planting vegetables  
**0:50:14-0:50:19:**  on your tree line the first year which I think is a very exciting idea you know you mentioned  
**0:50:19-0:50:26:**  that even roots were getting burnt is there did you see like a conflict between the needs  
**0:50:26-0:50:30:**  of vegetables in terms of fertility and over fertilizing trees or you know are there any  
**0:50:30-0:50:35:**  specific combinations that worked well I just want to go a bit in a few examples here because  
**0:50:35-0:50:43:**  I think it's fascinating yeah yeah I go straight forward with the we we tried many different  
**0:50:43-0:50:51:**  crops yeah I can tell you about I could speak about every single vegetable crop connected  
**0:50:51-0:50:58:**  to a particular tree species but I tell you I start from this from two crops that we planted  
**0:50:58-0:51:11:**  under the peaches fruit lines the potatoes was amazing it was perfect for many reasons  
**0:51:11-0:51:16:**  because it's good the first year and this is what I will do with the next system that  
**0:51:16-0:51:23:**  I I will be planting I will not use mulch for the first year because I want I don't  
**0:51:23-0:51:30:**  want the trees to develop a shallow root system and I'm depending of course on the crops certain  
**0:51:30-0:51:38:**  crops it will be fine I will be mulch from the first year but I would prefer to have  
**0:51:38-0:51:44:**  not bare soil but of course like maybe a crop like a vegetable crop that lets some some  
**0:51:44-0:51:53:**  sun burn the soil and the temperature to increase so the first root structure that the free  
**0:51:53-0:51:59:**  trees developed the first year which is extremely important is like the the spine of a child  
**0:51:59-0:52:10:**  I want them to grow very deep I wanted to extend where the the natural water is so the  
**0:52:10-0:52:18:**  potatoes were good because they allowed us to by also destroying when we harvest the  
**0:52:18-0:52:24:**  harvest the potatoes by destroying the superficial roots the only problem is that the potato  
**0:52:24-0:52:36:**  is is the best crop you could choose to bring verticillium fungi I don't know what is the  
**0:52:36-0:52:45:**  black rot maybe it's called in in in English anyway verticillium is the Latin name and  
**0:52:45-0:52:53:**  the potato carries it and brings it to the system and the peaches are extremely vulnerable  
**0:52:53-0:52:59:**  against this disease and not just the peaches because it's a disease that it grows on around  
**0:52:59-0:53:08:**  350 different crops and is a disease that kills the trees it can kill a very old olive  
**0:53:08-0:53:16:**  tree if there are the right conditions so when I talk about about this with the Antgosh  
**0:53:16-0:53:23:**  he told me is not the problem is not to plant the potato the problem is that the potato  
**0:53:23-0:53:30:**  should be planted on the top of the soil not under the soil so this I still have to I have  
**0:53:30-0:53:38:**  to try yeah but still in our case the line with the potatoes the peaches on that line  
**0:53:38-0:53:44:**  they are the ugliest they're still producing a lot we're trying by fertilizing them by  
**0:53:44-0:53:51:**  treating them with all sorts of preparations we are trying to keep them alive with the  
**0:53:51-0:53:57:**  sort of right pruning but still from a commercial point of view if I had decided to put potatoes  
**0:53:57-0:54:05:**  everywhere that would be would have been a big problem on the other side an amazing crop  
**0:54:05-0:54:13:**  has been corn we planted a line of corn very thick like sweet corn sweet corn in between  
**0:54:13-0:54:21:**  the lines sorry on the line in between the trees and those trees they were the most amazing  
**0:54:21-0:54:28:**  they grew like crazy and they were protected in the first year which is very important  
**0:54:28-0:54:35:**  because I imagine a small tree doesn't normally a peach tree would grow through the bushes  
**0:54:35-0:54:43:**  through the grass or protected by another tree and that was the corn was with his shape  
**0:54:43-0:54:53:**  which is like long and thin it lets the light come but still protecting leaves here and  
**0:54:53-0:55:01:**  there while the sun moves I do believe that the strong microbial activity and the huge  
**0:55:01-0:55:10:**  amount of hormones that are released continuously by this amazing C4 crop they played a very  
**0:55:10-0:55:17:**  important role into the activation of the roots of the peaches I have pictures which  
**0:55:17-0:55:24:**  are really showing what will happen there I mean we are not talking about thousands  
**0:55:24-0:55:33:**  of trees or an experiment of many hectares but still when you have let's say 15 trees  
**0:55:33-0:55:40:**  with one crop and 15 trees with another crop and you see a tendency you already have some  
**0:55:40-0:55:49:**  good answers another good crop is sweet potatoes I really like sweet potatoes because they  
**0:55:49-0:56:00:**  produce huge biomass they protect the soil during the summer and they create this how  
**0:56:00-0:56:09:**  to say big elements which are digging the strongest and the hardest of the soils like  
**0:56:09-0:56:15:**  moving stones like pumping sugars in the soil around the sweet potatoes the soil normally  
**0:56:15-0:56:25:**  is amazing is fantastic so they create when you harvest them the space for new soil to  
**0:56:25-0:56:35:**  be created they pump the soil the soil grows thanks to those to that crop I don't know  
**0:56:35-0:56:42:**  if I answered yeah that's great no that's great it's really interesting but then you  
**0:56:42-0:56:47:**  kind of prepare your tree line then plant it inside and then bring any specific fertilization  
**0:56:47-0:56:52:**  for the vegetables you kind of just fit them in the tree system and along the needs of  
**0:56:52-0:57:03:**  the trees then the tree in the fruit orchard the tree line preparation process it took  
**0:57:03-0:57:14:**  nine months where we have been cutting the grass and collecting it on the key lines so  
**0:57:14-0:57:21:**  basically we had the roots of the pasture that decomposed and left a very good and rich  
**0:57:21-0:57:30:**  soil part of the material that we added for three four times that decomposed and also  
**0:57:30-0:57:36:**  gave a good amount of nutrients and at the beginning we put a layer of five centimeters  
**0:57:36-0:57:45:**  of compost that we produced like very high carbon like 90 percent wood chips compost  
**0:57:45-0:57:51:**  very well decomposed together with the pumice rock dust to bring those minerals that we  
**0:57:51-0:58:01:**  don't have in this soil and in the whole of the trees we also we put all sorts of stimulants  
**0:58:01-0:58:10:**  like other rock dust microganism and bio are activated by a chair and the learner learner  
**0:58:10-0:58:20:**  diet and and things like that for the vegetable basically compost and and and the mulch  
**0:58:20-0:58:25:**  in looking at these more complex systems that you're creating these more complex tree lines  
**0:58:25-0:58:31:**  where you're integrating vegetables the berries the trees the paulownia i think it'd be interesting  
**0:58:31-0:58:37:**  to to to you know go over some more of the of the ways the elements interact together  
**0:58:37-0:58:46:**  yeah yeah yeah for example well the fruit trees basically they have to produce the fruits  
**0:58:46-0:58:52:**  because there is a lack of organic fruit production in the in the area so we can sell them for  
**0:58:52-0:59:02:**  a quite high price and the the berry layer which is the bush layer is a beautiful layer  
**0:59:02-0:59:08:**  to me is one of the the most fascinating and and important layers if i had to choose to  
**0:59:08-0:59:14:**  put a top canopy or an emergent tree in in a fruit orchard or a bush layer i would have  
**0:59:14-0:59:25:**  chosen the bush layer i mean bush bushes are are like are small trees or like a sort of  
**0:59:25-0:59:31:**  lignified pasture i love them because they're their roots they're marvelous they're they're  
**0:59:31-0:59:41:**  just magical every single species has as a magical root that that does one or or have  
**0:59:41-0:59:50:**  one or more ecological functions especially berries uh currents and gooseberries in in  
**0:59:50-1:00:00:**  this case they're amazing uh tree nurse they they grow they they are like an unexpressed  
**1:00:00-1:00:07:**  forest every current and every gooseberry plant is an unexpressed forest you just let  
**1:00:07-1:00:13:**  them like that and they will grow a forest the first year of planting we already had  
**1:00:13-1:00:19:**  no sorry second year when when the currents were were bigger but but also the gooseberries  
**1:00:19-1:00:26:**  under them they already started to grow maples service trees they started to grow uh what's  
**1:00:26-1:00:36:**  the name mulberries yeah um in like older raspberry systems now it is a forest it's  
**1:00:36-1:00:45:**  growing a forest so they're fine fine very thick uh root systems they just stimulate  
**1:00:45-1:00:52:**  the soil in in in in a wonderful way that no other crops manage to do so they have a  
**1:00:52-1:00:58:**  very positive interaction with the fruit trees that are above them it is is a good is a good  
**1:00:58-1:01:03:**  uh interaction between the two yeah it's like the the protection from the fruit trees is  
**1:01:03-1:01:12:**  good for the berries and the and the soil root activity and microbial activity of course  
**1:01:12-1:01:18:**  connected to the to the berries is is proper theoretical it is good for for the the fruit  
**1:01:18-1:01:27:**  tree it's just like the berry is substitute to me from what i've been observing the the  
**1:01:27-1:01:34:**  presence for example of of willow willow root system so very active very nice color all  
**1:01:34-1:01:40:**  the time growing new roots all the time new shoots all the time very active long sorry  
**1:01:40-1:01:48:**  short uh lifespan so they have to give all themselves if you imagine that from the second  
**1:01:48-1:01:53:**  year you already are in full production it's just amazing you have to imagine that these  
**1:01:53-1:02:02:**  trees these these crops they need to have an extremely complex active microbial and  
**1:02:02-1:02:11:**  root system around them because they grow a huge amount in quantity of fruits in a very  
**1:02:11-1:02:17:**  short period because they are always the first crops producing at the beginning of the year  
**1:02:17-1:02:25:**  they flower and in in in very little time they they bury fruits so they really need  
**1:02:25-1:02:34:**  to have a strong system that supports this so they are very vital to the system i do  
**1:02:34-1:02:38:**  i love the passion in your voice i literally can't wait to plant berries now you know i'm  
**1:02:38-1:02:43:**  in a climate where berries grow and i'm just getting excited and angsty on my chair just  
**1:02:43-1:02:48:**  thinking like wait when can i get out and plant these you know it's so it's so great  
**1:02:48-1:03:00:**  man in order to um how to say when when you like to plant trees when you like the berries  
**1:03:00-1:03:07:**  that you want to nearly to hug them it's like the winter is always too far because you want  
**1:03:07-1:03:13:**  to plant them all the time so we this year we we started to develop a system which is  
**1:03:13-1:03:24:**  like a it needs particular pots and a particular management but a system that allows us and  
**1:03:24-1:03:29:**  we already we're already experimenting to plant trees the whole year round so it doesn't  
**1:03:29-1:03:34:**  matter what is the season if you have a little bit of water and and you apply this system  
**1:03:34-1:03:41:**  you can plant the whole year round and and this for the people like like you and Dimitri  
**1:03:41-1:03:47:**  and me is like it's very very important because we need to plant forest all the time could  
**1:03:47-1:03:55:**  you elaborate a bit more on that uh system it's very simple it's basically we are using  
**1:03:55-1:04:04:**  these cardboard tubes it's like compressed cardboard which is open on the top and on  
**1:04:04-1:04:13:**  the bottom is is bent inside so it has a hole but on on the close to the side is uh it's  
**1:04:13-1:04:21:**  got like a sort of uh bottom yeah and you plant the whole thing it's like 25 centimeter  
**1:04:21-1:04:29:**  tall and seven eight centimeter wide so basically it's lots of soil or lots of compost inside  
**1:04:29-1:04:37:**  and then you just plant it and then what happen you don't move the roots it's not even like  
**1:04:37-1:04:43:**  root trainers that you have to open the root trainer and some sort of stress happen you  
**1:04:43-1:04:51:**  just plant this beautiful uh bullet in the soil and just give a little bit of water and  
**1:04:51-1:04:57:**  little by little the roots of the trees will grow in the bottom layer so you're already  
**1:04:57-1:05:03:**  growing trees perfect for agroforestry system where you don't want shallow root trees that  
**1:05:03-1:05:11:**  go on the cereals or on the vegetables because they will grow at the bottom of the of the  
**1:05:11-1:05:17:**  of the pot so in our case 25 centimeter deep already  
**1:05:17-1:05:22:**  we definitely need to get into that at the end and start finding out how we can build  
**1:05:22-1:05:32:**  these things come and plant some berries on my land with that and you're invited  
**1:05:32-1:05:38:**  remaining on this system that we were describing now the orchard all this complexity that you've  
**1:05:38-1:05:43:**  added in these different plants does it affect somehow the management of the system so i'm  
**1:05:43-1:05:51:**  thinking you know you've got to go in there to mow to spray to prune to harvest as well  
**1:05:51-1:05:58:**  kind of logistically or from a management perspective what's the impact there uh very  
**1:05:58-1:06:12:**  complex extremely complex especially for a european mind is too complex because we have  
**1:06:12-1:06:17:**  to work fast we have to spend little money because the produce is not valued as as it  
**1:06:17-1:06:27:**  should be so either you have a lot of passion and you work also in the night otherwise it  
**1:06:27-1:06:35:**  the system collapses we are working on the management systems that will allow us and  
**1:06:35-1:06:43:**  will allow many other farmers to run such a system or maybe leave it more simple but  
**1:06:43-1:06:52:**  in a more human human way in order not to get crazy with it so that that in order to  
**1:06:52-1:07:02:**  scale it to scale it yeah yeah exactly exactly we we sort of promote complexity we promote  
**1:07:02-1:07:09:**  problems i mean we could we could have many less problems if we would have used like copper  
**1:07:09-1:07:18:**  treatments or or pirettum treatments or many other organic toxic pesticides we we choose  
**1:07:18-1:07:27:**  not to and this already creates a lot of problems and then the system now we are observing the  
**1:07:27-1:07:34:**  system more from the biology and the ecology point of view and less from the machinery  
**1:07:34-1:07:43:**  point of view even if we are using already some particular machineries the ideal to me  
**1:07:43-1:07:51:**  is is to to use animals to use the system but i think still the biggest problem is the  
**1:07:51-1:07:58:**  lack of enough plants in the system as we already spoke many times especially with the  
**1:07:58-1:08:09:**  system at mazzi farm dimitri is that the the key in the key most of the time for many many  
**1:08:09-1:08:19:**  problems sorry to to solve many problems is to increase plant density we are lacking the  
**1:08:19-1:08:24:**  herbaceous layer because we didn't have time to yet to plant it we already have lots of  
**1:08:24-1:08:31:**  plants that we'll be planting in the winter as i said before and why we are missing it  
**1:08:31-1:08:37:**  because it is growing a lot of grass and and and lots of annual weeds and they are telling  
**1:08:37-1:08:45:**  us okay if you if you don't put something that allows the soil to to be covered by green  
**1:08:45-1:08:52:**  material we don't want the mulch the mulch is toxic to regenerate to the regeneration  
**1:08:52-1:09:02:**  process it's like a forest that is allowed to become old and and the the layer of leaves  
**1:09:02-1:09:09:**  leaves become thick because there are there are not any more animals to manage it to promote  
**1:09:09-1:09:16:**  the composition that layer not in all the climates not in all the situations but in  
**1:09:16-1:09:25:**  many cases in many wild tree consortiums what it makes the system becoming older and older  
**1:09:25-1:09:37:**  is this mulch it's just like what is is is is done by most of like permaculturists or  
**1:09:37-1:09:47:**  or many regenerative farmers is to put lots of mulch but the mulch the mulch is just like  
**1:09:47-1:09:54:**  bare soil the soil doesn't want to be covered the soil wants to have roots and eventually  
**1:09:54-1:10:04:**  some leaves on top of it it doesn't care about sterile slowly decomposing organic matter  
**1:10:04-1:10:09:**  so what we need is really to substitute the annual weeds because with lots of mulch what  
**1:10:09-1:10:19:**  happens the the most resistant plants will be the the rhizomatic with rhizomes like the  
**1:10:19-1:10:30:**  convolvulus arivensia like Artemisia vulgaris like synodondactylon like no no it doesn't  
**1:10:30-1:10:38:**  come the name anyway all those crops that have starchy roots or starchy rhizome that  
**1:10:38-1:10:49:**  manage to have the power to get through this hippie mulch and and to tell us just one thing  
**1:10:49-1:10:57:**  we need the soil is telling us that you need to cover it with green not with brown and  
**1:10:57-1:11:03:**  then we have to listen to what the soil is telling us because of course a rhizome start  
**1:11:03-1:11:11:**  to become a sort of interesting interesting crop to deal with because it grows very fast  
**1:11:11-1:11:16:**  has got a lot of energy a lot of energy I mean we have sorghum alepense that if you  
**1:11:16-1:11:22:**  don't cut it it has got these huge rhizomes and if you don't cut it in in two three weeks  
**1:11:22-1:11:32:**  it reaches like two two meters high it's a c4 beautiful biomass but very very aggressive  
**1:11:32-1:11:40:**  yeah you don't see your your apples anymore if you let it grow of course I can go and  
**1:11:40-1:11:48:**  cut it many times but I I can't I can't pay 10 people that spend their time in cutting  
**1:11:48-1:11:57:**  the grass is uneconomical when we will have someone paying us for for ecological services  
**1:11:57-1:12:04:**  yeah then I will have people cutting the grass all the time and putting it on the ground  
**1:12:04-1:12:11:**  but now is not possible yet that's something that will challenge a lot of people's understanding  
**1:12:11-1:12:19:**  I think what you just said but if you have such a if you have the need for a green living  
**1:12:19-1:12:26:**  plants on the tree line to regenerate the soil and activate the system how do you then  
**1:12:26-1:12:34:**  manage for weeding which you know this is a one of the huge problems and costs of labor  
**1:12:34-1:12:41:**  costs of of biological or ecological agriculture how would you manage that in the in this case  
**1:12:41-1:12:49:**  it all depends from the from system to system I will change strategy dramatically like in  
**1:12:49-1:12:55:**  our case what we will be planting under the system it will be because we tried it and  
**1:12:55-1:13:00:**  it is beautiful and it's working perfectly in small spots but now we already reproduce  
**1:13:00-1:13:11:**  thousands of plants of rhubarb of horseradish of of comfrey yeah there will be the three  
**1:13:11-1:13:19:**  main herbaceous layer crop which for us is not just a matter of cutting the grass and  
**1:13:19-1:13:26:**  letting there it will be a produce we can choose we can choose to harvest it and sell  
**1:13:26-1:13:39:**  it harvest it and preserve yeah like make preserves and and and jams and and so on so  
**1:13:39-1:13:44:**  they're all perennial plants as well right and so you're using plants to prevent the  
**1:13:44-1:13:51:**  weeds from growing yeah yeah we we in our experience for example either with rhubarb  
**1:13:51-1:13:57:**  and with horseradish they grow to a perfect height that stimulates the the berries to  
**1:13:57-1:14:06:**  grow a little bit a little bit taller but then nothing grows under them it's just like  
**1:14:06-1:14:14:**  rhubarb but also horseradish they're just perfect crops perfect because I could we could  
**1:14:14-1:14:27:**  choose a creepy time a creepy marjoram and all those covering herbs but they're not tall  
**1:14:27-1:14:39:**  enough and they promote the arrival of mediterranean sea for rhizomatos how to say like plants  
**1:14:39-1:14:45:**  that have rhizomes that will grow through and most of the time will will will give lots  
**1:14:45-1:14:52:**  of problems of course I can't sell I could create a market of thousands of kilos of of  
**1:14:52-1:15:06:**  marjoram dry marjoram but again is is is not so easy as maybe rhubarb or or or straddish  
**1:15:06-1:15:11:**  so the first year you would prepare your lines and you know plant the trees and you would  
**1:15:11-1:15:16:**  put vegetables the first year and only the second year start establishing more perennial  
**1:15:16-1:15:20:**  crops and your herbaceous layer or are you saying that establishing this the first year  
**1:15:20-1:15:28:**  as an alternative to potatoes or corn or the the other vegetables we mentioned it depends  
**1:15:28-1:15:37:**  what soil rich soil yeah go go straight straight with the those perennial crops perennial herbaceous  
**1:15:37-1:15:44:**  later layer if there are there's not enough fertility in the soil then start with the  
**1:15:44-1:15:52:**  annuals you you keep a shallow a shallow root layer so you don't give too many trouble to  
**1:15:52-1:16:00:**  to the young fruit trees which is in in the first year they're a little bit more delicate  
**1:16:00-1:16:06:**  and then from the second year on you will be planting perennial ones I mean now we are  
**1:16:06-1:16:15:**  entering we will be in the four year I think we are in the four year of our orchard and  
**1:16:15-1:16:21:**  we will be planting them this autumn I could have planted them before but we don't have  
**1:16:21-1:16:28:**  time super interesting so you know now we we've talked extensively of the orchards and  
**1:16:28-1:16:34:**  I was wondering if you could present to us you know your silvopasture systems that we  
**1:16:34-1:16:39:**  haven't you know touched upon yet either and yeah start again with a bit of an overview  
**1:16:39-1:16:51:**  of the systems the the species you chose and the breeds and yeah the the silvopasture systems  
**1:16:51-1:16:59:**  are still very very young and most of them we still have to plant them what we have now  
**1:16:59-1:17:12:**  at the moment planted is a is a young like two years old hazelnut orchard diamond shaped  
**1:17:12-1:17:19:**  planted with like diamond shapes or like the hexagon with four meter distance between each  
**1:17:19-1:17:26:**  tree and on the slopes because we have many slopes very steep slopes and we want to manage  
**1:17:26-1:17:34:**  them now with machinery but with animals but we also want to have a tree crops so the sheep  
**1:17:34-1:17:41:**  which are light will be managing to already we did already tryouts to deal with the with  
**1:17:41-1:17:50:**  the pasture with the hazelnut how to call them shoots yeah that are growing from from  
**1:17:50-1:17:54:**  the base that normally you have to go and cut them but the sheep will do the job the  
**1:17:54-1:18:05:**  sheep will prune the hazelnut leaves as as far as it will reach them in height and then  
**1:18:05-1:18:14:**  we'll have this beautiful sort of free flow free airflow layer at the bottom of the hazelnut  
**1:18:14-1:18:20:**  which is a crop that really needs a lot of air which is very prone to many many many  
**1:18:20-1:18:27:**  fungal and bacterial diseases so we need that we need to keep the grass low either for to  
**1:18:27-1:18:36:**  decrease the amount of moisture coming from the transpiration at the same time to reduce  
**1:18:36-1:18:47:**  water splashing and and to have clear grass when we have to harvest the hazelnuts we will  
**1:18:47-1:18:54:**  be planting I wanted to do it before top canopy in between the hazelnuts to have a little  
**1:18:54-1:19:01:**  bit of shade on the hazelnuts which are of course an edge tree if you want to produce  
**1:19:01-1:19:06:**  them otherwise they can also be in full shade but they don't produce much or they don't  
**1:19:06-1:19:16:**  produce anything and that's the hazelnut hazelnut sheep plus top layer which ideally I would  
**1:19:16-1:19:25:**  like to to have conifers like cedars like we planted we we have some Siberian night  
**1:19:25-1:19:32:**  not how do you call them Siberian pine nuts trees but they will take like ages to grow  
**1:19:32-1:19:44:**  so I don't I don't even say that we have been planting them 30 years time they will be growing  
**1:19:44-1:19:48:**  actually I have to choose but we have lots of pollonias that we we we still have to plant  
**1:19:48-1:19:54:**  so probably we start with pollonias and then we will plant cedars which are growing very  
**1:19:54-1:20:03:**  fast and they're beautiful trees and yeah for that system that's it not not much more  
**1:20:03-1:20:11:**  then we have the the walnut grove one they already have three years there they will be  
**1:20:11-1:20:18:**  growing quite tall I am preferring more and more the idea of a mono axis tree a little  
**1:20:18-1:20:29:**  bit like you do in commercial apple orchards so not vase but mono axis between the trees  
**1:20:29-1:20:36:**  we started to plant mulberries and caragon arboracians Siberian fish rub in order to  
**1:20:36-1:20:47:**  have high protein for the sheep the funny thing about the mulberry is that we will be  
**1:20:47-1:21:00:**  having a center trunk with the walnut trees spaced seven eight meters between them depending  
**1:21:00-1:21:07:**  on the on the part on the on the place where we are on the farm or on the terraces and  
**1:21:07-1:21:13:**  in between then one mulberry tree we will be growing two main or horizontal branches  
**1:21:13-1:21:20:**  at a 40 centimeter height from the ground so parallel going growing toward the walnuts  
**1:21:20-1:21:30:**  it would be then a a T a T letter with a very short leg and then from there on we will be  
**1:21:30-1:21:39:**  grow like cordons like with a grape and then every year from let's say the multiple pollard  
**1:21:39-1:21:46:**  heads on these long horizontal branches we will grow the fruiting branches we will harvest  
**1:21:46-1:21:56:**  the fruits when the fruits will be harvested sheep comes in eat the leaves we leave a resting  
**1:21:56-1:22:05:**  time leaves grows back sheep comes in second time it's very fresh high protein protein  
**1:22:05-1:22:13:**  leaves and then in the winter time we will be cutting again down to the pollard the head  
**1:22:13-1:22:22:**  every single branch let's say we will have a pollard head on the main branch every 25  
**1:22:22-1:22:34:**  30 centimeters spacing and every now and then on the length of on this four meters of cordon  
**1:22:34-1:22:42:**  we will have some cordon that will go in the ground in order to have support roots either  
**1:22:42-1:22:51:**  to keep the the the cordon at the right height at the same time to feed to feed with the  
**1:22:51-1:22:57:**  with the with the more roots the whole system great I just wanted to ask because you've  
**1:22:57-1:23:03:**  mentioned a few times you know the nutritional value of leaves and of trees so I think maybe  
**1:23:03-1:23:07:**  this is the right moment to go a bit more in depth in there and maybe you can explain  
**1:23:07-1:23:14:**  to us what is so beneficial of including fodder from trees into the the animals diet first  
**1:23:14-1:23:25:**  the animals they they doing grace on the ground so the the amount of parasite intake is really  
**1:23:25-1:23:34:**  very low secondary a perennial tree it can grow like like mulberry for example it can  
**1:23:34-1:23:46:**  grow very very extended roots system and by by that it just multiplies the amount of minerals  
**1:23:46-1:23:55:**  and the amount of biochemical produce that are are stored then in the leaves mulberry  
**1:23:55-1:24:06:**  it has it can reach six percent more protein than alfalfa wow but it's more digestible  
**1:24:06-1:24:15:**  it has got double the amount of the minerals and you don't have to plant it every four  
**1:24:15-1:24:25:**  years so it's just I see it because now managing the sheep and the donkeys and but also in  
**1:24:25-1:24:32:**  all the years of experience around the world I see that the first thing that animals will  
**1:24:32-1:24:39:**  go to eat when you move them we move them three four times a day the first thing that  
**1:24:39-1:24:46:**  will be eating it would be bush tree and tree leaves if they can if there are any if they're  
**1:24:46-1:24:54:**  reachable annual lights how to say annual weeds because there are dynamic accumulators  
**1:24:54-1:25:01:**  they are very rich in protein they are very easy to digest because no lignin no anti-nutritional  
**1:25:01-1:25:12:**  uh anti-nutritional compounds and uh and after the grass and and then yeah grass and and  
**1:25:12-1:25:19:**  forbs so it's very interesting like we we we think that the grazers they are grazers  
**1:25:19-1:25:29:**  but they're the browsers I mean the rumen evolved also to deal with lots of biochemical  
**1:25:29-1:25:36:**  anti-nutritional biochemical products that the trees and the bushes had in order to prevent  
**1:25:36-1:25:44:**  an over consumption of of of that tree then it's very important to choose the right tree  
**1:25:44-1:25:52:**  trees it's very important to have in in an alternative tree fodder system is important  
**1:25:52-1:26:02:**  to have trees with high tanning levels like for example chestnuts which are very very  
**1:26:02-1:26:09:**  digestible leaves at the same time it's very important to have elders it's very important  
**1:26:09-1:26:14:**  to have smaller amount of toxics because they're important for the animal for the for the health  
**1:26:14-1:26:28:**  of the gut system of the rumen system against parasites and following this idea we we nearly  
**1:26:28-1:26:36:**  have finished by putting down a consortium of around 10 different tree species that we  
**1:26:36-1:26:45:**  want to have on lines repeating them for every single move of the animals so every single  
**1:26:45-1:26:53:**  micropad dog where we are moving the animals being it's one day move being it three day  
**1:26:53-1:26:59:**  at three times a day move they always have to find those 10 trees that will that will  
**1:26:59-1:27:09:**  give them a free choice high nutrient high protein level high digestible sugars high  
**1:27:09-1:27:18:**  selenium high calcium and magnesium high tannins and all those very important produce that  
**1:27:18-1:27:27:**  the animals are trying to find desperately I mean we are managing animals in a very unnatural  
**1:27:27-1:27:35:**  way animals would walk for kilometers in order to have a particular mineral in order to have  
**1:27:35-1:27:45:**  a particular toxin that allows them to get rid of lysis ticks of ascaris parasite in  
**1:27:45-1:27:50:**  the in the in the guts and what we do we keep them in a small system where they can't find  
**1:27:50-1:28:00:**  they can't find what they need so in order to get what the animal needs we have to create  
**1:28:00-1:28:07:**  in every single move what the animal would find in in like a one kilometer move because  
**1:28:07-1:28:12:**  in nature animal keep on moving eat a little bit of that a little bit of that a little  
**1:28:12-1:28:20:**  bit of that and it happens that at the end of the day one herbivore ate 250 different  
**1:28:20-1:28:27:**  species can you imagine just us eating rice or eating rice and meat and butter and this  
**1:28:27-1:28:34:**  and this and that you just get so many more nutrients and so many more produce that that  
**1:28:34-1:28:40:**  that your body needs to maintain and to express the full genetics potential  
**1:28:40-1:28:47:**  I can't even imagine what this meat must taste like and I don't even know if in my life I've  
**1:28:47-1:28:53:**  been able to taste meat that has had such a good diet well maybe deer meat but do they  
**1:28:53-1:28:57:**  even have access to so much diversity when they're in the forest and the forest is often  
**1:28:57-1:29:01:**  it's managed forest where there's mostly oak and not a lot of other species because they've  
**1:29:01-1:29:07:**  been yeah selected you know what I mean so it's I don't even I wouldn't even expect deer  
**1:29:07-1:29:16:**  to have such a high mineral such a big selection of food but when you're looking at these the  
**1:29:16-1:29:21:**  animals and you know they're gonna have a mixed diet of pasture and fodder trees when  
**1:29:21-1:29:26:**  the trees grow when the system evolves what's going to be the impact on the pastures the  
**1:29:26-1:29:31:**  past you're gonna little by little kind of lose strength and it's not gonna have an impact  
**1:29:31-1:29:37:**  on the proportion that the animal of the of the of the diet of the animal no no father  
**1:29:37-1:29:43:**  and pasture do you know what I mean not at all because all those so-called trees they  
**1:29:43-1:29:53:**  will be managed as bushes so we will not let them grow in order to have high quality high  
**1:29:53-1:30:02:**  digestible fiber high protein you need to keep those trees with like one year maximum  
**1:30:02-1:30:08:**  two years old branches yeah so it's gonna look like some kind of because you also mentioned  
**1:30:08-1:30:12:**  that there was gonna be hazelnuts in some areas and and and paulownia it's gonna look  
**1:30:12-1:30:19:**  more like a savannah system with some trees growing tall and but with enough light or  
**1:30:19-1:30:28:**  going or yeah is that correct yeah yeah the the the like shade trees they are necessary  
**1:30:28-1:30:40:**  because most of the time animals they they stay under a tree yeah so like I'm not gonna  
**1:30:40-1:30:49:**  go deep into the relation between animal and and tree yeah I'm not gonna go very deep into  
**1:30:49-1:30:54:**  that because I could speak 10 years just about that that thing is one of the most exciting  
**1:30:54-1:31:06:**  and amazing thing on planet earth but remember that the cow that has got shade it will be  
**1:31:06-1:31:18:**  able to increase its own weight by 150 to 100 grams per day when a cow without shade  
**1:31:18-1:31:25:**  would not increase the weight but lose the weight yeah so shade is it's like food you  
**1:31:25-1:31:34:**  give them shade to eat because ruminants especially ruminants the animals with the with the rumen  
**1:31:34-1:31:42:**  they have to pass most or or a big part of their time ruminating so you have to give  
**1:31:42-1:31:48:**  them the right amount of food they finish the pasture they finish the trees that they  
**1:31:48-1:31:54:**  have in that small paddock they go under their tree they they they they make a good use of  
**1:31:54-1:32:02:**  what you gave them to eat yeah yeah but you need the tree shade that's very important  
**1:32:02-1:32:09:**  now we don't have trees that make shade in the whole property so we just build a movable  
**1:32:09-1:32:16:**  a movable shelter that we move on skids but eventually in few years we will be having  
**1:32:16-1:32:20:**  shade all over the place it's just amazing this relation between animals and shade it  
**1:32:20-1:32:27:**  just makes me crazy I really hope we can we can get back into that one day whether on  
**1:32:27-1:32:31:**  the podcast or you know when we come and visit to you but this is kind of it's really fascinating  
**1:32:31-1:32:38:**  stuff and yeah it's very exciting yeah I was thinking because we are constrained by time  
**1:32:38-1:32:44:**  maybe we can discuss a bit the management around you know integrating animals and trees  
**1:32:44-1:32:51:**  one aspect being you know planting the trees and protection that has to go in there and  
**1:32:51-1:32:56:**  then yeah just general interaction and you know a bit similar to what we explored in  
**1:32:56-1:33:01:**  the orchards and how that complexifies things how does that express itself in the sort of  
**1:33:01-1:33:11:**  pastoral system very complex very very very complex animals like trees yeah animal like  
**1:33:11-1:33:18:**  trees and and you want to have trees but you don't want to have animals which are eating  
**1:33:18-1:33:25:**  those trees at least while they're they're they're growing so with fruit trees we are  
**1:33:25-1:33:31:**  still trying to understand what to do but I think the the simplest thing and the most  
**1:33:31-1:33:37:**  intelligent thing if if I would go back four years time on the tree lines where we have  
**1:33:37-1:33:44:**  planted most of the trees on a free vertical axis when we are talking about like sort of  
**1:33:44-1:33:55:**  solax system on apples and and and pears and vase shape on the dropache family like plums  
**1:33:55-1:34:06:**  and peaches and and and apricots I would do everything espalier so be dimensional no natural  
**1:34:06-1:34:15:**  shape I want to produce fruits and I will have everything on on a let's say 30 40 centimeter  
**1:34:15-1:34:26:**  wide line in this way I will be managing to keep animals between the lines if if I need  
**1:34:26-1:34:36:**  and if I want all my very high fruit production on the on the on the fruit lines and the level  
**1:34:36-1:34:42:**  that of complexity or with herbaceous layer and bush layer and and top canopy layer that  
**1:34:42-1:34:50:**  I want to have but yeah like espalier is is the simplest tricep I could tell you what  
**1:34:50-1:34:57:**  you could use to protect the trunk you could have particular nets electric nets you could  
**1:34:57-1:35:07:**  spray some some produce that repoles repoles the the the animals but the simplest thing  
**1:35:07-1:35:17:**  is to change the shape of the tree and to to not not to to use too much space is this  
**1:35:17-1:35:23:**  why you're not integrating the animals into the orchard or are you integrating them there  
**1:35:23-1:35:31:**  we we are we are experimenting we are experimenting but it's okay with with with the bigger breeds  
**1:35:31-1:35:44:**  of of sheep which are fat and and and and low is not good with the donkeys so is is  
**1:35:44-1:35:52:**  is good with those sheep like sapphock like texel like blue flay blue face lyser under  
**1:35:52-1:35:59:**  the apricots under the the plums under the the peaches yeah but it's not good with the  
**1:35:59-1:36:05:**  apples because apple has got a vertical axis with very I mean you know how is make the  
**1:36:05-1:36:13:**  vertical vertical axis with the you have a one central trunk and from the bottom of the  
**1:36:13-1:36:20:**  tree you have the bottom branches which are coming out horizontally quite a lot like a  
**1:36:20-1:36:27:**  meter or meter 20 and it's just like a conifer and while you you get to the top the branches  
**1:36:27-1:36:33:**  they become shorter and shorter and you understand that if you have at the bottom at the mouth  
**1:36:33-1:36:42:**  height productive branches you can even put a net so you have to to you will have nets  
**1:36:42-1:36:48:**  which will be starting like electric nets which will be starting from the end of those  
**1:36:48-1:36:53:**  low branches that it means that you have very little space between one tree line and the  
**1:36:53-1:37:03:**  other tree line this is complex this is why I don't know for for how long we'll be keeping  
**1:37:03-1:37:10:**  the animals in that orchard but we will see we'll see Matthew I wanted to ask a quick  
**1:37:10-1:37:16:**  question well it's not a quick I mean the answer won't be quick but given in keeping  
**1:37:16-1:37:22:**  in mind that we have been taking your time for a long time how you know to what extent  
**1:37:22-1:37:27:**  does the selection of the breeds of the sheep you integrate what role does it play because  
**1:37:27-1:37:32:**  I know that certain sheep breeds are preferred in orchard management for example and since  
**1:37:32-1:37:37:**  you you started the talk talking to us about your genetics and your flock and the breeds  
**1:37:37-1:37:47:**  do you have anything to say about that I still don't have enough experience on this like  
**1:37:47-1:37:53:**  genetics is something extremely complex I don't come from a from a breeder or or or  
**1:37:53-1:38:04:**  a farming family as far as I know as far as I could observe like the the Shropshire sheep  
**1:38:04-1:38:12:**  it seems to be the the most appropriate for fruit orchards or Christmas trees operations  
**1:38:12-1:38:27:**  otherwise what I would do I would I would choose a fat low berry center animal so with  
**1:38:27-1:38:36:**  the neck it will not manage to to get to to high it will be not like we have this awesome  
**1:38:36-1:38:43:**  sheep which are like dwarf ships we just like like a little evils like amazing browsers  
**1:38:43-1:38:51:**  just they're just like goats but they they can pass through a hole like a rat and and  
**1:38:51-1:38:57:**  they will go and eat the first thing they will do they will eat the bark of your trunks  
**1:38:57-1:39:03:**  those ships where we are selling them so they are not right for our system we wanted to  
**1:39:03-1:39:10:**  try because we have we had different these but they are not appropriate then yeah I think  
**1:39:10-1:39:22:**  big and not tall but big fat wide wide wide shape sheep will be the the choice which are  
**1:39:22-1:39:29:**  very docile very calm they will not they will not go through the fence they are they are  
**1:39:29-1:39:35:**  very good animals they we never found them out the fence and now we have is quite a bit  
**1:39:35-1:39:43:**  of time that we have them and yeah not tall animals this is very important cool Matteo  
**1:39:43-1:39:50:**  you've given us so much information to for people for everybody listening to think about  
**1:39:50-1:39:57:**  analyze probably even take notes this is how detailed this your answers were so we wanted  
**1:39:57-1:40:03:**  to move to the last kind of questions that we that we ask people firstly what's the next  
**1:40:03-1:40:07:**  big projects at Isidé what are you in the next few years in the medium term how are  
**1:40:07-1:40:17:**  you expecting things to change and to evolve well I think consolidating what is working  
**1:40:17-1:40:30:**  and and and rearranging the systems especially where they haven't been working properly and  
**1:40:30-1:40:38:**  hopefully not hopefully actually we just received a permit to to to build the farm structures  
**1:40:38-1:40:48:**  and I think one very important part will be to to start how to say not really a restaurant  
**1:40:48-1:40:59:**  operation but where food will be prepared and served to people in a manner that will  
**1:40:59-1:41:07:**  will give to the produce of those systems more value because the people will be eating  
**1:41:07-1:41:14:**  those produce of course that will be cooked in in our commercial kitchen that will be  
**1:41:14-1:41:21:**  eating them in complex systems and I mean there are many ideas many many things that  
**1:41:21-1:41:31:**  we we we want to develop but systems we will be planting definitely what we haven't been  
**1:41:31-1:41:40:**  managing up to now apple and pear orchard for cider making and there I still have to  
**1:41:40-1:41:46:**  understand what type of complexity we want to have because the apple orchard we have  
**1:41:46-1:41:57:**  is is a has got a very simple consortium with the the honey the honey locust in between  
**1:41:57-1:42:07:**  every apple tree and then of course the king of the kings or the queen of the queens the  
**1:42:07-1:42:14:**  chestnut which is to me the the best crop on planet earth and I will have to manage  
**1:42:14-1:42:26:**  to to plant it on very alkaline soil and and to and to to reach this beautiful glow globos  
**1:42:26-1:42:34:**  rounded shape very sexy I think is the most sexy I can imagine the sheep underneath grazing  
**1:42:34-1:42:42:**  as well it's gonna be a beautiful scene it is amazing it's amazing so yeah as you know  
**1:42:42-1:42:48:**  we'll be talking to many different farmers and people involved in agroforestry on the  
**1:42:48-1:42:54:**  podcast what kind of topics or questions would you like to hear about on the podcast and  
**1:42:54-1:43:04:**  would you like us to explore what would you be interested in listening to  
**1:43:04-1:43:12:**  anything anything failures I want to hear about failures I want to hear about what doesn't  
**1:43:12-1:43:26:**  work in a system and and then to understand how people go through the solving the solving  
**1:43:26-1:43:32:**  process I would like to hear about system that works from an economical point of view  
**1:43:32-1:43:40:**  I would like to hear about systems of not heroes but but farmers that it means that  
**1:43:40-1:43:49:**  when when farmers will be speaking it it will meaning that the system will be compatible  
**1:43:49-1:44:00:**  for the most of the landscape I like to hear more about of course the whole thing about  
**1:44:00-1:44:08:**  nutritional the nutritional subject when we are speaking about for the trees and we are  
**1:44:08-1:44:15:**  speaking about perennial perennial nuts and and animals that are growing and and grazing  
**1:44:15-1:44:27:**  under a very rich silvopasture system and I would like to hear about the ways to give  
**1:44:27-1:44:35:**  more importance from economical point of view to the ecosystem services which we are delivering  
**1:44:35-1:44:45:**  to the society which we are delivering to degraded land and and they have to be valued  
**1:44:45-1:44:54:**  because if I if I don't produce erosion if I if my soil absorbs all the water that fells  
**1:44:54-1:45:09:**  from the sky and it doesn't it doesn't create how do you say in English it doesn't increase  
**1:45:09-1:45:13:**  the amount of water of rivers and and and the water course is creating here in Italy  
**1:45:13-1:45:20:**  is always the rule every every year creating huge problems to infrastructures to to railroads  
**1:45:20-1:45:27:**  to to to cities and and so on I want to be paid for that because I put more energy I  
**1:45:27-1:45:34:**  put more resources in order to stop that erosion in order to infiltrate the that water in the  
**1:45:34-1:45:42:**  deep ground and we have to be valued not just for the quality of our produce but also for  
**1:45:42-1:45:50:**  the quality of the environment of our farms and and and and the environment that becomes  
**1:45:50-1:45:58:**  better and better thanks to our farms listen I know there's a lot of people working on  
**1:45:58-1:46:04:**  this and I did my master's thesis on payment for ecosystem services so I know a few years  
**1:46:04-1:46:07:**  ago it wasn't quite there yet but a lot of people are working on it so we'll make sure  
**1:46:07-1:46:14:**  we we go and talk to some people and understand where we're at but in any case I mean thank  
**1:46:14-1:46:20:**  you so much for your time it's been a real privilege to have all this information and  
**1:46:20-1:46:25:**  especially in the busy summer months having worked on farms ourselves we we don't take  
**1:46:25-1:46:31:**  this lightly we really understand how precious time is so thanks for allocating it to this  
**1:46:31-1:46:36:**  podcast thank you sorry for my Italian English and  
**1:46:36-1:46:45:**  from the chaotic thoughts but but it's all about complexity and complexity is chaotic  
**1:46:45-1:46:56:**  so it's also good to not understand anything or understand everything I think the the complexity  
**1:46:56-1:47:03:**  of our systems makes us makes us more complex and is important to become polycultural in  
**1:47:03-1:47:11:**  our brain rather than monoculture so thank you for the for what you're doing and have  
**1:47:11-1:47:18:**  a nice day if you've made it this far thank you so much for listening to this episode

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 16:09:05)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:45:**  Hello everyone and welcome back to the podcast.  
**0:00:45-0:00:50:**  Well today we're very excited to share with you our interview with Adolfo Rosati from  
**0:00:50-0:00:53:**  Localitale Piano in Centraliti.  
**0:00:53-0:00:57:**  I really hope our listeners, Italian listeners can forgive my pronunciation.  
**0:00:57-0:01:02:**  What I find great about this episode are the many insights he gives us on finding a balance  
**0:01:02-0:01:07:**  between the diversity that comes with agroforestry on one hand and on the other the necessity  
**0:01:07-0:01:13:**  to maintain a certain economy of scale in your productions to avoid overstretching yourself.  
**0:01:13-0:01:17:**  Through his years of experience he's able to give us tangible examples and advice on  
**0:01:17-0:01:21:**  different strategies to navigate bureaucratic constraints but also on the best approach  
**0:01:21-0:01:23:**  to start a farm.  
**0:01:23-0:01:27:**  Personally I came out very inspired and with a lot of things to think about.  
**0:01:27-0:01:33:**  I really enjoyed his make sense farming approach where trees, animals and other crops are elegantly  
**0:01:33-0:01:40:**  combined to optimize for efficiency all whilst providing diversity to his local clients.  
**0:01:40-0:01:45:**  Adolfo shows us how to take advantage of the symbiotic relationships between farm elements  
**0:01:45-0:01:48:**  also explaining to us how technical and challenging this can be.  
**0:01:48-0:01:54:**  I love it how with small farms you really see creativity of integrating trees on farms  
**0:01:54-0:02:00:**  which may be more difficult to express to such a large extent on larger operations.  
**0:02:00-0:02:04:**  But regardless of this in my opinion it remains a real source of inspiration for whatever  
**0:02:04-0:02:09:**  the scale with elements that can be cherry picked to fit different contexts.  
**0:02:09-0:02:12:**  So without further ado let's get into it.  
**0:02:12-0:02:14:**  Welcome to the podcast Adolfo.  
**0:02:14-0:02:16:**  Thank you.  
**0:02:16-0:02:17:**  Thanks for joining us.  
**0:02:17-0:02:22:**  Thank you for giving us your time in this busy period.  
**0:02:22-0:02:29:**  And maybe as a beginning you could start by introducing yourself as well as your farm  
**0:02:29-0:02:30:**  and the project.  
**0:02:30-0:02:31:**  Sure.  
**0:02:31-0:02:33:**  My name is Adolfo Rosati.  
**0:02:33-0:02:41:**  I live in Italy and I dreamed of being a farmer as a kid and I didn't have a farm so I had  
**0:02:41-0:02:42:**  to find another job.  
**0:02:42-0:02:48:**  I thought I might as well be a scientist and study plants so that when I would have my  
**0:02:48-0:02:50:**  farm I would have some knowledge.  
**0:02:50-0:02:51:**  And so I did.  
**0:02:51-0:02:57:**  I studied agriculture and high school and university and then I became a researcher  
**0:02:57-0:02:58:**  and I studied agriculture.  
**0:02:58-0:03:07:**  And in one of my trips to the United States I met my wife who was also interested in animals  
**0:03:07-0:03:14:**  and she would be, as a kid she would draw stables to optimize the space for keeping  
**0:03:14-0:03:15:**  her cows and pigs.  
**0:03:15-0:03:23:**  And so we decided to have a farm together and because by then I had purchased some land  
**0:03:23-0:03:26:**  in Italy we decided to have a farm in Italy.  
**0:03:26-0:03:32:**  And so now I still work in research but when I go home I help my wife who's a full time  
**0:03:32-0:03:38:**  farmer and this is how we got to have a farm in Umbria in the middle of Italy.  
**0:03:38-0:03:44:**  And how did you then get to know agroforestry or did you get a specific interest in agroforestry?  
**0:03:44-0:03:53:**  Well as a scientist and a farmer-to-be I had land in a marginal area in the mountains and  
**0:03:53-0:03:57:**  everything I studied like growing corn and growing wheat it just wouldn't work in my  
**0:03:57-0:03:58:**  land.  
**0:03:58-0:04:04:**  There was no way I could make any money or a living growing corn on a place with incredible  
**0:04:04-0:04:08:**  slopes and very un-fertile soils.  
**0:04:08-0:04:16:**  Clearly I had to find some niche crops with higher value that could be interesting in  
**0:04:16-0:04:21:**  a farm that doesn't have the fertility necessary for the conventional crops.  
**0:04:21-0:04:26:**  And also I planted olives in a field and I realized it would take 20 years for them to  
**0:04:26-0:04:33:**  fill the space and I thought this is not practical, not good.  
**0:04:33-0:04:38:**  I need to use the space with something in the middle at least during the time the olives  
**0:04:38-0:04:39:**  are growing.  
**0:04:39-0:04:44:**  So I started planting small fruits like corns and blackberries.  
**0:04:44-0:04:49:**  I started planting the wild blackberries because they were the most suited to the area.  
**0:04:49-0:04:52:**  They grew without any help from outside.  
**0:04:52-0:04:57:**  And then I thought about the wild asparagus which grows spontaneously in my area but it's  
**0:04:57-0:05:01:**  sold on the market and no one grew it, no one cultivated it.  
**0:05:01-0:05:06:**  So I decided to plant asparagus under the trees because there was plenty of light available  
**0:05:06-0:05:12:**  and to combine things to get higher production out of the same land but in a sustainable  
**0:05:12-0:05:13:**  way.  
**0:05:13-0:05:19:**  And so I started practicing this which later on as I kept reading and studying I discovered  
**0:05:19-0:05:24:**  some other people call permaculture, some other people call agroforestry.  
**0:05:24-0:05:30:**  And so I realized what I was doing was agroforestry, I just didn't have the same name for it.  
**0:05:30-0:05:35:**  And when I discovered this I became interested in acting in agroforestry both as a farmer  
**0:05:35-0:05:37:**  and as a scientist.  
**0:05:37-0:05:45:**  And so I went to the Second World Agroforestry Conference in Kenya and I met people.  
**0:05:45-0:05:54:**  And I decided to found a European agroforestry organization which became EURAF, the European  
**0:05:54-0:05:58:**  Agroforestry Federation of which I am one of the founders.  
**0:05:58-0:06:05:**  And so basically since then I had a name for what I was doing and I had an opportunity  
**0:06:05-0:06:11:**  to learn more about it and how to do it and how to do it better and why it made sense.  
**0:06:11-0:06:17:**  And since then I've been working on it both as a scientist and as a farmer.  
**0:06:17-0:06:22:**  And so I would say that most of what we do in our farm nowadays could probably be qualified  
**0:06:22-0:06:24:**  under the name of agroforestry.  
**0:06:24-0:06:31:**  I love the fact that you kind of discovered agroforestry just out of practical observation  
**0:06:31-0:06:36:**  and just doing things in a logical manner and it's pretty cool that it happened in that  
**0:06:36-0:06:37:**  order actually.  
**0:06:37-0:06:44:**  I must admit that I am cautious with the user names because I feel like after all it's all  
**0:06:44-0:06:53:**  agriculture and often times there might not be need for a name or for a brand and I often  
**0:06:53-0:07:02:**  see people practicing certain kinds of farming being more interested in adhering to the brand  
**0:07:02-0:07:10:**  name or to the specific of that classification whereas I think from a farmer's perspective  
**0:07:10-0:07:16:**  we just want to know how to farm better in a more sustainable way both economically and  
**0:07:16-0:07:22:**  environmentally and we might not necessarily care what other people call this.  
**0:07:22-0:07:33:**  And so I'm conscious to feel strongly about the name rather I'm interested in whatever  
**0:07:33-0:07:38:**  any technique can offer to a farmer and call it agroforestry or whatever doesn't really  
**0:07:38-0:07:40:**  matter as much.  
**0:07:40-0:07:46:**  Though I like the agroforestry community because of the many different brand names that I heard,  
**0:07:46-0:07:55:**  it seems to be one of the most scientifically based practice or environment and so I like  
**0:07:55-0:08:04:**  to stick to facts and good ideas and so agroforestry seems to be a good environment for my way  
**0:08:04-0:08:12:**  of thinking but I'm happy to call it any other thing or not care about the name and just  
**0:08:12-0:08:15:**  follow the good practice for the good farm.  
**0:08:15-0:08:19:**  I think we can relate to that because with Dimitri we've often had the same conversation  
**0:08:19-0:08:23:**  about regenerative agriculture for example and these different terminologies but maybe  
**0:08:23-0:08:28:**  we'll have some time to get back to this because it's a really interesting topic but before  
**0:08:28-0:08:33:**  we do that maybe can you give us a bit of an overview of the farm then in terms of your  
**0:08:33-0:08:37:**  local context, what are your main products and where you sell them?  
**0:08:37-0:08:43:**  Yes of course the farm is you might say in the mountains the elevation is not very high  
**0:08:43-0:08:48:**  but it feels like you're in the mountains because the valley is very narrow and it's  
**0:08:48-0:08:54:**  just surrounded by mountains so the fields are really steep.  
**0:08:54-0:09:00:**  Our place is called Il Piano and you might wonder where the piano means the flat area  
**0:09:00-0:09:06:**  is and that's because it's a small piece like you know 0.1 hectares in front of our house  
**0:09:06-0:09:11:**  which is flat and it's such an exception that it gives the name to the place and so our  
**0:09:11-0:09:17:**  fields are sloped and this also means that fertility slope because you're in the mountains  
**0:09:17-0:09:25:**  the soil is not it does not come from different sources and it's not necessarily very deep  
**0:09:25-0:09:27:**  most of the time.  
**0:09:27-0:09:34:**  So about nowadays we have a little over 30 hectares and a little bit more than half of  
**0:09:34-0:09:44:**  this is forests and the other half was abandoned field that were slowly brought back to cultivation  
**0:09:44-0:09:50:**  and we on the main one of these we planted a collection of fruit trees because one of  
**0:09:50-0:09:57:**  our dreams was to save ancient varieties and to collect any other varieties to gather data  
**0:09:57-0:10:00:**  about what grows well in our area.  
**0:10:00-0:10:05:**  Our idea is that if you don't want to use a lot of external inputs and you want to have  
**0:10:05-0:10:12:**  a more sustainable farming you need to adapt to what grows in your area and this is a concept  
**0:10:12-0:10:16:**  that should translate also in the relationship with consumers.  
**0:10:16-0:10:22:**  Consumers should consume what is available on that farm and not buy in what I call a  
**0:10:22-0:10:27:**  capricious manner whatever suits your fancy just because it can be available.  
**0:10:27-0:10:33:**  Like don't eat the strawberries one month before it's time because that entails greenhouses  
**0:10:33-0:10:36:**  eat them when they're ready naturally.  
**0:10:36-0:10:42:**  So our goal was to test as many things as possible so that we would leave a heritage  
**0:10:42-0:10:48:**  of knowledge 10 years 20 years later to whomever wants to use it on what grows there without  
**0:10:48-0:10:49:**  many external inputs.  
**0:10:49-0:10:55:**  So we collected varieties and varieties of fruit trees we have 450 varieties of apples  
**0:10:55-0:11:01:**  and pears and peaches and 80 varieties of figs and persimmons and cherries and black  
**0:11:01-0:11:08:**  and white currants and blackberries and mulberries and unusual things.  
**0:11:08-0:11:14:**  And so part of the land is this mixed orchard.  
**0:11:14-0:11:22:**  Another part, small part is a forest garden where we collected edible but unusual species  
**0:11:22-0:11:28:**  and later can say more about what I feel about forest gardens if you're interested.  
**0:11:28-0:11:34:**  And then part of the land is just fields where animals graze and then animals also graze  
**0:11:34-0:11:37:**  in the forest which is indeed the majority of the land.  
**0:11:37-0:11:44:**  And we also thin the forest to provide forage for the animals and wood for the house so  
**0:11:44-0:11:47:**  that we can keep warm in winter.  
**0:11:47-0:11:49:**  So we have fruits.  
**0:11:49-0:11:54:**  We have two cows from the cows we make many varieties of cheese.  
**0:11:54-0:12:01:**  My wife Darcy has taken a real passion on making cheese and she makes anything from  
**0:12:01-0:12:10:**  blue cheese, gorgonzola to scamorza to mozzarella to ricotta to cachotta and so on, feta and  
**0:12:10-0:12:11:**  so on.  
**0:12:11-0:12:16:**  And so we have a large variety of cheeses, yogurt and milk.  
**0:12:16-0:12:22:**  Of course two cows don't produce much but that's the scale that we like.  
**0:12:22-0:12:28:**  It's like a production for a few families so that would be our family and that's our  
**0:12:28-0:12:29:**  first income.  
**0:12:29-0:12:36:**  We basically don't buy food because we have so many products that we only buy salt and  
**0:12:36-0:12:38:**  few other minor things.  
**0:12:38-0:12:41:**  Everything else basically we eat what we produce.  
**0:12:41-0:12:47:**  And because you use it at the price of a final consumer, that's a non-negligible source of  
**0:12:47-0:12:48:**  income.  
**0:12:48-0:12:54:**  Most people spend close to a thousand euros per month buying food in a family of four  
**0:12:54-0:12:59:**  like ours and we basically spend maybe five percent of that and so that is a source of  
**0:12:59-0:13:00:**  income.  
**0:13:00-0:13:12:**  And then the extra production goes to friends and customers that buy through our WhatsApp  
**0:13:12-0:13:17:**  group so we send a WhatsApp message with what is available and once a week when I go to  
**0:13:17-0:13:23:**  work in town I bring the produce and people come and get it.  
**0:13:23-0:13:28:**  So we have ten sheep that clean the orchard.  
**0:13:28-0:13:33:**  We don't usually milk them and make cheese because that's too much work but occasionally  
**0:13:33-0:13:34:**  we might.  
**0:13:34-0:13:41:**  In other ways we sell lambs and so we have nice vegetable gardens with a lot of different  
**0:13:41-0:13:42:**  variety of things.  
**0:13:42-0:13:47:**  My wife being American means that we often have seeds and varieties of vegetables that  
**0:13:47-0:13:54:**  are not common here so that it's a nice little niche market where people have not seen a  
**0:13:54-0:14:01:**  crook and neck yellow zucchini or a UFO shaped zucchini and this often makes for good sales.  
**0:14:01-0:14:06:**  I must say these new technologies really help the farmers.  
**0:14:06-0:14:14:**  You can send a picture of a nice unusual fruit and everybody wants to buy it because you  
**0:14:14-0:14:15:**  see a nice image.  
**0:14:15-0:14:21:**  So image and telephones and smartphones are really handy and useful for marketing and  
**0:14:21-0:14:23:**  advertising.  
**0:14:23-0:14:31:**  And then we host groups in the farms so we have activities, we offer activities.  
**0:14:31-0:14:35:**  People can come to learn about wild edible weeds.  
**0:14:35-0:14:39:**  So I am a bit specialized in this sector.  
**0:14:39-0:14:44:**  I wrote a couple of books and I take people around the farm showing what is edible, how  
**0:14:44-0:14:50:**  you recognize it and how you cook it and what it is good for and traditions and anecdotes  
**0:14:50-0:14:59:**  about those species and then we end up tasting and eating things made out of these greens  
**0:14:59-0:15:03:**  and that's one activity that we do with groups.  
**0:15:03-0:15:09:**  Others could be go milk the cow, go to the laboratory, make cheese and then turn on the  
**0:15:09-0:15:13:**  wood burning oven and make pizza and use the cheese on top of your pizza.  
**0:15:13-0:15:19:**  So you go from the barn to the table in the same morning and people can experience the  
**0:15:19-0:15:21:**  whole process.  
**0:15:21-0:15:26:**  We might pick grapes and make juice and so we sell activities, we sell fruits and vegetables  
**0:15:26-0:15:34:**  and cheeses and we have an agritourismo with four bedrooms where people can also stay and  
**0:15:34-0:15:40:**  they have two large kitchens where they can buy the produce and cook it by themselves.  
**0:15:40-0:15:43:**  So this is more or less the package of the activities.  
**0:15:43-0:15:48:**  Just to get a sense of the volume of what you produce, as a big, big estimation, how  
**0:15:48-0:15:53:**  many people do you think you sell produce to outside of your family?  
**0:15:53-0:15:59:**  I think we have a list of 50 families in our WhatsApp group that does not mean that we  
**0:15:59-0:16:06:**  produce that much because sometimes they don't buy anything, sometimes they're on holiday  
**0:16:06-0:16:10:**  so people come and go in waves.  
**0:16:10-0:16:16:**  So every week we might have perhaps 12, 15 families that buy at least something, not  
**0:16:16-0:16:18:**  necessarily a lot.  
**0:16:18-0:16:20:**  So that is more or less the scale.  
**0:16:20-0:16:26:**  You know when we were discussing before the podcast you were talking about different research  
**0:16:26-0:16:30:**  or experiments, agroforestry experiments that you were doing on your farm.  
**0:16:30-0:16:36:**  And you mentioned a few now about, for example, you talked about tree fodder from the forest  
**0:16:36-0:16:40:**  and you talked about animals grazing, sheep grazing in your orchard.  
**0:16:40-0:16:46:**  Could you maybe elaborate a bit more to explain to us what agroforestry systems are you implementing  
**0:16:46-0:16:47:**  on the farm?  
**0:16:47-0:16:49:**  Yeah, very happily.  
**0:16:49-0:16:56:**  So we may start with asparagus and olives, which has been the oldest payment I have conducted  
**0:16:56-0:17:01:**  in our farm before even it was a farm before even I met my wife.  
**0:17:01-0:17:07:**  In 91 I planted my first olive field and as I said, I saw a lot of space and olives would  
**0:17:07-0:17:11:**  take years to fill it out so I planted things underneath them and one of these things were  
**0:17:11-0:17:20:**  all these wild asparagus but nobody sold the plants and I tried to plant the seeds and  
**0:17:20-0:17:26:**  the seed did not germinate so I started studying seed germination and it took me a few years  
**0:17:26-0:17:32:**  to put together a system to make the seeds grow.  
**0:17:32-0:17:37:**  They're just dormant, they take a year and a half to grow basically but once I discovered  
**0:17:37-0:17:41:**  this I was able to produce plants and so I produced my own plants and planted them under  
**0:17:41-0:17:48:**  the olive and planted them along the line so that I could still drive the tractor in  
**0:17:48-0:17:51:**  between and harvest the olives and so on.  
**0:17:51-0:17:57:**  And then because it was such a neat thing and the market price of the wild asparagus  
**0:17:57-0:18:04:**  is really high around 25 euros per kilo, other people saw these things and I also as a scientist  
**0:18:04-0:18:09:**  wrote some article about how to grow these things and people started asking for plants  
**0:18:09-0:18:15:**  and so nobody was producing them so as a farm we decided to produce them and so we also  
**0:18:15-0:18:21:**  sell wild asparagus plants and have a little nursery.  
**0:18:21-0:18:31:**  To clean the asparagus I used the tractor and do flail mowing to grind up the weeds  
**0:18:31-0:18:40:**  but I realized that sheep could do the same job for free and while producing something  
**0:18:40-0:18:47:**  else so as soon as we could we started experimenting with animals and I had a chance to work in  
**0:18:47-0:18:56:**  a project using chickens instead and so I together with the University of Perugia worked  
**0:18:56-0:19:03:**  on a project with another farmer to grow wild asparagus under olives and use chickens to  
**0:19:03-0:19:09:**  weed both because once you plant the asparagus in olive orchard you don't have just an olive  
**0:19:09-0:19:13:**  orchard, you have an asparagus and asparagus is a vegetable crop, it's a much more intensive  
**0:19:13-0:19:20:**  system, so weeding an asparagus olive orchard is much more worth than weeding just an olive  
**0:19:20-0:19:26:**  orchard because you need to be careful of the asparagus as you drive your machinery  
**0:19:26-0:19:27:**  and it's more expensive.  
**0:19:27-0:19:32:**  Of course you get two crops and that justifies the expense but if you can spend nothing so  
**0:19:32-0:19:38:**  much better and chickens are small they scratch and if they don't eat the grass they destroy  
**0:19:38-0:19:47:**  by scratching and they fertilize at the same time so we basically put together the system  
**0:19:47-0:19:53:**  where if you grow a thousand chickens per hectare, meat chickens that have a cycle of  
**0:19:53-0:20:00:**  about 90 to 100 days and you do this in spring and fall when the grasses grow you can keep  
**0:20:00-0:20:07:**  your asparagus orchard system weed free and fertilized at no cost and of course you have  
**0:20:07-0:20:10:**  the additional production of chickens.  
**0:20:10-0:20:15:**  Of course the chickens need to be fed almost as much as you would without grazing them  
**0:20:15-0:20:21:**  because chickens will eat grass but that's not how they grow, they need their feed anyway  
**0:20:21-0:20:27:**  so the benefit is not that you're saving chicken feed but the benefit is that you're weeding  
**0:20:27-0:20:33:**  and fertilizing for free and this has resulted in a few papers including on the journal Clean  
**0:20:33-0:20:38:**  Air Production where we show that it's way more sustainable to keep chickens outdoors  
**0:20:38-0:20:47:**  grazing in existing orchard because their grazing saves you fertilizing and weeding  
**0:20:47-0:20:50:**  of the orchard but sheep do a great job too.  
**0:20:50-0:20:57:**  Of course sheep will eat olives and so you need to prune your olives a little bit higher  
**0:20:57-0:21:03:**  so that they will not damage the bulk of the canopy but the other great thing is that unlike  
**0:21:03-0:21:11:**  chickens sheep do eat grass as their main feed so compared to keeping sheep in a stable  
**0:21:11-0:21:16:**  grazing an olive orchard actually saves you most of the food and the other thing is that  
**0:21:16-0:21:22:**  sheep do eat olives but if the olives are tall they don't do much damage but they eat  
**0:21:22-0:21:29:**  the suckers which is free added labor and when you prune the olives the olive pruning  
**0:21:29-0:21:38:**  become sheep food so basically an olive orchard has three sources of feed for ruminants grass  
**0:21:38-0:21:44:**  growing naturally because nowadays in most of the world olive orchards are kept with  
**0:21:44-0:21:50:**  green mulching because of all the benefit of green mulching and therefore you need to  
**0:21:50-0:21:55:**  mow this grass and there's no point of spending gasoline and money to do it if animals can  
**0:21:55-0:22:01:**  do it for you and you get a second production so that's what we do we graze the olive orchard  
**0:22:01-0:22:10:**  in the fields and so olives produce feed by producing the grass that grows below produce  
**0:22:10-0:22:17:**  feed by producing pruning materials which you can use to feed the animals and when you  
**0:22:17-0:22:25:**  make olive oil you're left with olive cake as a residue and you can take the pits off  
**0:22:25-0:22:32:**  the cake and what's left is another product that can be mixed with other feeds and it's  
**0:22:32-0:22:36:**  very useful for feeding animals so you've got these three sources that are commonly  
**0:22:36-0:22:43:**  wasted now if you want to produce more in a more sustainable way with fewer resources  
**0:22:43-0:22:49:**  we can't keep wasting these resources so olive pruning olive grass and olive cake should  
**0:22:49-0:22:56:**  be all used as a feed before they go back to the land as a fertilizer and this makes  
**0:22:56-0:23:03:**  us produce more on the same land in a sustainable way while also saving the cost of fertilizing  
**0:23:03-0:23:08:**  and mowing so this is a little bit of what we do in the farm  
**0:23:08-0:23:13:**  let me stop you there a bit Adolfo because you've just unwrapped some really interesting  
**0:23:13-0:23:17:**  things there you talked about the chicken inside the orchard and the weeding that they  
**0:23:17-0:23:22:**  provide for the orchard and for the asparagus the chickens they don't go for the asparagus  
**0:23:22-0:23:27:**  even when it's young or do you have to integrate them after after the asparagus already got  
**0:23:27-0:23:35:**  established yes good points thanks for for giving me a chance to clarify you normally  
**0:23:35-0:23:40:**  need to fence the field because you want to keep the chickens in and you don't want to  
**0:23:40-0:23:45:**  stand there to look after them so you need to fence the field and the fencing needs to  
**0:23:45-0:23:52:**  go underground by maybe 30 centimeters to prevent foxes and other animals to dig under  
**0:23:52-0:23:58:**  and go in or you need some other system like a fencing that bends 90 degree and runs over  
**0:23:58-0:24:04:**  the ground for maybe 30 centimeters so that when animals go dig they find a metallic fence  
**0:24:04-0:24:10:**  and they can't dig so that's the first thing for the asparagus yes when you establish the  
**0:24:10-0:24:19:**  plan the first year or two the chickens could potentially approve them but asparagus are  
**0:24:19-0:24:24:**  long-lived plans once you plan them you have them for 50 years so after the first couple  
**0:24:24-0:24:29:**  of years the plans are adults and well established and they are prickly the wild asparagus is  
**0:24:29-0:24:35:**  I'm talking about asparagus acutifolius and it's a prickly plant so the chickens don't  
**0:24:35-0:24:43:**  go too close because it's a rigid and prickly plant and so they they can't scratch too close  
**0:24:43-0:24:51:**  to the to the root because the canopy of the plant keeps them away and of course you keep  
**0:24:51-0:24:58:**  the chickens out during the time where the new spears emerge the spears are the new asparagus  
**0:24:58-0:25:03:**  coming up so when the new shoots emerge you don't keep the chickens there though I have  
**0:25:03-0:25:08:**  noticed they do not eat them but for sanitary reason it's probably better that there's no  
**0:25:08-0:25:15:**  chickens for a month before you pick the spears and so you put the chickens after and after  
**0:25:15-0:25:20:**  means in my climate about beginning of May when the harvesting stops then you put the  
**0:25:20-0:25:27:**  chickens in the asparagus by then are opened they turn into a prickly vegetation the plant  
**0:25:27-0:25:34:**  is safe and the chickens clean out all the weeds you do your three-month period and then  
**0:25:34-0:25:39:**  stop because it's summer and the weeds don't grow anyway and then you start a second period  
**0:25:39-0:25:45:**  of chickens in fall when rains come again and the grass starts growing again so that  
**0:25:45-0:25:50:**  you harvest the chickens before Christmas before it's too cold for them to be outside  
**0:25:50-0:25:57:**  anyway and you do these two cycles in combination with the two moments where the grass grows  
**0:25:57-0:26:02:**  but the asparagus are already harvested it's really very interesting and going back to  
**0:26:02-0:26:06:**  what you were saying before with the sheep it's the same question would apply there do  
**0:26:06-0:26:10:**  the when you integrate the sheep in the olive orchard is it also the same olive orchard  
**0:26:10-0:26:18:**  that has the asparagus in between do the sheep other sheep also interested in the asparagus  
**0:26:18-0:26:24:**  same story the sheep don't browse on the prickly asparagus but you definitely don't want to  
**0:26:24-0:26:32:**  put goats there nor donkeys nor horses horses might be okay but they're heavy animals and  
**0:26:32-0:26:39:**  they compact the soil a lot and so small animals are much better but sheep will not eat the  
**0:26:39-0:26:48:**  asparagus and so you you can graze them and and again this is an important concept animals  
**0:26:48-0:26:56:**  as we as a tool to weed and fertilize should be used like any tools with management and  
**0:26:56-0:27:02:**  intelligence some people think that you fence a an orchard you throw in a couple of sheep  
**0:27:02-0:27:07:**  and you're done of course that doesn't work that way what that will result is in over  
**0:27:07-0:27:15:**  grazing compacted soil and the animals are out of boredom will start damaging asparagus  
**0:27:15-0:27:19:**  and olives because there's not enough grass and not enough to do grazing must be done  
**0:27:19-0:27:26:**  like you would on a flail mower you go through the field when the grass is tall and then  
**0:27:26-0:27:32:**  you you do your mowing and then you're out of there until it's needed again so the animals  
**0:27:32-0:27:38:**  must be managed the same way they need to have intensive short rotational grazing where  
**0:27:38-0:27:44:**  they go in they do their job and they're out until needed again so this is fundamental  
**0:27:44-0:27:50:**  you they need to be managed for the system to be successful if you just throw a few animals  
**0:27:50-0:27:55:**  in a fence and leave them all the time that's a disaster in a typical year the sheep would  
**0:27:55-0:28:04:**  be how long in the olive grove well in rotation which means you take the sheep in an area  
**0:28:04-0:28:09:**  and then move them to the next area and then to the next area but the sheep could be there  
**0:28:09-0:28:15:**  in in the case of olive orchard the sheep could be there basically could be rotated  
**0:28:15-0:28:21:**  through the system basically any time during the year except this those two months march  
**0:28:21-0:28:26:**  and april where you would pick the asparagus the rest of the time they can be there of  
**0:28:26-0:28:31:**  course in the summer there's not much for them to eat unless you're pruning water sprouts  
**0:28:31-0:28:37:**  from the trees in which case you can bring the sheep in to eat the water sprouts that  
**0:28:37-0:28:41:**  you're throwing to the ground and the same thing in winter once you graze through the  
**0:28:41-0:28:46:**  fall not much is growing during the winter unless you prune in the olives in which case  
**0:28:46-0:28:51:**  again you can bring the chickens in the the sheep or not the chickens they don't need  
**0:28:51-0:28:57:**  olive prunings the sheep in to eat most of the prunings consider that olive prunings  
**0:28:57-0:29:08:**  are about 50% leaves and or leaves plus tender twigs and 50% wood so when you prune about  
**0:29:08-0:29:15:**  50% of the biomass you remove from the tree is something that the sheep can actually eat  
**0:29:15-0:29:21:**  and this means that you're feeding the sheep but if you end up grounding the rest of the  
**0:29:21-0:29:27:**  wood as a fertilizer to leave in place you have to ground half as much the mass as you  
**0:29:27-0:29:35:**  would so you're still saving fuel and work and so the sheep could be there most of the  
**0:29:35-0:29:40:**  year if there is something to eat most likely there is more grass in the spring and in the  
**0:29:40-0:29:47:**  fall the chickens probably shouldn't be there in winter because at least in our climate  
**0:29:47-0:29:52:**  it would be too cold unless they had a good housing for cold days and there's not much  
**0:29:52-0:29:58:**  reason to be there in the summer because you don't need them and so they would soon over  
**0:29:58-0:30:03:**  graze the area so with the chickens I would advise two cycles per year in spring and fall  
**0:30:03-0:30:09:**  whereas with the sheep anytime there is grass or pruning material they can always go but  
**0:30:09-0:30:15:**  always with the idea that you keep them until for for as long as there is something for  
**0:30:15-0:30:20:**  them to eat and as soon as there isn't you move them out otherwise the mice are doing  
**0:30:20-0:30:25:**  damage and they compact the soil unnecessarily and they're getting nothing out of it anyway.  
**0:30:25-0:30:31:**  Talking about the compaction of the soil one of the issues with sheep that we often hear  
**0:30:31-0:30:36:**  about or with animals is when you're on a slope like you are you know they create erosion  
**0:30:36-0:30:41:**  they push the soil down they open up the soil is this something that you've seen happen  
**0:30:41-0:30:45:**  on your on your slope on your sloping fields with the with the sheep or even even more  
**0:30:45-0:30:53:**  so with the cows due to their weight? Yes this is the main problem if you don't manage  
**0:30:53-0:31:00:**  them well even if you manage them well you might see that they have preferential ways  
**0:31:00-0:31:05:**  of going every day and on those paths you might get a little bit of that a little bit  
**0:31:05-0:31:11:**  of potential erosion because they'll walk out of the night place always in the same  
**0:31:11-0:31:16:**  spot but if you move them frequently this is not a big problem because they might they  
**0:31:16-0:31:22:**  might not stay in a given place more than a few days and in a few days that's that's  
**0:31:22-0:31:27:**  not gonna be a problem if they stay there a month and it rains then on their path you  
**0:31:27-0:31:35:**  start seeing water erosion but but if you do intense and frequent grazing they are not  
**0:31:35-0:31:41:**  there enough to do the damage the the important point is that when you when you move them  
**0:31:41-0:31:47:**  you move them so that there is no area in common with the previous area and then the  
**0:31:47-0:31:53:**  problem is not is negligible. But I was thinking once you diversify that much and all of a  
**0:31:53-0:31:59:**  sudden you go from olive to having olive plus asparagus and then adding in chicken and maybe  
**0:31:59-0:32:04:**  sheep is that something that you were able to sell easily and as well I'm thinking in  
**0:32:04-0:32:09:**  terms of chicken to have the local infrastructure and the abattoir? Yes absolutely this this  
**0:32:09-0:32:16:**  was this is the downside of all the excitement we've talked about so far which I was certainly  
**0:32:16-0:32:24:**  going to get to because it's the most important limiting factor. For chickens in the project  
**0:32:24-0:32:31:**  that I mentioned we try to address this and University of Perugia is trying to study a  
**0:32:31-0:32:40:**  system of an abattoir on wheels that has all the certification and then the farmer doesn't  
**0:32:40-0:32:48:**  own it it just pays for the service so you pay it comes to your place and you have a  
**0:32:48-0:32:57:**  legal framework to butcher your animals and then this this should help solve the problem  
**0:32:57-0:33:03:**  because when you have a small number of animals it's not worth your while to bring them to  
**0:33:03-0:33:09:**  an unofficial abattoir that might be 300 miles away from you and it wouldn't it wouldn't  
**0:33:09-0:33:17:**  make economic sense. And this problem of scale I find applies to most things. Fruits and  
**0:33:17-0:33:25:**  vegetables you can sell without much paperwork as a farm so it's not too difficult even if  
**0:33:25-0:33:31:**  you are on a very small scale farmer selling fresh fruits and vegetables you can sell the  
**0:33:31-0:33:38:**  stuff and there's not many requirements so that that's relatively straightforward but  
**0:33:38-0:33:45:**  as soon as you turn your fruit into a jam you need a laboratory and a laboratory costs  
**0:33:45-0:33:50:**  a lot of money and it's not justifiable on a small scale. True you can bring your fruit  
**0:33:50-0:33:57:**  to an existing laboratory and have it do the work for you and have your jam with a perfectly  
**0:33:57-0:34:04:**  legal label and everything else it can have your name and it will say processed by this  
**0:34:04-0:34:13:**  laboratory for your farm and so that works. For chickens that's the most difficult thing.  
**0:34:13-0:34:20:**  It's true that in our my region because Italy has certain rules that are by region and not  
**0:34:20-0:34:29:**  by state by country and so in my region you can have up to 250 between chickens and rabbits  
**0:34:29-0:34:41:**  which you can process in the farm without needing an abattoir and you can sell it to  
**0:34:41-0:34:52:**  customers. So these are very small numbers 250 chickens could clean perhaps a small area  
**0:34:52-0:34:57:**  which could be the area where you're going to grow your vegetable garden next year in  
**0:34:57-0:35:01:**  rotation you know when you plow that little bit of land you put the chickens in to clean  
**0:35:01-0:35:08:**  all the pests and insects or it can be a small vineyard or a small orchard or olive orchard  
**0:35:08-0:35:15:**  but as I said before to really clean one hectare of an olive orchard or any other orchard you  
**0:35:15-0:35:21:**  probably need at least a thousand animals in a year and that becomes a scale where you  
**0:35:21-0:35:29:**  need official abattoirs and all of that and so you have to bring the animals to a place  
**0:35:29-0:35:36:**  and find an arrangement. The farmer we work with found a different solution he keeps the  
**0:35:36-0:35:46:**  animals on contract for a larger company that sells organic free range animals so they bring  
**0:35:46-0:35:52:**  the animals to him he keeps them for a month in the olive orchard and then they come and  
**0:35:52-0:35:58:**  get the animals he gets what he gets which probably is not much but he doesn't have to  
**0:35:58-0:36:02:**  deal with all the paperwork they just bring the animals and then a month later come and  
**0:36:02-0:36:09:**  get them so that's another solution. But yes in general the problem of diversifying your  
**0:36:09-0:36:18:**  farm is that you multiply the paperwork and the troubles of processing and selling many  
**0:36:18-0:36:28:**  different things and with the current legal framework this is a huge burden because this  
**0:36:28-0:36:33:**  framework is designed for the current system which is usually made of large industries  
**0:36:33-0:36:39:**  and so if you have a thousand chickens for one hectare or you have 10 million chickens  
**0:36:39-0:36:48:**  the requirements are the same. So what we need to make clear is that if Europe and the  
**0:36:48-0:36:57:**  world wants a small scale more sustainable localized agriculture it also needs to adjust  
**0:36:57-0:37:04:**  the rules to this scale you can't ask the same of a farmer with a thousand chickens  
**0:37:04-0:37:14:**  and one with a hundred thousand or ten millions you need a scale that is the burden the bureaucratic  
**0:37:14-0:37:20:**  and infrastructural burden must be proportional to the scale because the risks are also different  
**0:37:20-0:37:27:**  with a few chickens the risk of health risk of food are not the same as with a huge farm  
**0:37:27-0:37:35:**  so there's no need for the same strict rules and so to help farmers we really need to provide  
**0:37:35-0:37:44:**  this kind of simplification of rules and assistance in how to comply with the requirements like  
**0:37:44-0:37:51:**  writing a label for a jam is really difficult in fact you can't call it jam because jam  
**0:37:51-0:37:59:**  or marmelata in italiano only applies to citrus products so the fruit products everybody calls  
**0:37:59-0:38:07:**  it marmelata jam but legally it's a compote so you know you need assistance to do all  
**0:38:07-0:38:13:**  these things and on a small scale you can't pay that assistance so I would really vote  
**0:38:13-0:38:20:**  for stopping giving farmers subsidies to keep doing what they have been doing for 100 years  
**0:38:20-0:38:27:**  and it doesn't stay on the market and rather help them when they have ideas providing the  
**0:38:27-0:38:35:**  infrastructure and the assistance the bureaucratic or policy assistance for them to overcome  
**0:38:35-0:38:42:**  all the burdens so as I said fruits and vegetables are the easiest but when it comes to yogurt  
**0:38:42-0:38:49:**  and cheese and stuff so we were able as an agriturismo and only because we have an agriturismo  
**0:38:49-0:38:54:**  not because we're a farm but because we have an agriturismo and we can serve our food to  
**0:38:54-0:39:02:**  the guests then we were able to process up to 50 kilograms per week of say cheese or  
**0:39:02-0:39:10:**  jams and this was great because 50 kilograms a week it's a good scale and it's enough for  
**0:39:10-0:39:16:**  a small farm to work but then they changed the rule and now apparently according to the  
**0:39:16-0:39:22:**  new rule we can process something like half a kilo per week instead of 50 kilograms half  
**0:39:22-0:39:30:**  a kilo is like teasing a farmer it would be more honest to say don't do it because telling  
**0:39:30-0:39:35:**  me I can process half a kilo fruit or milk every week it's just ridiculous so this is  
**0:39:35-0:39:40:**  a way of killing the farmer pretending then that you give them a chance well indeed you  
**0:39:40-0:39:49:**  don't give them a chance and so now it's not really clear whether we can sell the cheese  
**0:39:49-0:39:54:**  to our customers but only if they eat it on the farm but if they take it home the same  
**0:39:54-0:40:02:**  cheese becomes illegal so these are huge problems and if we ever stop farming it's not because  
**0:40:02-0:40:09:**  our system is not technically or sustainable environmentally sustainable but because the  
**0:40:09-0:40:11:**  bureaucracy is killing us.  
**0:40:11-0:40:16:**  On this topic of infrastructure I mean one thing that's happening here in France and  
**0:40:16-0:40:23:**  I'm sure it exists in Italy as well is collective transformation I don't know how you say in  
**0:40:23-0:40:29:**  English atelier workshops or you know labs and I've seen this recently being on a farm  
**0:40:29-0:40:35:**  where they have a kind of like a cooperative but just that they collectively own these  
**0:40:35-0:40:39:**  machines and it means that they're able to diversify very quickly with a little risk  
**0:40:39-0:40:44:**  because you know you're not investing in huge amounts of machinery but you're actually you  
**0:40:44-0:40:47:**  know testing out different things and then if your product works you upscale it and that's  
**0:40:47-0:40:53:**  absolutely necessary because indeed we can talk as much as we want about ecological diversity  
**0:40:53-0:40:58:**  but the basis of that is having the proper infrastructure.  
**0:40:58-0:41:08:**  Absolutely I was in the Netherlands for the in 2018 for the fourth European Agroforestry  
**0:41:08-0:41:16:**  conference and I visited some farms and that's what some farms were doing like they were  
**0:41:16-0:41:23:**  experimenting very interesting things like in one case some city folks purchased a land  
**0:41:23-0:41:31:**  and pay somebody to be a farmer for them so they just pay the farmer and he tries to produce  
**0:41:31-0:41:37:**  what they ask and there might be some beef and some vegetables and some fruits and then  
**0:41:37-0:41:45:**  basically they own the place and the farmers arranges for them to pick up the produce.  
**0:41:45-0:41:50:**  I don't know if this would work everywhere but it's a great experiment and other experiments  
**0:41:50-0:42:02:**  could be in Italy you have the possibility of creating what is called a cultural club  
**0:42:02-0:42:09:**  so basically you belong to the club so I'm not giving you my milk but I'm milking your  
**0:42:09-0:42:16:**  cow because it belongs to the club and so you can eat your very own milk at your very  
**0:42:16-0:42:20:**  own risk because it's yours just like anybody can have a cow and drink the milk without  
**0:42:20-0:42:25:**  having a laboratory it's not illegal because you're the owner and you're not selling it.  
**0:42:25-0:42:33:**  So if you can study this kind of framework to overcome some of the limitations and we've  
**0:42:33-0:42:38:**  been thinking about this for the time being we haven't acted on it but this is a possible  
**0:42:38-0:42:45:**  solution basically find a legal framework for which the buyers are not buyers they're  
**0:42:45-0:42:51:**  paying the cost of growing their own food and you're just working for them and then  
**0:42:51-0:42:55:**  it's their cow and it's their pig and it's their jam and they can come and do it if they  
**0:42:55-0:43:03:**  want to or you make it for them but it's their jam so yes these ideas could really help a  
**0:43:03-0:43:10:**  farmer overcome some of these limitations but it would be nice if the policy would change  
**0:43:10-0:43:17:**  so that you don't have to go crazy about finding a solution and it would be just easier to  
**0:43:17-0:43:22:**  do things on a small scale with burdens that are proportional to your scale and not to  
**0:43:22-0:43:24:**  an industrial scale.  
**0:43:24-0:43:31:**  Adolfo this is a very interesting topic on infrastructure and just taking it a step back  
**0:43:31-0:43:37:**  do you think that diversifying the way you are diversifying at the moment notably with  
**0:43:37-0:43:41:**  the chickens in the orchard and the sheep and the asparagus what's the impact of that  
**0:43:41-0:43:46:**  economically speaking does that improve the economic position of the farm or is it something  
**0:43:46-0:43:49:**  that you do for ecological reasons?  
**0:43:49-0:43:58:**  Yeah thanks that's a great point because we find that diversification is really a coin  
**0:43:58-0:44:07:**  with two faces on one hand it's great because you always have something new and when  
**0:44:07-0:44:12:**  something fails there is always something else that didn't so having 450 varieties of  
**0:44:12-0:44:21:**  apple means that from June to April next year you always have something.  
**0:44:21-0:44:27:**  On the other hand it also means that when you taste an apple and it's good you might  
**0:44:27-0:44:32:**  not have enough to sell and the next apple tastes differently and you never know when  
**0:44:32-0:44:40:**  they're ready when to harvest which ones are worth selling and so it takes a huge amount  
**0:44:40-0:44:46:**  of experience and a long time to gain this experience in order for you to do the best  
**0:44:46-0:44:49:**  of what you have when you have so many different products.  
**0:44:49-0:44:56:**  But on the other hand sending a picture on whatsapp of an apple that people have never  
**0:44:56-0:45:05:**  seen before it's a very important attractive advertising and people want to try them.  
**0:45:05-0:45:13:**  And again five out of ten varieties fail one year but there is always one that does something  
**0:45:13-0:45:19:**  and when you don't spray them hardly prune them keep the weeds with the animal don't  
**0:45:19-0:45:24:**  spend much money on them it's an extensive system it doesn't matter that you grow ten  
**0:45:24-0:45:31:**  apples and sell fruits for the equivalent of one tree the rest falls on the ground and  
**0:45:31-0:45:38:**  the animals eat it and that's fine because that's a scale you are not spending the way  
**0:45:38-0:45:42:**  you normally would spend on the tree you're spending an amount of money and care that's  
**0:45:42-0:45:46:**  equivalent to one tree and you get the crop of one tree but it's a more extensive system  
**0:45:46-0:45:50:**  and you can afford to do it that way the rest is grazing anyway.  
**0:45:50-0:46:00:**  And so with experience the variety and the diversification turns out to be a good thing  
**0:46:00-0:46:05:**  to always have something it makes for a resilient system with every week there is something  
**0:46:05-0:46:12:**  to sell it's amazing how basically all year we always have something that's in season  
**0:46:12-0:46:19:**  and people come to us because we promise something fresh that's been picked few hours before  
**0:46:19-0:46:25:**  and it's unusual and it's in season and it's not always easy to find that or to trust that  
**0:46:25-0:46:33:**  what you buy is that and so this is a strong point but the diversification also means that  
**0:46:33-0:46:38:**  there's a lot of apples that you don't sell because you did not pick them the right time  
**0:46:38-0:46:46:**  or they don't have the flavor that people like a huge problem is that most customers  
**0:46:46-0:46:53:**  despite potentially being interested or declaring themselves as interested in sustainable issues  
**0:46:53-0:47:02:**  and local and whatever chemical free or whatever in reality they're used to eat in a certain  
**0:47:02-0:47:08:**  way which is an industrialized way and when they're faced with a product that doesn't  
**0:47:08-0:47:13:**  look and doesn't taste like anything they know they might be curious once but they're  
**0:47:13-0:47:21:**  not gonna buy regularly so we have cornelian cherries we even have improved varieties of  
**0:47:21-0:47:26:**  cornelian cherries people might be interested in knowing about them once but they're not  
**0:47:26-0:47:32:**  gonna be regular consumers of these things you know they're used to an apple and a pear  
**0:47:32-0:47:40:**  and an unusual fruit is not something they're likely to to pay for more than once or twice  
**0:47:40-0:47:50:**  so it's hard to sell a lot of diversity to a market that's not used to that diversity  
**0:47:50-0:47:59:**  it would be important to include the consumers in a closer contact with the farmer investing  
**0:47:59-0:48:06:**  in more education of the consumers where you send more information or you invite them to  
**0:48:06-0:48:12:**  participate in activities and make them learn but taste is something that people develop  
**0:48:12-0:48:20:**  as children and once they're adults they're not as open-minded about new new products  
**0:48:20-0:48:28:**  so very few people accept that an apple with no chemicals has a little grub inside and  
**0:48:28-0:48:33:**  then you open it up with a knife and discard the grub but then you are eating an apple  
**0:48:33-0:48:37:**  that's not been poisoned if the grub is not there that means somebody killed it and this  
**0:48:37-0:48:46:**  was by using chemicals so some people understand this and overcome the instinctive repulsion  
**0:48:46-0:48:52:**  for an apple that has a grub inside and they're willing to pay for it but most people despite  
**0:48:52-0:48:57:**  their interest in stability are not interested in doing that of course there are ways around  
**0:48:57-0:49:04:**  them that so when you harvest your apples you can think of making apple cider apple  
**0:49:04-0:49:08:**  cider can be done with apples that are not perfect and have a grub inside so you may  
**0:49:08-0:49:15:**  select your apple sell the one percent best apples as fresh fruit and the rest goes to  
**0:49:15-0:49:21:**  cider and the worst part of it goes to animal feed so you always have a use for it because  
**0:49:21-0:49:28:**  you have so many things that you make cheese you have whey the whey goes to the pig into  
**0:49:28-0:49:39:**  the chickens you process apples to make cider you get the leftover cake of squeezed apples  
**0:49:39-0:49:46:**  that goes to the pigs and cows and sheep and so you you always get a full utilization of  
**0:49:46-0:49:54:**  every product and every leftover product and every part of the process so that's the beauty  
**0:49:54-0:50:03:**  of this system that there's enough variety of species of plants and animals that nothing  
**0:50:03-0:50:09:**  goes to waste and everything can be optimized the backdrop is the difficulties in dealing  
**0:50:09-0:50:16:**  with all of this from both in natural agricultural point of view and especially from a market  
**0:50:16-0:50:22:**  and even worse from a bureau bureaucratic point of view but with experience I think  
**0:50:22-0:50:33:**  that overall by direct sale to people that understand the value of this a family could  
**0:50:33-0:50:40:**  probably get to a point where this can be their job but it does take 10 years of experience  
**0:50:40-0:50:42:**  to get to the point.  
**0:50:42-0:50:47:**  And here you see with your descriptions it's possible to see the importance also of the  
**0:50:47-0:50:53:**  animals in the system as the cyclers right and so linking it back to what you were saying  
**0:50:53-0:50:58:**  earlier on about how the animals they also provide labor for you by for example pruning  
**0:50:58-0:51:05:**  the suckers of the olives mowing the grass do you sometimes wish you were using a machine  
**0:51:05-0:51:13:**  a tractor to do this what's kind of the challenges or what's the benefits compared to the challenges  
**0:51:13-0:51:18:**  of using animals in the system compared to what somebody else would probably do which  
**0:51:18-0:51:20:**  is use machines.  
**0:51:20-0:51:27:**  Okay let me clarify that I use a tractor too so I'm working we are working and studying  
**0:51:27-0:51:37:**  the system and with the goal of reducing more and more the use of the tractor and using  
**0:51:37-0:51:45:**  the local resource of the farm the animals and what you have in place of the tractor  
**0:51:45-0:51:51:**  as much as possible but you always need eventually to go through with a tractor maybe you can  
**0:51:51-0:51:58:**  rotate animals like for instance if you graze fields eventually you get thistles because  
**0:51:58-0:52:04:**  the sheep and cows don't eat them and yes you could then use a donkey to eat the thistle  
**0:52:04-0:52:07:**  but then you have a donkey too and the donkey will damage the fruit so you can't put the  
**0:52:07-0:52:13:**  donkey in the orchard so eventually you have to use a tractor anyway so we're not talking  
**0:52:13-0:52:20:**  about a radical system where you don't even have a tractor anymore we're talking about  
**0:52:20-0:52:28:**  a system that uses a smaller tractor because the needs are reduced to 20% of the otherwise  
**0:52:28-0:52:33:**  system but you probably still need it and we're not even to the point where we needed  
**0:52:33-0:52:44:**  20% maybe we can we reduce it 50% right now but we still use it and so yes I don't know  
**0:52:44-0:52:48:**  if I have answered enough your point.  
**0:52:48-0:52:57:**  Yeah I wanted to this is definitely a part of the answer but maybe another way to phrase  
**0:52:57-0:53:04:**  this question is you know what's the how valuable are the animals as a source of labor on the  
**0:53:04-0:53:09:**  farm and how much because I can imagine for example you've got animals on the farm on  
**0:53:09-0:53:13:**  Massey farm we didn't we didn't work yet with a lot of animals so we don't have that intimate  
**0:53:13-0:53:17:**  experience with them but they are for example providing benefits in terms of the fertility  
**0:53:17-0:53:22:**  in terms of the mowing and etc but at the same time they're also involving a lot of  
**0:53:22-0:53:26:**  labor in terms of managing them moving them making sure they're in their fence when they  
**0:53:26-0:53:30:**  get ill taking care of them feeding them so I wanted to kind of know if it balances out  
**0:53:30-0:53:35:**  at the end if it's worth having the animals in there based on the fact that you've got  
**0:53:35-0:53:37:**  a product etc.  
**0:53:37-0:53:47:**  Yes I think it's worth it if the animals are already worth their while like if your purpose  
**0:53:47-0:53:54:**  is just to weed the garden and otherwise you have no interest clearly it's not worth it  
**0:53:54-0:53:58:**  it's cheaper to have a tractor that doesn't eat all year you just use it when you use  
**0:53:58-0:54:03:**  it and then it rests and it doesn't consume fuel and doesn't take management doesn't take  
**0:54:03-0:54:09:**  fencing doesn't take the vet it doesn't get sick so you you you need animals that are  
**0:54:09-0:54:20:**  useful or on their own and economically worthwhile on their own once you do that combining them  
**0:54:20-0:54:27:**  might provide some saving on both the animal and the plant side and then again it's useful  
**0:54:27-0:54:32:**  if you have enough of a scale like if you have to every day or every few days move a  
**0:54:32-0:54:41:**  fencing to move 10 sheep and this costs you an hour of time you know it will cost you  
**0:54:41-0:54:46:**  an hour time even if there were a hundred sheep and so again there is some scale economy  
**0:54:46-0:54:53:**  in there where it might not be convenient if you have only 10 because the system works  
**0:54:53-0:54:59:**  beautifully from a natural point of view but it's not sustainable economically or or from  
**0:54:59-0:55:06:**  a hand labor point of view so you can decide that you have animals for your own family  
**0:55:06-0:55:14:**  use and you don't deal with rules and lusts and abattoirs and you just do your own family  
**0:55:14-0:55:19:**  use maybe your own family use can include few friends that somehow you feed without  
**0:55:19-0:55:26:**  going through all the legal framework and if you are to that scale then you can use  
**0:55:26-0:55:32:**  this animal on small areas like intensive areas near the house like a vegetable garden  
**0:55:32-0:55:38:**  and where you don't need a lot of time to move them around if you want to clean the  
**0:55:38-0:55:42:**  olive orchard which is a little further away and it's a little larger scale and it needs  
**0:55:42-0:55:48:**  more animals maybe you don't want to do that step because then you get into selling chicken  
**0:55:48-0:55:55:**  meat and that's a whole other scale and you might not want to go that far so there are  
**0:55:55-0:56:03:**  different scales and different uses that you can choose and if you do the next step the  
**0:56:03-0:56:09:**  next step must be worthwhile by itself it wouldn't justify to have the chickens just  
**0:56:09-0:56:13:**  to clean the orchard clearly they're not that would not pay back but if you're interested  
**0:56:13-0:56:18:**  in keeping a thousand chickens and selling them and that's a possible source of income  
**0:56:18-0:56:23:**  and you envision that that's going to work in your farm then clearly do put your chickens  
**0:56:23-0:56:32:**  in your orchard because you're saving some money so animals do bring an incredible layer  
**0:56:32-0:56:38:**  of complication because they don't go on holiday they're they are not well chickens they have  
**0:56:38-0:56:42:**  cycles you buy the chicks and three months later you saw the chickens and you're done  
**0:56:42-0:56:48:**  so you're free you can also go on holiday if you have a cow clearly you can't and so  
**0:56:48-0:56:52:**  this is also another thing to consider if the animals are permanent animals you don't  
**0:56:52-0:56:57:**  get a day off in which case you might want to share your farm with at least another family  
**0:56:57-0:57:05:**  so you can alternate and you know go somewhere for Christmas every other year if if you have  
**0:57:05-0:57:08:**  meat chickens this is not a problem if you have egg chickens this is a problem you need  
**0:57:08-0:57:18:**  to keep them all year chickens can be kept in an indoor space with enough food and water  
**0:57:18-0:57:25:**  and without any care for maybe up to a week ten days so you could have chickens and still  
**0:57:25-0:57:29:**  allow yourself a holiday if you have a milk cow you clearly cannot do that I didn't want  
**0:57:29-0:57:34:**  to interrupt that I was thinking it'd be great to leave us a bit of time to have an overview  
**0:57:34-0:57:44:**  of some other of your systems as well yeah so other systems I wanted to say that we send  
**0:57:44-0:57:53:**  the animals in the forest now in Italy you cannot send goats into the forest but the  
**0:57:53-0:58:01:**  wild goats or wild deer or caprioli they grow naturally and then didn't used to be there  
**0:58:01-0:58:07:**  until 15 years ago but now there is plenty as well as the wild pigs the wild boar which  
**0:58:07-0:58:13:**  was a rare thing 50 years ago and now there is so many to the point that they crossroads  
**0:58:13-0:58:19:**  etc they can all go in the forest and that's legal and the hunters can harvest them so  
**0:58:19-0:58:27:**  basically you're growing this animal on your land for the hunters which pay a fee to the  
**0:58:27-0:58:32:**  region but not to you so you as a farmer you are maintaining the land so that other people  
**0:58:32-0:58:40:**  can go hunt on your land and reap the produce and you cannot send your own goats on the  
**0:58:40-0:58:48:**  land but you can send sheep and cows as long as you haven't just cut the forest but of  
**0:58:48-0:58:57:**  course in an adult forest there is not much that sheep and cows can eat and when you cut  
**0:58:57-0:59:04:**  the forest there is re-sprouting but the forest cannot be grazed for eight years or whatever  
**0:59:04-0:59:10:**  so what we found though is that you can ask for a thinning cut a thinning cut means that  
**0:59:10-0:59:17:**  you go in the forest and choose selectively the best specimens and thin out the rest because  
**0:59:17-0:59:24:**  they're not going to grow well or they're too crowded or they're sick or whatever and  
**0:59:24-0:59:28:**  as long as you respect certain rules you can do this thinning and because it's a thinning  
**0:59:28-0:59:37:**  you can do it in any season so by applying for this kind of cut you can cut the trees  
**0:59:37-0:59:42:**  during the summer where there is not much forage and then by cutting by felling the  
**0:59:42-0:59:47:**  tree the animals get access to its leaves and you can actually get a lot of feed that  
**0:59:47-0:59:54:**  way so this is one thing that we're doing we apply for cutting small areas of the forest  
**0:59:54-1:00:01:**  and we thin the trees in the summer and feed the cows and the sheep with the fallen trees  
**1:00:01-1:00:07:**  so that they can access their vegetation and then we cut up the wood for heating and so  
**1:00:07-1:00:15:**  again we make scale economy of our hand labor because you cut the trees for wood anyway  
**1:00:15-1:00:21:**  might as well feed the animals with the same operation you're getting an extra bonus of  
**1:00:21-1:00:26:**  feeding animals for something you will be doing anyway which is make firewood for the  
**1:00:26-1:00:32:**  house and so this is another thing that we're doing is using the forest to feed the animals  
**1:00:32-1:00:39:**  in the summer and I haven't had a chance to experiment but I would love to actually plant  
**1:00:39-1:00:45:**  forage trees a varieties of them on open fields that we use for grazing it would be good if  
**1:00:45-1:00:53:**  these open fields had lines of forage trees which you could top and hedge with a machine  
**1:00:53-1:01:00:**  to knock down the vegetation that needs it's needed to feed animals but this is a more  
**1:01:00-1:01:06:**  large larger scale experiment that I'm not sure we can afford to do our own cost in our  
**1:01:06-1:01:14:**  own farm but as researchers I'm in touch with other colleagues that are interested in trying  
**1:01:14-1:01:20:**  to experiment this kind of system which would be a way to modernize an ancient practice  
**1:01:20-1:01:28:**  of cutting tree leaves for feeding animals both fresh and as a preserved forage which  
**1:01:28-1:01:34:**  you can store in winter farmers used to cut branches collect them in bundles and dry them  
**1:01:34-1:01:41:**  for winters but this is this requires too much hand labor and it would not be convenient  
**1:01:41-1:01:49:**  nowadays for economic reasons but if you mechanize it and optimize the system then it can be  
**1:01:49-1:01:56:**  a way to pick up an old design and turn it into a modern design by adjusting it to modern  
**1:01:56-1:02:01:**  needs of costs and labor.  
**1:02:01-1:02:07:**  Other agroforestry or also permaculture things that we do in our farm would be to again use  
**1:02:07-1:02:16:**  the chickens in the vineyard we put fencing along the line of the vineyards every other  
**1:02:16-1:02:24:**  row and we're building a chicken mobile where the chickens barn is on wheels and so it can  
**1:02:24-1:02:30:**  be moved and they're very very effective in weeding the vineyard our vineyard is a small  
**1:02:30-1:02:38:**  area about a tenth of an hectare and on that scale a few animals can just do all the weeding  
**1:02:38-1:02:41:**  for you without much problems.  
**1:02:41-1:02:48:**  Another interesting thing that I found is that the tree Ailanthus altissima which is  
**1:02:48-1:02:56:**  considered a pest tree by everybody and everybody hates it when it comes out as a sapling the  
**1:02:56-1:03:02:**  animals don't eat it the leaves appear to be toxic and the animals leave it alone but  
**1:03:02-1:03:09:**  it turns out I discovered that if you cut the tree when the tree is become big enough  
**1:03:09-1:03:14:**  that it's out of reach of animals then and only then if you cut the tree they actually  
**1:03:14-1:03:19:**  love the leaves it might be that the tree has some toxins that protect the tree when  
**1:03:19-1:03:25:**  it's small but when it's big it doesn't need those toxins and so evolutionarily it learned  
**1:03:25-1:03:32:**  not to make them and if you cut it then then it provides forage but when the tree is young  
**1:03:32-1:03:37:**  you don't have to protect it you know agroforestry is a big problem about tree guards and how  
**1:03:37-1:03:42:**  to protect trees from the grazing animals because if you keep the animals where the  
**1:03:42-1:03:47:**  trees grow the animals will damage them so you have to spend money to protect the tree  
**1:03:47-1:03:53:**  well this tree protects itself and it grows bigger and it grows really fast faster than  
**1:03:53-1:04:01:**  any local indigenous species and then you cut it and they actually eat it and you make  
**1:04:01-1:04:08:**  firewood for the house it's not good quality wood but to burn inside a wood burning stove  
**1:04:08-1:04:14:**  it's a fine source of fuel so we found that this tree is actually a very great source  
**1:04:14-1:04:18:**  for agroforestry because it provides forage and it defends itself when it's young you  
**1:04:18-1:04:24:**  don't have to spend money to protect it so you just have to thin it out and cut it.  
**1:04:24-1:04:30:**  When you do thinning cuts and you let the animals in are there specific varieties of  
**1:04:30-1:04:35:**  trees that they find more nutritious or maybe you could go a bit more in detail on the tree  
**1:04:35-1:04:40:**  fodder and even maybe saying what you would plant if you had the opportunity to test out  
**1:04:40-1:04:44:**  including trees in the pasture.  
**1:04:44-1:04:55:**  Yes our forest is mainly one species of oak, rovarela is quercus pubescens and in America  
**1:04:55-1:05:00:**  they say that oaks are toxic for animals that you have to be careful I do not find that  
**1:05:00-1:05:06:**  we have a problem maybe our oaks are what they call white oaks in America and so they  
**1:05:06-1:05:13:**  are not as rich in tannins but when we cut oaks the animals eat in large quantities and  
**1:05:13-1:05:19:**  don't seem to have problems in fact probably it's good for the tannins and the parasites  
**1:05:19-1:05:24:**  but I don't know enough about this and unfortunately I don't think anybody knows enough about it  
**1:05:24-1:05:30:**  but this will be very interesting understanding what medicinal properties the different species  
**1:05:30-1:05:40:**  have on your livestock because maybe we could do without so many warm medicines for the  
**1:05:40-1:05:47:**  livestock if we could feed them the right kinds of plants that with the tannins or with  
**1:05:47-1:05:55:**  whatever act as a warm controlling agent but anyway oaks are fine we have one species of  
**1:05:55-1:06:08:**  ash, fraccinus hornus which like all the ashes the animal love when we do have elm of course  
**1:06:08-1:06:13:**  elm was the preferred forage tree for the farmer but nowadays with the Dutch elm disease  
**1:06:13-1:06:19:**  most elms are gone but when you do have it the animals love it then we have hornbeam  
**1:06:19-1:06:31:**  ostraegarpinifolia which they eat just fine what else we have these are the main species  
**1:06:31-1:06:41:**  oh and many maples minor apple field maple mountain maple they all eat it so when I think  
**1:06:41-1:06:46:**  the forest I try to cut every day perhaps one tree of each species to give them a different  
**1:06:46-1:06:58:**  diet and they seem to happily gobble it all up probably ashes would be among the favorite  
**1:06:58-1:07:07:**  but they eat it all whenever there is the availability so almost every tree in the forest  
**1:07:07-1:07:12:**  is something they eat I don't cut other trees like sorb trees or something because if I  
**1:07:12-1:07:17:**  have any I let them grow big and hope to get some fruit from them so they would eat it  
**1:07:17-1:07:24:**  otherwise oh and we have a wild cherry it's a bitter cherry but they eat the leaves as  
**1:07:24-1:07:31:**  well as the fruit again in America they have a different species pruno serotina which is  
**1:07:31-1:07:38:**  toxic and they recommend not to cut trees for those animals because you poison them  
**1:07:38-1:07:45:**  with our species which is not pruno serotina there is no problem at least I have for no  
**1:07:45-1:07:50:**  problem they eat it all up and it's interesting it smells like almonds when you cut it you  
**1:07:50-1:07:57:**  can smell the amygdalin but the animals eat it just fine and if I had to plant trees in  
**1:07:57-1:08:04:**  a field I would think more of trees that sprout back really easily there would be mulberries  
**1:08:04-1:08:16:**  there would be willows of course if you have the right soil with water poplars but also  
**1:08:16-1:08:23:**  black locusts probably is a fantastic tree for feeding animals as well as producing biomass  
**1:08:23-1:08:32:**  and maybe linden trees I did say mulberries among the mulberries there are some vigorous  
**1:08:32-1:08:41:**  varieties and they sprout back really well so yeah linden mulberries black locust willows  
**1:08:41-1:08:52:**  poplars probably a few more I found that redbud trees are also you can cut and hedge and top  
**1:08:52-1:08:57:**  them and they just come back but I found that the sheep eat the leaves and the goats too  
**1:08:57-1:09:04:**  but the cows don't so again this is a field where there is a lot of experience to be made  
**1:09:04-1:09:11:**  and there's not enough research and trials going on but it would be very nice to see  
**1:09:11-1:09:16:**  more experimentation going on to figure out more details.  
**1:09:16-1:09:22:**  And when the animals are eating tree leaves does that represent all of their diets or  
**1:09:22-1:09:27:**  is it always something that comes as a supplement and as a source of tannins in addition to  
**1:09:27-1:09:28:**  pasture?  
**1:09:28-1:09:37:**  Well in the literature people perhaps cautiously tend to state that you only want these forages  
**1:09:37-1:09:46:**  to be a small fraction of the total but I find that one it depends on the kind of animal  
**1:09:46-1:09:53:**  and what kind of production level they have so if you have high performance animals like  
**1:09:53-1:10:00:**  moss farms nowadays then these products probably can't provide too much a percentage of the  
**1:10:00-1:10:07:**  food because the rumen would be enough to hold enough material to feed these animals  
**1:10:07-1:10:15:**  but take sheep they have lambs in winter you milk them during the spring then you dry them  
**1:10:15-1:10:21:**  up during the summer for one because the cheese goes bad with high temperature and two because  
**1:10:21-1:10:25:**  there's not enough grass so in that moment of year you're just maintaining the weight  
**1:10:25-1:10:30:**  of the mothers they're not even getting pregnant because it's too early so if you have a rustic  
**1:10:30-1:10:38:**  sheep that's producing neither milk nor meat at the moment then you can use that forage  
**1:10:38-1:10:47:**  for a greater percentage of the diet which could easily be 50% I find and also we have  
**1:10:47-1:10:53:**  selected animals that eat what we normally feed them nowadays if those animals are not  
**1:10:53-1:11:00:**  good to eat forage tree forage perhaps they are not just the right animals if three forages  
**1:11:00-1:11:04:**  what we have or what we should have to be more sustainable then we should select animals  
**1:11:04-1:11:11:**  that can eat more of it and certainly there is room for that selection but to be more  
**1:11:11-1:11:17:**  specific about our farm I find that in the summer for sheep I would estimate that they  
**1:11:17-1:11:23:**  probably eat they can go up to 60% of tree forage and then I always give them hay at  
**1:11:23-1:11:31:**  night so depending on how much hay they use and how much they left over they leave uneaten  
**1:11:31-1:11:37:**  then I know if I'm starving them or if I'm feeding them appropriately so I always give  
**1:11:37-1:11:42:**  them enough hay perhaps not great quality hay but enough so that they need to leave  
**1:11:42-1:11:48:**  some behind if they finish all the hay even though it's not great hay perhaps you're giving  
**1:11:48-1:11:55:**  them too much tree forage and they need to eat something else I find that if animals  
**1:11:55-1:12:01:**  have a choice they will tell you what they want it's important that you give them a choice  
**1:12:01-1:12:07:**  so that if they don't want something they are not starving they don't have to eat it  
**1:12:07-1:12:16:**  and then they self limit a lot but give them always enough of something else to make sure  
**1:12:16-1:12:20:**  they have a choice and they'll tell you how much they can eat.  
**1:12:20-1:12:26:**  That's fascinating and going back to what you said earlier on does it only make sense  
**1:12:26-1:12:34:**  to use tree as forage economically speaking if you also harvest wood out of it for your  
**1:12:34-1:12:38:**  house for example or you know because you said that it doesn't make sense to have that  
**1:12:38-1:12:44:**  on your small scale it would need to be in your pasture to have some tree forage trees  
**1:12:44-1:12:47:**  there because you would need to mechanize it.  
**1:12:47-1:12:55:**  What I would say is that again when you consume a product as a final consumer for your own  
**1:12:55-1:13:04:**  use you're saving the full price and you don't have transportation and other expenses for  
**1:13:04-1:13:12:**  selling a shop or all of that so I find that producing many things for self consumption  
**1:13:12-1:13:17:**  is actually worthwhile because you're saving the full price when you're trying to sell  
**1:13:17-1:13:23:**  it then you have added costs and sometimes lower prices then sometimes on a small scale  
**1:13:23-1:13:29:**  it's not worth doing it but I do produce wood for my own house and I'm saving all the heating  
**1:13:29-1:13:34:**  for the house you know maybe a couple thousand euros in a year and to save that amount of  
**1:13:34-1:13:38:**  money I work certain amount of hours but I find it worthwhile.  
**1:13:38-1:13:45:**  So because for self consumption I find it worthwhile to cut my own wood it makes more  
**1:13:45-1:13:52:**  sense that I cut it the way I described because then I also save a few euros to feed the sheep.  
**1:13:52-1:14:00:**  If I had to go on a bigger scale I would if I had enough land to do it I would say and  
**1:14:00-1:14:06:**  if that was my job I would say that there are people that make money by cutting wood  
**1:14:06-1:14:12:**  if they do it then having sheep to use the forage would be possible on the bigger scale  
**1:14:12-1:14:21:**  too but in that case it could be questionable whether your labor to feed the sheep would  
**1:14:21-1:14:28:**  be worthwhile depends how much you need to spend to keep the sheep near the forest versus  
**1:14:28-1:14:29:**  wherever you have a barn.  
**1:14:29-1:14:34:**  So if the forest and the barn are nearby and it's easy to take the sheep there it's already  
**1:14:34-1:14:39:**  fenced maybe it's worthwhile on a larger scale too.  
**1:14:39-1:14:43:**  If you have to put the animals in a truck and bring them into a forest and fence the  
**1:14:43-1:14:50:**  forest so that you can feed them only part of their diet definitely it's not worth it.  
**1:14:50-1:15:02:**  So as usual there are limitations if you can organize your farm or if your farm is already  
**1:15:02-1:15:09:**  happens to be designed in a way that it's easy to move the animals and the infrastructure  
**1:15:09-1:15:14:**  is there the fencing is there then I would say that it's definitely worthwhile and it  
**1:15:14-1:15:18:**  could be on a self-consumption on a bigger scale.  
**1:15:18-1:15:23:**  Otherwise it would have to be on a large scale to justify it but to be honest I don't have  
**1:15:23-1:15:30:**  the economic numbers to calculate whether this would be more convenient than buying  
**1:15:30-1:15:33:**  forage and keep the animal in a stable.  
**1:15:33-1:15:38:**  Of course the animal that grazes the forest compared to one that stays in a stable it's  
**1:15:38-1:15:44:**  a different animal it's a different product it's a different animal welfare so the trick  
**1:15:44-1:15:49:**  is to market your product and marketing the product makes a difference.  
**1:15:49-1:15:53:**  If you sell your meat at twice the price you can do things that you wouldn't be able to  
**1:15:53-1:15:58:**  do otherwise and so the marketing part is really important.  
**1:15:58-1:16:03:**  Can we have added value by doing things in agroforestry or whatever you might call it  
**1:16:03-1:16:07:**  in a certain way rather than conventionally.  
**1:16:07-1:16:13:**  If you don't have that element a lot of things that make sense from a natural sustainable  
**1:16:13-1:16:17:**  point of view might not be economically sustainable.  
**1:16:17-1:16:27:**  We find that our customers are all high end well educated people that tend to understand  
**1:16:27-1:16:30:**  the value of something special.  
**1:16:30-1:16:35:**  If we had to sell tomatoes at the average price of conventional produce we probably  
**1:16:35-1:16:38:**  wouldn't find it convenient.  
**1:16:38-1:16:46:**  We tend to apply prices that are close to the supermarket price for organic produce  
**1:16:46-1:16:53:**  and we do have an organic farm but we don't bother certifying the product because our  
**1:16:53-1:16:57:**  customers trust us more than they trust the label.  
**1:16:57-1:17:03:**  We don't need to go on the label route to guarantee our products they know us and they  
**1:17:03-1:17:08:**  trust us and that probably has more of an impact on these kinds of consumers.  
**1:17:08-1:17:13:**  They've been to our place, they've seen the place, they're friends and they trust us and  
**1:17:13-1:17:19:**  so they're willing to pay those 3-4 euros for a kilo of tomatoes and the tomatoes might  
**1:17:19-1:17:32:**  be orange, yellow, striped, dark, red and light bulb shaped, round with ribs or smooth  
**1:17:32-1:17:41:**  and it's worth their while to pay extra to buy tomatoes that are colorful, flavorful,  
**1:17:41-1:17:49:**  completely chemical free and they trust us, they know what they're eating and they're  
**1:17:49-1:17:53:**  not discussing whether it should be 50 cents cheaper or not.  
**1:17:53-1:17:56:**  That's not a big issue for them.  
**1:17:56-1:18:02:**  If you want to hit a different target then you need to be more careful at your cost and  
**1:18:02-1:18:04:**  your scale economy.  
**1:18:04-1:18:11:**  Everything has to be calibrated for your system, your customers but you can choose your customers  
**1:18:11-1:18:18:**  by organizing your communication.  
**1:18:18-1:18:31:**  If you use images, send recipes, explain what you do, make a splash on the news, have interviews  
**1:18:31-1:18:36:**  like this or whatever else you have, explain what is important.  
**1:18:36-1:18:42:**  If you're a well educated communicator that knows how to explain the added value, you  
**1:18:42-1:18:46:**  will find those customers that will pay a little extra.  
**1:18:46-1:18:51:**  If the market is not there, that limits a lot what you can do with these systems and  
**1:18:51-1:18:57:**  not because potentially we couldn't get one day to produce things in a more sustainable  
**1:18:57-1:19:05:**  way using these techniques on a lower price but to get there we need to spend as many  
**1:19:05-1:19:11:**  years of research as we have spent so far studying a conventional system.  
**1:19:11-1:19:21:**  For a century now we have optimized conventional agriculture with chemical, fertilizers, pest  
**1:19:21-1:19:27:**  control and all of that, buying expensive equipment and all of that and now we've come  
**1:19:27-1:19:30:**  down to producing food at a very cheap price.  
**1:19:30-1:19:35:**  We could probably do something similar with alternative systems but we don't have the  
**1:19:35-1:19:43:**  one century of research behind us to make us adopt the right techniques.  
**1:19:43-1:19:52:**  So we're all pioneers of a new way of doing things and pioneers test things at their own  
**1:19:52-1:19:56:**  cost and on their own shoulders because no one tells them how to do it.  
**1:19:56-1:19:58:**  They're pioneers by definition.  
**1:19:58-1:20:04:**  For the time being, pioneers need added value and added price and once we will have that  
**1:20:04-1:20:10:**  expense we might be able to lower the price and do this for everybody.  
**1:20:10-1:20:15:**  If you have apples that are not perfect and have a grub inside, you can still make apple  
**1:20:15-1:20:22:**  cider which will look conventional enough for everybody to want to drink even though  
**1:20:22-1:20:24:**  the apples were not perfect.  
**1:20:24-1:20:33:**  So this concept can be applied to other things like sometimes we don't have perfect tomatoes,  
**1:20:33-1:20:36:**  we make tomato soup.  
**1:20:36-1:20:43:**  Sometimes we don't use the milk for making cheese because it's not enough request.  
**1:20:43-1:20:52:**  We feed the milk to the pig or to the chickens and still get something out of it.  
**1:20:52-1:20:57:**  You can make fruit leather, you can dry figs when you don't sell them fresh.  
**1:20:57-1:21:04:**  So there are ways with imperfect products to make perfect looking products like instead  
**1:21:04-1:21:11:**  of selling wine which is a very competitive field with very little margins because everybody  
**1:21:11-1:21:16:**  is super specialized in making wine, but hardly anyone makes grape juice.  
**1:21:16-1:21:19:**  So we don't make wine, we make grape juice.  
**1:21:19-1:21:28:**  So these are a little bit of concepts and tips that the farmer can think of to make  
**1:21:28-1:21:36:**  these unusual diversified products reach the market in a way that is acceptable for the  
**1:21:36-1:21:37:**  consumer.  
**1:21:37-1:21:41:**  So these are important ways of thinking about your products.  
**1:21:41-1:21:45:**  We're convinced with Dimitri that mistakes are the basis of all learning and that they're  
**1:21:45-1:21:48:**  actually the most precious things to share.  
**1:21:48-1:21:54:**  So we were thinking, are there some big mistakes that you remember or that you learned especially  
**1:21:54-1:22:00:**  from in designing or implementing or managing your agroforestry systems that you would like  
**1:22:00-1:22:04:**  to share with us and the listeners and that we can all learn from?  
**1:22:04-1:22:05:**  Yes.  
**1:22:05-1:22:10:**  The biggest mistake is we were excited about planting apples and we planted too many at  
**1:22:10-1:22:19:**  once and we totally completely underestimated that one, the soil was very poor and we needed  
**1:22:19-1:22:21:**  to take better care of fertilization.  
**1:22:21-1:22:28:**  And as we didn't want to use chemical fertilization, we should have invested a lot more in fertilizing  
**1:22:28-1:22:34:**  the soil by buying manure or buying straw or organic matter or some kind or guanito  
**1:22:34-1:22:42:**  or other organic products but it was a mistake to plant too many trees on a soil that was  
**1:22:42-1:22:44:**  too poor without taking good care of it.  
**1:22:44-1:22:49:**  The other mistake was I was convinced that on a very vigorous rootstock the apples will  
**1:22:49-1:22:53:**  become self-sufficient in terms of water within three, four, five years.  
**1:22:53-1:22:58:**  So I did not invest in a drip irrigation system because I thought we'll water them by hand  
**1:22:58-1:23:00:**  for a few years and then they'll be fine.  
**1:23:00-1:23:05:**  But the climate has been getting warmer and drier and this is no longer true.  
**1:23:05-1:23:11:**  In fact, I don't think I will ever be able to keep my apple trees despite being grafted  
**1:23:11-1:23:16:**  on MM-111 which is one of the most vigorous rootstocks you find on the market.  
**1:23:16-1:23:20:**  I don't think I'll be able to keep them without some irrigation in the summer.  
**1:23:20-1:23:24:**  So this year I finally, after 10 years, build a drip irrigation system.  
**1:23:24-1:23:34:**  So my advice would be start with perhaps many things but on a very small scale.  
**1:23:34-1:23:36:**  Plant a handful of trees.  
**1:23:36-1:23:42:**  Plant a small vegetable garden and do your best to do it well and be patient to learn  
**1:23:42-1:23:43:**  from the mistakes.  
**1:23:43-1:23:53:**  Don't make the step longer than your leg because you need those years of experience to do things  
**1:23:53-1:23:58:**  well and right and see what works for you and for your environment and for your customers.  
**1:23:58-1:24:05:**  So experiment a lot of things but everything on a small scale so you next year can say  
**1:24:05-1:24:08:**  okay this doesn't seem to work, I won't do it again.  
**1:24:08-1:24:14:**  This I'll try again but again on a small scale see if I have a luckier year.  
**1:24:14-1:24:16:**  This worked very well.  
**1:24:16-1:24:21:**  I'll do it a little bigger but not too much because I can't assume that that's the rule.  
**1:24:21-1:24:25:**  Perhaps that was a special year and the next year is not going to come out well.  
**1:24:25-1:24:31:**  So do many things on a small scale and give yourself time to learn from what you've done  
**1:24:31-1:24:40:**  so that you can grow slowly but constantly, consistently in the direction that seems to  
**1:24:40-1:24:41:**  work.  
**1:24:41-1:24:47:**  That would be the biggest mistake we made and the biggest advice I would give.  
**1:24:47-1:24:57:**  Another advice if I may is make sure you don't get overworked to the point where you're too  
**1:24:57-1:25:01:**  busy working to discover how to work less.  
**1:25:01-1:25:04:**  This is a typical problem with farmers.  
**1:25:04-1:25:10:**  They get excited, they get their hands full and then they don't have a minute to think  
**1:25:10-1:25:17:**  or to visit another farm or to read on internet or to listen to a podcast such as this.  
**1:25:17-1:25:22:**  The consequences of that is that they don't do as well as they could because they don't  
**1:25:22-1:25:24:**  have the ideas and the knowledge.  
**1:25:24-1:25:28:**  We visited farmers in Missouri and it was a good farm.  
**1:25:28-1:25:35:**  They were selling cheese and they were giving the way to a friend for the pigs without doing  
**1:25:35-1:25:36:**  ricotta.  
**1:25:36-1:25:42:**  Ricotta is another cheese you make after you made cheese and before you give the way to  
**1:25:42-1:25:49:**  the pigs you can extract another amount of sellable product and they just didn't know  
**1:25:49-1:25:50:**  it.  
**1:25:50-1:25:57:**  It was amazing that they could not know this and not make ricotta out of the milk.  
**1:25:57-1:25:58:**  They went to the market to sell the cheese.  
**1:25:58-1:26:02:**  They could have sold the ricotta as well and they just didn't know it.  
**1:26:02-1:26:06:**  And so they didn't explain with doing yogurt.  
**1:26:06-1:26:09:**  Now yogurt is the easiest thing in the world.  
**1:26:09-1:26:11:**  One liter of milk is one liter of yogurt.  
**1:26:11-1:26:17:**  One liter of milk may be 150 grams of cheese but it's one liter of yogurt.  
**1:26:17-1:26:25:**  If you sell yogurt you're selling milk with hardly any work added and you're selling it  
**1:26:25-1:26:26:**  at a much higher price than milk.  
**1:26:26-1:26:28:**  So that's a great opportunity.  
**1:26:28-1:26:32:**  They never knew about it or they never wanted to experiment.  
**1:26:32-1:26:38:**  So make sure, remember that knowledge is fundamental and we don't have the knowledge.  
**1:26:38-1:26:44:**  We just said before we need 100 years of experimenting in this direction before we'll be able to  
**1:26:44-1:26:49:**  produce food on a large scale at a lower price sustainably.  
**1:26:49-1:26:56:**  And that knowledge is absolutely needed both to produce and to sell and to create added  
**1:26:56-1:26:57:**  value.  
**1:26:57-1:27:01:**  If you're stuck in a vicious circle when you don't have the time, you're going to work  
**1:27:01-1:27:03:**  harder and harder for less and less.  
**1:27:03-1:27:10:**  You need to invest in your own education, visiting other farms, reading books, trying  
**1:27:10-1:27:12:**  different products.  
**1:27:12-1:27:18:**  Make sure that happens because this is a knowledge intensive approach to life and agriculture  
**1:27:18-1:27:22:**  and without that knowledge you can't be successful.  
**1:27:22-1:27:23:**  Thank you.  
**1:27:23-1:27:27:**  If no one else does, at least I'll follow that advice because it's great to have that  
**1:27:27-1:27:32:**  perspective from years of experience and it's really appreciated.  
**1:27:32-1:27:35:**  I'm sure Dimitri has some last questions.  
**1:27:35-1:27:39:**  I've been kind of hanging on to my questions and hanging on to you for the last 10 minutes  
**1:27:39-1:27:45:**  but there was one last question I wanted to ask which I think is important.  
**1:27:45-1:27:51:**  I heard you mention earlier that after 10 years of experimentation maybe a couple could  
**1:27:51-1:27:56:**  live from such a diversified farm and that's what I wanted to ask.  
**1:27:56-1:28:00:**  If there's a young couple that came in to see you with a similar context and that told  
**1:28:00-1:28:07:**  you we want to start an agroforestry based farm or I say agroforestry but it could be  
**1:28:07-1:28:12:**  not agroforestry, I mean just a small scale diversified farm using alternative farming  
**1:28:12-1:28:16:**  methods, could you look them in the eyes and say you can live from it or do you think we're  
**1:28:16-1:28:20:**  still at a stage where you need a side job and it's too risky?  
**1:28:20-1:28:24:**  I would look at them in the eyes to understand who they are.  
**1:28:24-1:28:35:**  I have seen people that are excited that I wouldn't bet that they make it because they're  
**1:28:35-1:28:40:**  excited in a naive way and they're perhaps not ready to work hard and to be stubborn  
**1:28:40-1:28:44:**  and to face the failures and stuff.  
**1:28:44-1:28:49:**  Depends on the character of the person but if I saw an intelligent person with an open  
**1:28:49-1:28:58:**  mind with enthusiasm but not a naive enthusiasm, a person that's willing to spend a year going  
**1:28:58-1:29:05:**  around farms working, volunteering for them just to learn before even trying and if I  
**1:29:05-1:29:13:**  saw a person like this then I would say you can make it and it's going to be hard, it's  
**1:29:13-1:29:17:**  not going to be like a lot of money and an easy life, it's not going to be ideal like  
**1:29:17-1:29:23:**  people think of living in the country, it's ideal when you come on holiday on our place  
**1:29:23-1:29:27:**  then you sleep until 11, you wake up and I bring you raspberries, that's fantastic but  
**1:29:27-1:29:33:**  I wake up at 6 to do the cows and the pick the berries and so most people are not up  
**1:29:33-1:29:38:**  for this but if you put yourself in the situation and decide that you enjoy that kind of life  
**1:29:38-1:29:44:**  and being the boss of yourself and you accept the challenge and you are not just excited  
**1:29:44-1:29:50:**  but also realistic and smart then I think you can do it and then I would suggest start  
**1:29:50-1:29:55:**  with a vegetable garden with or without trees so it can be agroforestry or not but start  
**1:29:55-1:30:00:**  with a good vegetable garden because in a small area with a lot of labor you can sell  
**1:30:00-1:30:07:**  a lot of crops and once you start from there that's probably the most intensive and successful  
**1:30:07-1:30:08:**  thing to do.  
**1:30:08-1:30:12:**  Start with a vegetable garden with many varieties of vegetables, start experimenting with what  
**1:30:12-1:30:17:**  grows and what people want to buy and get a group of people that follow you, keep up  
**1:30:17-1:30:23:**  with the social, I know it's annoying, I know it's in a way silly but that's how the world  
**1:30:23-1:30:28:**  is working right now and if you keep up with the social people will remember about you,  
**1:30:28-1:30:37:**  will buy your produce and will be your faithful customers and from there you start planting  
**1:30:37-1:30:42:**  a few trees and experimenting and maybe start with chickens.  
**1:30:42-1:30:48:**  I would start with a vegetable garden and with chickens and then later on when you see  
**1:30:48-1:30:53:**  it working, when you are determined that that's a life you want to have you can start adding  
**1:30:53-1:31:00:**  perhaps sheep or perhaps a cow or perhaps fruit trees and then maybe get into a forestry  
**1:31:00-1:31:06:**  area and all of that but you know the concept of permaculture, the things you are most intensive,  
**1:31:06-1:31:11:**  you keep them near the house and the fruit orchard at an intermediate distance and the  
**1:31:11-1:31:18:**  forest staff are further away, that should also apply in terms of priorities and temporal  
**1:31:18-1:31:20:**  strategies.  
**1:31:20-1:31:27:**  Start with the intensive things near the house and then most importantly don't spend money  
**1:31:27-1:31:31:**  until it's proven that that thing is worthwhile.  
**1:31:31-1:31:35:**  Do what you can with as little money as you can.  
**1:31:35-1:31:38:**  To have a small vegetable garden you don't need a lot of money, you might have to buy  
**1:31:38-1:31:44:**  some manure or some organic matter to start with but it's not a big investment.  
**1:31:44-1:31:48:**  You don't even have to till the soil, you don't even have to own a machine, you just  
**1:31:48-1:31:54:**  put 20 centimeters of manure on a strip of grass, it will kill the grass and you can  
**1:31:54-1:32:00:**  plant the tomatoes right in the soil between the manure and you don't even need to own  
**1:32:00-1:32:01:**  a tractor.  
**1:32:01-1:32:08:**  So I would start with a WhatsApp group and a group of customers that buy in a CSA kind  
**1:32:08-1:32:14:**  of approach, a community supported action where your customers are those every week  
**1:32:14-1:32:22:**  and with that scale I would think that a young determined couple that is willing to put the  
**1:32:22-1:32:28:**  time to gain the experience could probably get to a point where this can work for them.  
**1:32:28-1:32:31:**  Adolfo, thank you so much.  
**1:32:31-1:32:38:**  Well, thank you guys, I think you're doing a really important mission here and I wish  
**1:32:38-1:32:45:**  you all the success because this kind of detailed understanding and experience sharing is exactly  
**1:32:45-1:32:46:**  what we need.  
**1:32:46-1:32:54:**  I am tired of reading principles on agriculture books that with the excuse that because every  
**1:32:54-1:32:59:**  farm is different you can't apply the same detail to every farm, they limit themselves  
**1:32:59-1:33:06:**  to stating a list of nicely educated principles that as a farmer I never found helpful.  
**1:33:06-1:33:12:**  So yes, the concept is obvious and we can make it look fancy but it's a simple concept.  
**1:33:12-1:33:16:**  Of course, if you save money by having an animal do the work for you, it's great, yes,  
**1:33:16-1:33:22:**  but which animal, how, how many, what do they eat, why do they get sick?  
**1:33:22-1:33:25:**  Chickens are on the door, it's a great concept but they actually get more parasites than  
**1:33:25-1:33:30:**  if they're indoor and so we need this kind of practical information to move on and I  
**1:33:30-1:33:38:**  think that your initiative is one of the few that gets into the very details of this kind  
**1:33:38-1:33:39:**  of needed information.  
**1:33:39-1:33:47:**  So I really wish you the best and hope that this podcast is successful and people will  
**1:33:47-1:33:50:**  discover it as an incredible source of information.  
**1:33:50-1:33:55:**  You can always visit another farm but you can definitely listen to a podcast like this.  
**1:33:55-1:33:59:**  So it's going to be very useful I'm sure.  
**1:33:59-1:34:01:**  Thanks for making it this far into the podcast.  
**1:34:01-1:34:04:**  We hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.  
**1:34:04-1:34:08:**  So please contribute by giving us feedback and suggesting questions.  
**1:34:08-1:34:13:**  It's really important for us that we're able to include everyone and the more brains we

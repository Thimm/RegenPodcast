### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Fri, 04 Nov 2022 16:48:25)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:45:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:49:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:49-0:00:54:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we have the immense pleasure of welcoming Jean-Baptiste  
**0:00:54-0:00:59:**  Cordenier on the podcast to talk about something we've been meaning to discuss for a long time  
**0:00:59-0:01:02:**  and that is vitiforistry.  
**0:01:02-0:01:08:**  So Jean-Baptiste is the owner and manager of Chateau Antonyc that produces fantastic  
**0:01:08-0:01:15:**  wine and as the name suggests, vitiforistry means the integration of agroforestry practices  
**0:01:15-0:01:16:**  in viticulture.  
**0:01:16-0:01:22:**  Jean-Baptiste has a fascinating story alongside Chateau Antonyc that he's been managing for  
**0:01:22-0:01:27:**  the past 20 years in an active agroforestry transition for the past five years.  
**0:01:27-0:01:33:**  So once again we are here sitting down with a farmer, a land manager that is giving us  
**0:01:33-0:01:39:**  some feedback as to the successes and the challenges around bringing trees into the  
**0:01:39-0:01:45:**  landscape and diversifying his operation, diversifying his ecosystem, especially in  
**0:01:45-0:01:50:**  the context of a very intensive production system which is viticulture.  
**0:01:50-0:01:54:**  So in this episode you're going to be hearing a lot about hedges, we're going to be talking  
**0:01:54-0:02:00:**  about planting trees inside the plots, inside the vineyard as well as the integration of  
**0:02:00-0:02:06:**  cover crops and how all of these three play together to form an agroecological system.  
**0:02:06-0:02:11:**  So we really hope that you enjoy this episode as much as we did.  
**0:02:11-0:02:16:**  Hello Jean-Baptiste, it's really really nice to have you on the show today.  
**0:02:16-0:02:19:**  Hello Dimitri, thank you for receiving me.  
**0:02:19-0:02:26:**  So you are our first guest on the podcast to talk about vitiforistry, which is the integration  
**0:02:26-0:02:32:**  of trees into a wine or a chateau or wine producing context.  
**0:02:32-0:02:40:**  So yeah maybe we could start by you telling us a bit of the story of where you work at  
**0:02:40-0:02:46:**  the moment of Chateau Antonyc and how you came about managing Chateau Antonyc and its  
**0:02:46-0:02:54:**  vineyards and giving us a bit of context about your story and the amazing story of your chateau.  
**0:02:54-0:03:04:**  So Chateau Antonyc is a family estate that my father bought in 1977, so almost 50 years  
**0:03:04-0:03:06:**  ago.  
**0:03:06-0:03:19:**  And I took over the estate in 93, June 93, so it's my 30th vintage this year.  
**0:03:19-0:03:35:**  And when I started to manage the estate, it was after a long period of seven years living  
**0:03:35-0:03:46:**  very far from the estate because I've left the estate in 1986 for my student period.  
**0:03:46-0:03:54:**  I spent that period in Belgium where I was born.  
**0:03:54-0:04:04:**  I was a student in agriculture, agronomy, engineering in Jean Bleu and I've made the  
**0:04:04-0:04:13:**  water and forestry school as a specialty at the end of my student period.  
**0:04:13-0:04:20:**  And then I spent two years in Central Africa, in Congo for technical cooperation.  
**0:04:20-0:04:27:**  And so it was a long period of seven years almost not visiting the estate and it was  
**0:04:27-0:04:41:**  a long haul and during that haul my father had to face some very difficult vintages.  
**0:04:41-0:04:47:**  The worst one was 87 vintage with a lot of rain from the beginning to the end of the  
**0:04:47-0:04:48:**  season.  
**0:04:48-0:05:00:**  And so he was technically in organic agriculture but without certification and he switched  
**0:05:00-0:05:10:**  that year to chemical products and to herbicides on the soil from one year to the other.  
**0:05:10-0:05:22:**  And so I spent my childhood running through the ditches following the parcels, visiting  
**0:05:22-0:05:29:**  all the biodiversity inside our environment and I was very curious and passionate about  
**0:05:29-0:05:38:**  wildlife and so it was a very rich environment because it was preserved with no chemicals.  
**0:05:38-0:05:45:**  And I had that long haul of seven years and when I was back from Africa, when my father  
**0:05:45-0:05:58:**  asked me to take over, it was quite shocking because all that biodiversity had almost completely  
**0:05:58-0:06:00:**  disappeared.  
**0:06:00-0:06:09:**  The insect populations were very poor, the orchids that were quite abundant close to  
**0:06:09-0:06:24:**  the parcels or inside the vineyard were only reduced to small spots and it was quite shocking  
**0:06:24-0:06:26:**  to see that.  
**0:06:26-0:06:38:**  So that was my start point at the estate but I also was quite a modern agronomist, fresh  
**0:06:38-0:06:50:**  from school and convinced that a compromise was possible between all that chemistry and  
**0:06:50-0:07:02:**  preservation and I've tested a lot of dead ends during the next two decades and I've  
**0:07:02-0:07:12:**  experienced that it was, following my opinion after almost two decades, that it was not  
**0:07:12-0:07:19:**  possible to come back to a balanced system without cutting the link with chemistry first  
**0:07:19-0:07:27:**  and without reintroducing wildlife corridors and cover crops and trees inside the system.  
**0:07:27-0:07:34:**  That was the only answer to come back to a balanced ecosystem in my vineyard.  
**0:07:34-0:07:40:**  So that was the beginning of this story of agroforestry in Antonique.  
**0:07:40-0:07:45:**  But I'm curious as to what were those dead ends that you met.  
**0:07:45-0:07:50:**  Maybe you could tell us a bit more about how you arrived to the conclusion that you needed  
**0:07:50-0:07:53:**  to break the link with chemistry.  
**0:07:53-0:07:56:**  So it was a long, very long process.  
**0:07:56-0:08:07:**  The first thing I've seen is that I've made soil analysis, the two first years of my new  
**0:08:07-0:08:16:**  life in Antonique as the manager of the estate and I was quite surprised to receive the lab's  
**0:08:16-0:08:31:**  result with organic percentage of the soil at an average of 2%, something like that,  
**0:08:31-0:08:35:**  1.8 to a bit more than 2%.  
**0:08:35-0:08:44:**  And always with the same comment, standard, normal, good.  
**0:08:44-0:08:52:**  And I had in my hands the first analysis that were made when my father bought the estate  
**0:08:52-0:09:00:**  and all these parcels they had that time, 5, 6%, sometimes more, sometimes a bit less,  
**0:09:00-0:09:05:**  but at least it was at 4%, average 5.  
**0:09:05-0:09:10:**  And so it was a strong decreasing and I was quite surprised to receive the message, it's  
**0:09:10-0:09:21:**  normal without any thought about the past of the parcel, no question about that.  
**0:09:21-0:09:24:**  And so I've tried to recover.  
**0:09:24-0:09:37:**  So my opinion was, my feeling was that we were on a slope and it was decreasing quite  
**0:09:37-0:09:46:**  fast because the first analysis were made maybe a decade or max 15 years ago.  
**0:09:46-0:09:50:**  So it was a short period.  
**0:09:50-0:10:02:**  And so my feeling that we were on a very bad slope and so I've tried things like crushing  
**0:10:02-0:10:10:**  the branches of the vines after the pruning because that time they were burned outside  
**0:10:10-0:10:14:**  the parcel, that was the common practice.  
**0:10:14-0:10:20:**  And so after one year I bought a machine to crush the branches and I was feeling that  
**0:10:20-0:10:24:**  okay, we will solve the problem with that, no results.  
**0:10:24-0:10:33:**  So we have started some cover crops with the natural grass that was present on the parcel  
**0:10:33-0:10:40:**  and on some parcel that was quite productive but it was only two parcels.  
**0:10:40-0:10:54:**  We have seeded some artificial grass to make competition with the vineyard to decrease  
**0:10:54-0:11:05:**  the production but most of the cover crop was natural grass with no competition with  
**0:11:05-0:11:06:**  the vineyard.  
**0:11:06-0:11:16:**  And so my intuition was that it was possible to add some organic materials to the soil  
**0:11:16-0:11:23:**  with the branches, with the cover crop, the natural cover crop and the results was quite  
**0:11:23-0:11:26:**  low, almost no change.  
**0:11:26-0:11:36:**  So it was possible to stay at that low level but not to recover the old percentages.  
**0:11:36-0:11:48:**  And so after years and years like that I've increased the addition of manure, the addition  
**0:11:48-0:11:58:**  of organic fertilizers and so it was not possible to climb the slope back.  
**0:11:58-0:12:15:**  And so after a lot of experiences like that my feeling was that it was maybe a good question  
**0:12:15-0:12:27:**  was to ask is the conventional system good for the life of my soil and so I started to  
**0:12:27-0:12:33:**  think about organic viticulture at that time but it was quite risky with our climate and  
**0:12:33-0:12:40:**  so I first started to plant some edges.  
**0:12:40-0:12:51:**  That was the first step in 2010 and then I've made some experiences with the branches of  
**0:12:51-0:13:02:**  the hedges, with the life of the soil that was visibly better close to the edges and  
**0:13:02-0:13:10:**  then step by step we have developed the project and we have also changed the cover crop by  
**0:13:10-0:13:17:**  seeding, some dynamic cover crops on the parcel to feed the soil.  
**0:13:17-0:13:19:**  But it was a very very long process.  
**0:13:19-0:13:26:**  And so you started seeing results when you stopped applying chemistry, then you started  
**0:13:26-0:13:31:**  seeing that, was it the stopping applying chemistry that started to create results or  
**0:13:31-0:13:35:**  was it overall you realized that you had to invest a lot more?  
**0:13:35-0:13:40:**  My first step was to plan to install the hedges.  
**0:13:40-0:13:43:**  That was the first step.  
**0:13:43-0:13:51:**  And then I've some results on the biodiversity were visible quite fast.  
**0:13:51-0:14:02:**  The agronomic results are on the long term but the wildlife, the biodiversity results  
**0:14:02-0:14:07:**  are coming quite fast when you plant hedges.  
**0:14:07-0:14:16:**  The first thing I've seen for the, I've discovered for the agronomic impact was with the frost  
**0:14:16-0:14:28:**  we had in 2017 because the only Merlot I've produced, that vintage, were produced quite  
**0:14:28-0:14:31:**  close to the edges.  
**0:14:31-0:14:33:**  They were protected by the edges.  
**0:14:33-0:14:42:**  That varietal is very fragile facing the spring frost and we had some protection close to  
**0:14:42-0:14:44:**  the edges.  
**0:14:44-0:14:53:**  We also had some impact facing the drought on the parcels.  
**0:14:53-0:15:03:**  When we had the drought in the old time it was more impacting on the limit of the parcel  
**0:15:03-0:15:06:**  than inside the parcel.  
**0:15:06-0:15:16:**  But with the hedges the impact of the drought on the side of the parcel was much lower because  
**0:15:16-0:15:20:**  they had the protection of the hedge.  
**0:15:20-0:15:28:**  And so it was also visible that we had a lot of fungi that were growing at the base of  
**0:15:28-0:15:30:**  the hedge.  
**0:15:30-0:15:42:**  And my idea was that they were maybe also protecting and making some micro-resis not  
**0:15:42-0:15:50:**  only with the edges, the trees inside the edges, but also with the vines.  
**0:15:50-0:16:01:**  And the consultants I was working with for the edges told me that they were sure that  
**0:16:01-0:16:12:**  we could have some impact close to, on the lines at the limit of the parcels.  
**0:16:12-0:16:21:**  So then I started to think about introducing trees inside the parcel and to feed the soil  
**0:16:21-0:16:28:**  with some cover crop, dynamic cover crop, to feed the soil and to encourage the development  
**0:16:28-0:16:35:**  of fungi everywhere in the parcel, not only at the limit of the parcel.  
**0:16:35-0:16:40:**  So the first step was the hedge, the second the cover crop and the third one the trees  
**0:16:40-0:16:42:**  inside the parcel.  
**0:16:42-0:16:48:**  I'm curious about the consultants you're working with because it's quite obvious that planting  
**0:16:48-0:16:56:**  hedges goes against the logic of modern agriculture that we've been developing since the 60s.  
**0:16:56-0:17:01:**  And so the natural response or the natural kind of opinion that I would expect to see  
**0:17:01-0:17:06:**  in consultants that are following a traditional agriculture would be competition.  
**0:17:06-0:17:12:**  But it was not my analogies, it was not an agronomist.  
**0:17:12-0:17:25:**  The first consultant I've met and the one I've started the edges with was an association,  
**0:17:25-0:17:31:**  Arbre Péisage, so trees and landscapes.  
**0:17:31-0:17:36:**  And they encourage, they visit agricultures and they talk with them and they encourage  
**0:17:36-0:17:42:**  them to reinstall hedges at the limit of their parcels.  
**0:17:42-0:17:51:**  So they have met my technical director at a meeting somewhere and they talked about  
**0:17:51-0:18:03:**  their business and Jean Bernard told me, oh I've met some nice people, they help agricultures  
**0:18:03-0:18:05:**  to plant hedges.  
**0:18:05-0:18:08:**  Are you interested in making a test?  
**0:18:08-0:18:14:**  I know that you like wildlife, birds and maybe it could be a good opportunity to reintroduce  
**0:18:14-0:18:18:**  birds inside the parcels.  
**0:18:18-0:18:26:**  The first idea was there, visible biodiversity, not invisible biodiversity with the mycorrhizas.  
**0:18:26-0:18:36:**  And so we have started LIDAR, planting in 2011 100 meters of edge with a quite fast  
**0:18:36-0:18:39:**  result on visible biodiversity.  
**0:18:39-0:18:49:**  The first year because we had a few months later baby snakes, baby gash snakes that were  
**0:18:49-0:18:55:**  coming under the mulch protecting the roots of the edges.  
**0:18:55-0:19:01:**  So the first result, quite happy, quite encouraging us was that one.  
**0:19:01-0:19:11:**  So we were not thinking about agronomy at the base but some decisions to have more biodiversity  
**0:19:11-0:19:21:**  and wildlife corridors inside the estate and it was like opening a door on a new world.  
**0:19:21-0:19:30:**  And then through them I've met some agronomists like Konrad Schreiber that were talking about  
**0:19:30-0:19:38:**  cover crop and not only green manure, it's not exactly the same thing.  
**0:19:38-0:19:43:**  And so step by step we have developed the system.  
**0:19:43-0:19:56:**  But at the same time I was living sort of quite coming back to my old diplomas of water  
**0:19:56-0:20:02:**  and forestry that I had forgotten during my viticulture life.  
**0:20:02-0:20:03:**  Very interesting.  
**0:20:03-0:20:06:**  And also I really enjoyed when we had the prequel together you explained to me that  
**0:20:06-0:20:13:**  as a young child you were passionate about the biodiversity and the insects and the birds  
**0:20:13-0:20:18:**  and the snakes and you would go around and you had actually seen in your lifetime the  
**0:20:18-0:20:23:**  decline in those species that's with the hedges and with your work at the moment you're seeing  
**0:20:23-0:20:27:**  them come back but you're very attuned to the landscape you're working in since you  
**0:20:27-0:20:28:**  grew up here.  
**0:20:28-0:20:31:**  So you're visibly observing these things year on year.  
**0:20:31-0:20:38:**  Yeah and I remember when I started my diploma in agronomy the first year we had to make  
**0:20:38-0:20:50:**  an insect collection of 50 species and the same with plants, a collection of 50 species.  
**0:20:50-0:20:58:**  Quite large in the same ecosystem but with a maximum of families and genders.  
**0:20:58-0:21:06:**  And it was very easy in 86 to do that in Antonique in a few days.  
**0:21:06-0:21:15:**  And when I was back to the estate seven years later I tried to do the same, to find the  
**0:21:15-0:21:21:**  same species and to make a new collection and it was almost impossible to do that in  
**0:21:21-0:21:23:**  a so short time.  
**0:21:23-0:21:32:**  It was much longer to do the same and a lot of species were not present.  
**0:21:32-0:21:38:**  They had disappeared or they were at a very low level and so it was the same for birds  
**0:21:38-0:21:49:**  and things like that and snakes and frogs and the biomass was so low.  
**0:21:49-0:21:58:**  The biodiversity was so low it was impressive and now we see that it is coming back very  
**0:21:58-0:22:10:**  fast and the most important result we have today in agroforestry is that biodiversity  
**0:22:10-0:22:13:**  and that has almost no cost.  
**0:22:13-0:22:24:**  For the agronomic results it's something longer and we are only at the beginning of our experience.  
**0:22:24-0:22:28:**  We will just drop our mics, everybody has understood the message.  
**0:22:28-0:22:33:**  We just need to go out and plant hedges because with the experience that you have just come  
**0:22:33-0:22:37:**  back to us with we can transform biodiversity relatively fast with hedges and this is also  
**0:22:37-0:22:40:**  something that science is backing up.  
**0:22:40-0:22:44:**  We just have to get out there and start planting more trees really.  
**0:22:44-0:22:45:**  But of course that's not what we are going to do.  
**0:22:45-0:22:50:**  What we are going to do is understand the details of how you have planted them, what  
**0:22:50-0:22:55:**  species you have used, what spacings so we can have a bit of an understanding of the  
**0:22:55-0:23:00:**  practical design of those hedges.  
**0:23:00-0:23:07:**  I would love to know more about how many species you have included, what species, why.  
**0:23:07-0:23:10:**  Maybe you could tell us a bit about the design process.  
**0:23:10-0:23:18:**  So first we use local species.  
**0:23:18-0:23:20:**  That's very important.  
**0:23:20-0:23:30:**  You cannot talk about biodiversity if you introduce exotic species in your ecosystem.  
**0:23:30-0:23:35:**  Second you need to make a mix.  
**0:23:35-0:23:42:**  It's not a green concrete.  
**0:23:42-0:23:53:**  So we need diversity and we use something like 18-20 species in the hedges at least.  
**0:23:53-0:23:58:**  Some trees and some bush.  
**0:23:58-0:24:14:**  So the dominant species if you go to associations or to pepinerist, I don't know the word in  
**0:24:14-0:24:15:**  English.  
**0:24:15-0:24:16:**  Nursery.  
**0:24:16-0:24:33:**  To nurseries, they will deliver you mostly some maples, the European maples and mostly  
**0:24:33-0:24:39:**  acare campestris, les rables champêtres.  
**0:24:39-0:24:41:**  That's the base.  
**0:24:41-0:24:49:**  It's a good base because it's local and it's the natural companion of the vineyard, of  
**0:24:49-0:24:50:**  the vine.  
**0:24:50-0:25:01:**  They grew up together in the same ecosystem, the narrow forest following the rivers.  
**0:25:01-0:25:14:**  So the tree helping the vine to climb with water enough in the soil and light higher  
**0:25:14-0:25:16:**  in the canopy.  
**0:25:16-0:25:24:**  So they had a coevolution and so they were living together.  
**0:25:24-0:25:32:**  They have some genetics together and they share the same mycorrhizas.  
**0:25:32-0:25:42:**  So the first species you will introduce in vitreoforestry in the hedge will be obviously  
**0:25:42-0:25:48:**  the maples, acare campestris.  
**0:25:48-0:25:58:**  But you have a lot of trees that you can also use, some alms, le fraine in French, I don't  
**0:25:58-0:26:01:**  know the word in English.  
**0:26:01-0:26:04:**  Le charm.  
**0:26:04-0:26:07:**  So what's the Latin name?  
**0:26:07-0:26:08:**  Fraxinus.  
**0:26:08-0:26:10:**  Ah, so ash.  
**0:26:10-0:26:11:**  Ash.  
**0:26:11-0:26:19:**  And so we also use the elm.  
**0:26:19-0:26:28:**  That is if you let a hedge grow in Bordeaux on the limes and clay soils, the elms will  
**0:26:28-0:26:30:**  come first, naturally.  
**0:26:30-0:26:37:**  Because they are everywhere with the graffios, the disease that is affecting the elms and  
**0:26:37-0:26:46:**  they almost disappeared everywhere in Europe, they survive at a young stage like a bush.  
**0:26:46-0:26:58:**  And if they are in a hedge, they stay like juveniles because they are pruned every year  
**0:26:58-0:27:05:**  and they stay juvenile and they don't have the graffios and they survive like that.  
**0:27:05-0:27:06:**  And they are quite abundant.  
**0:27:06-0:27:16:**  If you let the hedge grow in Chateau Antony, you will have alms at 80%.  
**0:27:16-0:27:18:**  Is that the correct name?  
**0:27:18-0:27:19:**  Yes, it is.  
**0:27:19-0:27:22:**  They will be dominant.  
**0:27:22-0:27:36:**  We also use wild roses because they also make good micro-resis and a lot of some wild fruit  
**0:27:36-0:27:42:**  trees, wild prunes, some epineuar.  
**0:27:42-0:27:53:**  I don't know the names in English but we have a mix of 20 species, trees, but trees from,  
**0:27:53-0:27:58:**  mostly trees from open landscapes.  
**0:27:58-0:28:10:**  And some very small trees, bushes that will make quite diverse ecosystem.  
**0:28:10-0:28:14:**  The idea is to make a maximum of micro-resis.  
**0:28:14-0:28:20:**  So with a maximum of species, you will host a maximum of fungi.  
**0:28:20-0:28:24:**  To host a maximum of birds, so you need to feed them.  
**0:28:24-0:28:28:**  A maximum of insects, so you need diversity.  
**0:28:28-0:28:38:**  So what we need to avoid is invaders, exotic trees.  
**0:28:38-0:28:48:**  And when you have planted some hedges, if you want to increase the network, you don't  
**0:28:48-0:28:58:**  need to plant anymore because the animals will do the job.  
**0:28:58-0:29:00:**  The wine will do the job.  
**0:29:00-0:29:09:**  They will transport the seeds and today when I plant and replant a parcel where I have  
**0:29:09-0:29:18:**  no hedge, I let the nature do and I don't clean the limit of the parcel and the hedge  
**0:29:18-0:29:19:**  will come.  
**0:29:19-0:29:21:**  I only have to prune it.  
**0:29:21-0:29:25:**  That's very simple and I see what is coming.  
**0:29:25-0:29:33:**  And then if it's too poor, I will take seeds inside the rest of my hedges and I will enrich.  
**0:29:33-0:29:40:**  And these hedges are starting faster because they are not planted, they are seeded and  
**0:29:40-0:29:42:**  it's much more efficient.  
**0:29:42-0:29:52:**  But at the beginning, in a poor landscape with only vines for decades or almost a century,  
**0:29:52-0:29:55:**  you have to start with plantations.  
**0:29:55-0:30:05:**  So the second rule is follow your landscape.  
**0:30:05-0:30:12:**  You don't have to create a new network and to open highways.  
**0:30:12-0:30:20:**  You have to observe your estate first.  
**0:30:20-0:30:22:**  Do I have rivers?  
**0:30:22-0:30:27:**  If I have one, the first thing to do is to plant following the river.  
**0:30:27-0:30:31:**  If you have ditches, you follow the ditches.  
**0:30:31-0:30:42:**  These are some of sort of lost spaces apparently because they are lost for agriculture but  
**0:30:42-0:30:48:**  we need them to extract water by drainage.  
**0:30:48-0:30:54:**  If you have a river, you cannot cultivate the river.  
**0:30:54-0:31:08:**  So you can use these lost spaces and they will build a network and that will be current  
**0:31:08-0:31:12:**  because it's already a network.  
**0:31:12-0:31:24:**  So the first years, I've only followed the existing ditches bordering my parcels and  
**0:31:24-0:31:32:**  only planting this, I had more than 80% of my network.  
**0:31:32-0:31:37:**  So this is the second base.  
**0:31:37-0:31:42:**  And the third one is not too fast.  
**0:31:42-0:31:44:**  You need to learn.  
**0:31:44-0:31:53:**  So go step by step and if you learn quite fast, then you go faster every year and you're  
**0:31:53-0:31:58:**  able to plant more than one kilometer in one year if you want but don't start like that  
**0:31:58-0:32:00:**  at the beginning.  
**0:32:00-0:32:09:**  Start small with only a few hundred of meters or only 100 meters like I started and you  
**0:32:09-0:32:15:**  discover how to prune the first hedge and then you make your own experience.  
**0:32:15-0:32:24:**  And when the hedges are becoming strong, they are not becoming strong altogether because  
**0:32:24-0:32:34:**  then you have to learn how to prune and to make holes inside the older hedges and when  
**0:32:34-0:32:40:**  you learn, you make mistakes and you don't make the same mistakes on the whole network.  
**0:32:40-0:32:43:**  So step by step, that's another rule.  
**0:32:43-0:32:44:**  Very interesting.  
**0:32:44-0:32:46:**  You're providing some phenomenal feedback here.  
**0:32:46-0:32:50:**  I'm just going to ask a few questions to dig a bit deeper on a few elements.  
**0:32:50-0:32:54:**  Do you plant a single row or a double row?  
**0:32:54-0:33:07:**  I've planted single row but today when I have more space, I think that I will try to plant  
**0:33:07-0:33:14:**  double row because I think that for biodiversity, a larger hedge is much more impacting and  
**0:33:14-0:33:16:**  faster impacting.  
**0:33:16-0:33:25:**  But when you visit my hedges, the oldest ones, they are now 10 years old, they become larger.  
**0:33:25-0:33:30:**  That's the natural way they expand and so it's the way you prune them that will limit  
**0:33:30-0:33:31:**  them.  
**0:33:31-0:33:32:**  Only that.  
**0:33:32-0:33:36:**  And the second thing is about the ditches.  
**0:33:36-0:33:41:**  I started to plant both sides of the ditches.  
**0:33:41-0:33:49:**  Planting a hedge on one side and planting some salics on the other side.  
**0:33:49-0:33:55:**  You take a branch like that, you leave it in the soil and it's making roots.  
**0:33:55-0:34:05:**  It's very easy to do and if you miss it one year, so maybe one third will die, it's nothing.  
**0:34:05-0:34:10:**  You will plant the next winter and they will survive the next year.  
**0:34:10-0:34:26:**  And I try to cover my ditch with a closed canopy that is protecting my ditch or my river  
**0:34:26-0:34:35:**  from the sun and then the idea is to avoid to come with a machine inside the ditch to  
**0:34:35-0:34:42:**  clean it because with no light you will have no grass growing inside the ditch.  
**0:34:42-0:34:50:**  And this is a fantastic closing canopy that is starting to build in the first ditches  
**0:34:50-0:34:54:**  I've planted both sides.  
**0:34:54-0:35:03:**  I think that for biodiversity it's very interesting and for the cost to manage that is I believe  
**0:35:03-0:35:09:**  the same than the standard because you don't come with a machine inside the ditch.  
**0:35:09-0:35:14:**  You only have to prune the hedge and it's the same job.  
**0:35:14-0:35:15:**  Very interesting.  
**0:35:15-0:35:21:**  And coming back to the early phases of the establishment of the hedge, how did you manage  
**0:35:21-0:35:22:**  the planting?  
**0:35:22-0:35:27:**  Are you planting mechanically or are you planting with humans?  
**0:35:27-0:35:33:**  How are you using let's say volunteer people for this like open days?  
**0:35:33-0:35:39:**  How are you organizing planting the hedge at the start?  
**0:35:39-0:35:45:**  So we work a lot with the Agri-Paysage, so they come with a team and you pay them the  
**0:35:45-0:35:49:**  service that's one way.  
**0:35:49-0:35:56:**  As I told you most of my hedges today I don't plant them, they are natural and then we enrich  
**0:35:56-0:36:00:**  and I do that myself.  
**0:36:00-0:36:04:**  So enriching, I don't need a team to do that.  
**0:36:04-0:36:14:**  My workers, they know the job now and I also plant some trees with Les Vignerons du Vivant  
**0:36:14-0:36:15:**  when they come.  
**0:36:15-0:36:23:**  It's a school we have founded with some other estates in Medoc and with Les Apprenti de  
**0:36:23-0:36:30:**  Pérez and sometimes we have students that are coming and they make one or two days of  
**0:36:30-0:36:38:**  experimenting how to plant a hedge and so if we have to install a hedge and if it's  
**0:36:38-0:36:44:**  the week they need to make that experience they can come to my estate or to another one  
**0:36:44-0:36:45:**  and to help.  
**0:36:45-0:36:50:**  So we have several ways but mostly by Agri-Paysage.  
**0:36:50-0:36:55:**  In terms of the weed management at the start, what's been your learning experience there,  
**0:36:55-0:36:57:**  what's the process?  
**0:36:57-0:37:08:**  So first we make mulch, I did not talk about the mulch for the hedges and for the trees  
**0:37:08-0:37:10:**  it's the same.  
**0:37:10-0:37:14:**  When you plant a hedge or a tree they need a mulch.  
**0:37:14-0:37:20:**  All the mistakes I've made, all the trees I've lost, it was always the same reason no  
**0:37:20-0:37:23:**  mulch or not enough.  
**0:37:23-0:37:31:**  So that's important because we never have the time to give them water.  
**0:37:31-0:37:38:**  When we have to give water to them we are occupied to give water to the baby vines and  
**0:37:38-0:37:46:**  so when it's a line inside the parcel we can give water to the trees but not to all the  
**0:37:46-0:37:47:**  hedges it's not possible.  
**0:37:47-0:37:55:**  So the mulch is very, very important, it's a basic.  
**0:37:55-0:38:03:**  And so management of the trees at the beginning we do nothing.  
**0:38:03-0:38:11:**  When I started with my two first hedges I was quite anxious about the fight and the  
**0:38:11-0:38:18:**  competition because it was, as you told me, for the agronomist, the consultants, all the  
**0:38:18-0:38:26:**  analogists and my colleagues they were all talking about you plant hedges it will make  
**0:38:26-0:38:32:**  a competition for minerals, for water and for light with your vines.  
**0:38:32-0:38:41:**  So with that pressure I was self-limiting my experience and the two first years I've  
**0:38:41-0:38:49:**  shortened my hedges at the height of the vine and that was not good.  
**0:38:49-0:39:00:**  Today I don't do that because you damage them quite low so now I let them grow and I prune  
**0:39:00-0:39:05:**  them when they are higher than me.  
**0:39:05-0:39:19:**  The trees inside the hedges I try to prune the low branches on the first 35% of the tree  
**0:39:19-0:39:30:**  and then I let the canopy complete and when they grow up then I cut a new verticillis  
**0:39:30-0:39:33:**  of branches and that's it.  
**0:39:33-0:39:36:**  It's quite limited.  
**0:39:36-0:39:44:**  The only decision you have to make when you plant a hedge is from place to place you let  
**0:39:44-0:39:54:**  a tree grow higher than the hedge and you choose if you have place enough to leave it  
**0:39:54-0:40:04:**  in free growing or if you prune it like a... like a...  
**0:40:04-0:40:05:**  how?  
**0:40:05-0:40:07:**  Tête-artre in French.  
**0:40:07-0:40:10:**  Like a pollard.  
**0:40:10-0:40:11:**  Like a pollard, yes.  
**0:40:11-0:40:13:**  That's a good word.  
**0:40:13-0:40:16:**  So that's the only question.  
**0:40:16-0:40:20:**  Let him free or prune it like a pollard.  
**0:40:20-0:40:29:**  If you have no place, if you risk a competition for your machines, for the light, for... if  
**0:40:29-0:40:41:**  you want to limit the tree you prune it like a pollard and you will give him stronger roots  
**0:40:41-0:40:51:**  and you will open holes for more biodiversity and for birds and for bats and for insects  
**0:40:51-0:40:54:**  and for frogs, climbing frogs.  
**0:40:54-0:40:56:**  So it's good.  
**0:40:56-0:41:01:**  That's the two questions you will ask for the trees.  
**0:41:01-0:41:11:**  And for the bush, some of them we prune them very short at the base when they are basitonic.  
**0:41:11-0:41:20:**  If you cut them at the base, they will make a lot of new branches starting from the base.  
**0:41:20-0:41:33:**  So the hazelnut is living like that and with a hazelnut you can do that.  
**0:41:33-0:41:34:**  You prune it completely at the base.  
**0:41:34-0:41:42:**  You only keep one branch and you have a hole in your hedge and the hole is closing in one  
**0:41:42-0:41:45:**  year because they restart quite fast.  
**0:41:45-0:41:50:**  That type of small trees you can prune them like that.  
**0:41:50-0:41:58:**  And we manage the edge when it's at the low limit of the parcel and if we are facing some  
**0:41:58-0:42:10:**  spring frost and we need to make openings to let the cold air go through the parcel,  
**0:42:10-0:42:18:**  we open holes inside on key places inside the hedge like that.  
**0:42:18-0:42:20:**  But it's not a lot of work.  
**0:42:20-0:42:21:**  Interesting.  
**0:42:21-0:42:28:**  And so this pruning, how often on a line of hedge, how often do you prune?  
**0:42:28-0:42:30:**  Is it every year or every three years?  
**0:42:30-0:42:38:**  Yeah, that one I started to do it in the first hedges after seven years, six years, something  
**0:42:38-0:42:44:**  like that, depending on the strength of the starting of the hedge.  
**0:42:44-0:42:46:**  So it depends.  
**0:42:46-0:42:48:**  But it's not very early.  
**0:42:48-0:42:56:**  And the general pruning of the hedge, because we have to do that to limit the width and  
**0:42:56-0:43:05:**  the height of the hedge, you have to do that every two years, every year, depending on  
**0:43:05-0:43:10:**  the... if it's very vigorous, very strong, you have to do that every year.  
**0:43:10-0:43:16:**  But in some parcels, in some hedges, it's only every two years.  
**0:43:16-0:43:21:**  And you can't really do that mechanically because if you do that mechanically, you will  
**0:43:21-0:43:28:**  be cutting some of the long trees that you've decided to leave in the hedge, right?  
**0:43:28-0:43:30:**  How do you do it quite efficiently?  
**0:43:30-0:43:33:**  Because you now have four kilometers of hedges, if I understood well.  
**0:43:33-0:43:45:**  So what I do, I work with a small independent company that is cleaning my hedges.  
**0:43:45-0:43:52:**  And so they have all the machines you need for that, and they can control a hedge with  
**0:43:52-0:43:53:**  that.  
**0:43:53-0:43:56:**  So I make a color.  
**0:43:56-0:44:01:**  I use a color on the trees I want to keep.  
**0:44:01-0:44:06:**  And I tell them, when you cut a hedge, when you see the color on a tree, you stop.  
**0:44:06-0:44:08:**  You don't cut it.  
**0:44:08-0:44:14:**  You can... and then I give them the instruction, you limit the hedge at that large and that  
**0:44:14-0:44:15:**  high.  
**0:44:15-0:44:17:**  And when you see the color, don't cut.  
**0:44:17-0:44:23:**  So if you talk with them, and if you are very clear, they can do that.  
**0:44:23-0:44:33:**  But I only do that on the hedges that are limiting a ditch that they are cleaning.  
**0:44:33-0:44:38:**  But for all the other hedges, when I have no space enough to come with a tractor between  
**0:44:38-0:44:47:**  the hedge and the vine, and if I have no trail limiting on the other side the parcel, then  
**0:44:47-0:44:59:**  I come with a worker, only with a small electric hand pruner.  
**0:44:59-0:45:00:**  And it's quite fast.  
**0:45:00-0:45:01:**  It's very easy.  
**0:45:01-0:45:04:**  So it's not a big problem.  
**0:45:04-0:45:06:**  It's not taking a lot of time.  
**0:45:06-0:45:10:**  You're making me think about how close is your hedge from your vineyard?  
**0:45:10-0:45:17:**  Typically it's at least two meters.  
**0:45:17-0:45:24:**  But I have some edges that are very close.  
**0:45:24-0:45:27:**  I've made my experience in one parcel.  
**0:45:27-0:45:32:**  I've planted the edge at one meter from the last wall.  
**0:45:32-0:45:37:**  And I make a plaissé in French.  
**0:45:37-0:45:43:**  So I will take every plant in the hedge.  
**0:45:43-0:45:51:**  I take a branch, very supple, and I make a knot with the next one.  
**0:45:51-0:45:56:**  So I make the branch horizontal to the next plant in the hedge.  
**0:45:56-0:45:57:**  You bend the branch down.  
**0:45:57-0:45:59:**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**0:45:59-0:46:03:**  And I do the same with the vine.  
**0:46:03-0:46:07:**  So some branches of the vine, they will grow inside the hedge.  
**0:46:07-0:46:17:**  It's only an experience in one row, just for fun, because I can harvest the grapes behind  
**0:46:17-0:46:20:**  the hedge because I have a trail there.  
**0:46:20-0:46:24:**  So it's just for fun.  
**0:46:24-0:46:35:**  I have another parcel where I have a ditch and no place to plant the hedge on the right  
**0:46:35-0:46:45:**  side of the ditch and almost no place on the left side because it's between the ditch and  
**0:46:45-0:46:47:**  the first line of the hedge.  
**0:46:47-0:46:57:**  And I've tried to plant that hedge in that very narrow space so the edge is at one and  
**0:46:57-0:47:01:**  a half meter from the first row.  
**0:47:01-0:47:06:**  It's too close, so I have to prune that hedge more often on that side.  
**0:47:06-0:47:08:**  That's it.  
**0:47:08-0:47:13:**  And so I have two or three places like that.  
**0:47:13-0:47:20:**  But the standard is at least two meters or three or four meters when I have a trail and  
**0:47:20-0:47:25:**  I want to come with a machine between the hedge and the parcel.  
**0:47:25-0:47:26:**  Very nice.  
**0:47:26-0:47:29:**  There's lots of things to break down here and delve into, and we'll get there.  
**0:47:29-0:47:34:**  I just need to zoom back about 10 minutes when you said that the most important thing  
**0:47:34-0:47:36:**  to do was to mulch.  
**0:47:36-0:47:38:**  And the biggest mistakes that you made was when you lacked mulch.  
**0:47:38-0:47:45:**  So I can just hear the future listeners of this podcast asking themselves, so how much  
**0:47:45-0:47:49:**  mulch, what type of mulch do you prefer to use?  
**0:47:49-0:47:55:**  What kind of height and width do you aim for around the single line of hedge that you've  
**0:47:55-0:47:56:**  planted?  
**0:47:56-0:47:59:**  Taking into account here that of course we're talking about the planted hedges and that  
**0:47:59-0:48:04:**  the new hedges that grow on their own, it's another logic.  
**0:48:04-0:48:06:**  This is another type of system.  
**0:48:06-0:48:11:**  So maybe you could give us a bit of feedback as to your experience with mulching.  
**0:48:11-0:48:15:**  So we were talking only about the hedges.  
**0:48:15-0:48:21:**  That is only one of the three basics of phagophore history.  
**0:48:21-0:48:25:**  The two others are the trees inside the parcels.  
**0:48:25-0:48:35:**  So I plant trees now inside the parcels to have a max distance between every vine inside  
**0:48:35-0:48:42:**  a parcel and another species of tree of 15 meters.  
**0:48:42-0:48:50:**  But the third basic is the cover crop.  
**0:48:50-0:48:58:**  You are not building a complete agroforestry project only with the hedges and the trees.  
**0:48:58-0:49:07:**  If the soil is nicked, something is missing because the branches of the hedges that you  
**0:49:07-0:49:14:**  will crush, the branches of the pruned trees inside the parcel that you will crush and  
**0:49:14-0:49:22:**  send back to the soil, they will not produce biomass enough to feed the life of the soil.  
**0:49:22-0:49:28:**  You need the cover crop to do more than 80% of that job.  
**0:49:28-0:49:39:**  And in a nedled parcel, it's quite easy to install a cover crop with a mix of cereals,  
**0:49:39-0:49:47:**  legumes and some mustards and plants like that and radishes.  
**0:49:47-0:49:53:**  So different families that will explore different horizons and that will take different minerals  
**0:49:53-0:50:01:**  in the soil and that will altogether produce a lot of biomass that you will crush on the  
**0:50:01-0:50:09:**  soil to make natural mulch when you will destroy it.  
**0:50:09-0:50:19:**  We were teach, when we were teach about that in agriculture schools, about green menus.  
**0:50:19-0:50:29:**  You plant a cover crop and you destroy it and you incorporate it to the soil.  
**0:50:29-0:50:39:**  The other way is to plant a cover crop and to roll it on the soil to let it die and if  
**0:50:39-0:50:46:**  it's re-growing to come back to do it again, to make a natural mulch covering the soil  
**0:50:46-0:50:56:**  and feeding the soil slowly respecting the complete trophic chain of all the microorganisms  
**0:50:56-0:51:08:**  that will eat all that vegetal biomass and transform it step by step in minerals.  
**0:51:08-0:51:20:**  So in an eddled vineyard, it's possible to do that, to make cover crop with your own  
**0:51:20-0:51:26:**  mix or with a mix from you can buy complete.  
**0:51:26-0:51:27:**  I do both.  
**0:51:27-0:51:28:**  I make my own mix.  
**0:51:28-0:51:41:**  I also buy some premix like a wolf or things like that and the idea is to feed the soil  
**0:51:41-0:51:47:**  that will feed the vine.  
**0:51:47-0:51:55:**  And I believe that it's a very interesting way for eddled parcels that have their root  
**0:51:55-0:52:03:**  system complete, installed quite deep because they will never suffer of the competition  
**0:52:03-0:52:12:**  because the roots are deep enough and the system will be balanced.  
**0:52:12-0:52:23:**  But in a young vine, I've tried to make a cover crop the same year I was planting the  
**0:52:23-0:52:26:**  vine and that was very difficult.  
**0:52:26-0:52:35:**  I've made bad experiences with that, almost killing the baby vineyard in one parcel because  
**0:52:35-0:52:44:**  when you have a severe drought like I had in 2019 in the one and a half hectare I have  
**0:52:44-0:52:53:**  planted that year, the competition between my cover crop and the baby vines was too high  
**0:52:53-0:52:59:**  and a lot of vines never survived to that experience.  
**0:52:59-0:53:06:**  And we had to replace most of them the next year.  
**0:53:06-0:53:12:**  And a lot of seeds were invading the line under the vines, covering the vines and it  
**0:53:12-0:53:23:**  was, we were suffocated by all the work it was representing and so now I'm more careful.  
**0:53:23-0:53:32:**  When I plant a vine, I don't make a cover crop but I hate naked soils and I know that  
**0:53:32-0:53:37:**  I want to avoid that, I make a green manure.  
**0:53:37-0:53:45:**  So I choose to plant in autumn, to seed in autumn and I completely destroy and incorporate  
**0:53:45-0:53:50:**  my cover crop to the soil in spring before the starting of the new vine.  
**0:53:50-0:54:00:**  And then I control by cutting it quite short or by letting the natural grass being dominant  
**0:54:00-0:54:06:**  again and I control the size with a machine and that's it.  
**0:54:06-0:54:12:**  And I work the soil, I plug the soil under the line of vines only but not between the  
**0:54:12-0:54:14:**  two rows.  
**0:54:14-0:54:23:**  For the young vines, they need to make their roots with no competition for everything,  
**0:54:23-0:54:28:**  minerals and water, mostly water.  
**0:54:28-0:54:36:**  And you have to avoid the risk to be suffocated by too much biomass that is covering your  
**0:54:36-0:54:40:**  plant and they need light, they will not survive.  
**0:54:40-0:54:41:**  So it's too risky.  
**0:54:41-0:54:50:**  The two, three first years, they need to make their roots and then you have to make a compromise.  
**0:54:50-0:55:04:**  Yes, naked soil is not living enough but first, your first aim is to plant the vineyard and  
**0:55:04-0:55:07:**  then you will make a compromise.  
**0:55:07-0:55:15:**  It will be covered in winter, beginning of the spring and not in summer or very short  
**0:55:15-0:55:18:**  grass, that's it.  
**0:55:18-0:55:27:**  And after two or three years, when you have your roots, then you can start something different  
**0:55:27-0:55:29:**  with a real cover crop.  
**0:55:29-0:55:40:**  And I believe a lot in that practice because my feeling is that the model where you produce  
**0:55:40-0:55:48:**  a lot of vineyard, a lot of biomass that you crush on the soil, covering the soil, is the  
**0:55:48-0:55:57:**  best copy of the natural soil in a forest system.  
**0:55:57-0:56:03:**  The name agroforestry is not coming from the trees inside the parcels, from the edge following  
**0:56:03-0:56:04:**  the parcel.  
**0:56:04-0:56:06:**  A forest is not an edge.  
**0:56:06-0:56:14:**  The name agroforestry, the name of the concept is we try to copy the living soil of a forest  
**0:56:14-0:56:18:**  but without a forest covering your parcel.  
**0:56:18-0:56:27:**  And how copying the forest soil, you have to have the starter with the branches of the  
**0:56:27-0:56:42:**  vines, of the edges, of the trees you are pruning so they will give the basic lignin  
**0:56:42-0:56:52:**  to the soil, that is the next human starter, and you will complete by all the grass, you  
**0:56:52-0:56:56:**  will cultivate, all the species you will cultivate in your cover crop.  
**0:56:56-0:57:04:**  And these will produce most of the biomass with the starter inside.  
**0:57:04-0:57:12:**  And if you make a good mulch with that, then you will have a good copy of a forest soil  
**0:57:12-0:57:15:**  and you will be practicing agroforestry.  
**0:57:15-0:57:16:**  That's fascinating.  
**0:57:16-0:57:17:**  That's very interesting.  
**0:57:17-0:57:21:**  So you're covering the layers above the vine and below the vine in a way.  
**0:57:21-0:57:23:**  You're right.  
**0:57:23-0:57:26:**  We create different horizons.  
**0:57:26-0:57:30:**  We introduce verticality in the system.  
**0:57:30-0:57:35:**  A conventional agriculture system is very horizontal.  
**0:57:35-0:57:41:**  You cultivate potatoes or corn, it's only one level.  
**0:57:41-0:57:44:**  But when you have hedges, it's a second level.  
**0:57:44-0:57:51:**  When you have the vine, the hedges, the trees and covering the soil, the cover crop, you  
**0:57:51-0:57:53:**  will have four different levels.  
**0:57:53-0:58:03:**  So it's a much more complex ecosystem and you will completely use the whole volume of  
**0:58:03-0:58:05:**  your ecosystem.  
**0:58:05-0:58:07:**  And you can produce a lot of things.  
**0:58:07-0:58:18:**  So when I seed my parcels, we have finished the harvest this morning.  
**0:58:18-0:58:20:**  What are we doing tomorrow morning?  
**0:58:20-0:58:27:**  We will work the soils not deep, only a few centimeters on all the parcels and we will  
**0:58:27-0:58:28:**  seed.  
**0:58:28-0:58:30:**  Every parcels, every two rows we seed.  
**0:58:30-0:58:39:**  And we plant our mixture with the three big families and we will let the crop grow the  
**0:58:39-0:58:40:**  whole autumn.  
**0:58:40-0:58:44:**  So it's still warm in October.  
**0:58:44-0:58:51:**  So we have water again because the rain is back since last week.  
**0:58:51-0:59:01:**  So it will grow quite fast and we will have quite a cover crop within three or four weeks.  
**0:59:01-0:59:11:**  If November is quite soft, and that's the standard of Atlantic climate in Bordeaux,  
**0:59:11-0:59:20:**  we will have a second month where during the whole month of November, the cover crop will  
**0:59:20-0:59:24:**  continue to grow slower, but it will grow.  
**0:59:24-0:59:33:**  Then the herd of winter, December, January, it will grow slowly and it will restart in  
**0:59:33-0:59:36:**  February, March.  
**0:59:36-0:59:39:**  March, it will grow quite fast.  
**0:59:39-0:59:42:**  And when will the vineyard start?  
**0:59:42-0:59:43:**  In April.  
**0:59:43-0:59:53:**  So we can let it grow if we are lucky, quite fast, two months in autumn and two months  
**0:59:53-0:59:57:**  at the end of the winter, beginning of the spring.  
**0:59:57-1:00:05:**  And when the buds of the vines will open, then we need to come inside the parcels to  
**1:00:05-1:00:09:**  make the first treatments against the rot.  
**1:00:09-1:00:15:**  We will have to work to cut the double branches and make the green things and things like  
**1:00:15-1:00:17:**  that.  
**1:00:17-1:00:20:**  So we will work inside the vineyard.  
**1:00:20-1:00:29:**  And the vineyard will need a lot of water and a lot of minerals for his own growing.  
**1:00:29-1:00:34:**  So we need to reduce the competition with the cover crop.  
**1:00:34-1:00:38:**  So then we crush it on the soil.  
**1:00:38-1:00:45:**  But if we are lucky, if we are successful, we have behind us four months of, four complete  
**1:00:45-1:00:48:**  months of growing.  
**1:00:48-1:00:52:**  And it can be higher than the vineyard that time.  
**1:00:52-1:00:54:**  And it's a lot of biomass.  
**1:00:54-1:01:00:**  It's tons of biomass per hectare that you are giving to the soil and that will feed  
**1:01:00-1:01:02:**  the vineyard.  
**1:01:02-1:01:07:**  So then we have to make a compromise.  
**1:01:07-1:01:17:**  Sometimes we will need to feed the grass, the cover crop.  
**1:01:17-1:01:31:**  You will have to give nutrigene to 20 or 30 points of nutrigenes to the grass to feed  
**1:01:31-1:01:40:**  it because if you don't do that, they will eat the nutrigene that the vines will need.  
**1:01:40-1:01:41:**  For sure.  
**1:01:41-1:01:42:**  Okay?  
**1:01:42-1:01:43:**  Yeah, yeah.  
**1:01:43-1:01:51:**  When you destroy your cover crop, all the microorganisms, all the batteries that will  
**1:01:51-1:02:00:**  eat all the organic materials you give back to the soil, they will need for their own  
**1:02:00-1:02:03:**  growth, they will need some nutrigene.  
**1:02:03-1:02:05:**  They will take it in the soil.  
**1:02:05-1:02:08:**  So you can have a competition with your vine.  
**1:02:08-1:02:14:**  So you have to feed the vine, to help the vine that time.  
**1:02:14-1:02:25:**  So to feed your mulch with nutrigene if you want to avoid the competition with the vineyard.  
**1:02:25-1:02:30:**  So these key moments are maybe important to manage.  
**1:02:30-1:02:39:**  But when you do that, when you avoid that risk of competition for nutrigene, you only  
**1:02:39-1:02:41:**  have advantages.  
**1:02:41-1:02:49:**  You have a cover crop that is protecting your soil against UVs, against drought because  
**1:02:49-1:03:01:**  it will limit water evaporation and it will slowly feed all the trophic chain until the  
**1:03:01-1:03:04:**  last minerals that will feed the vine.  
**1:03:04-1:03:07:**  So it's a very interesting practice.  
**1:03:07-1:03:14:**  Feeding the soil with plants that will feed the vine herself.  
**1:03:14-1:03:18:**  It's fascinating stuff and it's interesting to understand that it's also working super  
**1:03:18-1:03:20:**  well in your context in the vineyard.  
**1:03:20-1:03:24:**  I wanted to talk a bit about as well the trees.  
**1:03:24-1:03:30:**  This is the last element of the system, your agro-cological system that you've described.  
**1:03:30-1:03:36:**  So now you are pushing the limits even further in a way and you've already started including  
**1:03:36-1:03:39:**  trees inside the vineyard plots.  
**1:03:39-1:03:43:**  So it's not just on the edges like you've done with the hedges but actually inside.  
**1:03:43-1:03:48:**  So what kind of species have you chosen to plant inside?  
**1:03:48-1:03:55:**  How are you managing competition with the vine which is something that clearly as you've  
**1:03:55-1:03:58:**  described has a certain risk?  
**1:03:58-1:04:02:**  Maybe you could explain to us a bit about that system.  
**1:04:02-1:04:03:**  About the trees.  
**1:04:03-1:04:12:**  They are very important in the system because what we try to do...  
**1:04:12-1:04:27:**  One of the keys in microforestry is that we are coming back to the herd of the forestry  
**1:04:27-1:04:35:**  soil that is the fungi.  
**1:04:35-1:04:41:**  In forestry, in pure forestry, we have never forgotten the fungi.  
**1:04:41-1:04:49:**  I was teaching in forestry school that chemistry minerals in forestry are not good because  
**1:04:49-1:04:59:**  they destroy the fungi and we need the fungi to have healthy trees.  
**1:04:59-1:05:06:**  So mycorrhizae is something quite familiar in forestry.  
**1:05:06-1:05:15:**  In agriculture, we have for decades completely forgotten microphysis.  
**1:05:15-1:05:26:**  We were feeding the soils for decades with mineral fertilizers that were toxic for the  
**1:05:26-1:05:36:**  fungi, we were practicing a lot of plugging of the soils, working the soils too much that  
**1:05:36-1:05:45:**  was not good for the fungi and we were using a lot of chemicals that were selected to kill  
**1:05:45-1:05:55:**  all the fungi that were developing disease of our crops but when coming on the soil,  
**1:05:55-1:06:04:**  they were also killing the fungi inside the soil and because they were systemic, they  
**1:06:04-1:06:12:**  were also killing the microphysis inside the plant.  
**1:06:12-1:06:22:**  So we have slowly built a system where all the plants we were cultivating in agriculture  
**1:06:22-1:06:29:**  were orphans or almost orphans of most of their microphysis and the system we want to  
**1:06:29-1:06:40:**  build again in agroforestry is to give the microphysis back to the plants and to reintroduce  
**1:06:40-1:06:43:**  the fungi in the heart of the system.  
**1:06:43-1:06:55:**  So to make a link between, to have that link between the vines and the trees, we know that  
**1:06:55-1:07:02:**  we need a max distance between a vine and a tree of 15-20 meters.  
**1:07:02-1:07:12:**  So that's the reason I plant a row of, in every parcel I'm planting or replanting, I  
**1:07:12-1:07:19:**  plant a row of trees every 30 meters inside the parcel.  
**1:07:19-1:07:20:**  So I lose space.  
**1:07:20-1:07:27:**  I lose because I cancel two rows, I plant 20 rows, one and a half meter between two  
**1:07:27-1:07:38:**  rows, so I plant 20 rows, 30 meters, then I cancel two rows, so I lose two on 22, I  
**1:07:38-1:07:43:**  lose 9% of my surface with no vine on that surface.  
**1:07:43-1:07:52:**  But I have my vines back because I increase the density inside the lines.  
**1:07:52-1:07:59:**  Between two rows, between two vines inside the row, I had previously one meter and today  
**1:07:59-1:08:02:**  I have only 90 centimeters.  
**1:08:02-1:08:05:**  So I win 11%.  
**1:08:05-1:08:11:**  So I even increase the density with that.  
**1:08:11-1:08:16:**  And then I adapt my pruning to have the number of buds I need.  
**1:08:16-1:08:22:**  But it's possible to do that and in theory it's quite difficult to apply, but it's possible  
**1:08:22-1:08:31:**  to have the same potential of production to preserve it.  
**1:08:31-1:08:35:**  So the idea is to have a network with trees from place to place.  
**1:08:35-1:08:40:**  I have my hedge, 20 rows, a line of trees, 20 rows, a line of trees, etc. and then a  
**1:08:40-1:08:44:**  new hedge at the end of the parcel.  
**1:08:44-1:08:53:**  And every vine will be at the max distance of 15 meters from another species of trees.  
**1:08:53-1:09:03:**  And so they will make richer connections, they will have more opportunities for micro-resis.  
**1:09:03-1:09:11:**  And the idea is to increase the biodiversity in the soil and we suppose that it will be  
**1:09:11-1:09:17:**  positive for the life of the soil and for the agronomy.  
**1:09:17-1:09:19:**  I have no proof of that.  
**1:09:19-1:09:27:**  I have no analysis to tell you it's true, it's efficient.  
**1:09:27-1:09:36:**  But what I see about the impact of the hedges, what I see about the impact of leaving cover  
**1:09:36-1:09:43:**  crop year after year on an old parcel, I'm sure that the trees will have the same positive  
**1:09:43-1:09:44:**  impact.  
**1:09:44-1:09:51:**  You mentioned earlier on, you talked about the ecological result of bringing in these  
**1:09:51-1:09:54:**  trees into your farm through biodiversity, etc.  
**1:09:54-1:10:00:**  But you also mentioned the agronomic results that will take much longer to start being  
**1:10:00-1:10:01:**  visible.  
**1:10:01-1:10:04:**  So of course, we're in a space here where we don't have a lot of visibility and science  
**1:10:04-1:10:05:**  on this.  
**1:10:05-1:10:07:**  There's not a lot of people that have done this before.  
**1:10:07-1:10:11:**  So our best shot is for somebody like you that's already been doing it for 10 years  
**1:10:11-1:10:17:**  now or 11, what are the expected agronomic results that you expect?  
**1:10:17-1:10:21:**  You alluded to some at the beginning already, but it's worth repeating them and it's worth  
**1:10:21-1:10:24:**  kind of reinstating this idea and delving a bit deeper.  
**1:10:24-1:10:32:**  So what are the expected agronomic results that you are expecting to see with trees inside?  
**1:10:32-1:10:34:**  Now I'm focusing on trees, less on the cover crop.  
**1:10:34-1:10:35:**  This is more clarified.  
**1:10:35-1:10:41:**  So both together, trees and cover crop, we need both.  
**1:10:41-1:10:50:**  So first, when you see a tree, you only see the visible part of the iceberg.  
**1:10:50-1:10:56:**  So a large part of the biomass of the tree is in the roots.  
**1:10:56-1:11:08:**  So when you see biodiversity that is increasing in the air, in the tree, in the edge, you  
**1:11:08-1:11:13:**  can be sure at 100% that you increase the biodiversity inside the soil.  
**1:11:13-1:11:15:**  You can be sure about that.  
**1:11:15-1:11:16:**  So what are the...  
**1:11:16-1:11:21:**  But the question is that we don't see it.  
**1:11:21-1:11:25:**  So we cannot measure that with our eyes.  
**1:11:25-1:11:29:**  You have to make analysis and we are practitioners.  
**1:11:29-1:11:32:**  We are cultivators, so we are not scientists.  
**1:11:32-1:11:35:**  We are not spending our time to make analysis.  
**1:11:35-1:11:42:**  And I could be happy to have students that are coming to see what is happening inside  
**1:11:42-1:11:44:**  the soil.  
**1:11:44-1:11:48:**  So what are the expecting results?  
**1:11:48-1:11:58:**  First, more species that are completing the trophic chain, transforming all the organic  
**1:11:58-1:12:06:**  inventory of the soil in minerals, a repeated cycle with a long chain of species.  
**1:12:06-1:12:08:**  I want to...  
**1:12:08-1:12:13:**  So I expect that we will enrich that cycle.  
**1:12:13-1:12:24:**  Second, increasing the organic percentage of the soil and living organic material that  
**1:12:24-1:12:37:**  is recycled, not stored and dead, but something living and transformed.  
**1:12:37-1:12:43:**  So we want to increase the organic percentage of the soil and we expect to do something  
**1:12:43-1:12:45:**  quite efficient facing that.  
**1:12:45-1:12:55:**  And for that, I have some measures because the first parcels I've resized with the hedges,  
**1:12:55-1:13:03:**  the trees inside and the cover crop, after four years of practicing the cover crop, I'm  
**1:13:03-1:13:07:**  now climbing the slope back.  
**1:13:07-1:13:15:**  And I observed that from two percent after four years, I'm at three percent on some parcels.  
**1:13:15-1:13:18:**  So that's good, that's positive.  
**1:13:18-1:13:26:**  Another thing we are expecting is that we will protect the soil, again, too much evaporation  
**1:13:26-1:13:29:**  in summer.  
**1:13:29-1:13:38:**  Another thing we expect is that the network of the roots of the trees, they will help  
**1:13:38-1:13:43:**  us to make a natural drainage of the soils.  
**1:13:43-1:13:58:**  And it's visible that the prisms of the trees can help because they have deeper roots.  
**1:13:58-1:14:08:**  And when you prune the trees, most of these roots will die and they will open some trails  
**1:14:08-1:14:12:**  for air, water inside the soil.  
**1:14:12-1:14:16:**  So that's good.  
**1:14:16-1:14:26:**  And the last thing I can talk about, the expected results, and it's an evidence, all these trees  
**1:14:26-1:14:30:**  we are planting, they fix a lot of carbon.  
**1:14:30-1:14:33:**  So long-term impact.  
**1:14:33-1:14:40:**  Fixing carbon is good for environment and I believe that we have to do that, to plant  
**1:14:40-1:14:50:**  hedges, trees, to build and cover crop to build a new agriculture, fixing much more  
**1:14:50-1:14:58:**  carbon from the air, facing the global warming we have today, it's very important.  
**1:14:58-1:15:08:**  And the trees in the parcels will be very positive for facing the heat waves because  
**1:15:08-1:15:12:**  they will act like natural air conditioners.  
**1:15:12-1:15:19:**  They take water quite deep in the soil and they evaporate at three, four, five meters  
**1:15:19-1:15:22:**  high, they evaporate water.  
**1:15:22-1:15:32:**  And that has an impact on the microclimate of the parcel and it's possible to decrease  
**1:15:32-1:15:39:**  the peak, to erase the peak of the heat waves by two, three Celsius and sometimes more.  
**1:15:39-1:15:55:**  And you have experienced that in other cultures when you are practicing agroforestry in serials.  
**1:15:55-1:16:05:**  I've heard that you have measured, you have experimented this impact on the microclimate  
**1:16:05-1:16:06:**  of the parcel.  
**1:16:06-1:16:08:**  And I try to do the same in my parcels.  
**1:16:08-1:16:10:**  No, that's very interesting.  
**1:16:10-1:16:16:**  And so what you're saying is that you're expecting, and again, I'm taking your words from before,  
**1:16:16-1:16:18:**  it's more of a medium long-term result.  
**1:16:18-1:16:24:**  You're expecting the soil to be more fertile, your vineyard to produce more because your  
**1:16:24-1:16:26:**  soil is richer, right?  
**1:16:26-1:16:28:**  You're expecting there to be a microclimate effect.  
**1:16:28-1:16:34:**  And as you had commented earlier on with the hedge to be kind of buffering the extremes  
**1:16:34-1:16:36:**  of cold and hot.  
**1:16:36-1:16:43:**  And so, and all of this, you're expecting that the competition effects through soil  
**1:16:43-1:16:48:**  water, soil water, nutrients and light will be lower than the benefits.  
**1:16:48-1:16:53:**  I'm sure about that because of the trees, we can prune them and control their size.  
**1:16:53-1:16:59:**  So competition for light is not a big problem.  
**1:16:59-1:17:04:**  We prune the vines, we can prune the trees how we want.  
**1:17:04-1:17:13:**  So it's, so and I'm sure by 100% that we can avoid the light competition.  
**1:17:13-1:17:24:**  The water competition, I'm sure with a good cover crop that we limit the evaporation on  
**1:17:24-1:17:25:**  the soil.  
**1:17:25-1:17:31:**  So it's good for saving water in the soil.  
**1:17:31-1:17:39:**  The trees that are taking water quite deep in the soil, if they refresh the atmosphere  
**1:17:39-1:17:45:**  like a natural air conditioner will help us.  
**1:17:45-1:17:58:**  So I don't see where we will lose, so more with competition than we win with the advantages.  
**1:17:58-1:18:01:**  We are not planting pines.  
**1:18:01-1:18:15:**  We are planting species that can grow close to the vine without competition with the vine.  
**1:18:15-1:18:23:**  So they share the same mycorrhizas, they live together because they had the evolution to  
**1:18:23-1:18:24:**  live together.  
**1:18:24-1:18:28:**  So if you do that with pines, it will be a problem.  
**1:18:28-1:18:32:**  Of course, that's naturally going to be something that's really important.  
**1:18:32-1:18:35:**  But what it's making me think right now what you're saying is that it's really a system  
**1:18:35-1:18:36:**  as well.  
**1:18:36-1:18:41:**  You can't just be planting trees in the middle of your parcel without adapting also, for  
**1:18:41-1:18:45:**  example, including cover crops to be reducing evaporation without the, I mean, they all  
**1:18:45-1:18:48:**  kind of work together and the overall result.  
**1:18:48-1:18:53:**  And it's also, it's important to not be separating and simplifying these things too much.  
**1:18:53-1:18:57:**  We're trying to imitate an ecosystem which is highly complex.  
**1:18:57-1:19:01:**  And so by including all these elements, but again, being careful with variety choices,  
**1:19:01-1:19:06:**  management in terms of pruning, planting methods, when we integrate these things or not, being  
**1:19:06-1:19:09:**  careful about many agronomic details, which you've gained quite a lot of experience with  
**1:19:09-1:19:14:**  and expressed some here in the podcast, then you can have a system which is more resilient  
**1:19:14-1:19:21:**  to the future stresses that we're expecting from current and future from climate change  
**1:19:21-1:19:27:**  and just generally the stresses that we experience in farming.  
**1:19:27-1:19:28:**  That's really, really interesting.  
**1:19:28-1:19:33:**  I'm going to just shift the conversation a bit now towards the economics.  
**1:19:33-1:19:37:**  I think this will finish off the interview with this topic.  
**1:19:37-1:19:41:**  And this is something we had started talking about at the beginning in our prequel.  
**1:19:41-1:19:48:**  And one of the things that you were saying is that currently these practices that you're  
**1:19:48-1:19:53:**  describing, planting the hedges, managing the hedges, planting the trees, et cetera,  
**1:19:53-1:20:00:**  that they're costing you money, but they're not necessarily generating a direct income.  
**1:20:00-1:20:04:**  So I don't want to put words in your mouth at all here, but I just wanted to set a bit  
**1:20:04-1:20:06:**  the context of the conversation we started having.  
**1:20:06-1:20:10:**  I mean, maybe we could talk a bit, you could express to us a bit the economics of it.  
**1:20:10-1:20:16:**  Do you see this as being an economical, profitable venture at the end to be including these things?  
**1:20:16-1:20:18:**  Could it be more so and how?  
**1:20:18-1:20:21:**  Do you think your neighbors would be looking at this and wanting, taking into account that  
**1:20:21-1:20:25:**  many of the people that will be engaging with agroecology in the future will be doing so  
**1:20:25-1:20:29:**  because of economic reasons, not because of a necessarily strong belief for it?  
**1:20:29-1:20:34:**  Do you think this is relevant to people that are looking towards agroecology and agroforestry  
**1:20:34-1:20:38:**  for financial reasons?  
**1:20:38-1:20:42:**  Maybe you could elaborate more on this.  
**1:20:42-1:20:45:**  It's a bit complex to answer that question.  
**1:20:45-1:20:48:**  The fact is that we are producing wine.  
**1:20:48-1:21:00:**  So wine, you do not need wine like you need wheat or corn or it's not the basic of your  
**1:21:00-1:21:02:**  life.  
**1:21:02-1:21:04:**  It's a pleasure.  
**1:21:04-1:21:08:**  And we are producing premium wines.  
**1:21:08-1:21:18:**  So they have a certain price and people that are buying that kind of wines, they accept  
**1:21:18-1:21:29:**  and they prefer to pay the price to have a wine that is grown in a natural environment,  
**1:21:29-1:21:34:**  to encourage a vine that is preserving his environment.  
**1:21:34-1:21:40:**  And a lot of clients are ready to help for that, to pay the price.  
**1:21:40-1:21:50:**  So I'm convinced that if I tell the story to my clients, they will follow us if it's  
**1:21:50-1:21:53:**  reasonable.  
**1:21:53-1:22:06:**  And because we were among the pioneers of the agroforestry, the vitiferous tree in Bordeaux,  
**1:22:06-1:22:14:**  the many mille-grélier were, I believe, the first one to start that years before me.  
**1:22:14-1:22:23:**  And I was the first one to start it in Medoc, at the scale of the estate.  
**1:22:23-1:22:26:**  So yes, it has a cost.  
**1:22:26-1:22:36:**  The hedges, it's a cost, but it's a small cost facing the total income of the estate.  
**1:22:36-1:22:42:**  The cover crop, yes, it has a cost, but I save some fertilizers.  
**1:22:42-1:22:50:**  So it is a partial compensation of the cost.  
**1:22:50-1:23:00:**  The trees, yes, they have a cost, but it's minor facing the total production cost I have.  
**1:23:00-1:23:10:**  And the benefits I have today in terms of image is higher than my cost.  
**1:23:10-1:23:18:**  But if everybody is doing that, it will be a standard, and for the image, it will maybe  
**1:23:18-1:23:25:**  not be the same balance, so I'm quite careful when talking about that.  
**1:23:25-1:23:33:**  You cannot talk about the economic model when you take an advantage for your image and you  
**1:23:33-1:23:36:**  cannot tell to your colleagues.  
**1:23:36-1:23:38:**  For sure, you will have the same advantage.  
**1:23:38-1:23:44:**  I don't know their own story, how they are able to sell it to their clients.  
**1:23:44-1:23:48:**  So you understand that I'm quite careful about that.  
**1:23:48-1:24:03:**  But I believe that if we have a look at a very long term, the term of the live duration  
**1:24:03-1:24:05:**  of a tree.  
**1:24:05-1:24:13:**  So when we plant a vine, we plant it for half a century, 40 years, 50 years, something like  
**1:24:13-1:24:18:**  that, if we work well.  
**1:24:18-1:24:30:**  And if I plant my hedge following the parcel and 50 trees per hectare in my model, when  
**1:24:30-1:24:44:**  I will replant the parcel and restart from scratch with a new parcel, I can keep a certain  
**1:24:44-1:24:47:**  percentage of my trees and replant the parcel.  
**1:24:47-1:24:59:**  And maybe I can cut the largest trees, one half of the trees, one half of the line, so  
**1:24:59-1:25:07:**  I cannot imagine because I planted my first trees in 2016, so they are quite small.  
**1:25:07-1:25:14:**  But the idea is if we cut one half of the trees when we plant the parcel, 50 years later,  
**1:25:14-1:25:24:**  and the second half, 50 years later, after one century, these trees will be large enough  
**1:25:24-1:25:32:**  if they are pruned at three and a half meters high, you will have a trunk.  
**1:25:32-1:25:46:**  And if you work well with no branches, so no nuts inside, quite pure, and with rare  
**1:25:46-1:26:01:**  species that are not abundant on the wood market, like the home is quite rare, the wild  
**1:26:01-1:26:13:**  cherry, the wild cherry, the market is quite low today, but some trees like the, also I  
**1:26:13-1:26:20:**  don't remember the names in English, so no interest, but some of these trees, the wood  
**1:26:20-1:26:23:**  has a good value.  
**1:26:23-1:26:32:**  And if you have thousand of hectares of vineyards with the trees inside, we will build a new  
**1:26:32-1:26:34:**  market, build a new offer.  
**1:26:34-1:26:39:**  Alone, I will not be attractive to sell that wood because the wood merchants, they will  
**1:26:39-1:26:49:**  not come to my estate to buy 20 or 15 trees.  
**1:26:49-1:27:00:**  But if we are dozens of viticulture doing the same, they will have a market facing them  
**1:27:00-1:27:09:**  with larger volumes, and I'm sure that it's possible to dream about and to build a new  
**1:27:09-1:27:19:**  market with rare trees produced inside the vineyard that will give value to the producer  
**1:27:19-1:27:24:**  when a new income, when he's replanting the parcel.  
**1:27:24-1:27:29:**  And that time, we need a lot of money to replant a parcel.  
**1:27:29-1:27:39:**  Replanting a parcel has a cost of at least 30,000 euros per hectare, 40,000 euros per  
**1:27:39-1:27:40:**  hectare.  
**1:27:40-1:27:50:**  So if you have a new income with the trees you are cutting, it can pay a part of the  
**1:27:50-1:27:52:**  replantation you are currently doing.  
**1:27:52-1:28:03:**  So it's only a dream, but I'm sure it's also a possible market, and we need that for future.  
**1:28:03-1:28:05:**  We need diversification.  
**1:28:05-1:28:07:**  So I know another model.  
**1:28:07-1:28:14:**  Domaine Emile Grelier, they plant more fruit trees, and they have a production, jams, things  
**1:28:14-1:28:15:**  like that.  
**1:28:15-1:28:17:**  They sell the fruits.  
**1:28:17-1:28:19:**  So it's another side production.  
**1:28:19-1:28:20:**  It's their model.  
**1:28:20-1:28:28:**  I don't want that one in my estate because I'm focused on my premium wines, and we have  
**1:28:28-1:28:37:**  a lot of things to do for the harvest, for the green things and things like that.  
**1:28:37-1:28:44:**  And if we are disturbed by the fruit season in the trees at the same moment, it's not  
**1:28:44-1:28:45:**  good.  
**1:28:45-1:28:49:**  So when I have fruit trees, I lose the trees, they feed the soil.  
**1:28:49-1:29:00:**  It's good for that, for biodiversity, and I eat some for my personal use to make a few  
**1:29:00-1:29:01:**  boxes of jam.  
**1:29:01-1:29:03:**  That's it.  
**1:29:03-1:29:14:**  So I'm more on the wood side if we are talking about economy because I'm a forester also.  
**1:29:14-1:29:19:**  So I'd like to build a new market, but alone I will never do that.  
**1:29:19-1:29:30:**  But if we are hundreds of viticulturists doing the same, we will build a market together.  
**1:29:30-1:29:32:**  That's very interesting.  
**1:29:32-1:29:36:**  And also in terms of the, maybe I'm repeating some of the things you've said, but in terms  
**1:29:36-1:29:42:**  of the management of the trees, what you're saying is that it's quite marginal, the cost  
**1:29:42-1:29:46:**  of pruning the trees, even the trees that are inside the, it's quite marginal as compared  
**1:29:46-1:29:49:**  to the other costs that you have.  
**1:29:49-1:29:52:**  It's something that the team that you currently have, you don't necessarily need to hire an  
**1:29:52-1:29:54:**  extra person for it.  
**1:29:54-1:29:58:**  No, no, no.  
**1:29:58-1:30:06:**  We have in winter, we have some lost days and we can do things like that, that period.  
**1:30:06-1:30:15:**  When it's too cold, too hard to prune the vine, why not?  
**1:30:15-1:30:25:**  It's possible to prune the trees and when we have to stop the pruning because we are  
**1:30:25-1:30:34:**  too fast and we have to slow it because we want to keep some hectares for late pruning,  
**1:30:34-1:30:45:**  facing the risk of frost, we can manage some holes inside the winter period to work the  
**1:30:45-1:30:46:**  trees.  
**1:30:46-1:30:47:**  Nice.  
**1:30:47-1:30:52:**  Do you imagine your neighbors that are not necessarily working or colleagues that aren't  
**1:30:52-1:30:58:**  necessarily working with a speciality wines that have got, you know, maybe they're working  
**1:30:58-1:31:04:**  on finer margins or that are working more on scale.  
**1:31:04-1:31:09:**  Do you imagine that they could be interested in the type of practices that you have been  
**1:31:09-1:31:13:**  implemented on Chateau Antonique?  
**1:31:13-1:31:15:**  Some of them they can.  
**1:31:15-1:31:22:**  I'm sure that it will not be the standard quite fast but some can.  
**1:31:22-1:31:25:**  The edges are spreading now.  
**1:31:25-1:31:31:**  A lot of producers are planting hedges when they will plant a parcel because it's coming  
**1:31:31-1:31:34:**  back in our culture.  
**1:31:34-1:31:41:**  For the trees inside the parcels, it will be longer because people are hesitating.  
**1:31:41-1:31:50:**  We were teaching in agronomy schools that trees inside the parcels were the enemies  
**1:31:50-1:32:02:**  because they were hosting some fungi that were quite, that were killing the vineyards.  
**1:32:02-1:32:07:**  And so now we are more experimented.  
**1:32:07-1:32:17:**  We know that the problem was that before, so a century before the pouridiers, I don't  
**1:32:17-1:32:30:**  know the name of the fungi, so he's developing that disease, was the cause of that disease  
**1:32:30-1:32:33:**  was not the tree.  
**1:32:33-1:32:38:**  It was the presence of a tree that was ill.  
**1:32:38-1:32:47:**  If your trees are healthy, they live together with the vineyard and they don't have that  
**1:32:47-1:32:50:**  disease.  
**1:32:50-1:32:58:**  If they are not healthy, if they're ill, they will be weak and then these porosite  
**1:32:58-1:33:04:**  fungi will develop a lot and that will be a problem.  
**1:33:04-1:33:13:**  So if your ecosystem is balanced, if you have a lot of biodiversity, fungi's biodiversity  
**1:33:13-1:33:20:**  in your soil, you will have a competition between fungi's and they will compete the  
**1:33:20-1:33:21:**  powers of fungi's.  
**1:33:21-1:33:26:**  They will occupy the ecosystem and they will limit their presence.  
**1:33:26-1:33:29:**  So the problem is not the trees, it's the ecosystem.  
**1:33:29-1:33:31:**  Is it balanced or not?  
**1:33:31-1:33:35:**  And are the trees in good health or not?  
**1:33:35-1:33:38:**  Yes, very interesting, very, very interesting.  
**1:33:38-1:33:46:**  This is a fascinating stuff and I guess I'll finish off with one last question as a speciality  
**1:33:46-1:33:48:**  wine producer.  
**1:33:48-1:33:52:**  I'll say something and maybe you can confirm what you're seeing and what you're expecting  
**1:33:52-1:33:57:**  with the trees, notably the trees inside the parcel that have going to have quite a strong  
**1:33:57-1:34:02:**  influence on the area through the mycorrhizal network, but also through the light and the  
**1:34:02-1:34:05:**  water and the nutrient flows and the organic matter.  
**1:34:05-1:34:09:**  You're expecting this to have a positive effect on the quality of your wine to have zero effect  
**1:34:09-1:34:14:**  or what's the effect that you're expecting it to have?  
**1:34:14-1:34:15:**  On the wine himself?  
**1:34:15-1:34:16:**  Yes.  
**1:34:16-1:34:20:**  And of course connected to the quality of the grape.  
**1:34:20-1:34:30:**  So, on the vine and on the wine, I can talk about both of them.  
**1:34:30-1:34:40:**  Today I'm happier in the vineyard I see around my home and inside the estate because that  
**1:34:40-1:34:50:**  life, that biodiversity that is back is a result that is very visible and that takes  
**1:34:50-1:34:54:**  nothing to me in terms of volume.  
**1:34:54-1:35:03:**  So my average production is the same than my closest neighbor and they are not organic,  
**1:35:03-1:35:07:**  they are not in agroforestry and we produce almost the same volumes.  
**1:35:07-1:35:12:**  Sometimes I produce more, sometimes less.  
**1:35:12-1:35:23:**  The most important risk is the spring frost with the cover crop because if you are not  
**1:35:23-1:35:29:**  good enough managing your cover crop, you can lose a lot with the spring frost.  
**1:35:29-1:35:34:**  When it's high enough to cover the vineyard, it's a protection.  
**1:35:34-1:35:39:**  When it's too short at the limit of the buds, you have to destroy it a few weeks before  
**1:35:39-1:35:42:**  the frost season.  
**1:35:42-1:35:45:**  It's too risky.  
**1:35:45-1:35:57:**  But except that point and the question of the new plantations, it has no impact on your  
**1:35:57-1:36:08:**  volume and I think that the positive effects we are expecting will be more important than  
**1:36:08-1:36:11:**  the negative impact.  
**1:36:11-1:36:18:**  Talking about the wine himself, a lot of clients are telling us that the style of the wine  
**1:36:18-1:36:24:**  change a lot in Anthony, that the wines are fresher.  
**1:36:24-1:36:33:**  Even with the global warming we are facing like everybody, vintages are warmer, the droughts  
**1:36:33-1:36:41:**  are longer, so the alcohol levels are higher than before and the acidities in the wines  
**1:36:41-1:36:44:**  are lower than before.  
**1:36:44-1:36:53:**  And today, we are able to produce wines that are lower in alcohol than our neighbors and  
**1:36:53-1:36:55:**  higher in acidity.  
**1:36:55-1:37:01:**  It's a small percentage but the balance with combination of the impact of lower alcohol  
**1:37:01-1:37:08:**  and higher acidity is very important and the freshness of the wine is much better.  
**1:37:08-1:37:14:**  And the style change a lot and so the wines are more delicate, they are expressing more  
**1:37:14-1:37:22:**  fruit and they are more resilient facing the global warming and I think that it's quite  
**1:37:22-1:37:29:**  surprising because I was not expecting an impact like that so fast.  
**1:37:29-1:37:35:**  But the clients are talking about that, they feel it, and they are not dreamers, they are  
**1:37:35-1:37:41:**  professional buyers that are talking business with me every year.  
**1:37:41-1:37:56:**  So I am in the competition when I sell them the wine so I cannot give them stories, they  
**1:37:56-1:38:03:**  need something quite solid and when they make that comment it's solid, yes.  
**1:38:03-1:38:05:**  That's amazing, that's fantastic.  
**1:38:05-1:38:11:**  Jean-Baptiste, thank you so much for taking the time today to share your amazing experience  
**1:38:11-1:38:16:**  at Chateau Antonique and I am going to put all the links below of where people can find  
**1:38:16-1:38:21:**  out about your website, if they want to look into your wine, if they want to hopefully  
**1:38:21-1:38:25:**  buy some agroforestry wine bottles which I don't think there are many going around at  
**1:38:25-1:38:26:**  the moment.  
**1:38:26-1:38:32:**  And, yeah, so thank you so much for taking the time to talk and sharing so openly and  
**1:38:32-1:38:33:**  freely.  
**1:38:33-1:38:42:**  So thank you so much for the time you gave to me and so as you know I am passionate about  
**1:38:42-1:39:03:**  this agroforestry project and I hope that we will meet again.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 13:59:47)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:48:**  Hi and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:50:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:50-0:00:54:**  I greatly enjoyed talking with Lindsay because so far we've often focused on the farmer's  
**0:00:54-0:00:59:**  perspective on silvopasture, how to establish trees and how to manage them for example.  
**0:00:59-0:01:03:**  This time we take a different angle and look at trees from the animal's perspective.  
**0:01:03-0:01:08:**  Through the interview we get a systematic and fact-driven account of the multiple ways  
**0:01:08-0:01:12:**  in which livestock benefit from trees and their environment.  
**0:01:12-0:01:17:**  Well I was expecting some of the benefits such as shelter or fodder but I was amazed  
**0:01:17-0:01:20:**  at hearing some of the facts Lindsay shares with us and the extent to which trees can  
**0:01:20-0:01:26:**  have a positive impact including on the social interactions within the herd.  
**0:01:26-0:01:27:**  Enjoy the interview.  
**0:01:27-0:01:30:**  Welcome Lindsay to the podcast.  
**0:01:30-0:01:31:**  Thank you.  
**0:01:31-0:01:37:**  Thanks so much for joining us today and as an introduction could you tell us who you  
**0:01:37-0:01:40:**  are and how you got into agroforestry?  
**0:01:40-0:01:44:**  Yes, well my name is Lindsay Wistentz.  
**0:01:44-0:01:51:**  I'm a senior researcher at the Organic Research Centre and I got into agroforestry really  
**0:01:51-0:01:55:**  because of the benefits that trees bring to livestock.  
**0:01:55-0:02:01:**  Of course trees are very important in their own right and on a private and global citizen  
**0:02:01-0:02:09:**  level if you like, trees play a really fundamental role in global health but in professional  
**0:02:09-0:02:18:**  terms really my focus is how trees can bring real benefits to the livestock's landscape.  
**0:02:18-0:02:24:**  And how about your career and did you always work researching on agroforestry or what's  
**0:02:24-0:02:25:**  your background?  
**0:02:25-0:02:33:**  No, well originally I actually left school without any higher education.  
**0:02:33-0:02:37:**  All I wanted to do was really was milk cows.  
**0:02:37-0:02:44:**  I wanted to be a farmer initially and I spent a few years working mostly with dairy cattle  
**0:02:44-0:02:51:**  but also some sheep work and some pig work and became actually increasingly frustrated  
**0:02:51-0:03:01:**  with the focus on production because my real interest then and now is the welfare of the  
**0:03:01-0:03:02:**  animals that we farm.  
**0:03:02-0:03:09:**  I'm very happy, I'm okay that we farm them but I really believe that we should give them  
**0:03:09-0:03:13:**  a life worth living.  
**0:03:13-0:03:20:**  And so I went back really to education as a mature student and worked through doing  
**0:03:20-0:03:29:**  my higher education degree, PhD with the aim to understand livestock better.  
**0:03:29-0:03:34:**  Really, my main focus is behaviour and welfare of livestock.  
**0:03:34-0:03:41:**  So I worked for a few years around different research centres around Europe and I've now  
**0:03:41-0:03:48:**  been working at the Organic Research Centre for five years and this is really where my  
**0:03:48-0:03:55:**  interest and ability to research agroforestry or silvopasture in particular has really kicked  
**0:03:55-0:04:04:**  off because ORC had an established agroforestry programme already going and I could just slot  
**0:04:04-0:04:08:**  into it with the livestock interests.  
**0:04:08-0:04:13:**  I actually find it extremely fulfilling.  
**0:04:13-0:04:23:**  I believe, I know that livestock have a relationship with the natural world independent of humans  
**0:04:23-0:04:27:**  and I think if we are to give them a life worth living then we should be giving them  
**0:04:27-0:04:34:**  diverse landscapes in which they can choose what they want and when they want it.  
**0:04:34-0:04:42:**  And trees really more than any other plants, of course other plants are important but really  
**0:04:42-0:04:51:**  it's the trees that bring a huge variety of benefits to the livestock in the form of food,  
**0:04:51-0:05:00:**  medicine, shade, shelter, even social benefits including improving the relationship between  
**0:05:00-0:05:03:**  humans and animals.  
**0:05:03-0:05:11:**  So this is why I'm really fascinated and interested to research this aspect of livestock welfare.  
**0:05:11-0:05:16:**  And that was a great overview of a lot of the themes I want to discuss with you today  
**0:05:16-0:05:20:**  but before we delve into them, maybe you can tell us a bit more about your work with the  
**0:05:20-0:05:25:**  ORC, how does it function and what kind of organisation it is?  
**0:05:25-0:05:30:**  Yes, well the Organic Research Centre is a charity.  
**0:05:30-0:05:36:**  We work predominantly with organic systems but not exclusively.  
**0:05:36-0:05:45:**  So as a group we try to and want to work with any farmer or stakeholder within the food  
**0:05:45-0:05:48:**  production industry that is interested in.  
**0:05:48-0:05:56:**  We work across systems, so we have crop, we have livestock, we have agroforestry, we look  
**0:05:56-0:06:07:**  at economic and social changes and sometimes we work with a combination of these things  
**0:06:07-0:06:12:**  because of course when you have regenerative and sustainable systems it often means that  
**0:06:12-0:06:14:**  they're mixed systems.  
**0:06:14-0:06:20:**  So understanding each of these aspects in different contexts can be important.  
**0:06:20-0:06:29:**  So an example might be an arable farmer who wants to bring in grass lays into his system  
**0:06:29-0:06:36:**  and then brings in sheep to graze that system and understanding how these work together.  
**0:06:36-0:06:45:**  From my point of view, of course animals, the researchers can be incredibly diverse,  
**0:06:45-0:06:51:**  so I've just finished a project, a four-year project looking at how we can feed pigs and  
**0:06:51-0:06:57:**  poultry with 100% organic and regional feed across Europe.  
**0:06:57-0:07:02:**  We found certainly some solutions but that's a very difficult and much bigger topic than  
**0:07:02-0:07:07:**  one project but we certainly made some headway with that.  
**0:07:07-0:07:14:**  Another project that I worked on, also a four-year European project, was looking at the sustainability  
**0:07:14-0:07:23:**  of sheep and goat industries across Europe and how different aspects of farming sheep  
**0:07:23-0:07:29:**  and goats can be made more resilient and more sustainable in a changing climate and in a  
**0:07:29-0:07:33:**  changing economic world.  
**0:07:33-0:07:38:**  So these can be really quite different and a further project that ORC is engaged with  
**0:07:38-0:07:51:**  is extensive dairy systems, so finding ways that cows can produce milk from grass.  
**0:07:51-0:07:57:**  And yet another interest that we've been looking at is how to keep dairy calves with their  
**0:07:57-0:08:02:**  mothers in dairy systems.  
**0:08:02-0:08:04:**  So it can be really quite diverse.  
**0:08:04-0:08:12:**  Yeah, well, it's interesting because a lot of these research projects seems to go beyond  
**0:08:12-0:08:18:**  agroforestry, so then agroforestry is only one of the toolkit that you have to tackle  
**0:08:18-0:08:20:**  this more sustainable approach to food.  
**0:08:20-0:08:28:**  I know it'll be interesting to see exactly where you see the role of trees and what were  
**0:08:28-0:08:34:**  the opportunities for trees and all the different solutions you brought forward in your research.  
**0:08:34-0:08:36:**  Yeah, sure.  
**0:08:36-0:08:41:**  I think this is one of the exciting things.  
**0:08:41-0:08:50:**  As I say, the animal for me is central in what I do but trees play an important role  
**0:08:50-0:08:57:**  in offering good welfare, high welfare systems, and that's for all livestock.  
**0:08:57-0:09:07:**  We know that free range poultry will use the landscape more when they have cover.  
**0:09:07-0:09:13:**  So we're not just talking about cows and sheep here, we're talking about all livestock and  
**0:09:13-0:09:14:**  also pigs.  
**0:09:14-0:09:21:**  In fact, many of our livestock originally are woodland or peripheral woodland creatures.  
**0:09:21-0:09:29:**  If you like, they've inherited this relationship with trees and it really behoves us to offer  
**0:09:29-0:09:37:**  them that relationship again so that they can interact as they naturally would.  
**0:09:37-0:09:38:**  Sure.  
**0:09:38-0:09:46:**  Maybe that's the first thing I wanted us to do together is really for once take the perspective  
**0:09:46-0:09:48:**  of the livestock.  
**0:09:48-0:09:53:**  Here on the show, we've talked about silver pasture a few times and we often do so from  
**0:09:53-0:10:00:**  a practical farming approach, taking the angle of the farmer and how to manage and all these  
**0:10:00-0:10:04:**  practical and economical aspects.  
**0:10:04-0:10:09:**  But I think for once it's really interesting to really try and see things from the livestock's  
**0:10:09-0:10:16:**  perspective and understand how trees might affect their behavior.  
**0:10:16-0:10:22:**  Maybe starting with some of the obvious things which is protecting them from extreme weather  
**0:10:22-0:10:27:**  events or from heat, maybe we can have a bit of an overview then of these different ways  
**0:10:27-0:10:29:**  in which they benefit from trees.  
**0:10:29-0:10:31:**  Yeah, sure.  
**0:10:31-0:10:37:**  Yes, I mean the animals as I say are central to me so the way I look at trees is from their  
**0:10:37-0:10:40:**  point of view first and foremost.  
**0:10:40-0:10:47:**  And if we think about how the trees buffer the landscape, then we get an idea of how  
**0:10:47-0:10:50:**  the trees also buffer the livestock.  
**0:10:50-0:11:01:**  So, for example, we're becoming much more at risk of hot summers and I don't know what  
**0:11:01-0:11:07:**  it was like for you in the summer of 2018 but here in the UK we had a very hot and very  
**0:11:07-0:11:13:**  dry summer and once the farmers had cut the grass for silage or hay that first time there  
**0:11:13-0:11:15:**  was no regrowth.  
**0:11:15-0:11:23:**  The fields were brown and really you could see very quickly, very clearly how the trees,  
**0:11:23-0:11:26:**  the canopy enabled the grass to remain green.  
**0:11:26-0:11:34:**  So you've got a protection from the solar radiation but also protection from or maintenance  
**0:11:34-0:11:43:**  if you like of the water, so the evapotranspiration rates holding that moisture lower to the ground.  
**0:11:43-0:11:48:**  And then we've got the benefit that trees bring, for example, in wet climates, so the  
**0:11:48-0:11:54:**  root system holding and managing the water and taking it away from the surface.  
**0:11:54-0:12:00:**  And there's an example of an agroforestry system in Ireland where the ground is wet,  
**0:12:00-0:12:06:**  an established agroforestry system ended up extending the grazing system by an average  
**0:12:06-0:12:11:**  of 15 weeks every year, most of that in the autumn.  
**0:12:11-0:12:19:**  That's a really substantial increase in enabling the animals to stay outdoors and to graze  
**0:12:19-0:12:23:**  for much longer every year.  
**0:12:23-0:12:28:**  And then if we think about the winter time, we know that even when trees have lost their  
**0:12:28-0:12:36:**  leaves the ground temperature under a tree canopy can be up to six degrees warmer.  
**0:12:36-0:12:44:**  So this is not only providing animals with an easier place to find food for grazing,  
**0:12:44-0:12:49:**  but it's also offering them a warmer place to lie down when they're out wintered.  
**0:12:49-0:12:54:**  Six degrees is a substantial increase in temperature when you're looking for a comfortable place  
**0:12:54-0:12:55:**  to lie down.  
**0:12:55-0:13:03:**  How can we explain such a big difference in temperature even when they've lost the leaves?  
**0:13:03-0:13:05:**  I don't know.  
**0:13:05-0:13:07:**  I can't tell you.  
**0:13:07-0:13:08:**  It's been measured.  
**0:13:08-0:13:15:**  I mean, I would of course say that there must be, this is up to six degrees I should say,  
**0:13:15-0:13:22:**  because if it's a single tree in a very exposed situation, you've got high winds, then you're  
**0:13:22-0:13:26:**  not going to be finding those increases in temperature.  
**0:13:26-0:13:31:**  So animals are fairly resilient of course, and if they're acclimatised they can tolerate  
**0:13:31-0:13:34:**  better cold weather.  
**0:13:34-0:13:38:**  If they have a good winter coat, if they have good body condition, if all of these things  
**0:13:38-0:13:43:**  are met, then animals can be relatively tolerant.  
**0:13:43-0:13:49:**  But it's still important for us to understand what these environments are doing for them  
**0:13:49-0:13:52:**  in welfare terms.  
**0:13:52-0:14:00:**  So if we, for example, take a beef animal that is healthy and has a good winter coat,  
**0:14:00-0:14:08:**  then it will have a lower critical temperature of around zero degrees centigrade.  
**0:14:08-0:14:14:**  So below that point, for every one degree below that animal's lower critical temperature,  
**0:14:14-0:14:26:**  it will need a two percent increase in feed to maintain its growth or its body maintenance.  
**0:14:26-0:14:33:**  If we then take a scenario where we've got an air temperature of plus two degrees and  
**0:14:33-0:14:40:**  we add in a 24 kilometre an hour wind, it's a cold day, the effective temperature becomes  
**0:14:40-0:14:42:**  minus seven.  
**0:14:42-0:14:51:**  So for this animal, it's already needing 14 percent extra feed.  
**0:14:51-0:14:55:**  Now this is for an animal that's dry.  
**0:14:55-0:15:02:**  If we then add rain into the mix, so it's a cold and windy day and it's raining, it's  
**0:15:02-0:15:09:**  lower critical temperature shoots up to 15 degrees centigrade.  
**0:15:09-0:15:16:**  So if we add seven and 15, that makes 23 degrees below its lower critical temperature, which  
**0:15:16-0:15:23:**  is now 46 percent extra food for that animal in those conditions.  
**0:15:23-0:15:29:**  Now, you know, we could say, okay, we can compensate that animal.  
**0:15:29-0:15:30:**  We've got plenty of grass.  
**0:15:30-0:15:33:**  We've made plenty of hay or plenty of silage this year.  
**0:15:33-0:15:36:**  So we can give them that extra feed.  
**0:15:36-0:15:42:**  But let's remind ourselves that the animal's first choice would be to look for shelter.  
**0:15:42-0:15:45:**  It's not to go and food, go and eat more.  
**0:15:45-0:15:47:**  They would naturally go and look for shelter.  
**0:15:47-0:15:49:**  And that's indeed what they do.  
**0:15:49-0:15:55:**  So we might be able to maintain production, but we've done nothing for animal welfare  
**0:15:55-0:15:58:**  in that scenario.  
**0:15:58-0:16:00:**  So that's on the cold side of things.  
**0:16:00-0:16:10:**  If we then think about the... what happens in hot weather when it's way too hot, and  
**0:16:10-0:16:17:**  I should actually say, as important as cold stress can be, actually heat stress is of  
**0:16:17-0:16:20:**  much more critical importance here.  
**0:16:20-0:16:26:**  And really shade from trees is probably the most important thing they can do across the  
**0:16:26-0:16:31:**  globe.  
**0:16:31-0:16:36:**  There are lots of things going on when an animal suffers from heat stress.  
**0:16:36-0:16:40:**  First of all, they naturally seek shade.  
**0:16:40-0:16:45:**  And if that shade is not available, then they start to suffer heat stress.  
**0:16:45-0:16:52:**  And then what happens is that they begin to shut down non-vital systems in order to move  
**0:16:52-0:17:00:**  blood out to the skin to increase cooling and help maintain core body temperature.  
**0:17:00-0:17:06:**  So then what happens when you move blood away from these non-vital systems, if we take the  
**0:17:06-0:17:13:**  reproductive system as an example, you have negative effects on fertility.  
**0:17:13-0:17:16:**  So your animals are not getting pregnant.  
**0:17:16-0:17:22:**  You have negative effects on embryo growth and development.  
**0:17:22-0:17:27:**  And these things translate into smaller babies being born.  
**0:17:27-0:17:34:**  And there's some research that's been done on dairy calves where the cow has suffered  
**0:17:34-0:17:37:**  from heat stress during late lactation.  
**0:17:37-0:17:44:**  And they have found that the cow has poorer quality colostrum.  
**0:17:44-0:17:50:**  So there's lower immunoglobulin G levels in the colostrum.  
**0:17:50-0:17:53:**  The calf is smaller.  
**0:17:53-0:18:00:**  And if it's a heifer, they've recorded that her milk levels are affected for her first  
**0:18:00-0:18:02:**  two lactations.  
**0:18:02-0:18:08:**  So this is really just for a small amount of time when the mother has been heat stressed  
**0:18:08-0:18:09:**  in late gestation.  
**0:18:09-0:18:14:**  These are really big effects.  
**0:18:14-0:18:19:**  The other non-vital system is the digestive system.  
**0:18:19-0:18:27:**  And up to 50% of the blood can be redirected from the digestive system and out to the skin.  
**0:18:27-0:18:39:**  What happens here is that the removal of that blood stops the membrane being impermeable.  
**0:18:39-0:18:47:**  So the gut membrane becomes permeable and that allows things in the gut to pass through  
**0:18:47-0:18:49:**  into the bloodstream.  
**0:18:49-0:18:57:**  And we're talking mycotoxins and endotoxins, things that should not be in the blood.  
**0:18:57-0:19:02:**  Then what happens is that you get an inflammation cascade.  
**0:19:02-0:19:10:**  So unsurprisingly, research has measured that dairy cows are more likely to have mastitis  
**0:19:10-0:19:17:**  problems when they don't have access to shade.  
**0:19:17-0:19:20:**  And these are incredibly significant.  
**0:19:20-0:19:26:**  In America, they've worked out in terms of dollars how much heat stress costs their industry  
**0:19:26-0:19:28:**  on an annual basis.  
**0:19:28-0:19:34:**  For dairy cows, it's $900 million every year.  
**0:19:34-0:19:42:**  When you think of the cow is losing production, she's diseased and needs treating, she's not  
**0:19:42-0:19:46:**  in calf and therefore they lose the cow.  
**0:19:46-0:19:49:**  These are all big things happening.  
**0:19:49-0:19:54:**  And in the beef industry, they've calculated it to be $400 million every year.  
**0:19:54-0:20:04:**  These are really, really substantial production losses all based on poor welfare, all because  
**0:20:04-0:20:08:**  the animals don't have access to good shade.  
**0:20:08-0:20:09:**  Wow.  
**0:20:09-0:20:13:**  This is really quality information.  
**0:20:13-0:20:19:**  Thank you so much because as a future cow farmer, I don't know how you say in English,  
**0:20:19-0:20:26:**  but already it's so useful to understand so much detail.  
**0:20:26-0:20:32:**  But just to clarify, when we're talking about heat stress, from what temperature onwards  
**0:20:32-0:20:36:**  are we talking about severe effects?  
**0:20:36-0:20:42:**  Well, again, this is a bit of a moveable feast.  
**0:20:42-0:20:47:**  It depends really what...  
**0:20:47-0:20:51:**  It's different for each species.  
**0:20:51-0:20:55:**  It can be different within species.  
**0:20:55-0:21:05:**  So coat colour, yield status, body shape, size, these can all have an effect.  
**0:21:05-0:21:06:**  Food can have an effect.  
**0:21:06-0:21:14:**  So if they're being fed on high energy feeds, that also creates more heat.  
**0:21:14-0:21:19:**  For dairy cows at least, there's evidence that they are beginning to suffer from heat  
**0:21:19-0:21:24:**  stress at 18 degrees centigrade.  
**0:21:24-0:21:31:**  But I should also qualify this really and say that with mild heat stress, animals can  
**0:21:31-0:21:37:**  recover and they typically recover during cooler periods of the day.  
**0:21:37-0:21:46:**  So for example, at nighttime, but models forecasting climate change suggest that we will be losing  
**0:21:46-0:21:48:**  that benefit over time.  
**0:21:48-0:21:58:**  So as the earth warms up, it's unlikely to lose that type of heat during the nighttime.  
**0:21:58-0:22:05:**  So the cows and other livestock will then not be able to benefit from that.  
**0:22:05-0:22:13:**  And I think sheep also, the changes with sheep can be much more dramatic if you like, where  
**0:22:13-0:22:21:**  they have a full fleece and can withstand the colder weather, for example, assuming  
**0:22:21-0:22:25:**  that they're clean and that they're healthy.  
**0:22:25-0:22:32:**  Then when we shear them, their lower critical temperature shoots up, in fact, 28 degrees  
**0:22:32-0:22:33:**  centigrade.  
**0:22:33-0:22:35:**  It's really very high.  
**0:22:35-0:22:40:**  Now, luckily for them, the fleece starts to grow back very quickly.  
**0:22:40-0:22:44:**  So that vulnerable period for them is quite short.  
**0:22:44-0:22:51:**  But in the UK, we start shearing our sheep in May, where the average temperature is only  
**0:22:51-0:22:53:**  around 16 degrees.  
**0:22:53-0:23:00:**  So they are 12 degrees below their lower critical temperature for several days.  
**0:23:00-0:23:04:**  And we are increasingly experiencing bad weather in May.  
**0:23:04-0:23:09:**  So we'll have storms and cold winds.  
**0:23:09-0:23:13:**  So this is certainly something to think about for them.  
**0:23:13-0:23:21:**  Actually, I genuinely think that of course food is important, but if we offer the livestock  
**0:23:21-0:23:29:**  places where they can shelter themselves in a meaningful way, so there are enough trees,  
**0:23:29-0:23:37:**  there is enough hedgerow or shelter belt available for them to go and utilise it, then we're  
**0:23:37-0:23:39:**  doing the best we can for them.  
**0:23:39-0:23:40:**  Yeah.  
**0:23:40-0:23:46:**  Well, I think hopefully we'll come back to this idea of how many is enough and get a  
**0:23:46-0:23:48:**  bit more idea of that.  
**0:23:48-0:23:54:**  But just continuing our overview, I think it's pretty clear how beneficial trees are  
**0:23:54-0:23:57:**  in terms of buffering these extremes.  
**0:23:57-0:23:59:**  How about in terms of nutrition?  
**0:23:59-0:24:05:**  I mean, tree fodder is a big topic when it comes to ruminants.  
**0:24:05-0:24:09:**  And I'm wondering what you can tell us about that.  
**0:24:09-0:24:10:**  Yes.  
**0:24:10-0:24:19:**  Well, it's worth remembering that, as I said earlier, animals have this natural relationship  
**0:24:19-0:24:25:**  with trees and not just in terms of accessing them for shade and shelter.  
**0:24:25-0:24:33:**  Actually, trees as browse is part of all of our livestock's natural diet.  
**0:24:33-0:24:42:**  If we think for cattle, over a whole year, the percent of browse is around 12% across  
**0:24:42-0:24:44:**  that year.  
**0:24:44-0:24:47:**  For sheep, it's around 20%.  
**0:24:47-0:24:51:**  And for goats, it's around 60%.  
**0:24:51-0:24:55:**  So when they have access to browse, they will naturally do so.  
**0:24:55-0:25:00:**  And of course, this percentage can increase at certain times.  
**0:25:00-0:25:06:**  So if we have drought or dry periods, or for example, early spring growth that's highly  
**0:25:06-0:25:11:**  palatable, then that intake can increase quite dramatically.  
**0:25:11-0:25:22:**  So cattle can quite easily browse up to 55.5% of their diet without any negative effects.  
**0:25:22-0:25:32:**  Although they are very well adapted to getting energy from grass, actually feeding on browse  
**0:25:32-0:25:34:**  is not a problem for them.  
**0:25:34-0:25:39:**  They can digest it very well.  
**0:25:39-0:25:48:**  In terms of nutritional content, there've been a few bits of research across the world.  
**0:25:48-0:25:56:**  And generally the findings are that across the board, nutritional content can be compared  
**0:25:56-0:25:59:**  to grasses in the same environment.  
**0:25:59-0:26:04:**  So generally speaking, they are comparable to grasses.  
**0:26:04-0:26:06:**  Of course, they don't grow at the same rate.  
**0:26:06-0:26:12:**  So we have to manage intake and we have to manage browse much more carefully from the  
**0:26:12-0:26:13:**  trees.  
**0:26:13-0:26:21:**  What you certainly don't want to be doing is allowing more than 50% defoliation because  
**0:26:21-0:26:31:**  then you'll be stressing the tree and perhaps affecting its regrowth.  
**0:26:31-0:26:38:**  There are certainly some trees that are better, very good in nutritional terms.  
**0:26:38-0:26:46:**  And some research was done in the Netherlands in 2016 looking at protein content in different  
**0:26:46-0:26:52:**  leaf species and comparing that to alfalfa and dry grass.  
**0:26:52-0:27:00:**  They found that, for example, ash and lime compare very well, but the absolute outstanding  
**0:27:00-0:27:02:**  tree was mulberry.  
**0:27:02-0:27:08:**  So if any farmers live in a region where mulberry grows very well, then they have a very, very  
**0:27:08-0:27:12:**  good crop indeed in terms of protein.  
**0:27:12-0:27:22:**  And one of the other things I wanted to mention about protein content is that largely grass-based  
**0:27:22-0:27:30:**  foods, certainly grasses, don't have any tannins.  
**0:27:30-0:27:38:**  And we know that aside from the health benefits, condensed tannins hold onto the protein, it  
**0:27:38-0:27:48:**  passes through the rumen and then it gets degraded in the abomasum, effectively delivering  
**0:27:48-0:27:53:**  high quality rumen bypass protein to the small intestine.  
**0:27:53-0:27:56:**  So this is something that's really attractive.  
**0:27:56-0:28:01:**  And on top of that, we also know that the condensed tannins also help to manage methane  
**0:28:01-0:28:04:**  levels.  
**0:28:04-0:28:10:**  So if we compare the amount of methane that's produced off willow with that produced from  
**0:28:10-0:28:18:**  lucerne, well, the willow produces less than half than the lucerne does.  
**0:28:18-0:28:24:**  So really having some tannins in the diet can be very beneficial.  
**0:28:24-0:28:32:**  And I should say generally the recommended is around 4% of dry matter intake and certainly  
**0:28:32-0:28:37:**  not more than 5% of dry matter intake on a daily basis.  
**0:28:37-0:28:45:**  Because of course we have to remind ourselves that tannins are the plant's defense against  
**0:28:45-0:28:47:**  predation.  
**0:28:47-0:28:52:**  It's supposed to be an anti-nutritional factor.  
**0:28:52-0:28:56:**  But yes, in small quantities, it can have these benefits.  
**0:28:56-0:29:04:**  And I think the final thing that's really notable about trees in terms of nutrition  
**0:29:04-0:29:06:**  is the trace elements.  
**0:29:06-0:29:11:**  So the mineral content that they can provide.  
**0:29:11-0:29:22:**  And we did some work at ORC around four, five years ago where we looked at the mineral content  
**0:29:22-0:29:25:**  of a few species of tree.  
**0:29:25-0:29:35:**  So that included older, goat willow, ash, and elm.  
**0:29:35-0:29:42:**  Now we're currently having problems with ash and elm, both trees, which is very unfortunate  
**0:29:42-0:29:50:**  because these are both very good traditional tree fodder trees, certainly in the UK.  
**0:29:50-0:29:56:**  And what we found was that they are very good sources across the board, very good sources  
**0:29:56-0:30:04:**  of minerals, but some trees are particularly good sources of certain minerals.  
**0:30:04-0:30:12:**  So for example, we find with the Osea willow, the Salix viminalis, we find that to be very  
**0:30:12-0:30:15:**  good in terms of zinc.  
**0:30:15-0:30:26:**  We find the goat willow to be good for calcium and phosphorus and in a quite useful two to  
**0:30:26-0:30:30:**  one ratio for these minerals.  
**0:30:30-0:30:37:**  And we also find that within this piece of research, we were really looking at nutritional  
**0:30:37-0:30:42:**  content when it was fed as tree hay.  
**0:30:42-0:30:52:**  So the leaves were harvested in June in the summer, and then they were fed in March the  
**0:30:52-0:30:56:**  following year and they were analysed at both points.  
**0:30:56-0:31:03:**  And what we found was that when they were fed, the mineral content was much higher across  
**0:31:03-0:31:05:**  all minerals.  
**0:31:05-0:31:10:**  So both macro and micro minerals, the content had increased.  
**0:31:10-0:31:20:**  And this makes us think that tree leaves actually might be a good and sustainable source for  
**0:31:20-0:31:28:**  mineral feeding if we can manage it or perhaps make it into some kind of production, meaningful  
**0:31:28-0:31:30:**  production.  
**0:31:30-0:31:37:**  So these are really the key points to take from tree fodder is that generally across  
**0:31:37-0:31:43:**  the board, they are at least comparable to grasses.  
**0:31:43-0:31:52:**  They offer a good protein supplement and they offer a good mineral supplement generally.  
**0:31:52-0:32:01:**  What we've also learned more recently is that if you're interested in the mineral content,  
**0:32:01-0:32:09:**  apart from a few trees, which seem to have high levels, for example, of zinc in the Osea  
**0:32:09-0:32:19:**  willow, that soil content can reflect content in the trees.  
**0:32:19-0:32:26:**  So I've been learning about this from bioremediation research, where some trees, as you may know,  
**0:32:26-0:32:31:**  are being used to help with pollution.  
**0:32:31-0:32:40:**  So they've done a lot of research on some trees and there are three strategies if you  
**0:32:40-0:32:41:**  like.  
**0:32:41-0:32:43:**  So you have accumulator trees.  
**0:32:43-0:32:49:**  So it doesn't matter how much of a mineral is present in the soil, it will accumulate  
**0:32:49-0:32:51:**  this above ground.  
**0:32:51-0:32:55:**  So you will always find this mineral to be high in that particular species.  
**0:32:55-0:33:01:**  So this, for example, is what's happening with zinc in the Osea willow.  
**0:33:01-0:33:03:**  Then you'll find indicator trees.  
**0:33:03-0:33:06:**  So they reflect what's in the soil.  
**0:33:06-0:33:11:**  So it's very hard for us to say across the board, oak has high selenium.  
**0:33:11-0:33:17:**  It does on the farm we measured it on in Berkshire, but it didn't in Wales.  
**0:33:17-0:33:19:**  So that's an indicator species.  
**0:33:19-0:33:22:**  And then you have excluder strategy as well.  
**0:33:22-0:33:30:**  So it will actively prevent a mineral from being represented above ground in the plant,  
**0:33:30-0:33:33:**  if you like.  
**0:33:33-0:33:42:**  And so we're learning all the time and really it's unavoidable to, you have to have some  
**0:33:42-0:33:48:**  intimate knowledge of your own landscape, if you like, to know what you're offering  
**0:33:48-0:33:53:**  your animals if this is of interest to you.  
**0:33:53-0:34:01:**  And I think the other important thing to say is it's, yes, it's useful and important to  
**0:34:01-0:34:07:**  know what nutritional content there is, but it's also important to know what the animals  
**0:34:07-0:34:09:**  like to eat.  
**0:34:09-0:34:19:**  So understanding palatability and understanding motivation to eat certain trees is key.  
**0:34:19-0:34:25:**  Now there's not been that much work done on this, but there was some research done in  
**0:34:25-0:34:38:**  Scotland which showed that in a free setting that aspen and willow were very high in palatability  
**0:34:38-0:34:42:**  as were ash and rowan.  
**0:34:42-0:34:49:**  So in the middle were hazel, oak, Scots pine, holly, birch and hawthorn, but right at the  
**0:34:49-0:34:53:**  bottom beech and alder.  
**0:34:53-0:35:06:**  So alder has very low palatability and I suppose we don't understand why.  
**0:35:06-0:35:09:**  Alder is a very interesting tree for other reasons.  
**0:35:09-0:35:11:**  It works well on wet ground.  
**0:35:11-0:35:14:**  It's a nitrogen fixer.  
**0:35:14-0:35:20:**  So it's of interest certainly in farming systems, but the older tree typically doesn't even  
**0:35:20-0:35:24:**  need to be protected against wild deer.  
**0:35:24-0:35:33:**  It really is a very unpalatable tree in general terms and yet its nutritional content is highly  
**0:35:33-0:35:38:**  comparable to other trees.  
**0:35:38-0:35:43:**  So we don't really know what's going on with this tree.  
**0:35:43-0:35:51:**  That said, we do also know that palatability levels can go up and down depending on the  
**0:35:51-0:35:57:**  health status of the animal.  
**0:35:57-0:36:07:**  So for example, there's been some research done on sheep that have a heavy worm burden  
**0:36:07-0:36:15:**  and if they are offered plants that have a high condensed tannin content, they will shift  
**0:36:15-0:36:22:**  their preference to the high condensed tannin plants and that research has shown that they  
**0:36:22-0:36:28:**  can reduce their worm burden by 50% doing this, but they don't continue to eat the high  
**0:36:28-0:36:32:**  condensed tannin plants because these are bitter.  
**0:36:32-0:36:40:**  So they're changing their food preferences in order to rebalance their health status  
**0:36:40-0:36:41:**  if you like.  
**0:36:41-0:36:43:**  This is actually something that I wanted to ask you about.  
**0:36:43-0:36:50:**  So we're on topic about this anti-parasitic effect of tannins.  
**0:36:50-0:36:56:**  So the research seems to show that it is effective in controlling some types of parasites.  
**0:36:56-0:37:00:**  Yes, yes it is.  
**0:37:00-0:37:08:**  It's shown to be effective on ascaris in pigs.  
**0:37:08-0:37:18:**  The general worms, parasites for ruminants, it's basically effective for most.  
**0:37:18-0:37:25:**  Less so for haemonchus, things like that, but actually copper can work very well on  
**0:37:25-0:37:26:**  haemonchus.  
**0:37:26-0:37:34:**  But yes, in terms of generic gastrointestinal parasites, condensed tannins have a beneficial  
**0:37:34-0:37:37:**  effect.  
**0:37:37-0:37:48:**  And they do this by inhibiting the larvae from maturing.  
**0:37:48-0:37:56:**  So they prevent the maturing of the larvae and for those that do become mature, they  
**0:37:56-0:38:05:**  tend to be smaller in size than if you like healthy larvae becoming adults.  
**0:38:05-0:38:15:**  And size really matters in larvae because size really predicts how many eggs they lay.  
**0:38:15-0:38:18:**  So in effect you've got a double whammy here.  
**0:38:18-0:38:25:**  You've got larvae being prevented from becoming adults, so the cycle is broken.  
**0:38:25-0:38:30:**  And then you've got smaller adults producing fewer eggs for the next generation.  
**0:38:30-0:38:33:**  So it actually really works very well.  
**0:38:33-0:38:43:**  And because it's a mechanical effect, there's absolutely no evidence that the worms, the  
**0:38:43-0:38:48:**  parasites have any defense against the tannins.  
**0:38:48-0:38:56:**  So it's actually a pretty effective long-term strategy, if you like, to utilize condensed  
**0:38:56-0:38:58:**  tannins in this way.  
**0:38:58-0:39:04:**  And of course then animals are naturally seeking them out when they have this option.  
**0:39:04-0:39:11:**  And the benefit of that is that the animals can seek it out when they need it, not when  
**0:39:11-0:39:15:**  we have woken up to the fact that they need it.  
**0:39:15-0:39:20:**  So they're doing it in their own time, in real time, if you like.  
**0:39:20-0:39:26:**  And it also then means that we're not having to give them chemicals.  
**0:39:26-0:39:33:**  We're not having to use chemical remediation when these natural remedies are available  
**0:39:33-0:39:34:**  to them.  
**0:39:34-0:39:41:**  Yeah, it's really interesting to see all those benefits from the nutritional aspect and the  
**0:39:41-0:39:42:**  tannin aspect.  
**0:39:42-0:39:47:**  But the other kind of obvious one is also that in these times where everything is drying  
**0:39:47-0:39:54:**  up so early in the season, just having access to green leaves in August, for example, is  
**0:39:54-0:39:55:**  a huge benefit.  
**0:39:55-0:39:57:**  Yes, it can be.  
**0:39:57-0:40:02:**  And it can be of benefit in several ways, really.  
**0:40:02-0:40:09:**  When you have a dry season, for example, some countries, certainly Mediterranean countries  
**0:40:09-0:40:17:**  and some areas in New Zealand and Australia all having dry seasons, then yes, the only  
**0:40:17-0:40:21:**  green that is available is tree fodder.  
**0:40:21-0:40:28:**  And in fact, in some places in New Zealand, they've adopted tree fodder really as a crisis  
**0:40:28-0:40:36:**  management, if you like, where they planted lots of willow and poplar as a landscape management.  
**0:40:36-0:40:43:**  So they were planting the trees to help keep soil in place.  
**0:40:43-0:40:50:**  And then they were finding that these trees were also exceptionally good as fodder in  
**0:40:50-0:40:51:**  the dry season.  
**0:40:51-0:40:56:**  So they will cut them fresh and just let them drop.  
**0:40:56-0:41:01:**  What they find is that they can maintain animal condition.  
**0:41:01-0:41:08:**  So the animals in these scenarios, they might not be growing, but they can at least maintain  
**0:41:08-0:41:13:**  condition where animals are losing condition on drought pasture in the same scenario.  
**0:41:13-0:41:19:**  Now, of course, let's remind ourselves that they are only offering two species of tree,  
**0:41:19-0:41:21:**  which is willow and poplar.  
**0:41:21-0:41:32:**  So that's not necessarily a, let's say a fulfilled diet, but it's certainly helping them in those  
**0:41:32-0:41:35:**  drought conditions.  
**0:41:35-0:41:42:**  And there's also been some research done on lambs.  
**0:41:42-0:41:47:**  So lambs born in these Mediterranean style conditions where they've got very little green  
**0:41:47-0:41:49:**  grass.  
**0:41:49-0:41:54:**  They're also very susceptible to white muscle disease because the vitamin E is in very poor  
**0:41:54-0:41:55:**  supply.  
**0:41:55-0:42:01:**  So when they're coming off milk, when they're being weaned, they are increasingly susceptible  
**0:42:01-0:42:05:**  to white muscle disease.  
**0:42:05-0:42:13:**  But there are lots of shrubs in this environment with green and therefore high vitamin E. And  
**0:42:13-0:42:21:**  some researchers did some trials with lambs where they actually made some of the lambs  
**0:42:21-0:42:28:**  deliberately deficient in vitamin E. And they offered them two feeds, one which was low  
**0:42:28-0:42:35:**  in vitamin E and one which was unpalatable, but high in vitamin E. And they found that  
**0:42:35-0:42:43:**  the lambs that were deficient switched their preference to the feed that was unpalatable,  
**0:42:43-0:42:49:**  but high in vitamin E. And they found that the lambs were doing this before they could  
**0:42:49-0:42:54:**  record any differences in health status.  
**0:42:54-0:42:58:**  They knew they'd made them deficient, but nothing was measurable at that point when  
**0:42:58-0:43:01:**  the lambs switched their feeding preferences.  
**0:43:01-0:43:06:**  And once they'd regained balance in the vitamin E, then they switched back to the more palatable  
**0:43:06-0:43:09:**  feed.  
**0:43:09-0:43:16:**  So I suppose it indicates an awareness of nutritional status.  
**0:43:16-0:43:23:**  And it also indicates that if animals have access to a variety of feedstuffs, then they  
**0:43:23-0:43:31:**  can learn and look for those feedstuffs that have the nutritional content that they need  
**0:43:31-0:43:33:**  when they need it.  
**0:43:33-0:43:41:**  I do want to make the point that although we've certainly seen evidence of animals selecting  
**0:43:41-0:43:47:**  the food and the nutrition that they need at given times, I think it's still important  
**0:43:47-0:43:51:**  to underline that it can go wrong.  
**0:43:51-0:43:57:**  Animals can select foods that are poisonous.  
**0:43:57-0:44:02:**  They might have nutritional status, but they're eating too much, for example.  
**0:44:02-0:44:08:**  So I don't want to give the impression that all animals are all knowing because just like  
**0:44:08-0:44:11:**  humans, they can get it wrong.  
**0:44:11-0:44:12:**  Of course they can.  
**0:44:12-0:44:20:**  And if the landscape is imbalanced in terms of diversity, they may be selecting plants  
**0:44:20-0:44:27:**  that are not healthy in the quantities that they may be choosing to eat them.  
**0:44:27-0:44:33:**  I really want to make that point because there are plenty of farmers who have experienced  
**0:44:33-0:44:41:**  livestock being poisoned by eating the wrong thing in the wrong amounts.  
**0:44:41-0:44:52:**  We have quite a debate here in the UK about ivy, where it has a tradition as a feedstuff.  
**0:44:52-0:44:59:**  And here, certainly anecdotally, farmers will say that if you have a sick sheep, if it doesn't  
**0:44:59-0:45:03:**  eat a little bit of ivy, then it doesn't want to live.  
**0:45:03-0:45:05:**  So it has that reputation.  
**0:45:05-0:45:10:**  But then we also have other farmers that have had animals die because they've eaten ivy.  
**0:45:10-0:45:16:**  So we need to know much more about that as a plant and its nutritional content and what  
**0:45:16-0:45:20:**  else it's containing.  
**0:45:20-0:45:28:**  So that's really just a caveat that animals, they know a lot if they have the ability to  
**0:45:28-0:45:32:**  learn, but they don't know everything like humans.  
**0:45:32-0:45:34:**  Thanks for this precision.  
**0:45:34-0:45:37:**  It's good to always nuance these things.  
**0:45:37-0:45:42:**  And it's nice to think that animals are this perfect nutritional intelligence, but I think  
**0:45:42-0:45:45:**  it's a useful reminder that you gave us.  
**0:45:45-0:45:50:**  Another fascinating point that you mentioned a bit earlier on in the introduction was how  
**0:45:50-0:45:56:**  trees can actually influence the social behavior of animals.  
**0:45:56-0:45:58:**  Could you tell us a bit more about that?  
**0:45:58-0:46:00:**  Yes.  
**0:46:00-0:46:06:**  I was really interested when I first learned about this because it didn't seem immediately  
**0:46:06-0:46:11:**  obvious that it would have this benefit.  
**0:46:11-0:46:20:**  But some research has in fact shown that animals that are kept in an agroforestry, in a silvipasture  
**0:46:20-0:46:27:**  setting, have better social relationships within the herd.  
**0:46:27-0:46:33:**  And some work that was done with cattle, for example, has shown that if they're out on  
**0:46:33-0:46:43:**  open pasture, then the positive social licking part of their social interactions is around  
**0:46:43-0:46:49:**  42% of all of their behavior towards each other.  
**0:46:49-0:46:57:**  But within a silvipasture setting, this shoots up to nearly 80%.  
**0:46:57-0:46:59:**  And this is a really positive behavior.  
**0:46:59-0:47:02:**  It helps with social cohesion.  
**0:47:02-0:47:12:**  It helps maintain hierarchy and dominance levels without the animals resorting to aggression.  
**0:47:12-0:47:20:**  What research has also shown is that this better relationship transfers to humans as  
**0:47:20-0:47:21:**  well.  
**0:47:21-0:47:28:**  So the relationship between humans and livestock is also improved in this scenario.  
**0:47:28-0:47:34:**  And it's not really clear why this should be, but they think that at least having something  
**0:47:34-0:47:45:**  physical for the animals to hide behind enables them to show less fear or feel less fear towards  
**0:47:45-0:47:47:**  their human handlers.  
**0:47:47-0:47:54:**  And this then helps the human animal relationship when they are being handled.  
**0:47:54-0:48:03:**  And I was listening to an Irish farmer saying, in fact, just this thing, when he started  
**0:48:03-0:48:08:**  silvipasture with his cattle, he now has an established silvipasture system.  
**0:48:08-0:48:13:**  And he used to be able to walk among his beef cattle.  
**0:48:13-0:48:18:**  They certainly weren't scared of him, but he would have to be very careful walking up  
**0:48:18-0:48:22:**  to them and may not be able to touch them.  
**0:48:22-0:48:28:**  Now he can walk right up to them and just scratch them in a silvipasture setting.  
**0:48:28-0:48:36:**  He said it's absolutely the trees that have improved his relationship with the animals.  
**0:48:36-0:48:46:**  And we do know with social licking, and to return to that point, it has a very beneficial  
**0:48:46-0:48:52:**  effect, not just in terms of dominance hierarchy, but there's research evidence that shows  
**0:48:52-0:48:58:**  that the heart rate of the animal that is being licked goes down.  
**0:48:58-0:49:05:**  So it's a real pacifying effect it has on the animals.  
**0:49:05-0:49:12:**  And in fact, the other component, the other benefit that trees bring to livestock is their  
**0:49:12-0:49:18:**  ability to scratch and rub, so body maintenance behavior.  
**0:49:18-0:49:26:**  And research has also shown that when an animal is rubbing, their heart rate goes down.  
**0:49:26-0:49:34:**  So socially and in stress terms, these are really beneficial effects of having trees  
**0:49:34-0:49:36:**  in the landscape.  
**0:49:36-0:49:42:**  Aside from, of course, from the physiological benefits of being able to rub.  
**0:49:42-0:49:49:**  So if we think of skin as a frontline defense against disease, then it's hardly surprising  
**0:49:49-0:49:54:**  that these animals are spending part of every single day managing the health of their skin  
**0:49:54-0:49:55:**  and their coat.  
**0:49:55-0:49:58:**  And of course they do this through rubbing.  
**0:49:58-0:50:07:**  So by being able to rub different body parts, they can get rid of dead hair, dead skin,  
**0:50:07-0:50:12:**  external parasites, seeds that can penetrate the skin.  
**0:50:12-0:50:14:**  All of these things can be knocked away.  
**0:50:14-0:50:20:**  And also by knocking the dust out of the coat, this can all help with temperature regulation.  
**0:50:20-0:50:26:**  So that then has further benefits on the general wellbeing of the animal.  
**0:50:26-0:50:32:**  And if we think about incorporating trees at different angles, then they can access  
**0:50:32-0:50:37:**  most body parts in this way.  
**0:50:37-0:50:43:**  So overall, trees contribute to making a more interesting environment for livestock in every  
**0:50:43-0:50:44:**  way.  
**0:50:44-0:50:51:**  Having more diverse sources of food, having different textures and different temperatures  
**0:50:51-0:50:53:**  and microclimates to explore.  
**0:50:53-0:51:00:**  A lot like us, the feeling of walking in an interesting kind of semi-woodland with a bit  
**0:51:00-0:51:01:**  of light.  
**0:51:01-0:51:04:**  I mean, at least that's my experience.  
**0:51:04-0:51:09:**  Sometimes more enjoyable and more interesting than walking in an empty open space.  
**0:51:09-0:51:14:**  But it's so interesting that you're able to actually demonstrate this to us and illustrate  
**0:51:14-0:51:18:**  it with so many different examples and so much scientific research.  
**0:51:18-0:51:19:**  Yeah.  
**0:51:19-0:51:23:**  Well, I mean, it's genuinely a fascinating subject.  
**0:51:23-0:51:30:**  And I think if we understand the animal, then we understand the environment that they can  
**0:51:30-0:51:33:**  and should be living in.  
**0:51:33-0:51:39:**  And there's also evidence, of course, that if you put animals in a silvopasture setting,  
**0:51:39-0:51:41:**  they use that environment more evenly.  
**0:51:41-0:51:45:**  Now, of course, we're talking sufficient access.  
**0:51:45-0:51:52:**  We're not talking about a single tree in a field where all of the animals are overcrowded  
**0:51:52-0:51:54:**  to try to gain access to shade, for example.  
**0:51:54-0:52:01:**  So in that scenario, you're risking animals staying in one area for too long, death of  
**0:52:01-0:52:10:**  vegetation, soil compaction, maybe weed growth during recovery of that land, and also risking  
**0:52:10-0:52:16:**  disease of livestock because they're standing too close together and maybe even perversely  
**0:52:16-0:52:22:**  overheating because they're not able to lose body heat when they're standing all very close  
**0:52:22-0:52:24:**  together.  
**0:52:24-0:52:31:**  What we find in a silvopasture setting is that they generally maintain behaviour patterns.  
**0:52:31-0:52:39:**  So they continue to feed and continue to produce what we're asking them to, but they also utilise  
**0:52:39-0:52:41:**  that landscape more evenly.  
**0:52:41-0:52:47:**  And the knock-on benefit of that is that they're depositing recycling nutrients more evenly  
**0:52:47-0:52:49:**  across that landscape.  
**0:52:49-0:52:58:**  So yeah, I mean, I would say largely if people are happy managing trees, then it's certainly  
**0:52:58-0:53:03:**  a win-win for the animals living within this environment.  
**0:53:03-0:53:08:**  And also bearing in mind, of course, that if we want the animals to browse, then we  
**0:53:08-0:53:10:**  have to think about their browse heights.  
**0:53:10-0:53:17:**  So it has to be growing at a meaningful height for them to access these feeds.  
**0:53:17-0:53:21:**  So for sheep, for example, it will be around 1.2 metres.  
**0:53:21-0:53:27:**  For cows, it's around 2 metres, maximum heights this is.  
**0:53:27-0:53:32:**  And if anyone has goats, well then there is no limit.  
**0:53:32-0:53:35:**  There's no meaningful height for goats because they're so agile.  
**0:53:35-0:53:41:**  They can pretty much climb trees if they want to.  
**0:53:41-0:53:49:**  And then if we don't want to, or if we on top of that want to offer tree fodder as tree  
**0:53:49-0:53:55:**  hay, well then we can harvest that and dry it and feed it to them in the wintertime.  
**0:53:55-0:54:02:**  I think by now we have a pretty good understanding of the numerous benefits that livestock retrieve  
**0:54:02-0:54:05:**  from being surrounded by trees.  
**0:54:05-0:54:12:**  But I'm wondering, and I'm sure our listeners are as well, what those silvopastral systems  
**0:54:12-0:54:20:**  might look like in practice, or beyond silvopastral even thinking in relation to pigs or poultry  
**0:54:20-0:54:23:**  as well.  
**0:54:23-0:54:26:**  To start things off, you were talking before of tree cover.  
**0:54:26-0:54:33:**  Do you have a number in terms of percentage of what's a meaningful tree cover?  
**0:54:33-0:54:38:**  What are we talking about to really get those benefits you were just mentioning?  
**0:54:38-0:54:46:**  Well, if we consider tree cover from a livestock point of view, then it's really having sufficient  
**0:54:46-0:54:55:**  access for the animals to all use the cover in a meaningful way without overcrowding or  
**0:54:55-0:54:58:**  without damaging that landscape.  
**0:54:58-0:55:06:**  So ideally you would have sufficient room for them to be moving around in that landscape  
**0:55:06-0:55:17:**  without, as I say, damaging it, but also being able to choose between different environments.  
**0:55:17-0:55:27:**  So there might be some more dense, less dense areas and open areas in between.  
**0:55:27-0:55:34:**  If we think of it in landscape terms, then we have to consider what we're trying to achieve  
**0:55:34-0:55:35:**  with that landscape.  
**0:55:35-0:55:41:**  So if we have grasses, we have to know what grasses are there and how much shade they  
**0:55:41-0:55:44:**  tolerate and still be productive.  
**0:55:44-0:55:50:**  We tend to underestimate their ability to tolerate shade.  
**0:55:50-0:55:59:**  Most of our grasses can at least tolerate 50% shade without loss of production.  
**0:55:59-0:56:07:**  And I came across a piece of research that showed that protein levels were higher when  
**0:56:07-0:56:10:**  shade was higher.  
**0:56:10-0:56:17:**  I've only come across it once, so I don't know how robust that piece of research was,  
**0:56:17-0:56:24:**  but it's certainly interesting if we're trying to produce grain, for example, for human consumption,  
**0:56:24-0:56:32:**  let's say, and the protein content is higher, then that makes it a more valuable resource,  
**0:56:32-0:56:36:**  even perhaps if the yield is slightly lower.  
**0:56:36-0:56:40:**  So that might be a reasonable trade-off.  
**0:56:40-0:56:46:**  And we also have to consider, if we're thinking about pasture, we have to consider canopy  
**0:56:46-0:56:47:**  density.  
**0:56:47-0:56:49:**  So maybe selecting trees.  
**0:56:49-0:56:53:**  In fact, it goes across the board for agroforestry altogether.  
**0:56:53-0:56:58:**  We have to think about what we're trying to produce on the ground and how those trees  
**0:56:58-0:57:00:**  interact.  
**0:57:00-0:57:11:**  So trees with a later canopy growth and a less dense growth will enable us to farm vertically  
**0:57:11-0:57:17:**  and maintain production levels better at the ground level.  
**0:57:17-0:57:21:**  That said, we can manage canopy height.  
**0:57:21-0:57:28:**  So we can clean up the canopy and have it higher, so there's more light coming down  
**0:57:28-0:57:29:**  to the ground.  
**0:57:29-0:57:33:**  And we're still getting the benefit, if there are sufficient trees in that landscape, we're  
**0:57:33-0:57:42:**  still getting the benefits of, perversely in summer, an increased airflow and higher  
**0:57:42-0:57:43:**  evapotranspiration rates.  
**0:57:43-0:57:50:**  So they're also helping to manage both grass growth and more comfortable conditions for  
**0:57:50-0:57:53:**  the livestock.  
**0:57:53-0:58:01:**  When we think of design, for the livestock, we can have several different designs, if  
**0:58:01-0:58:07:**  you like, we can think about the traditional wood pasture, which is permanent pasture and  
**0:58:07-0:58:16:**  you have trees spread out in that landscape in a random way.  
**0:58:16-0:58:21:**  There can be natural regeneration in this process.  
**0:58:21-0:58:25:**  So the trees are interacting with the birds.  
**0:58:25-0:58:30:**  The birds are hiding acorns, for example, from the oak tree and some shrubbery.  
**0:58:30-0:58:32:**  And this is all just a natural process.  
**0:58:32-0:58:37:**  So there's very little control over where trees are planted in this scenario.  
**0:58:37-0:58:41:**  But here in the UK, it was a very traditional system.  
**0:58:41-0:58:49:**  And some of these systems now being regenerated, actively managed again.  
**0:58:49-0:58:56:**  In modern systems, we might want to think about clusters of trees.  
**0:58:56-0:59:00:**  And in fact, we have a piece of research that we're currently engaging with.  
**0:59:00-0:59:07:**  We have eight farmers in the south of England and we have three different silver pasture  
**0:59:07-0:59:11:**  designs that these farmers are trialling and we're monitoring.  
**0:59:11-0:59:14:**  So they've just planted them.  
**0:59:14-0:59:22:**  And in this piece of research, some of the farmers are trialling clusters of trees.  
**0:59:22-0:59:29:**  So mimicking the old wood pasture system closely.  
**0:59:29-0:59:32:**  And then we have two linear designs.  
**0:59:32-0:59:38:**  So more like a hedgerow type.  
**0:59:38-0:59:43:**  And the third one is more like a shelterbelt type.  
**0:59:43-0:59:54:**  So longer lines, more regimented, easier access for machinery, perhaps more suited for changing  
**0:59:54-0:59:56:**  use of lands.  
**0:59:56-1:00:06:**  So if you're putting in lay grasses and reseeding regularly, then the more uncontrolled design,  
**1:00:06-1:00:11:**  if you like, is less suitable in this scenario.  
**1:00:11-1:00:15:**  So these farmers, all livestock farmers are trialling these different systems and we'll  
**1:00:15-1:00:21:**  be monitoring and measuring them as we go through the next 12 years.  
**1:00:21-1:00:30:**  But what we expect to find with the linear systems, you do tend to limit access to shade  
**1:00:30-1:00:35:**  and shelter because of course the sun is changing as it moves round.  
**1:00:35-1:00:41:**  So what you need to consider with these systems, although they might be easier to manage for  
**1:00:41-1:00:47:**  the farmer, they will have their drawbacks for the livestock.  
**1:00:47-1:00:57:**  And then you really need to think about how they're positioned in terms of the prevailing  
**1:00:57-1:00:58:**  wind, for example.  
**1:00:58-1:01:04:**  So you want them to be perpendicular to the prevailing wind, otherwise you risk creating  
**1:01:04-1:01:07:**  wind tunnels.  
**1:01:07-1:01:12:**  And you really want them to be either side of the landscape that you're offering the  
**1:01:12-1:01:21:**  livestock so they can at least offer optimum shelter and optimum shade for more of the  
**1:01:21-1:01:26:**  day than they otherwise would have with a single line.  
**1:01:26-1:01:32:**  The benefits of having these shelter belts, of course, is that it's easier to browse from  
**1:01:32-1:01:41:**  because they tend to go down to ground level where if you've got trees, they can access  
**1:01:41-1:01:47:**  what they can up to the browse line and then they have to wait for regrowth.  
**1:01:47-1:01:53:**  So these are all real considerations that you manage with your livestock, but you also  
**1:01:53-1:01:59:**  manage with the type of farming that you wish to carry out.  
**1:01:59-1:02:06:**  Yeah, it's really good points that you're making actually in terms of designing it.  
**1:02:06-1:02:13:**  And I'm wondering in terms of, we talked about fodder beforehand, in terms of harvesting  
**1:02:13-1:02:18:**  fodder for me, that's one of the main difficulties when we come to tree fodder is how you give  
**1:02:18-1:02:25:**  access to the animals, because sometimes the labor involved in pruning trees and then feeding  
**1:02:25-1:02:28:**  it to the animals and then disposing of the branches is huge.  
**1:02:28-1:02:34:**  But on the other hand, it's not always easy to synchronize the needs of the pasture and  
**1:02:34-1:02:40:**  giving access to trees and managing the whole herd.  
**1:02:40-1:02:44:**  And of course, you don't have all the answers to this, but I'm wondering if you've seen  
**1:02:44-1:02:49:**  some things through your research working with farmers of systems that worked well for  
**1:02:49-1:02:50:**  the farmers in question.  
**1:02:50-1:02:53:**  Well, yes, tree fodder does.  
**1:02:53-1:02:56:**  It can be a complicated process.  
**1:02:56-1:03:03:**  It can certainly bring benefits, but it does require forethought when you start practicing  
**1:03:03-1:03:06:**  collecting tree hay.  
**1:03:06-1:03:11:**  We have some farmers here that are beginning to do so.  
**1:03:11-1:03:14:**  It does require a lot of space.  
**1:03:14-1:03:17:**  It does require planning.  
**1:03:17-1:03:20:**  You have to consider harvesting it at the right time.  
**1:03:20-1:03:25:**  If you harvest it too late in the season, then you risk a lot of leaf drop.  
**1:03:25-1:03:29:**  And of course, the leaves are the things that you really want.  
**1:03:29-1:03:35:**  Although the animals will feed on the smaller twigs, it's the leaves that hold the most  
**1:03:35-1:03:38:**  nutrition.  
**1:03:38-1:03:40:**  Which brings me to another point.  
**1:03:40-1:03:46:**  The species of the tree that you're harvesting also matters.  
**1:03:46-1:03:53:**  Ash, for example, is a very good tree fodder tree, but the leaves become quite brittle.  
**1:03:53-1:04:02:**  So some recording in either Sweden or Norway, I can't remember, but the way they used to  
**1:04:02-1:04:09:**  practice it was that they would cut it and they would dry it as close as possible to  
**1:04:09-1:04:17:**  where they were going to feed the animals so that that leaf drop was minimized.  
**1:04:17-1:04:25:**  The other thing is that when you harvest it, if you're harvesting wood that's bigger than  
**1:04:25-1:04:31:**  the animals are prepared to eat, then you also then have a lot of waste that you have  
**1:04:31-1:04:33:**  to go back and clear up.  
**1:04:33-1:04:38:**  So thinking about that is also important.  
**1:04:38-1:04:47:**  Both sheep and cattle, once they're accustomed to eating browse, will eat the twigs, the  
**1:04:47-1:04:51:**  branches, up to roughly one centimeter diameter.  
**1:04:51-1:04:56:**  So if you're harvesting bigger than that, then you're going to be doing a lot of clearing  
**1:04:56-1:05:01:**  up as well after feeding.  
**1:05:01-1:05:07:**  Because for me, when I think about harvesting, it seems more obvious to be cutting branches.  
**1:05:07-1:05:08:**  That's what you often see.  
**1:05:08-1:05:15:**  So what ways are farmers finding to harvest the tips of the branches with very small twigs  
**1:05:15-1:05:17:**  as you just recommended?  
**1:05:17-1:05:19:**  I don't actually know.  
**1:05:19-1:05:26:**  I know of two farmers who are currently feeding tree hay.  
**1:05:26-1:05:35:**  One is a Belgian goat farmer, and I think the goats will actively strip the bark off  
**1:05:35-1:05:36:**  the bigger branches.  
**1:05:36-1:05:40:**  So I don't think he's overly bothered about this.  
**1:05:40-1:05:47:**  The second farmer is a dairy farmer in the UK, and he's just started feeding tree hay  
**1:05:47-1:05:52:**  this year, this winter we've just had.  
**1:05:52-1:05:59:**  And he was feeding willow to his dry cows, and he was most interested in offering them  
**1:05:59-1:06:06:**  willow for medicinal purposes, if you like, to help them through that late gestation period  
**1:06:06-1:06:09:**  for carving.  
**1:06:09-1:06:17:**  And he certainly cut them too big, but rather than make life hard for himself, he dried  
**1:06:17-1:06:23:**  it on trailers, and when it was completely dry, he hired a wood chipper, and he just  
**1:06:23-1:06:32:**  chipped the lot, and then spread it on top of the cows' food, and they ate everything.  
**1:06:32-1:06:44:**  Now, for dry cows, that is not necessarily a problem, but in terms of nutritional content,  
**1:06:44-1:06:52:**  you wouldn't recommend necessarily that they're feeding on wood of poor nutrition.  
**1:06:52-1:06:59:**  So it works for him in his situation, but that's probably not something that one would  
**1:06:59-1:07:03:**  recommend generally.  
**1:07:03-1:07:12:**  Of course, there is another option, you can ensile tree fodder, you can make silage out  
**1:07:12-1:07:15:**  of tree fodder.  
**1:07:15-1:07:23:**  This brings its own problems, because of course you have to get all of the air out for the  
**1:07:23-1:07:26:**  process to work properly.  
**1:07:26-1:07:33:**  Fasting works well in this scenario as well, but you also have to consider time of year  
**1:07:33-1:07:44:**  and water content, and being careful not to harvest it too dry is key.  
**1:07:44-1:07:49:**  Species such as willow can become too dry, and then they won't ensile, you won't get  
**1:07:49-1:07:54:**  that fermenting process, in fact it will just go mouldy.  
**1:07:54-1:08:01:**  So that's something to consider, but if people are comfortable with making grass silage,  
**1:08:01-1:08:11:**  then moisture content is a known and important part of that process, so it's not that difficult.  
**1:08:11-1:08:21:**  In terms of how it's done, it's not really done on large scale, but a few zoos are actually  
**1:08:21-1:08:29:**  using this practice to feed and enrich their zoo animals, so they're creating tree silage  
**1:08:29-1:08:36:**  in tubs, recycled, reused tubs every year.  
**1:08:36-1:08:44:**  It's possible, it's absolutely possible.  
**1:08:44-1:08:51:**  We've talked a lot about how desirable integrating trees is, and how we can do it, and what it  
**1:08:51-1:08:59:**  might look like, but I'm sure you've encountered some hesitations or some questions from farmers  
**1:08:59-1:09:09:**  or from farming advisors or experts, and today what do you see as the main obstacles to being  
**1:09:09-1:09:18:**  able to scale silver pasture and really include trees in the way we farm?  
**1:09:18-1:09:23:**  I see really three main obstacles.  
**1:09:23-1:09:28:**  The first one is lack of knowledge.  
**1:09:28-1:09:35:**  We've been quite systematic in our removal of trees from the farmed landscape over the  
**1:09:35-1:09:40:**  last 80 years or so.  
**1:09:40-1:09:46:**  Although trees used to be a fundamental part of the farmed landscape, we've very quickly  
**1:09:46-1:09:56:**  forgotten how to farm with trees, which really leaves farmers in a difficult position.  
**1:09:56-1:10:05:**  They can see the benefits, but they're not comfortable with getting it wrong, if you  
**1:10:05-1:10:06:**  like.  
**1:10:06-1:10:11:**  So there's real knowledge needed, and we don't have enough yet.  
**1:10:11-1:10:18:**  We're all having to relearn these systems, but if you plant trees in the wrong place,  
**1:10:18-1:10:21:**  it's a lot to get wrong.  
**1:10:21-1:10:30:**  That said, those farmers who have been practicing silvery pasture for several decades in this  
**1:10:30-1:10:35:**  country really say, just get on and do it.  
**1:10:35-1:10:40:**  That is their advice to farmers, and they typically say that the best time to plant  
**1:10:40-1:10:43:**  trees was 20 years ago.  
**1:10:43-1:10:47:**  The second best time is today.  
**1:10:47-1:10:53:**  Using for, for example, financial support from the government, they say, well, the government  
**1:10:53-1:11:02:**  in the UK changes every four years, and they change their mind, so just do it.  
**1:11:02-1:11:11:**  I do think whilst I understand farmers' hesitancy about planting trees, I think they can take  
**1:11:11-1:11:20:**  some reassurance from those farmers who are already doing it that they haven't, they don't  
**1:11:20-1:11:25:**  regret planting those trees, and they're very keen that other farmers should plant trees  
**1:11:25-1:11:30:**  and follow their practice.  
**1:11:30-1:11:39:**  I think leading on from that, the second issue is really the health issue, the safety issue  
**1:11:39-1:11:49:**  of bringing trees on farm, because it's important to note that trees require management as much  
**1:11:49-1:11:54:**  as the grass does, as much as the soil does.  
**1:11:54-1:12:00:**  Just by bringing trees in, I mean, yes, you can have some standard trees, but they will  
**1:12:00-1:12:07:**  require some kind of management, and particularly if you want to go down the tree fodder route.  
**1:12:07-1:12:13:**  For many of our farmers, they are now in a situation where they are loan workers, all  
**1:12:13-1:12:21:**  day, every day working on their own, and thinking about having a chainsaw, and maybe working  
**1:12:21-1:12:29:**  at height are factors that they have to consider, and rightly so.  
**1:12:29-1:12:32:**  So that's the second point.  
**1:12:32-1:12:39:**  And the third point in the UK is we have a lot of rented land, and you have to have the  
**1:12:39-1:12:46:**  landlord agreeing before the tenant can plant trees, and this can be a real problem for  
**1:12:46-1:12:48:**  farmers.  
**1:12:48-1:12:52:**  So overall, there are these three issues that we need to consider.  
**1:12:52-1:13:03:**  I think the first two can be managed, learning courses, and becoming more comfortable with  
**1:13:03-1:13:09:**  having trees back into the farm landscape, where we can start to think of that as normal  
**1:13:09-1:13:18:**  rather than new and innovative, actually returning the landscape to the way it once was.  
**1:13:18-1:13:29:**  And I should actually say that online there's a fantastic video of a French farmer who grows  
**1:13:29-1:13:38:**  mulberry trees for tree fodder, and he pollards them, and his harvest every year, he clearly  
**1:13:38-1:13:47:**  lives in a place where mulberry trees go very well, and he harvests multiple tons of mulberry  
**1:13:47-1:13:51:**  leaves every year for his beef cattle.  
**1:13:51-1:13:55:**  They're quite an extraordinary sight.  
**1:13:55-1:14:03:**  One last question I wanted to ask is things to be aware of in the design of, I'm thinking  
**1:14:03-1:14:09:**  putting trees in the wrong place or not enough of them could have detrimental impacts, thinking  
**1:14:09-1:14:22:**  of maybe not enough trees where all the livestock concentrates on creating problems of compaction  
**1:14:22-1:14:25:**  and concentrating fertility in one area.  
**1:14:25-1:14:30:**  So what would your advice be in terms of preventing that?  
**1:14:30-1:14:32:**  Oh, more trees.  
**1:14:32-1:14:35:**  It's as simple as that.  
**1:14:35-1:14:41:**  This is a valued resource that the animals are using because they need to use it.  
**1:14:41-1:14:50:**  So getting more trees will take the pressure off that part of the landscape.  
**1:14:50-1:14:52:**  There is one other thing to think about.  
**1:14:52-1:15:01:**  We talked at the beginning of the conversation about water management.  
**1:15:01-1:15:09:**  And one thing to consider is if you have land that has drainage, so the land has been drained,  
**1:15:09-1:15:13:**  then you do have to think about the trees seeking out those drains for the water supply  
**1:15:13-1:15:16:**  and blocking them up.  
**1:15:16-1:15:22:**  Now there is an ongoing discussion here about if the trees are going for the water and they  
**1:15:22-1:15:28:**  can manage the water, then the drains are less important and of less value.  
**1:15:28-1:15:34:**  But there are certain species of trees, which includes willow, and they actively seek out  
**1:15:34-1:15:35:**  water.  
**1:15:35-1:15:43:**  So if you have drainage on your land, then thinking about where they are and the types  
**1:15:43-1:15:50:**  of trees that you're planting can be a useful exercise to avoid your drains not working  
**1:15:50-1:15:55:**  anymore or being blocked by willow roots.  
**1:15:55-1:16:02:**  I think maybe I'll just finish on one thing.  
**1:16:02-1:16:09:**  It's not so much about the livestock, but it is about the number of trees.  
**1:16:09-1:16:13:**  I want to consider this in terms of flies.  
**1:16:13-1:16:23:**  So we know that a few trees brings in more flies, which is a problem for the livestock.  
**1:16:23-1:16:29:**  But if you bring in more trees, you do bring in the flies, but you also bring in the predators  
**1:16:29-1:16:30:**  of those flies.  
**1:16:30-1:16:35:**  So you're creating a better biodiverse system.  
**1:16:35-1:16:45:**  And a piece of research has shown that although there are more flies in the silvopasture system,  
**1:16:45-1:16:55:**  because of the predators, when you take head counts of head flies, there are 40% fewer  
**1:16:55-1:17:00:**  in the silvopasture system than on open pasture.  
**1:17:00-1:17:08:**  And this is really a key point to make because you're rebuilding biodiversity.  
**1:17:08-1:17:10:**  You're rebuilding these systems.  
**1:17:10-1:17:17:**  So yes, those pests are there, but the predators are there to manage those populations.  
**1:17:17-1:17:28:**  And alongside this, we know that silvopasture systems have more dung beetles, more species  
**1:17:28-1:17:33:**  of dung beetles, and each of these beetles is more active.  
**1:17:33-1:17:40:**  So the muck that's being deposited is getting into the ground much quicker.  
**1:17:40-1:17:45:**  So those nutrients are being captured.  
**1:17:45-1:17:54:**  So really, yes, my main interest is the livestock, but in general, trees bring a great deal more  
**1:17:54-1:17:58:**  benefits than that.  
**1:17:58-1:18:00:**  What a beautiful conclusion.  
**1:18:00-1:18:01:**  Thank you so much.  
**1:18:01-1:18:08:**  And thanks again for taking the time to share all this amazing knowledge with us.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 13:38:51)
**0:00:00-0:00:19:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:19-0:00:21:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:21-0:00:26:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:26-0:00:30:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:30-0:00:35:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:35-0:00:36:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:36-0:00:41:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:41-0:00:46:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:46-0:00:49:**  Hello everybody and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:49-0:00:56:**  Today we're super excited to be interviewing Benedikt Bössel from Gothenbössel in Germany.  
**0:00:56-0:00:59:**  Hi Benedikt and welcome to the podcast.  
**0:00:59-0:01:00:**  Thanks for joining us.  
**0:01:00-0:01:01:**  Yeah, my pleasure.  
**0:01:01-0:01:02:**  Hi guys.  
**0:01:02-0:01:05:**  Great to be here.  
**0:01:05-0:01:10:**  So we were thinking that maybe we could start with kind of overview of the project and you  
**0:01:10-0:01:15:**  could, you know, introduce the project and tell us what it's about and how it kind of  
**0:01:15-0:01:17:**  came about.  
**0:01:17-0:01:18:**  Sure.  
**0:01:18-0:01:34:**  So I had a prior life, let's say, because I started working in investment banking when,  
**0:01:34-0:01:41:**  you know, I basically went through or came out of university.  
**0:01:41-0:01:48:**  And having lived in and around farms and having always had, let's say, the natural world,  
**0:01:48-0:01:58:**  so to say, as something that is basically my passion, I soon came to realize that investment  
**0:01:58-0:02:04:**  banking as such is not something that I really want to, you know, spend my time in.  
**0:02:04-0:02:10:**  Then the financial crisis hit and suddenly I saw how this whole system just really fell  
**0:02:10-0:02:18:**  together and being 22 years old and experiencing that firsthand was something that had a deep  
**0:02:18-0:02:25:**  influence on the way I saw the world or on the way I thought about myself in that context.  
**0:02:25-0:02:31:**  So then I basically said, let's go back to, you know, the kind of passion that you have,  
**0:02:31-0:02:35:**  which has always been natural nature and I guess resources.  
**0:02:35-0:02:41:**  So I started looking at, you know, the idea or the context of how can you bring in the  
**0:02:41-0:02:49:**  sort of financial background that you have with topics around land use.  
**0:02:49-0:02:55:**  And this is when, you know, you had the first couple of funds in the US, I think it was  
**0:02:55-0:03:02:**  Avrio, Contibian and in the Netherlands you had Antara that had been formed around the  
**0:03:02-0:03:04:**  topic of ag tech.  
**0:03:04-0:03:09:**  So I thought, okay, this is, you know, this is an area that I'd love to go into because  
**0:03:09-0:03:18:**  obviously the problems that we are facing are quite obvious and the solutions that innovation  
**0:03:18-0:03:27:**  can bring, be it technological, digital or somehow other are going to be part of the  
**0:03:27-0:03:30:**  or a large part of the solution.  
**0:03:30-0:03:33:**  So then I took one or two side steps.  
**0:03:33-0:03:34:**  I wasn't restructuring for a while.  
**0:03:34-0:03:42:**  I did a master's in agriculture economics and then started working in venture capital  
**0:03:42-0:03:51:**  with a strong focus on, let's say ecological technologies specifically agricultural technologies.  
**0:03:51-0:03:59:**  And what I learned through those times, specifically talking to startups in the space, that I was  
**0:03:59-0:04:05:**  always confronted with their sort of vision of a future when it comes to land use and  
**0:04:05-0:04:07:**  agriculture and food.  
**0:04:07-0:04:19:**  And I think through that, I basically regained the interest of agriculture in the broad sense.  
**0:04:19-0:04:25:**  And here also a little side step to my personal history.  
**0:04:25-0:04:34:**  See my family's history in a sense that the family of my step-grandfather used to live  
**0:04:34-0:04:41:**  in an estate in our east of Berlin for 250 years.  
**0:04:41-0:04:50:**  And he flew in 1945 and then married my father's mother in Western Germany when my father was  
**0:04:50-0:04:51:**  five years old.  
**0:04:51-0:04:54:**  So basically my father grew up with my step-grandfather.  
**0:04:54-0:05:02:**  And for me, it was always my grandfather, although we're not actually related.  
**0:05:02-0:05:09:**  And when the war came down, my step-grandfather came back to the estate that his family has  
**0:05:09-0:05:17:**  been living on all those years and was basically approached by the people living here and was  
**0:05:17-0:05:19:**  asked to come back.  
**0:05:19-0:05:24:**  Because of course, after the war went down, it was all very, an unsure time.  
**0:05:24-0:05:26:**  It wasn't quite easy.  
**0:05:26-0:05:34:**  It wasn't quite, yeah, I wasn't sure how it will all basically turn out to be.  
**0:05:34-0:05:39:**  So then my step-grandfather approached my parents and said, look, I am thinking of going  
**0:05:39-0:05:42:**  back home and rebuilding the estate.  
**0:05:42-0:05:44:**  Are you guys up for it?  
**0:05:44-0:05:55:**  And my parents obviously were saying, this is a great opportunity and the tasks are daunting,  
**0:05:55-0:05:58:**  but yet could be quite fulfilling.  
**0:05:58-0:06:04:**  So they then started or initiated the whole process of starting to buy back the land.  
**0:06:04-0:06:09:**  First of all, the agricultural land, then the forestry land, and then years afterwards,  
**0:06:09-0:06:12:**  the park and the manor house.  
**0:06:12-0:06:21:**  And this is basically how my family kind of returned to the land.  
**0:06:21-0:06:31:**  And when I was, I guess, around 30 plus minus, and having worked with the startups in the  
**0:06:31-0:06:40:**  agricultural space and getting more and more known, myself more and more, let's say, involved  
**0:06:40-0:06:45:**  in thinking about the future when it comes to land use, when it comes to food and agriculture,  
**0:06:45-0:06:53:**  I realized that for me personally, the biggest impact that I can have is not being a cool  
**0:06:53-0:07:01:**  investor and talking to startups about technologies that I don't understand as much as they do,  
**0:07:01-0:07:08:**  but to actually go back to the land and utilize the land or make it also available for others  
**0:07:08-0:07:15:**  to actually test solutions, develop solutions and seek and look out for new solutions when  
**0:07:15-0:07:17:**  it comes to land use.  
**0:07:17-0:07:25:**  So I returned to the farm and took over responsibility of our reparations here in December, 2016.  
**0:07:25-0:07:33:**  And in the beginning, I thought, coming from the space, technology and digital solutions,  
**0:07:33-0:07:40:**  I guess, are going to be the way forward when it comes to land use and food.  
**0:07:40-0:07:50:**  And what I realized pretty fast is that the problem is that today, 90% of the time, undefined  
**0:07:50-0:07:59:**  percentage, but I think it's a high percentage, we have innovation in the ag space or also  
**0:07:59-0:08:05:**  in connection to land use that is always being developed out of an exploitative understanding  
**0:08:05-0:08:08:**  of complex ecosystems.  
**0:08:08-0:08:14:**  And that means that by definition, the innovation that can come from that will always only be  
**0:08:14-0:08:20:**  able to, let's say, limit the negative outcomes or the negative effects of our predominant  
**0:08:20-0:08:22:**  production model.  
**0:08:22-0:08:28:**  But I think, and this is what I observed here, this is what I observed day to day, is that  
**0:08:28-0:08:34:**  in order to solve the big problems of our time when it comes to climate, to health,  
**0:08:34-0:08:41:**  to rural development, education, culture, obviously there's many things, equality, to  
**0:08:41-0:08:49:**  name another one, we need to take an imaginary step back and look at the root causes of the  
**0:08:49-0:08:56:**  problems and then decide how do we have to change our system in order to not be faced  
**0:08:56-0:08:59:**  with the negative outcomes in the first place.  
**0:08:59-0:09:05:**  And this is really what I learned in those first, let's say, in the first year when I  
**0:09:05-0:09:12:**  took over the responsibility here, because we are now east of Berlin, we have very sandy  
**0:09:12-0:09:19:**  soil and at the same time, we have quite incredible drought problems, especially in the spring,  
**0:09:19-0:09:24:**  early summer, we have weeks and weeks without rain.  
**0:09:24-0:09:32:**  So this combination makes it incredibly challenging to grow food, to grow even a forest.  
**0:09:32-0:09:40:**  So what I realized is that my focus has to be on soil and soil health and soil fertility  
**0:09:40-0:09:45:**  and more or less the question, how can we build soil organic matter?  
**0:09:45-0:09:52:**  How can we use that little water that does come most effectively?  
**0:09:52-0:09:53:**  So how can it be taken up?  
**0:09:53-0:09:55:**  How can it be stored?  
**0:09:55-0:10:02:**  And through that, I then understood that it's not only technological, it's not only digital  
**0:10:02-0:10:04:**  innovation that we have to look for.  
**0:10:04-0:10:10:**  I mean, they are and they will be incredible tools or instruments later on, but beforehand,  
**0:10:10-0:10:14:**  we have to think systemically, we have to think ecologically, socially, what kind of  
**0:10:14-0:10:17:**  innovation can come from that angle.  
**0:10:17-0:10:23:**  And then I started writing thousands and thousands of emails to really anybody that was somehow  
**0:10:23-0:10:29:**  involved in new systems or new is a wrong word for this, I guess, but different systems  
**0:10:29-0:10:37:**  of land use, different ideas of how we can cultivate land.  
**0:10:37-0:10:44:**  I looked at farmers and NGOs and people all over the world that either had similar problems  
**0:10:44-0:10:49:**  than we have and have already solved them or that have just other approaches.  
**0:10:49-0:10:54:**  And through all that, I basically discovered the whole ideas of regenerative agriculture  
**0:10:54-0:11:01:**  with all its different variables, let's say, or different lines of thought, I guess.  
**0:11:01-0:11:08:**  So agroforestry in a more classical way, centropic agriculture, which is basically like a dynamic  
**0:11:08-0:11:17:**  agroforestry with an extremely high diversity in species, holistic grazing, of course, marked  
**0:11:17-0:11:18:**  gardening.  
**0:11:18-0:11:23:**  I mean, there's so many different kinds of regenerative agriculture.  
**0:11:23-0:11:28:**  I'm always not such a big fan on the whole definition side of things, but I think the  
**0:11:28-0:11:30:**  ideas were compelling.  
**0:11:30-0:11:36:**  And what I found really interesting is that although they have been developed and have  
**0:11:36-0:11:42:**  been proven to be extremely successful in very different regions and contexts and climate  
**0:11:42-0:11:48:**  situations, they more or less all have the same underlying understanding of soil and  
**0:11:48-0:11:55:**  how you have to treat the soil and what you can do to actually start growing soil and  
**0:11:55-0:11:58:**  building soil biodiversity and so forth.  
**0:11:58-0:12:02:**  And so when I saw that, I realized, okay, this is going to be our future.  
**0:12:02-0:12:04:**  I want this to be our future.  
**0:12:04-0:12:10:**  So then the next question was, how can we bring those ideas here?  
**0:12:10-0:12:11:**  How can we bring the knowledge here?  
**0:12:11-0:12:16:**  How can we bring people that are fascinated by it that already know some of it or at least  
**0:12:16-0:12:18:**  are willing to learn?  
**0:12:18-0:12:27:**  And then I started writing a lot of different programs on innovation and subsidy programs  
**0:12:27-0:12:28:**  and whatever.  
**0:12:28-0:12:41:**  And I think it was over 10 different tries on the regional level.  
**0:12:41-0:12:48:**  The country level, EU level, and all of them collectively said, nah, we're not going to  
**0:12:48-0:12:49:**  find this.  
**0:12:49-0:12:50:**  This is no innovation.  
**0:12:50-0:12:53:**  Where's the drone?  
**0:12:53-0:12:54:**  There's no blockchain here.  
**0:12:54-0:12:56:**  This can't be innovation.  
**0:12:56-0:13:02:**  And yeah, I was like, well, this is systemic systems innovation.  
**0:13:02-0:13:03:**  This is ecological.  
**0:13:03-0:13:04:**  This is social innovation.  
**0:13:04-0:13:10:**  But they didn't really feel that, I guess.  
**0:13:10-0:13:12:**  So then I understood I have to just do it by myself.  
**0:13:12-0:13:20:**  So I still had a car, a nice German Audi from my venture capitalist times, which I sold.  
**0:13:20-0:13:25:**  And I had some really bad shares, which I had when I started investment banking.  
**0:13:25-0:13:27:**  They were really bad also.  
**0:13:27-0:13:31:**  So I was kind of relieved to get them away anyway.  
**0:13:31-0:13:36:**  So I sold both of them and got a loan from Ecosia.  
**0:13:36-0:13:44:**  Ecosia is a German search engine that actually is a purpose company that plants trees by  
**0:13:44-0:13:47:**  the money that they do earn through advertisements.  
**0:13:47-0:13:48:**  They gave me a loan.  
**0:13:48-0:13:56:**  So I always say I swapped 200 horsepower against 20 carpowers because with that capital then  
**0:13:56-0:14:05:**  I founded a single agriculture company that today is basically leasing the land from the  
**0:14:05-0:14:09:**  large ecological agriculture company.  
**0:14:09-0:14:18:**  And within that small company, we then basically now initiated those different forms of regenerative  
**0:14:18-0:14:19:**  agriculture on the estate.  
**0:14:19-0:14:29:**  So we today have two different, let's say more or less classical agroforestry systems.  
**0:14:29-0:14:37:**  We have a centropic agriculture test field on roughly 3.5 hectares.  
**0:14:37-0:14:45:**  We have, by the end of the year, we'll have more or less hundred cows.  
**0:14:45-0:14:46:**  We have the chickens.  
**0:14:46-0:14:50:**  So we do the whole holistic grazing on that front.  
**0:14:50-0:14:56:**  We have partners that we're leasing land to that are doing a market garden.  
**0:14:56-0:15:03:**  So there's different sort of things that we're trying, composting methodologies as well.  
**0:15:03-0:15:09:**  And trying to, first of all, see how they work in our context, obviously trying to adapt  
**0:15:09-0:15:11:**  them and develop them.  
**0:15:11-0:15:18:**  And also what we can see and what we can learn, bring that more and more into the large ecological  
**0:15:18-0:15:26:**  estate to transform that basically as we speak.  
**0:15:26-0:15:33:**  And yeah, maybe I'll add some more words to the whole setting here in total.  
**0:15:33-0:15:41:**  So we are basically in charge of roughly 3000 hectares, a third of which is agricultural  
**0:15:41-0:15:44:**  land, two thirds is forestry.  
**0:15:44-0:15:48:**  We manage that with roughly 20 employees.  
**0:15:48-0:15:55:**  We always have around five interns as well as volunteers that come help us in, let's  
**0:15:55-0:16:03:**  say the planting seasons in early spring or during the winter.  
**0:16:03-0:16:06:**  And yeah, I mean, my family lives here.  
**0:16:06-0:16:08:**  I live here.  
**0:16:08-0:16:17:**  And yeah, we've had the luck to find more and more people that are willing to come and  
**0:16:17-0:16:26:**  join this journey with us and help us out and share the dream, I guess, of finding new,  
**0:16:26-0:16:34:**  I guess, multifunctional land use models that have the potential to be economically, ecologically  
**0:16:34-0:16:41:**  and socially somehow more beneficial than the current other systems that we usually  
**0:16:41-0:16:42:**  see.  
**0:16:42-0:16:46:**  And although we are only at the beginning and although we know there's just so much  
**0:16:46-0:16:54:**  more to learn and to see and to do, we are incredibly hopeful and we are incredibly,  
**0:16:54-0:17:02:**  I guess, motivated by what we see every day and how many people come in from all different  
**0:17:02-0:17:08:**  areas and kind of give us the impression that they value what we do.  
**0:17:08-0:17:12:**  And yeah, so it has been an incredible journey.  
**0:17:12-0:17:18:**  And to be totally honest with you, I'm so glad that we didn't get funding for any of  
**0:17:18-0:17:28:**  the projects that we proposed earlier, like a couple of years ago, because sometimes the  
**0:17:28-0:17:33:**  things that go wrong are the things that you need to go wrong in order to get where you  
**0:17:33-0:17:34:**  want to be.  
**0:17:34-0:17:37:**  And where we are right now is exactly where we want to be.  
**0:17:37-0:17:44:**  So we are quite happy about that, I guess.  
**0:17:44-0:17:48:**  That's such an interesting story and introduction, Benedict.  
**0:17:48-0:17:49:**  Thank you so much.  
**0:17:49-0:17:54:**  Yeah, sorry for the long monologue.  
**0:17:54-0:17:55:**  It was amazing.  
**0:17:55-0:17:58:**  A very, very detailed description.  
**0:17:58-0:17:59:**  It was very interesting.  
**0:17:59-0:18:04:**  So we wanted to understand a bit more about how much of these 1000 hectares you're farming  
**0:18:04-0:18:12:**  are you currently testing regenerative techniques or testing ecological techniques?  
**0:18:12-0:18:19:**  And when you talk about ecological farming, what does that mean for you on the farm?  
**0:18:19-0:18:24:**  Well, so let's start with the last question.  
**0:18:24-0:18:33:**  Ecological farming in Germany specifically, you have a whole, let's say, set of rules  
**0:18:33-0:18:36:**  and regulations that you have to basically adhere to.  
**0:18:36-0:18:39:**  So it has to do with the crop rotation.  
**0:18:39-0:18:41:**  It has to do where you buy your seeds.  
**0:18:41-0:18:47:**  And if it's all certified, where you get the manure from.  
**0:18:47-0:18:53:**  And it's a whole process that follows certain rules that make sure that the whole ecological  
**0:18:53-0:18:57:**  production follows, let's say, the ecological mind, let's say, right?  
**0:18:57-0:19:00:**  So there's no synthetic fertilizers allowed, of course.  
**0:19:00-0:19:04:**  There's no herbicides, fungicides.  
**0:19:04-0:19:09:**  It's pretty, I guess, it's pretty natural, I guess.  
**0:19:09-0:19:14:**  So our farm has been ecological since 2004.  
**0:19:14-0:19:24:**  So as such, we haven't had any kind of conventional approaches here for a long, long time.  
**0:19:24-0:19:30:**  Asking how much of, let's say, the regenerative approaches we are already establishing on  
**0:19:30-0:19:32:**  the whole farm.  
**0:19:32-0:19:39:**  I mean, this is, I guess, more or less difficult to say because where does it start and where  
**0:19:39-0:19:40:**  does it end?  
**0:19:40-0:19:49:**  I mean, as of today, we are growing roughly 400 to 600 hectares of cover crop each year.  
**0:19:49-0:19:56:**  In addition, we have 200 to 300 hectares with nurse crops underneath.  
**0:19:56-0:20:01:**  So a combination of different grasses and clover, for example.  
**0:20:01-0:20:08:**  So this would be something that is part of the definition of regenerative agriculture.  
**0:20:08-0:20:14:**  Yet this is something that we conventional farmers, ecological farmers have been doing  
**0:20:14-0:20:19:**  and are doing in Germany and probably in many other countries also.  
**0:20:19-0:20:23:**  So that depends, I guess.  
**0:20:23-0:20:33:**  I mean, when it comes to no till convention or no till organic farming, I guess this is  
**0:20:33-0:20:36:**  also something where we have to take small steps.  
**0:20:36-0:20:44:**  I mean, I wish I could just say, okay, we will stop plowing completely as of today.  
**0:20:44-0:20:46:**  But life is not that simple.  
**0:20:46-0:20:52:**  And I think we are, as many others are, also caught in our system, right?  
**0:20:52-0:20:59:**  So I mean, because of the sandy soil and the low precipitation, our profitability is really,  
**0:20:59-0:21:01:**  really weak.  
**0:21:01-0:21:08:**  And being faced with those risks that we certainly are and having operating costs that are quite  
**0:21:08-0:21:17:**  large, I can only take little steps, I guess, because if I was to basically say no plowing  
**0:21:17-0:21:23:**  as of today, we would probably go through a year of, or let's say a time of, I guess,  
**0:21:23-0:21:30:**  something between six and 10 years where I will have a revenue dip of something between  
**0:21:30-0:21:32:**  20 and 40%.  
**0:21:32-0:21:41:**  And there is no way that I could basically somehow economically do that.  
**0:21:41-0:21:45:**  I would have to lay off people, which I don't want to do, and I would have to do other things  
**0:21:45-0:21:46:**  that I don't want to do.  
**0:21:46-0:21:51:**  So we have to really take it slow and we have to learn, we have to be very, very sure on  
**0:21:51-0:21:57:**  what we do because we can be, and we want to be as ecologically sound as we possibly  
**0:21:57-0:21:59:**  can and we want to build soil.  
**0:21:59-0:22:07:**  But if that means I have to sell my parents' house or I have to lay off workers, then that  
**0:22:07-0:22:10:**  can't be sound.  
**0:22:10-0:22:16:**  So this is also one of the reasons why our experience is we need to start small, learn  
**0:22:16-0:22:23:**  as much as we can to then slowly leapfrog some of that knowledge into the larger state  
**0:22:23-0:22:26:**  because the risks are just so predominant.  
**0:22:26-0:22:33:**  If we go really saying, okay, but if you go hard on yourself on how many hectares are  
**0:22:33-0:22:41:**  you doing regenerative organic agriculture, it would be 100 hectare as of today.  
**0:22:41-0:22:46:**  But as I said, then we have another 100 hectare today where we don't know plowing, but we  
**0:22:46-0:22:52:**  haven't started any holistic grazing on it yet, that we haven't done any agroforest.  
**0:22:52-0:22:55:**  So it's a moving target, let's say.  
**0:22:55-0:23:03:**  But obviously we're trying to grow in a sense with land and with capital and with experience  
**0:23:03-0:23:11:**  so that we'll be looking at a thousand hectare regenerative organic in a few years, of course.  
**0:23:11-0:23:17:**  But if I have learned one thing doing what we are doing and living here, it's to be humble  
**0:23:17-0:23:32:**  and to make sure that you always know that the outside decides not I and not we, our  
**0:23:32-0:23:34:**  heads or our aims.  
**0:23:34-0:23:37:**  If it rains, we can reach certain targets.  
**0:23:37-0:23:39:**  If it doesn't, we can't.  
**0:23:39-0:23:45:**  And we have to make sure that we'll be able to cope either way.  
**0:23:45-0:23:50:**  So yeah, it's an ongoing process.  
**0:23:50-0:23:52:**  It's great to hear that, Benedikt.  
**0:23:52-0:23:58:**  In so many successful farms, that's what I've observed over the past few years is this transition  
**0:23:58-0:24:03:**  method and not being too hurried to go too far in the idealism because it remains something  
**0:24:03-0:24:04:**  quite experimental.  
**0:24:04-0:24:08:**  So it's really cool to see that that's the approach you're taking as well.  
**0:24:08-0:24:10:**  And congrats for that.  
**0:24:10-0:24:16:**  I think we wanted to focus now on a bit more in detail on the agroforestry systems.  
**0:24:16-0:24:20:**  So maybe you can just give us an idea of what we're talking about.  
**0:24:20-0:24:26:**  What did you plant out and a kind of detailed description of the main trees.  
**0:24:26-0:24:31:**  I know it's difficult to encapsulate everything, but just so that we have an idea of what we're  
**0:24:31-0:24:32:**  talking about.  
**0:24:32-0:24:33:**  Sure.  
**0:24:33-0:24:43:**  Well, the first system that we started was basically one step back.  
**0:24:43-0:24:51:**  In the beginning, the first system we planted was April 2019.  
**0:24:51-0:24:54:**  So not that long ago.  
**0:24:54-0:25:05:**  And a couple of months before that, let's say, I guess towards the end of 2018, I had  
**0:25:05-0:25:13:**  in mind to basically initiate maybe an agroforestry system or maybe think about cows.  
**0:25:13-0:25:14:**  Nah, probably not.  
**0:25:14-0:25:16:**  I can't start with cows.  
**0:25:16-0:25:18:**  Well, cows are going to be so much work.  
**0:25:18-0:25:22:**  I've got so much work enough already.  
**0:25:22-0:25:28:**  And I had that kind of idea and thinking and potential projects in my mind still at the  
**0:25:28-0:25:35:**  time where I was like, okay, if I managed to somehow get one of those projects here,  
**0:25:35-0:25:37:**  this would just be incredible.  
**0:25:37-0:25:42:**  And now looking back, we have quite a few of those.  
**0:25:42-0:25:48:**  So there has been some sort of exponential development when it comes to the different  
**0:25:48-0:25:49:**  projects.  
**0:25:49-0:25:53:**  But looking back, I sometimes don't really, I can't really realize, it's difficult for  
**0:25:53-0:25:59:**  me to understand how I must have been thinking back in the day.  
**0:25:59-0:26:04:**  But anyway, so the first system that we started was really just getting started.  
**0:26:04-0:26:14:**  I mean, it was really just about putting some trees on the agricultural fields just to basically  
**0:26:14-0:26:17:**  get our hands dirty.  
**0:26:17-0:26:22:**  So the first system was very simple or is still very simple where we have basically  
**0:26:22-0:26:33:**  just populace, Alder, and what's it called?  
**0:26:33-0:26:36:**  Well, I think it's called, wait one second.  
**0:26:36-0:26:40:**  Give us the German name and then everyone else will have to go and Google translate  
**0:26:40-0:26:42:**  and practice writing German.  
**0:26:42-0:26:43:**  Weider.  
**0:26:43-0:26:44:**  So Willow.  
**0:26:44-0:26:45:**  Yes, Willow.  
**0:26:45-0:26:46:**  Thank you so much.  
**0:26:46-0:26:49:**  So it's basically just a system of that.  
**0:26:49-0:26:58:**  We have eight different populace species and two willow and two alders.  
**0:26:58-0:27:04:**  And we always plant them in, let's say 30 meter parts following each other because we  
**0:27:04-0:27:11:**  really wanted to see which species and what kind of kind will be able to cope with our,  
**0:27:11-0:27:16:**  let's say surroundings here, which as I said again, but it's really something that is  
**0:27:16-0:27:20:**  quite predominant, incredibly tough.  
**0:27:20-0:27:30:**  And we planted them on a field that has roughly 35 hectares and decided to have two double  
**0:27:30-0:27:37:**  rows from east to west as well as six double rows north to south.  
**0:27:37-0:27:43:**  And we did that because with all the systems that we did initiate or that we're doing,  
**0:27:43-0:27:52:**  we always try to go as high as we can in diversity and basically trying out things because we  
**0:27:52-0:28:00:**  think there is more or less nothing more valuable than doing it and observing it and trying  
**0:28:00-0:28:08:**  to learn from it the best that you can to then have by definition made many mistakes,  
**0:28:08-0:28:13:**  which you then hope to not repeat.  
**0:28:13-0:28:19:**  To be honest with you now, looking back, planting our first agroforestry system, we did, I don't  
**0:28:19-0:28:22:**  know, 10 mistakes, 10 big mistakes.  
**0:28:22-0:28:28:**  Then this year in spring, we thought, okay, we know it a lot better now.  
**0:28:28-0:28:29:**  We did it again.  
**0:28:29-0:28:32:**  We did 10 mistakes, which were just as big.  
**0:28:32-0:28:33:**  They were just very different.  
**0:28:33-0:28:43:**  So unfortunately, it's a bit of a spoiler, but doing those mistakes or doing things not  
**0:28:43-0:28:48:**  as good as you could do them looking back, that's not going to end, unfortunately.  
**0:28:48-0:28:50:**  But that's a different discussion.  
**0:28:50-0:28:54:**  So basically we did that and it was quite interesting.  
**0:28:54-0:28:56:**  As I said, we planted them badly.  
**0:28:56-0:29:01:**  We had the wrong choosing of crop in between.  
**0:29:01-0:29:08:**  We didn't have any sort of high gear GPS thing that basically helps us make it a straight  
**0:29:08-0:29:09:**  line.  
**0:29:09-0:29:14:**  So I'm kind of sweating when I think about Google Maps, because as soon as they have  
**0:29:14-0:29:21:**  an update of the satellite pictures, everyone else will see our agroforestry lines, which  
**0:29:21-0:29:28:**  will look more like, I don't know, but not really straight, I guess.  
**0:29:28-0:29:32:**  So there's a lot of things that you can do better.  
**0:29:32-0:29:43:**  But yeah, I guess it was our first trial and we'll see what it'll be like.  
**0:29:43-0:29:47:**  In the first year, we had rye next to it, which is not a good thing because it grows  
**0:29:47-0:29:50:**  so high that you can't see the rows anymore.  
**0:29:50-0:29:56:**  We didn't go in there and clean within the tree rows, which is really bad mistakes.  
**0:29:56-0:30:04:**  The animals loved it, so any kind of animal from any kind of deer, wild boar, wolf, they  
**0:30:04-0:30:10:**  all loved those tree lines and they ate them and did anything to them, which we didn't  
**0:30:10-0:30:14:**  want them to, but they were loving it.  
**0:30:14-0:30:19:**  So yeah, you can tell when you come there today how they look.  
**0:30:19-0:30:26:**  They've had a rough upbringing, but maybe that makes them even stronger now looking  
**0:30:26-0:30:27:**  to the future.  
**0:30:27-0:30:35:**  And we are already starting to basically fill them with other trees and more quality trees  
**0:30:35-0:30:44:**  in between to basically get the diversity up and get more species into them.  
**0:30:44-0:30:45:**  So this was basically the first one.  
**0:30:45-0:30:56:**  The second one we did this year was with a variety with different beech trees, also popular  
**0:30:56-0:31:04:**  also elder, but then we also had slow black thorn.  
**0:31:04-0:31:05:**  What else?  
**0:31:05-0:31:06:**  One second.  
**0:31:06-0:31:07:**  Mulberry.  
**0:31:07-0:31:17:**  So a very high sort of different bushes as well as fast growing trees as well as more  
**0:31:17-0:31:20:**  sort of slow growing trees.  
**0:31:20-0:31:26:**  Specifically interesting is the sort of limes also, lime trees.  
**0:31:26-0:31:30:**  So there we already have a different structure that we are looking at different layers within  
**0:31:30-0:31:39:**  the system combined with wild berry.  
**0:31:39-0:31:45:**  It's interesting for either the chicken tractors that we could walk through those agroforestry  
**0:31:45-0:31:50:**  systems or just basically the general wildlife.  
**0:31:50-0:31:54:**  Because of course in the first system where we only have fast growing trees, once they  
**0:31:54-0:31:59:**  grow let's say out of the first three, four meters, then we'll have the same effect that  
**0:31:59-0:32:02:**  we had before, which we don't want that the wind can go underneath.  
**0:32:02-0:32:08:**  And what we really want is basically to have a windbreak.  
**0:32:08-0:32:14:**  So in those kinds of agroforestry systems, what we're looking to do is change the microclimate  
**0:32:14-0:32:15:**  within the tree lines.  
**0:32:15-0:32:18:**  This is I think for me the most compelling thing.  
**0:32:18-0:32:28:**  If you imagine a time like now where we hardly have any rain, but we sometimes have some  
**0:32:28-0:32:31:**  humidity in the morning especially.  
**0:32:31-0:32:34:**  If the sun goes up, it gets very hot very fast.  
**0:32:34-0:32:36:**  The wind is most of the time quite strong.  
**0:32:36-0:32:41:**  It goes over the field and basically takes all the humidity and evaporates it.  
**0:32:41-0:32:49:**  Basically it's the same that if it does actually rain, the soil is so hot and hard that it's  
**0:32:49-0:32:56:**  like basically if you take a jar of flour and you put in some drops of milk, you'll  
**0:32:56-0:33:00:**  have this milk bubble forming on the flour.  
**0:33:00-0:33:02:**  Then this is what happens here.  
**0:33:02-0:33:04:**  Then the wind comes and it evaporates it.  
**0:33:04-0:33:08:**  So for us, it's really about decentralized water retention when it comes to those, let's  
**0:33:08-0:33:16:**  say more easy agroforestry systems, which we are really interested to see what kind  
**0:33:16-0:33:21:**  of effect they have on the agricultural land in between.  
**0:33:21-0:33:28:**  Sort of comparable scientific literature has shown that if you reduce the agricultural  
**0:33:28-0:33:37:**  land by 5 to 10%, that your potential yield on the remaining field will be either the  
**0:33:37-0:33:43:**  same if not more, especially in let's say difficult situations.  
**0:33:43-0:33:48:**  So this is a bit what we're looking at, where we're going for.  
**0:33:48-0:33:54:**  And then of course, if you think about wind erosions, water erosion, extreme water conditions  
**0:33:54-0:33:59:**  that we tend to have here as well, you'll have the tree lines that can actually hold  
**0:33:59-0:34:00:**  up the water.  
**0:34:00-0:34:03:**  They can help with the water infiltration.  
**0:34:03-0:34:05:**  Also a question of building soil organic matter.  
**0:34:05-0:34:09:**  So there's all these kinds of effects that we're looking for in those two systems.  
**0:34:09-0:34:18:**  We have a university from Berlin that is basically taking soil samples over a 20-year time period  
**0:34:18-0:34:24:**  to see how the different soil components develop over that time period.  
**0:34:24-0:34:27:**  Just a quick question about these systems, Benedict.  
**0:34:27-0:34:33:**  Firstly, what you said about the mistakes, these are some of probably, I mean, for most  
**0:34:33-0:34:36:**  people listening, these are probably some of the most interesting things to know more  
**0:34:36-0:34:42:**  about, but it would take a whole other podcast, I imagine, to go into these mistakes, but  
**0:34:42-0:34:48:**  definitely things to keep track of and hopefully one day something that we can all share with  
**0:34:48-0:34:51:**  our agroforest systems and all the mistakes we did.  
**0:34:51-0:34:59:**  But going back into the systems that you've just described now, you described the ecological  
**0:34:59-0:35:05:**  or let's say the ecosystem services that they can provide for the crops.  
**0:35:05-0:35:10:**  What are the economic benefits that you're hoping to take out from the tree lines?  
**0:35:10-0:35:13:**  Are you hoping to produce something from them as well?  
**0:35:13-0:35:21:**  Well, I mean, we are hoping to produce something from them for sure.  
**0:35:21-0:35:28:**  But as of today, the focus really is on the agricultural fields in between.  
**0:35:28-0:35:36:**  So if we can prove that the average, let's say revenue, depending on obviously market  
**0:35:36-0:35:41:**  price, or you could just use some standardized market price, but if we go for yield, if you  
**0:35:41-0:35:47:**  say tons per hectare, for example, from that field over the last 10 years will be compared  
**0:35:47-0:35:49:**  from now into the future.  
**0:35:49-0:35:56:**  And if we manage to have the same amount or even a bit more, although we're reduced by  
**0:35:56-0:36:00:**  the tree lines, then this is what I'm looking for.  
**0:36:00-0:36:03:**  Because as of now, I don't want to mix the two thoughts.  
**0:36:03-0:36:11:**  Of course you can, but my approach or my hope is, and I think I am pretty sure that it will  
**0:36:11-0:36:21:**  be, that we manage to have the ecosystem functions of the trees that bring more value to the  
**0:36:21-0:36:24:**  whole field or the whole area.  
**0:36:24-0:36:32:**  And then on top of that comes a potential value add through the tree lines themselves.  
**0:36:32-0:36:38:**  But on this field specifically, I am actually not so keen about the potential coming from  
**0:36:38-0:36:39:**  the tree lines itself.  
**0:36:39-0:36:43:**  It's really about the surrounding field.  
**0:36:43-0:36:47:**  And this is quite the opposite to our syntropic test field, for example.  
**0:36:47-0:36:53:**  In the syntropic test field, this is one where we work with Ernst Gertsch very closely together,  
**0:36:53-0:36:56:**  who's been here two times on the farm.  
**0:36:56-0:37:04:**  We are really concerned with the potential value add of the tree lines themselves.  
**0:37:04-0:37:10:**  So there we have a huge variety of different nut trees, fruit trees, high value sort of  
**0:37:10-0:37:14:**  wooden trees and so forth.  
**0:37:14-0:37:18:**  We only have, let's say 10 meters from tree line to tree line on that other field that  
**0:37:18-0:37:26:**  I was referring to in the beginning, there we have 36 meters between the tree lines basically.  
**0:37:26-0:37:31:**  But sure, we do think about that.  
**0:37:31-0:37:36:**  It's a matter of choosing the right species, I guess.  
**0:37:36-0:37:47:**  But here again, I think something that I am lacking definitely is sort of the time to  
**0:37:47-0:37:55:**  go to other places and visit them and share on their experiences and their mistakes and  
**0:37:55-0:37:58:**  the things that they have done.  
**0:37:58-0:38:11:**  Because I think it's a bit of a philosophical question, but in my first job as an investment  
**0:38:11-0:38:19:**  banker, you took everything and changed it towards an outcome that you want.  
**0:38:19-0:38:24:**  And the underlying assumption was always, well, no one will be able to prove what you  
**0:38:24-0:38:32:**  rigged in the numbers, so to say, when the time has come.  
**0:38:32-0:38:35:**  So basically, here it's the same thing.  
**0:38:35-0:38:37:**  I can plan anything I want on Excel.  
**0:38:37-0:38:39:**  I can calculate myself poor.  
**0:38:39-0:38:44:**  I can calculate the project being very profitable or whatever.  
**0:38:44-0:38:53:**  But until I harvest it in 25, in 30, in 35 years, it doesn't matter what's on the Excel  
**0:38:53-0:38:54:**  sheet.  
**0:38:54-0:39:00:**  That is when the time comes if it has worked in that sense or if it hasn't.  
**0:39:00-0:39:06:**  And to calculate in that sense, to think in that sense too strongly in a time where you  
**0:39:06-0:39:13:**  just don't know enough yet, I think it's just not something that is very good to do because  
**0:39:13-0:39:18:**  you're relying on something that you only have minor influence on.  
**0:39:18-0:39:27:**  So yeah, it's not a good answer for that simple question, but it is really, we think about  
**0:39:27-0:39:34:**  it, but I have my eyes somehow on a different target as of now.  
**0:39:34-0:39:36:**  Let's put it that way.  
**0:39:36-0:39:39:**  Yeah, Benedict, I mean, you said that you can't travel everywhere, but that's why we're  
**0:39:39-0:39:40:**  doing the podcast.  
**0:39:40-0:39:46:**  So hopefully you'll be able to travel with us as we go and investigate everyone's mistakes  
**0:39:46-0:39:48:**  and successes.  
**0:39:48-0:39:52:**  And that's good to hear.  
**0:39:52-0:40:00:**  So maybe since you mentioned the objective and the focus is really on the field production,  
**0:40:00-0:40:01:**  how is that working so far then?  
**0:40:01-0:40:06:**  How is it working to integrate the trees?  
**0:40:06-0:40:12:**  And by that, I mean both on the crop, but also in terms of workflow and moving machinery  
**0:40:12-0:40:19:**  around and how has that changed your previous operations?  
**0:40:19-0:40:28:**  I mean, with regard to the 1000 hectare grain rotation or the grain operation, that field  
**0:40:28-0:40:40:**  of agroforestry on roughly 35 hectares is not yet of, let's say of a size that it will  
**0:40:40-0:40:46:**  have a big influence on the whole sort of other operation, I guess.  
**0:40:46-0:40:54:**  I mean, it has been fun with our guys that have been in the agriculture for 30, 40 years.  
**0:40:54-0:41:00:**  Suddenly, they have to look out on things while they operate the machines that they've  
**0:41:00-0:41:01:**  never done before.  
**0:41:01-0:41:03:**  And they're like, what's going on here?  
**0:41:03-0:41:08:**  I mean, they're like, what the...  
**0:41:08-0:41:14:**  So that's a very interesting thought process, I think.  
**0:41:14-0:41:18:**  And they were obviously complaining that the lines are not straight.  
**0:41:18-0:41:27:**  And they asked me what I had the night before when I basically started planting.  
**0:41:27-0:41:31:**  So they are having a bit of fun.  
**0:41:31-0:41:35:**  And to be honest with you, I think that is also some...  
**0:41:35-0:41:37:**  That's a hugely important thing.  
**0:41:37-0:41:43:**  And it's a big learning with all honesty, because if I...  
**0:41:43-0:41:44:**  I'm not a farmer.  
**0:41:44-0:41:49:**  I haven't like, well, how do you define being a farmer?  
**0:41:49-0:41:54:**  I mean, I would see myself as a farmer today, but if someone has done 40 years of farming  
**0:41:54-0:41:59:**  and then sees my background, the last thing is that I'm a farmer.  
**0:41:59-0:42:05:**  But anyway, so if I go there and say, look, guys, we're going to start planting trees  
**0:42:05-0:42:08:**  on the agricultural fields, and we're going to do this, I'm going to do that, and we're  
**0:42:08-0:42:10:**  going to stop plowing and all that.  
**0:42:10-0:42:18:**  And this is all knowledge and views and values and ideas and systems that they haven't heard  
**0:42:18-0:42:23:**  of before and they haven't done in 40, 50 years.  
**0:42:23-0:42:27:**  And they don't understand.  
**0:42:27-0:42:31:**  It's also defined understand, but they don't agree with, let's put it that way, they don't  
**0:42:31-0:42:33:**  agree with.  
**0:42:33-0:42:39:**  Then if I force them to do it, I might as well just chuck the money out of the window,  
**0:42:39-0:42:48:**  because what we need, what I need, and I think all of us who begin this journey is to get  
**0:42:48-0:42:56:**  the people that are working with us on the same page.  
**0:42:56-0:43:03:**  You have to kind of listen to them, bring them along, draw them in, communicate, show  
**0:43:03-0:43:09:**  them why and how, maybe if you can prove to them on the outside so that they can actually  
**0:43:09-0:43:11:**  experience it themselves.  
**0:43:11-0:43:24:**  But it has to be a process, it has to be very carefully communicated in order for them to  
**0:43:24-0:43:29:**  see this as their project as well, because if they don't, they'll never support it.  
**0:43:29-0:43:33:**  And if they don't support it, it will never have a chance.  
**0:43:33-0:43:37:**  So this is something that I think is incredibly important.  
**0:43:37-0:43:48:**  So we're starting to basically then observing all these new things that are happening and  
**0:43:48-0:43:50:**  seeing how they develop.  
**0:43:50-0:43:58:**  And then suddenly you drill the next crop and obviously they start looking out of the  
**0:43:58-0:44:02:**  window and they're starting to think about it and asking questions about it.  
**0:44:02-0:44:04:**  And I get more and more interested.  
**0:44:04-0:44:10:**  And that's a way of basically drawing them in step by step.  
**0:44:10-0:44:14:**  So yeah, has it had a huge influence on the farming business as such?  
**0:44:14-0:44:17:**  As of now, not in that sense.  
**0:44:17-0:44:23:**  Has it had a huge influence on us as a group of people trying to change something?  
**0:44:23-0:44:24:**  Yes, for sure.  
**0:44:24-0:44:29:**  I mean, during Corona time, we had started with four volunteers.  
**0:44:29-0:44:36:**  In the end, we were like a group of 20, 30 volunteers who planted 10,000 trees together,  
**0:44:36-0:44:44:**  10,000 potatoes with their hands, 100,000 tree seeds, 300 blackberries.  
**0:44:44-0:44:51:**  So this has had an incredible influence on us and it was an incredible energy and it  
**0:44:51-0:44:58:**  was an incredible feeling for all of us, planting all these things and doing all of this together.  
**0:44:58-0:45:05:**  But on, let's say, numbers-based analysis, looking at the farm as a whole with the 1,000  
**0:45:05-0:45:07:**  hectares, it's still minor.  
**0:45:07-0:45:17:**  So it's really, as in agriculture, I guess always, it's not just one level, it's not  
**0:45:17-0:45:19:**  just one answer.  
**0:45:19-0:45:23:**  It is multifaceted, so to say.  
**0:45:23-0:45:24:**  I love your approach.  
**0:45:24-0:45:30:**  I mean, I think it's just great how you were able to stay humble and really take this approach  
**0:45:30-0:45:35:**  on the long run of including people rather than excluding them.  
**0:45:35-0:45:38:**  You get credit for that and it's really great.  
**0:45:38-0:45:40:**  Do you expect that things will shift?  
**0:45:40-0:45:47:**  I expect that they already have to a certain extent, but do you think that things will  
**0:45:47-0:45:53:**  shift once maybe the system is mature and the farmers you work with can actually observe  
**0:45:53-0:45:56:**  tangibly results?  
**0:45:56-0:45:59:**  Is that, do you think, will be the tipping point in acceptability and in shifting the  
**0:45:59-0:46:00:**  whole business?  
**0:46:00-0:46:03:**  Yes, for sure.  
**0:46:03-0:46:09:**  I think when it comes to the farmers that we work with here or when it comes to visitors  
**0:46:09-0:46:17:**  from any sort of space, what for me is something that I see every day is that we have to make,  
**0:46:17-0:46:21:**  and I think this is our task that goes far beyond what we are doing and what you guys  
**0:46:21-0:46:26:**  are doing, what we all have to do is make these kinds of new ways experienceable.  
**0:46:26-0:46:31:**  Because you can tell people like, don't do this or you cannot do this or do this, but  
**0:46:31-0:46:40:**  if you haven't really experienced it, you will never take it as a whole, like in a spiritual  
**0:46:40-0:46:42:**  sense part of you.  
**0:46:42-0:46:46:**  And this is, I think, is really, really important.  
**0:46:46-0:46:55:**  And now, going back to our farm, if basically I'm looking now at our old agriculture employees  
**0:46:55-0:47:01:**  or farmers, they all have their own potatoes in their backyard.  
**0:47:01-0:47:06:**  And on the centropic field, which we haven't yet talked so much about, we planted 21 different  
**0:47:06-0:47:14:**  potatoes, basically just to cover weeds that usually would come up in that space.  
**0:47:14-0:47:16:**  So we used them in a sort of natural way.  
**0:47:16-0:47:22:**  Now we have been joking about the potatoes for quite a while with the farmers because  
**0:47:22-0:47:29:**  those potatoes are just lying on top of the soil with the mulch on top of it.  
**0:47:29-0:47:39:**  And our farmers, they usually do it the old way where you would use any kind of things  
**0:47:39-0:47:48:**  to make them grow fast and strong and then they look at it and they don't say anything.  
**0:47:48-0:47:50:**  They're like, yeah, whatever.  
**0:47:50-0:47:57:**  And then the next time you say, hey guys, let's have a look at the potatoes or we do  
**0:47:57-0:47:58:**  the hay in between.  
**0:47:58-0:48:03:**  Let's say we had alfalfa between the centropic fields and we did some silage there.  
**0:48:03-0:48:08:**  So the guys were driving away the silage and they were standing over the rows and looking  
**0:48:08-0:48:12:**  at it and they're like, okay, well, it's interesting.  
**0:48:12-0:48:15:**  They look quite good.  
**0:48:15-0:48:17:**  So that process starts.  
**0:48:17-0:48:24:**  And now we've already started to say, well, in mid August or late August, we will have  
**0:48:24-0:48:30:**  a day where we'll go to each one at home and look at their potatoes and we'll make a little  
**0:48:30-0:48:34:**  test and say, okay, we have like a square meter and we'll get all the potatoes of this  
**0:48:34-0:48:37:**  guy and then we'll get all the potatoes of him.  
**0:48:37-0:48:40:**  And then we'll go on the centropic field and get all the potatoes there.  
**0:48:40-0:48:54:**  And so basically it's like, you're trying to build a common language, I guess it is.  
**0:48:54-0:48:59:**  You have to build a connection somehow through language or through something that everyone  
**0:48:59-0:49:01:**  kind of knows.  
**0:49:01-0:49:07:**  And that is then something again, from there it can grow and it can accelerate in all different  
**0:49:07-0:49:12:**  aspects or different directions because once they accept that, hey, this new way of having  
**0:49:12-0:49:18:**  potatoes just lying on the soil and you have murch on top and they are beautifully clean  
**0:49:18-0:49:25:**  and they have hardly any problems with pests and there's no worms or whatever, I might  
**0:49:25-0:49:26:**  try this.  
**0:49:26-0:49:30:**  Then suddenly they'll respect this new way of thinking and they'll be like, oh, I also  
**0:49:30-0:49:35:**  saw that you plant a blackberry together with a birch tree.  
**0:49:35-0:49:36:**  Why do you do that?  
**0:49:36-0:49:41:**  And then suddenly you're talking about a centropic agriculture system where if you would have  
**0:49:41-0:49:46:**  started without having that introduction through the potatoes, they'll be like, what?  
**0:49:46-0:49:47:**  No way.  
**0:49:47-0:49:51:**  You cannot plant together a blackberry with a birch tree.  
**0:49:51-0:49:52:**  That doesn't work.  
**0:49:52-0:50:03:**  So I think it's really important to find those areas where you can start building that relation  
**0:50:03-0:50:09:**  and that connection within the people and through the systems, I guess.  
**0:50:09-0:50:20:**  What we wanted to ask you about is how integrating agroforestry at the moment only represents  
**0:50:20-0:50:26:**  a small amount of the land that you have, but how do you see agroforestry having an  
**0:50:26-0:50:31:**  impact on the business strategy of the farm in the medium term or long term, or maybe  
**0:50:31-0:50:32:**  even now?  
**0:50:32-0:50:40:**  How is it at the moment impacting that aspect?  
**0:50:40-0:50:47:**  I think there's also a couple of considerations.  
**0:50:47-0:50:59:**  So first of all, we are in a time where, at least in my bubble or in my understanding,  
**0:50:59-0:51:08:**  we have a weird situation where we have people and especially eating people, not eating people,  
**0:51:08-0:51:10:**  but consumers, let's say.  
**0:51:10-0:51:13:**  I don't like that word, but consumers.  
**0:51:13-0:51:19:**  They are not happy with the way products are being produced.  
**0:51:19-0:51:24:**  They are looking for other products that have a different ethos when it comes to animal  
**0:51:24-0:51:31:**  welfare, when it comes to ecological side effects, when it comes to health attitudes.  
**0:51:31-0:51:36:**  At the same time, we have the farmers who don't feel hurt.  
**0:51:36-0:51:37:**  They are unhappy.  
**0:51:37-0:51:41:**  If they are ecological or if they're conventional, it doesn't matter.  
**0:51:41-0:51:45:**  Both of them go on the street and say, hey, guys, what's going on?  
**0:51:45-0:51:53:**  We have a system that is strategically making farmers less and less independent, but forcing  
**0:51:53-0:52:01:**  them into corners of having huge depth and corners of being more and more specialized  
**0:52:01-0:52:06:**  for markets that become more and more anonymous, which I think is exactly the wrong direction.  
**0:52:06-0:52:10:**  I think we have to look at it in a completely different direction.  
**0:52:10-0:52:17:**  I think agroforestry in that sense has a very dominant and very direct way of establishing  
**0:52:17-0:52:25:**  a connection, of establishing a communication approach with farmers, with consumers, with  
**0:52:25-0:52:32:**  politicians, with all of us who want a world worth living with regards to climate change,  
**0:52:32-0:52:38:**  with regards to food, tasty food, with regards to all those things that we can change through  
**0:52:38-0:52:41:**  the question of land use because it's a new aspect.  
**0:52:41-0:52:43:**  There is no heaviness to it.  
**0:52:43-0:52:47:**  It's not about nitrate leaching or whatever.  
**0:52:47-0:52:49:**  It's not always negative, but it's a positive.  
**0:52:49-0:52:52:**  It's a positive narrative.  
**0:52:52-0:52:56:**  Although there are some unknowns and although not everything will work in the sense that  
**0:52:56-0:53:03:**  we hope it or we believe it to work, it is a new way and it is a new possibility of approaching  
**0:53:03-0:53:06:**  what we have neglected for such a long time.  
**0:53:06-0:53:12:**  This is something that I think is incredibly valuable.  
**0:53:12-0:53:17:**  I guess business-wise you would call it marketing.  
**0:53:17-0:53:24:**  It's a marketing approach, not limiting it to that, definitely not, but it is a way of  
**0:53:24-0:53:28:**  starting a new communication with potential customers.  
**0:53:28-0:53:32:**  That is something that I see very predominant as of immediately.  
**0:53:32-0:53:41:**  Then in the mid-term or in a sooner time period, I think there's just incredible value through  
**0:53:41-0:53:44:**  the tree lines themselves.  
**0:53:44-0:53:50:**  Depending on your machine of equipment, on your set of values, on your entry or your  
**0:53:50-0:53:58:**  let's say the distance to markets, depending on your age group, depending on your risk  
**0:53:58-0:54:04:**  profile and depending on all these different aspects that make us as farmers so incredibly  
**0:54:04-0:54:12:**  heterogeneous, you can decide on a couple of products or things that you enjoy, that  
**0:54:12-0:54:19:**  you like to eat, that you like to see, that you think fit well into your context that  
**0:54:19-0:54:21:**  you can start investing in.  
**0:54:21-0:54:34:**  I mean, if you agree on let's say the assumption that we have to look at more perennial species  
**0:54:34-0:54:44:**  in order to combat or better equipped for climate exchanges, then for me it's a matter  
**0:54:44-0:54:51:**  of not investing into equipment, machinery, the latest tractor, the latest camera, whatever  
**0:54:51-0:54:59:**  drone, but invest your money into the soil, into trees, into animals and into people.  
**0:54:59-0:55:07:**  I think that's really also my economic rationale behind it.  
**0:55:07-0:55:14:**  From a sort of an economic side, yeah, I mean, it just very much depends on your system.  
**0:55:14-0:55:20:**  We will have potatoes to be sold starting in a couple of weeks.  
**0:55:20-0:55:22:**  We've planted them beginning of the year.  
**0:55:22-0:55:27:**  That's a nigroforestry system that has done us really good because it prevented the weeds  
**0:55:27-0:55:28:**  from growing.  
**0:55:28-0:55:37:**  But now we have 21 colorful, amazing tasting potato species that have high nutritional  
**0:55:37-0:55:39:**  value that we will sell.  
**0:55:39-0:55:40:**  We'll have a story to tell.  
**0:55:40-0:55:42:**  We'll have people to draw in.  
**0:55:42-0:55:46:**  Maybe we'll even have a weekend where they come and they harvest it themselves.  
**0:55:46-0:55:52:**  So that's an immediate economic benefit.  
**0:55:52-0:55:55:**  Then we have other trees and other bushes that will grow into it.  
**0:55:55-0:55:57:**  So next year we'll have a lot of blackcurrant already.  
**0:55:57-0:56:00:**  The year after we will have this and so forth.  
**0:56:00-0:56:02:**  So it's a moving target.  
**0:56:02-0:56:04:**  It's growing.  
**0:56:04-0:56:13:**  And I today say that in four or five years' time, our estate will be dominated by, let's  
**0:56:13-0:56:18:**  say, plums and sea buckthorn.  
**0:56:18-0:56:22:**  No, I can't guarantee that.  
**0:56:22-0:56:28:**  This is why we have planted 1,900 different species of trees and of bushes to find out  
**0:56:28-0:56:30:**  what can actually cope in our surrounding.  
**0:56:30-0:56:35:**  But I think what I'm sure there will come a time where we'll be like, right, we're going  
**0:56:35-0:56:43:**  to say these three, four, five, maybe a bit more species are the ones that we're going  
**0:56:43-0:56:47:**  to have a strong focus on.  
**0:56:47-0:56:52:**  So yeah, again, I'm sorry that this repeats over and over.  
**0:56:52-0:56:55:**  But it's just not something that I...  
**0:56:55-0:57:02:**  It's too complex or too versatile to limit to one simple answer, I guess.  
**0:57:02-0:57:07:**  Yeah, but it's good that you're talking about this diversity because that's also something  
**0:57:07-0:57:13:**  we wanted to understand is how does diversity fit in your sales strategy?  
**0:57:13-0:57:19:**  Because something we had in our experience in Maazee is that ecology drives you towards  
**0:57:19-0:57:22:**  diversifying and putting so much diversity of crops.  
**0:57:22-0:57:29:**  But then that still requires you selling those crops and it's not always easy to market diversity.  
**0:57:29-0:57:34:**  So I was wondering in your context and your market, for example, you have a grain operation  
**0:57:34-0:57:38:**  on the side, which I assume is sold wholesale.  
**0:57:38-0:57:42:**  And then on the side now you have some potatoes to sell or you might have some berries next  
**0:57:42-0:57:43:**  year.  
**0:57:43-0:57:44:**  Is that going to fit easily?  
**0:57:44-0:57:47:**  Is that a challenge as well to find these new customers?  
**0:57:47-0:57:49:**  How does that interact with the existing business?  
**0:57:49-0:57:56:**  Yeah, I mean, ask me that again in a couple of months.  
**0:57:56-0:58:00:**  This is something that we all are quite wary of, I guess.  
**0:58:00-0:58:04:**  I don't have the answer as of now.  
**0:58:04-0:58:11:**  Maybe I'm naive or stupid, but I strongly believe that there is a market for those products,  
**0:58:11-0:58:18:**  even if it's a small number compared to wholesale grain, a couple of hundreds of tons.  
**0:58:18-0:58:27:**  But yeah, it is probably naive, but I think that, I mean, we have Berlin just in front  
**0:58:27-0:58:30:**  of our door.  
**0:58:30-0:58:36:**  I think if you do a nice packaging, if you can in easy, short words, explain some of  
**0:58:36-0:58:47:**  the story behind the product, I think it's going to be a possibility of selling those.  
**0:58:47-0:58:56:**  I mean, for sure, if you think about our centropic agroforestry systems where the number of trees  
**0:58:56-0:59:02:**  and bushes and plants and everything that is combined there is just incredibly high,  
**0:59:02-0:59:05:**  I don't think that our future will look exactly like this.  
**0:59:05-0:59:15:**  I think from what we learn, we will skip a couple of components of the plant systems  
**0:59:15-0:59:26:**  to basically make it mechanically harvestable and cared for, and then also be able to actually  
**0:59:26-0:59:29:**  scale those operations.  
**0:59:29-0:59:37:**  So, what you're saying to understand is use diversity to test out and let maybe the ecosystem  
**0:59:37-0:59:43:**  express the possibilities and then you select and then you upscale and you go through this  
**0:59:43-0:59:48:**  kind of curve of diversity and then maybe lower it again.  
**0:59:48-0:59:49:**  That's interesting.  
**0:59:49-0:59:52:**  I'm just saying that because I hadn't thought about it that way and I think it's a really  
**0:59:52-0:59:54:**  interesting way of looking at it.  
**0:59:54-0:59:56:**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**0:59:56-1:00:05:**  I mean, the thing is the environment here has such a huge influence that it's never  
**1:00:05-1:00:08:**  going to be the market that decides what is growing here.  
**1:00:08-1:00:15:**  It's always going to be the ecosystem itself that will decide what can or can't grow here.  
**1:00:15-1:00:23:**  And then it is up to us to understand what it is and how we can combine that into a beautiful  
**1:00:23-1:00:26:**  system and a beautiful product.  
**1:00:26-1:00:30:**  And then it's our task to sell the product.  
**1:00:30-1:00:36:**  But I don't think that it's useful to start at a product then look how can I fit that  
**1:00:36-1:00:37:**  into the ecosystem.  
**1:00:37-1:00:42:**  I think that's exactly what we have been doing for years and years trying to control because  
**1:00:42-1:00:45:**  of whatever reason we have.  
**1:00:45-1:00:55:**  But I want to understand how can I best let nature do her job here and what products can  
**1:00:55-1:00:56:**  come out of it.  
**1:00:56-1:01:00:**  And then I'll try to make the best out of the products.  
**1:01:00-1:01:05:**  If I find out that this is not the approach and that no one wants to buy the stuff that  
**1:01:05-1:01:10:**  will come out of a beautiful agroforestry system here on our farm, well then I'll just  
**1:01:10-1:01:12:**  have to eat it all myself.  
**1:01:12-1:01:16:**  But I don't believe it will.  
**1:01:16-1:01:26:**  I think people if they have trust to our brand, if they have trust in what we do and if they  
**1:01:26-1:01:31:**  like what we do, I think they will buy the product as far as well as long as it tastes  
**1:01:31-1:01:32:**  nice.  
**1:01:32-1:01:36:**  That's for sure.  
**1:01:36-1:01:45:**  But yes, I just naively strongly believe that it is the ecosystem that needs to show us  
**1:01:45-1:01:50:**  first what we can and then we'll have to take it from there.  
**1:01:50-1:01:57:**  So I think talking agroforestry, talking regenerative agriculture, I think this will be something  
**1:01:57-1:02:07:**  that at some point in time will be economically more viable than let's say a classical agricultural  
**1:02:07-1:02:15:**  grain dominant business because it shows and it manifests that there's people who take  
**1:02:15-1:02:21:**  a risk and that they do that for the nature.  
**1:02:21-1:02:31:**  And the people who try a new way because they believe that it will help them to work more  
**1:02:31-1:02:36:**  with nature or basically get ready for different climate.  
**1:02:36-1:02:46:**  I think it is going to be at some point in time something that shows that you're thinking  
**1:02:46-1:02:54:**  beyond just yield per hectare or you're thinking beyond just profitability per hectare.  
**1:02:54-1:02:56:**  It's also about the ecosystem.  
**1:02:56-1:03:02:**  It's also about the people who live in the countryside.  
**1:03:02-1:03:08:**  It's also about trying to involve more than just or thinking more than just primary production.  
**1:03:08-1:03:13:**  And I think that will have an effect on your profitability as a whole.  
**1:03:13-1:03:14:**  I believe so, yes.  
**1:03:14-1:03:19:**  And part of that could be because you have more and more people coming that want to experience  
**1:03:19-1:03:20:**  it and they want to look at it.  
**1:03:20-1:03:27:**  And while they're there, you just give them a jar of honey that you can market for 10  
**1:03:27-1:03:30:**  euros a piece and not five euros a piece.  
**1:03:30-1:03:35:**  So yes, I think it will have an influence for sure.  
**1:03:35-1:03:42:**  That touches upon this big topic in regenerative agriculture of the value that's produced in  
**1:03:42-1:03:47:**  these regenerative farms goes much beyond the economic one.  
**1:03:47-1:03:51:**  And so being able to capture that is the challenge, isn't it?  
**1:03:51-1:03:57:**  So being able to, for example, as you're saying, communicate it to your customers and through  
**1:03:57-1:04:03:**  that possibly having more customers or an easier way to value your product, maybe even  
**1:04:03-1:04:05:**  a bit higher prices.  
**1:04:05-1:04:10:**  People would be willing to pay a bit more for a product that they know is doing good  
**1:04:10-1:04:14:**  for the soil, doing good for the planet.  
**1:04:14-1:04:20:**  And so this is a big topic in regenerative agriculture and in agroforestry, in the agroforestry  
**1:04:20-1:04:22:**  space as well.  
**1:04:22-1:04:28:**  But I want to go back to one thing you said just now, because I think this is something  
**1:04:28-1:04:29:**  completely neglected.  
**1:04:29-1:04:36:**  And I think this is growing on me more and more each day.  
**1:04:36-1:04:43:**  And this is about the concept or the understanding or basically the observation of myself that  
**1:04:43-1:04:52:**  agriculture for all of us has or is just many times incredibly challenging because of a  
**1:04:52-1:04:53:**  very variety of things.  
**1:04:53-1:05:00:**  And the tendency of seeing the bad things and the negative and the risks and all of  
**1:05:00-1:05:06:**  those kind of developments is always quite high because they're so predominant.  
**1:05:06-1:05:16:**  And that, depending on how you are as an individual, that could lead to you being unhappy or you  
**1:05:16-1:05:21:**  could be getting slightly depressed or you could be worried about the future.  
**1:05:21-1:05:28:**  And all of these feelings are not a feeling of joy and the feeling of happiness and the  
**1:05:28-1:05:32:**  feeling of freedom and a feeling of life.  
**1:05:32-1:05:38:**  And I think this is what we have to come back to though, because being in agriculture, being  
**1:05:38-1:05:42:**  a farmer, this is the, I think, in my view, I'm speaking for myself now, it's the best  
**1:05:42-1:05:44:**  thing that I could possibly do in my life.  
**1:05:44-1:05:47:**  And it's the most beautiful task.  
**1:05:47-1:05:57:**  And if we don't, or we haven't learned to think about ourselves in that context anymore.  
**1:05:57-1:06:01:**  So it's always about just producing and production and this and that.  
**1:06:01-1:06:07:**  But it's also about the life that you have and the life that you form around yourself  
**1:06:07-1:06:11:**  with your family, with the people that work with you and for you and their families and  
**1:06:11-1:06:13:**  so forth.  
**1:06:13-1:06:19:**  And in that kind of difficult time or in those kinds of difficult times, having your eyes  
**1:06:19-1:06:29:**  on topics such as transforming the operation towards more regenerative methods, starting  
**1:06:29-1:06:34:**  a small market garden, even if it's just for the employees and yourself, starting your  
**1:06:34-1:06:40:**  first agroforestry system, getting a couple of cows, suddenly you can turn your energy  
**1:06:40-1:06:46:**  and your focus onto something that you can actually do and that will from day one bring  
**1:06:46-1:06:53:**  joy to your life, from day one will bring color and ideas and new ways and new thinking  
**1:06:53-1:06:57:**  and things to talk about and to think about into your life.  
**1:06:57-1:07:03:**  And this is something that I've found so incredibly valuable because all the other problems and  
**1:07:03-1:07:08:**  risks and all that's, I mean, we all know that, but it bores me to think about it and  
**1:07:08-1:07:10:**  it doesn't make my life more happy.  
**1:07:10-1:07:16:**  But focusing on new ways and new approaches and just getting started from a quality perspective  
**1:07:16-1:07:25:**  or the quality of life perspective, it's unmeasurable as a value component.  
**1:07:25-1:07:27:**  Yeah, sorry.  
**1:07:27-1:07:35:**  I just need to get that off my heart because I think it's such a huge part of it.  
**1:07:35-1:07:36:**  I wanted to add to that.  
**1:07:36-1:07:44:**  This is also what's going to help people get back into farming from the cities.  
**1:07:44-1:07:51:**  But also it's known that farmers, for example, have one of the highest suicide rates in terms  
**1:07:51-1:07:52:**  of profession.  
**1:07:52-1:07:58:**  This is clearly a vital aspect to make farming work for everybody.  
**1:07:58-1:08:02:**  It's not just about the economics, which is, you know what, we've been questioning quite  
**1:08:02-1:08:10:**  a lot here on this aspect, but it's about so much more that we need to do in order for  
**1:08:10-1:08:11:**  farms to be successful.  
**1:08:11-1:08:13:**  Yeah, totally.  
**1:08:13-1:08:17:**  I mean, this is exactly what I'm trying to say.  
**1:08:17-1:08:24:**  It's just so much more than all of the economics that are obviously driving all the decisions  
**1:08:24-1:08:28:**  and that are a huge part and you have to take care of it.  
**1:08:28-1:08:34:**  But in the end of the day, it's about humans and it's about life and it's about designing  
**1:08:34-1:08:40:**  and living a life that your kids at some point want to take over and like to get into and  
**1:08:40-1:08:45:**  young people from interdisciplinary fields around you just as much.  
**1:08:45-1:08:46:**  Yeah.  
**1:08:46-1:08:53:**  And agroforestry feels, sorry about that, but agroforestry feels right as well on that  
**1:08:53-1:08:54:**  aspect.  
**1:08:54-1:08:55:**  It's about regenerating.  
**1:08:55-1:08:56:**  It's about reforesting.  
**1:08:56-1:09:00:**  It's about complexifying and integrating.  
**1:09:00-1:09:06:**  And so this is something where agroforestry, in my opinion, has a lot of power and a lot  
**1:09:06-1:09:07:**  of potential.  
**1:09:07-1:09:08:**  Absolutely.  
**1:09:08-1:09:15:**  And I mean, one thing that also drives me is just the imagination of what it will look  
**1:09:15-1:09:19:**  like in X, Y, Z years.  
**1:09:19-1:09:23:**  Having stand on our, like if you come to our, and obviously I'll invite you all to come  
**1:09:23-1:09:31:**  and meet us and see us, but if you stand here on the field during this time of the year  
**1:09:31-1:09:41:**  after the harvest, maybe the sun is burning down with 30, 35 degrees Celsius and it is  
**1:09:41-1:09:46:**  just incredibly lifeless, I guess, in that kind of moment.  
**1:09:46-1:09:52:**  But now if you mentioned to have tree lines that go through those kinds of fields and  
**1:09:52-1:09:55:**  they're still green and lush and you have like you come in the morning, you have all  
**1:09:55-1:09:58:**  the birds going up and it's like a huge diversity.  
**1:09:58-1:10:06:**  It's just, you know, it has so many compelling aspects of creating life rather than deciding  
**1:10:06-1:10:10:**  on what you have to destroy or what you have to fight when you get up in the morning.  
**1:10:10-1:10:15:**  So I'm completely with you on that one.  
**1:10:15-1:10:19:**  We wanted to understand as well how, for example, implementing these agroforestry systems, did  
**1:10:19-1:10:26:**  it require some serious investments in terms of machines or other types of infrastructure?  
**1:10:26-1:10:34:**  This is often a big, let's say, limit for farmers, something that they don't often have  
**1:10:34-1:10:39:**  so much cash and new investments can be a bit scary.  
**1:10:39-1:10:45:**  So could you talk to us a bit about what that was like on your farm?  
**1:10:45-1:10:54:**  So I mean, we have, as far as the planting itself is concerned, we actually have a cooperation  
**1:10:54-1:10:59:**  with a company from Switzerland, which is called Renostech, that they have developed  
**1:10:59-1:11:11:**  a planting, I guess, a machine that is preparing the tree lines in the sense that you have  
**1:11:11-1:11:21:**  a subsoiler underneath in combination with a milling machine, so to say.  
**1:11:21-1:11:26:**  It's in one machine, basically from the subsoiler, it brings up the earth and then it will pick  
**1:11:26-1:11:34:**  up from the milling and it will be made very nice and soft on a depth of, let's say, 40,  
**1:11:34-1:11:35:**  45 centimeters.  
**1:11:35-1:11:44:**  So it's below a potential, let's say, compaction area through the plow or through whatever  
**1:11:44-1:11:50:**  you have in order to basically establish the trees or establish a bedding for the trees  
**1:11:50-1:11:55:**  to go in deep from the early time or from the beginning.  
**1:11:55-1:12:01:**  And also the whole planting of the trees themselves is incredibly good to do because obviously  
**1:12:01-1:12:06:**  the whole soil is very soft and you can basically do it with your hands.  
**1:12:06-1:12:16:**  So this is a machine that we've invested in and it costs you around 6,000, 7,000 euros,  
**1:12:16-1:12:27:**  which when it comes to planting trees is an investment that makes a lot of sense, right?  
**1:12:27-1:12:33:**  I sometimes compare it with people buying furniture for their house.  
**1:12:33-1:12:38:**  They spend a lot of money for things that you see, but on a mattress, which you spend  
**1:12:38-1:12:42:**  half of your life, you don't spend as much money.  
**1:12:42-1:12:45:**  This is the same with the tree planting.  
**1:12:45-1:12:51:**  So invest when it comes to establishing the trees.  
**1:12:51-1:12:55:**  This is what I think is important.  
**1:12:55-1:12:59:**  And this machine is something that's just incredibly helpful because it gets the best  
**1:12:59-1:13:03:**  sort of start for the trees that you possibly can.  
**1:13:03-1:13:10:**  Apart from that, let's say protection obviously is a very big one depending on what kind of  
**1:13:10-1:13:13:**  species and trees you're going for.  
**1:13:13-1:13:20:**  But we have built fences around the ones that are carrying all the sort of fruit and nut  
**1:13:20-1:13:30:**  trees because without you, you would have huge problems with all sorts of animals that  
**1:13:30-1:13:33:**  love those trees as well.  
**1:13:33-1:13:39:**  When it comes to the trees themselves, depending on what kind of trees, I mean, we have to  
**1:13:39-1:13:41:**  buy ecological varieties.  
**1:13:41-1:13:47:**  So if you think about a walnut, it's somewhere between 35 and 55 euros.  
**1:13:47-1:13:51:**  Same with, let's say, plum trees and so forth.  
**1:13:51-1:14:01:**  When it comes to basically trees from out of the forest, classical leaf trees, so to  
**1:14:01-1:14:09:**  say, that are there for other purposes, then we're talking a couple of cents or maybe a  
**1:14:09-1:14:11:**  euro or whatever.  
**1:14:11-1:14:17:**  So the investment of the trees in my view is always not the big one.  
**1:14:17-1:14:19:**  It's more sort of the protection.  
**1:14:19-1:14:21:**  It's the whole planting process.  
**1:14:21-1:14:26:**  And specifically, it's the weeding process in between.  
**1:14:26-1:14:35:**  So I think when it comes to planting a system, what you have to take care or you have to  
**1:14:35-1:14:44:**  take account of is basically weeding it four, five, six times a year, at least for the first  
**1:14:44-1:14:45:**  four to five years.  
**1:14:45-1:14:49:**  Depending on the system, obviously, that you choose.  
**1:14:49-1:14:51:**  If it's a classical agroforestry system, then for sure.  
**1:14:51-1:14:56:**  If it's a syntropic system, which is comprised of actually not having any space in between  
**1:14:56-1:15:01:**  the rows because it's all being planted, then you don't have to do that that much.  
**1:15:01-1:15:03:**  But you have other things to do.  
**1:15:03-1:15:12:**  So I think when it comes to the whole investment as such, one aspect that is incredibly important  
**1:15:12-1:15:18:**  and I think that makes it most difficult, especially in the beginning, is the sort of  
**1:15:18-1:15:20:**  the timing of things.  
**1:15:20-1:15:22:**  Because the chances are you've planted the trees.  
**1:15:22-1:15:25:**  Well, okay, now you're done.  
**1:15:25-1:15:32:**  But then comes basically May, June, July, those months you're having to do hay, you're  
**1:15:32-1:15:35:**  having to do harvest, that starts.  
**1:15:35-1:15:40:**  And this is the time where you at the same time have to basically go into the tree lines  
**1:15:40-1:15:48:**  and weed them, make sure that they always have enough space to breathe and to have not  
**1:15:48-1:15:51:**  too high competition when it comes to water.  
**1:15:51-1:15:57:**  And if you don't have someone that is specifically looking after the tree lines, the chances  
**1:15:57-1:16:00:**  is you will completely neglect it during those months.  
**1:16:00-1:16:19:**  And then for that year, they will have already been quite, let's say, suppressed, I guess.  
**1:16:19-1:16:26:**  I was just going to ask you to finalize this ecological understanding of the system.  
**1:16:26-1:16:36:**  You've mentioned chickens, you've mentioned also beef, well, cows, and I was wondering  
**1:16:36-1:16:40:**  maybe even if you're not integrating them yet, how you see that integration happening.  
**1:16:40-1:16:43:**  Is that something that you're actively thinking about?  
**1:16:43-1:16:44:**  And yeah.  
**1:16:44-1:16:46:**  Yeah, for sure.  
**1:16:46-1:16:58:**  I mean, we are currently planning a system, a centropic system that we will plant beginning,  
**1:16:58-1:17:04:**  let's say October, November of this year on six hectares where we're going to plant or  
**1:17:04-1:17:10:**  we're going to have a focus on, one second.  
**1:17:10-1:17:17:**  So like basic like leaf bushes.  
**1:17:17-1:17:22:**  Don't know the perfect.  
**1:17:22-1:17:24:**  Is it like tree hay, for example?  
**1:17:24-1:17:26:**  Say that again.  
**1:17:26-1:17:30:**  Are you talking more about tree hay, for example?  
**1:17:30-1:17:34:**  Hay that or feed that is produced on bushes or trees?  
**1:17:34-1:17:36:**  Yeah, pretty much.  
**1:17:36-1:17:37:**  Exactly.  
**1:17:37-1:17:42:**  So we have a variety of seven, eight different varieties or different kinds there that we  
**1:17:42-1:17:50:**  will plant in rows with a different like four meter 40 from row to row.  
**1:17:50-1:17:51:**  And this is going to be for the cows.  
**1:17:51-1:18:00:**  So it's basically a pasture system, a climate adapted pasture system.  
**1:18:00-1:18:07:**  And we'll combine that with the production of, one second.  
**1:18:07-1:18:14:**  Yeah, there's no translation for that.  
**1:18:14-1:18:21:**  With two trees that are incredibly valuable in terms of wood as well as walnut trees.  
**1:18:21-1:18:26:**  So this is a system that is specifically designed for a pasture model if you want.  
**1:18:26-1:18:30:**  So there's the first integration, which is directly linked and the agroforestry system  
**1:18:30-1:18:37:**  that we've done beginning of this year with all the sort of wild berries is a system that  
**1:18:37-1:18:41:**  we've already integrated basically with the chickens.  
**1:18:41-1:18:48:**  So it's always thought in a process that basically they have to live from each other with each  
**1:18:48-1:18:50:**  other.  
**1:18:50-1:18:57:**  And I mean, on a sort of visionary note, I guess my idea of having a couple of fields  
**1:18:57-1:19:03:**  in a system where we have a nurse crop and a cover crop and grain, then we harvest it  
**1:19:03-1:19:07:**  for the grain for the production for humans.  
**1:19:07-1:19:12:**  Then you have the nurse crop growing, again, protecting the soil.  
**1:19:12-1:19:15:**  So photosynthesis, bringing back the nutrients in the soil, then we'll have the cows come  
**1:19:15-1:19:20:**  and harvest or basically graze through it with holistic grazing.  
**1:19:20-1:19:25:**  We can sell the meat of the cows, then we'll have the chickens that come, we can sell the  
**1:19:25-1:19:27:**  eggs and the chickens.  
**1:19:27-1:19:32:**  And then basically in autumn we will come and have the sort of the tree lines, the centropic  
**1:19:32-1:19:38:**  agroforestry lines, and they all can start harvesting different nuts and different berries  
**1:19:38-1:19:39:**  and whatnot.  
**1:19:39-1:19:46:**  So there is this idea of obviously bringing it all together, but again, we try to stay  
**1:19:46-1:19:55:**  as humble as we can because we'll see how it goes and how the weather develops and how  
**1:19:55-1:20:02:**  our learnings will be in which directions and take it from there.  
**1:20:02-1:20:11:**  But yes, of course we want to at some point integrate all of it into one more or less  
**1:20:11-1:20:15:**  adaptable system, I guess.  
**1:20:15-1:20:22:**  Basically given your background in finance and investment, which must have brought about  
**1:20:22-1:20:30:**  some very interesting or very interesting perspective to farming as well, in your opinion,  
**1:20:30-1:20:37:**  what's some of the most interesting ways in funding agroforestry systems?  
**1:20:37-1:20:42:**  Well two things come to mind immediately.  
**1:20:42-1:20:48:**  The Perennial Fund, everything the guys over at Mad Agriculture, Phil Teller, for example,  
**1:20:48-1:20:52:**  are doing I think is incredible work.  
**1:20:52-1:20:59:**  Basically saying that if we want to help farmers go through that transitional phase, that basically  
**1:20:59-1:21:07:**  mentioned early on as well, that we need to find a new way of a financial product because  
**1:21:07-1:21:12:**  just giving more loans and loans is not going to help quite the opposite.  
**1:21:12-1:21:18:**  I think we have to find ways where farmers become less dependent.  
**1:21:18-1:21:26:**  So basically saying if a farmer is open to go and change the system, let's say from conventional  
**1:21:26-1:21:32:**  to ecological or to regenerative or in which direction ever, but basically more with regards  
**1:21:32-1:21:39:**  to soil health and biodiversity and so forth, then we need to offer him capital through  
**1:21:39-1:21:44:**  that phase, but without basically asking for annual repayments.  
**1:21:44-1:21:50:**  Because if there's a drought, he or she can't repay, then we need to take account of that  
**1:21:50-1:21:51:**  somehow.  
**1:21:51-1:21:58:**  I think the system that the guys at Mad Agriculture developed in a sense where you're not obliged  
**1:21:58-1:22:04:**  to pay back in times where you're not earning a profit, but only when you do earn a profit  
**1:22:04-1:22:09:**  and then you have like a revenue split model until a certain time, I think that is a beautiful  
**1:22:09-1:22:13:**  model and this is something that I hope that will become mainstream at some point in time.  
**1:22:13-1:22:21:**  I think progressive industry leaders such as Trilladoes or GLS or Umbelbank in Germany  
**1:22:21-1:22:24:**  are also thinking that direction.  
**1:22:24-1:22:27:**  This is one thing and then there's another example also.  
**1:22:27-1:22:32:**  We had him also on the podcast with Kun together.  
**1:22:32-1:22:41:**  It's Thomas Ripple and the work that he is doing, basically leveraging a community around  
**1:22:41-1:22:47:**  a farm and people around a farm that believe in the kind of work that the farmers are doing  
**1:22:47-1:22:54:**  and making, let's say, a cooperative model where they can kind of invest into the business,  
**1:22:54-1:23:02:**  thereby enabling the farmer to use that money to actually change his or her operation in  
**1:23:02-1:23:10:**  a sense that it becomes more sustainable and towards the way of regenerative agriculture  
**1:23:10-1:23:14:**  in some sort of sense as well.  
**1:23:14-1:23:21:**  Basically overcoming that problem of land ownership, which is often obviously only for  
**1:23:21-1:23:26:**  people who are either investors or have some other forms of money, but we really need to  
**1:23:26-1:23:33:**  try or we really need to put it in the hands of people that do it for the love of the land  
**1:23:33-1:23:39:**  and then do it because of the right reasons, not as a speculating object, but wanting to  
**1:23:39-1:23:45:**  grow healthy food and thereby making sure that you have healthy land.  
**1:23:45-1:23:49:**  These are two very different models coming from different directions, but I think they  
**1:23:49-1:23:55:**  are just two examples of so many incredible and brilliant models of rethinking also the  
**1:23:55-1:23:57:**  financials when it comes to farming.  
**1:23:57-1:24:01:**  I think there's going to be huge developments in years to come and I really hope so because  
**1:24:01-1:24:05:**  this is one of the most desperately needed ones.  
**1:24:05-1:24:12:**  But if I could choose, I would make Thomas and Phil, those guys, they have to be known  
**1:24:12-1:24:18:**  everywhere basically and governments should be thinking about putting more focus and action  
**1:24:18-1:24:21:**  into that direction as well.  
**1:24:21-1:24:23:**  Great.  
**1:24:23-1:24:34:**  So, well, I think we'll be taking things to an end now and just as a few final questions,  
**1:24:34-1:24:38:**  what would you personally want to hear about in this podcast?  
**1:24:38-1:24:42:**  What are the topics that you're excited to discover?  
**1:24:42-1:24:44:**  What would you want us to ask about?  
**1:24:44-1:24:52:**  And this is the moment where you get to give us some input on the following episodes.  
**1:24:52-1:24:57:**  I mean, first of all, I have to say thank you so much for inviting me and it's been  
**1:24:57-1:25:04:**  great talking to you, although it's always a bit of an unpleasant situation if you're  
**1:25:04-1:25:07:**  the one who has to answer because you only hear yourself talking.  
**1:25:07-1:25:08:**  So sorry for that.  
**1:25:08-1:25:13:**  I would have loved to hear more about you guys.  
**1:25:13-1:25:18:**  And I mean, I think it's a very personal, it's a personal question.  
**1:25:18-1:25:25:**  So I don't know what anyone or everyone likes or wants to hear.  
**1:25:25-1:25:33:**  If you ask me individually, I always love to hear the whys.  
**1:25:33-1:25:35:**  Why did people start?  
**1:25:35-1:25:37:**  Why what's their motivation?  
**1:25:37-1:25:39:**  How do they see that?  
**1:25:39-1:25:46:**  I mean, having been sort of a numbers guy, I am not intrigued by those that much anymore.  
**1:25:46-1:25:53:**  Of course, I calculate, I've got my spreadsheets and whatever, but I think the personal stories,  
**1:25:53-1:26:00:**  the emotions, the things that happened to them that have made them change, the understandings  
**1:26:00-1:26:06:**  that have gained, the people that they have met, the reasons why they are starting a process  
**1:26:06-1:26:11:**  that is to do with uncertainty and a certain risk.  
**1:26:11-1:26:18:**  I think that's always, for me, something that is most interesting or most inspiring because  
**1:26:18-1:26:24:**  you can somehow relate or you can't, or at least it helps you reflect upon your own life  
**1:26:24-1:26:30:**  and see how maybe you've had situations similar to that, or if you are in a situation, you  
**1:26:30-1:26:32:**  can relate to that somehow.  
**1:26:32-1:26:39:**  So I love these kinds of personal stories because in the end of the day, it's what drives  
**1:26:39-1:26:42:**  us.  
**1:26:42-1:26:45:**  So yeah, more about the whys.  
**1:26:45-1:26:46:**  Yeah, thanks for that input.  
**1:26:46-1:26:49:**  We'll make sure we explore that with everyone.  
**1:26:49-1:26:53:**  Although it's really hard to do everything in an hour, an hour and a half it goes so  
**1:26:53-1:26:55:**  quickly as we discovered today.  
**1:26:55-1:27:00:**  So Benedict, what would be the one piece of advice, most important piece of advice you  
**1:27:00-1:27:06:**  would give to somebody that's starting out a similar project to what you have started  
**1:27:06-1:27:11:**  out there on your farm?  
**1:27:11-1:27:12:**  Just start.  
**1:27:12-1:27:16:**  I think that's just get going.  
**1:27:16-1:27:20:**  You can ask all the questions, you can read all the books and at the end of the day, you  
**1:27:20-1:27:26:**  just have to get going, like buy a tree planted or buy a couple of trees planted, buy the  
**1:27:26-1:27:32:**  first animal, get someone to come to stay at your farm and do it with you.  
**1:27:32-1:27:40:**  I think that's, we always say, and I nicked this expression from Phil Taylor also, but  
**1:27:40-1:27:41:**  we built the ship by sailing.  
**1:27:41-1:27:47:**  I think that's really what we do and this is part of the journey because this is what  
**1:27:47-1:27:52:**  Aaron Sketch always says, 5% is the start, planting the first couple of trees and then  
**1:27:52-1:27:55:**  is the real start, is only starting then.  
**1:27:55-1:28:01:**  95% is observing and adapting and observing and adapting.  
**1:28:01-1:28:06:**  So if you don't start, you can't start observing, I guess.  
**1:28:06-1:28:12:**  So I guess, yeah, just get going as soon as you can and then take it from there.  
**1:28:12-1:28:17:**  Yeah, great advice and yeah, thanks for that.  
**1:28:17-1:28:22:**  Maybe the last thing, can you tell our listeners where they can find out more about your farm  
**1:28:22-1:28:26:**  and your website and all of that?  
**1:28:26-1:28:27:**  Sure.  
**1:28:27-1:28:36:**  I mean, we're not that strong on the whole website and I'm slowly starting to start like  
**1:28:36-1:28:38:**  an Instagram live.  
**1:28:38-1:28:47:**  So whoever wants to follow us, we are on Instagram with my name, Benedict Bozel.  
**1:28:47-1:28:50:**  And we'll start to be more active on that front.  
**1:28:50-1:28:57:**  And then we have our website, which is gutenbozel.org.  
**1:28:57-1:29:04:**  And yeah, I mean, there's some info you can get or some way to have connection to us,  
**1:29:04-1:29:11:**  but we'll hope to become a bit more active on those kinds of fronts.  
**1:29:11-1:29:14:**  But one step after another, I guess.  
**1:29:14-1:29:17:**  Yeah, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.  
**1:29:17-1:29:22:**  Yeah, thank you guys so much for having me and thank you for all the incredible work  
**1:29:22-1:29:30:**  you're doing and looking forward to check in soon or later again and see what's what  
**1:29:30-1:29:32:**  and where you guys are at.  
**1:29:32-1:29:35:**  And yeah, thank you so much for having me.  
**1:29:35-1:29:41:**  It definitely seems like we'll need to dig into some more details in a later episode  
**1:29:41-1:29:42:**  at some time.  
**1:29:42-1:29:46:**  There's a lot of things that we wanted to talk about and that we didn't manage and  
**1:29:46-1:29:50:**  that are important to share with your work.  
**1:29:50-1:29:55:**  For sure, anytime and obviously you're both more than welcome to anytime to comment  
**1:29:55-1:29:59:**  and visit the farm as soon as that's feasible and possible again.  
**1:29:59-1:30:01:**  Thank you for listening to this episode.  
**1:30:01-1:30:06:**  Below, you'll find all the useful links to find out more about Benedict's farm.  
**1:30:06-1:30:10:**  Also, we'd love to have your feedback so we can make the show better.  
**1:30:10-1:30:13:**  And most important of all, include your questions.  
**1:30:13-1:30:42:**  So reach out to us through our website and we hope to see you there.

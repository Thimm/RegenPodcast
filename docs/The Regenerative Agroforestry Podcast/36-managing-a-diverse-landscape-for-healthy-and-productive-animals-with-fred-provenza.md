### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Wed, 09 Mar 2022 13:04:36)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:47:**  Hi and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:49:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:49-0:00:52:**  Today I have the pleasure of welcoming Fred Provenza.  
**0:00:52-0:00:56:**  He's a researcher in behavioral ecology who has carried out fascinating research on the  
**0:00:56-0:01:02:**  nutritional wisdom of animals on their ability to select their diets and learn.  
**0:01:02-0:01:07:**  We wanted to explore with him the importance of shrubs and trees and the nutrition of grazing  
**0:01:07-0:01:12:**  animals, but in reality the conversation went well beyond that into why and how to increase  
**0:01:12-0:01:15:**  diversity in the herd's diets.  
**0:01:15-0:01:19:**  This of course relates to agroforestry, but also goes beyond as we explore in-depth elements  
**0:01:19-0:01:21:**  of animal behavior.  
**0:01:21-0:01:23:**  I really hope you enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:23-0:01:25:**  Hi Fred and welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:25-0:01:28:**  Hello, it's wonderful to be here with you.  
**0:01:28-0:01:34:**  Yeah, we're so excited about this interview and having you with us today.  
**0:01:34-0:01:39:**  To kick things off, maybe you could give us a bit of an overview of your background and  
**0:01:39-0:01:42:**  the path that led you to researching agriculture.  
**0:01:42-0:01:44:**  Sure, happy to do that.  
**0:01:44-0:01:50:**  I think from when I was a young child, I was absolutely fascinated with anything that was  
**0:01:50-0:01:57:**  alive, insects, birds, fishes, mammals, and lived in a small town in central Colorado  
**0:01:57-0:02:01:**  in the Rocky Mountains.  
**0:02:01-0:02:04:**  Just loved everything outdoors, kinds of things like that.  
**0:02:04-0:02:13:**  So that led naturally then to when it came time to go to college to a program in wildlife  
**0:02:13-0:02:14:**  biology.  
**0:02:14-0:02:21:**  And I absolutely loved everything I was learning about plants, about animals, about ecology.  
**0:02:21-0:02:27:**  But at the same time, I kind of by coincidence ended up working on a ranch.  
**0:02:27-0:02:32:**  I had a friend who asked me if I wanted to earn some extra money during my senior year  
**0:02:32-0:02:33:**  in high school.  
**0:02:33-0:02:34:**  And I said, sure.  
**0:02:34-0:02:40:**  He said, we can haul hay, bales of hay out at Henry DeLuca's ranch in the evenings and  
**0:02:40-0:02:41:**  on the weekends.  
**0:02:41-0:02:46:**  And I said, okay, I was working at a greenhouse during my years in high school.  
**0:02:46-0:02:48:**  I said, that sounds great.  
**0:02:48-0:02:50:**  And I absolutely loved it.  
**0:02:50-0:02:53:**  Loved everything about being out there on the ranch.  
**0:02:53-0:02:54:**  I didn't know anything about it.  
**0:02:54-0:02:58:**  Was no ranch experience, but it was just the right thing for me.  
**0:02:58-0:02:59:**  It was clear.  
**0:02:59-0:03:00:**  I loved that.  
**0:03:00-0:03:06:**  And that combination of what I was learning hands on working with animals, goats and sheep  
**0:03:06-0:03:13:**  and cows and pigs and chickens and everything and growing crops out on the ranch really  
**0:03:13-0:03:20:**  complemented what I was learning in wildlife biology, even though that might seem like  
**0:03:20-0:03:21:**  it wouldn't.  
**0:03:21-0:03:23:**  It did perfectly, the ecology and plants.  
**0:03:23-0:03:27:**  And so, yeah, so that led me then.  
**0:03:27-0:03:33:**  You know, when I finished my schooling at Colorado State University, and as I say, I  
**0:03:33-0:03:38:**  loved that, I thought, oh, I've had enough schooling for one lifetime.  
**0:03:38-0:03:42:**  Not enough learning, but enough.  
**0:03:42-0:03:44:**  And so I didn't know what I wanted to do, though.  
**0:03:44-0:03:46:**  I knew I wouldn't be in wildlife biology.  
**0:03:46-0:03:47:**  Don't know how.  
**0:03:47-0:03:50:**  I just knew that I wouldn't be in that.  
**0:03:50-0:03:52:**  So I thought, well, I'll go back to the ranch.  
**0:03:52-0:03:54:**  Henry needs somebody to run the place.  
**0:03:54-0:03:56:**  He wants somebody to run it full time.  
**0:03:56-0:03:58:**  So I thought, I'll go back there.  
**0:03:58-0:04:03:**  Something will occur to me somewhere along the line.  
**0:04:03-0:04:05:**  So I was out there running the place.  
**0:04:05-0:04:09:**  Somehow, I don't know why, I thought research might be interesting.  
**0:04:09-0:04:15:**  I also was, I realized how much I loved learning about things.  
**0:04:15-0:04:17:**  And I was missing that, actually.  
**0:04:17-0:04:25:**  Just that kind of stimulation you get from the classes, I was really missing that.  
**0:04:25-0:04:29:**  And I think that was in part got me thinking, well, if you want to go back to school, which  
**0:04:29-0:04:34:**  you said you'd never do, maybe research would be interesting.  
**0:04:34-0:04:40:**  So I started applying to different places and ended up going back to graduate school,  
**0:04:40-0:04:41:**  actually at a place.  
**0:04:41-0:04:45:**  I didn't get into graduate school so easily.  
**0:04:45-0:04:48:**  I didn't have the best grades in the world.  
**0:04:48-0:04:53:**  They weren't bad, but they weren't the best.  
**0:04:53-0:04:59:**  But I ended up at a place, and I'll save the stories on that, though they're interesting,  
**0:04:59-0:05:05:**  that makes you reflect back on how events you don't even pay attention to at the time  
**0:05:05-0:05:11:**  end up being key factors in the composition of kind of a consistent plot of your life.  
**0:05:11-0:05:14:**  When you look back, then you think, oh, wow, that was amazing.  
**0:05:14-0:05:20:**  But anyway, I ended up at a place where the researchers were thinking about how can we  
**0:05:20-0:05:25:**  use domestic animals to improve habitat for wildlife.  
**0:05:25-0:05:30:**  And I thought that's perfect for me because there was always this controversy.  
**0:05:30-0:05:35:**  Wildlife people didn't like domestic livestock so much because they saw them as degrading  
**0:05:35-0:05:36:**  landscapes.  
**0:05:36-0:05:43:**  And here in this country, in the early part of the last century, there was a lot of overgrazing  
**0:05:43-0:05:47:**  that occurred that degraded the landscapes.  
**0:05:47-0:05:55:**  And so wildlife people saw livestock as absolutely negative influences.  
**0:05:55-0:06:00:**  And yet here's this program that for many years, for 50 years or so, had been showing  
**0:06:00-0:06:07:**  how we can use domestic animals to improve habitat through grazing for wildlife species.  
**0:06:07-0:06:13:**  So I thought that works really well for me, and I was fortunate to get in.  
**0:06:13-0:06:19:**  You sometimes think that it's not chance-like at all as you go through life.  
**0:06:19-0:06:20:**  There's kind of a path for you.  
**0:06:20-0:06:25:**  If you follow your heart, then you get on that path, it's kind of like it was always  
**0:06:25-0:06:27:**  there in a way.  
**0:06:27-0:06:28:**  Anyway, so that's long-winded.  
**0:06:28-0:06:31:**  That's some background, though.  
**0:06:31-0:06:35:**  And then I got there to Utah State University.  
**0:06:35-0:06:38:**  My wife and I thought, well, we'll go there for two years.  
**0:06:38-0:06:41:**  You can get your master's degree, then we go somewhere else.  
**0:06:41-0:06:47:**  Well, I found I absolutely loved research.  
**0:06:47-0:06:48:**  Just couldn't.  
**0:06:48-0:06:50:**  It was amazing.  
**0:06:50-0:06:53:**  And so ended up going on for a PhD.  
**0:06:53-0:06:59:**  And then during that whole process, I was working with goats and just watching what  
**0:06:59-0:07:05:**  they were doing like I'd done on the ranch and just amazed by their behaviors, doing  
**0:07:05-0:07:10:**  things that you think, why are they...  
**0:07:10-0:07:14:**  You know, we were using goats to manipulate this landscape dominated by a shrub.  
**0:07:14-0:07:19:**  We're going to talk about shrubs and trees, dominated by a shrub called black brush.  
**0:07:19-0:07:25:**  And the idea was we'll have the goats browse that shrub during the winter and that stimulates  
**0:07:25-0:07:29:**  all this new growth on the shrubs.  
**0:07:29-0:07:36:**  That would be better food for wildlife species like mule deer and bighorn sheep, as well  
**0:07:36-0:07:38:**  as for cattle during the winter.  
**0:07:38-0:07:42:**  So we're using them to improve this landscape.  
**0:07:42-0:07:46:**  But come to find out the goats didn't want to eat the new growth in the black brush,  
**0:07:46-0:07:52:**  even though we know on shrubs and trees, new twigs are more nutritious.  
**0:07:52-0:07:55:**  They're higher in energy and protein, in minerals and so forth.  
**0:07:55-0:07:57:**  The goats didn't want to eat it.  
**0:07:57-0:08:03:**  So these kind of things were and other things were happening.  
**0:08:03-0:08:06:**  It just was like fascinating.  
**0:08:06-0:08:09:**  To think about that and then to study it.  
**0:08:09-0:08:13:**  And so that led to 40, 35, 40 years of research.  
**0:08:13-0:08:20:**  And now we're talking, I'm retired for 13 years and it went quickly.  
**0:08:20-0:08:22:**  It went quickly.  
**0:08:22-0:08:28:**  And you know, you've had a long career, you've written several books and many papers.  
**0:08:28-0:08:34:**  And what were like the key themes or findings that you focused on throughout your academic  
**0:08:34-0:08:36:**  career?  
**0:08:36-0:08:41:**  I'd say there are three broad areas that we focused on.  
**0:08:41-0:08:48:**  One was, and they all related in a sense to the nutritional wisdom of the body of creatures,  
**0:08:48-0:08:56:**  that there's this wisdom that's in all creatures, including humans, that knows what your body  
**0:08:56-0:08:57:**  needs.  
**0:08:57-0:09:02:**  The cells and organ systems, including the microbiome, know what we need if we allow  
**0:09:02-0:09:04:**  that to take place.  
**0:09:04-0:09:07:**  So there's three facets to that.  
**0:09:07-0:09:13:**  One is getting some help early in life from mother.  
**0:09:13-0:09:21:**  So we did a lot of studies of how what mother's eating and where she's going, how that influences  
**0:09:21-0:09:24:**  food and habitat selection behaviors by her offspring.  
**0:09:24-0:09:31:**  To me, that was so interesting to look at that, how that starts even in the womb.  
**0:09:31-0:09:37:**  A fetus is already starting to learn about the foods mother's eating from the flavors  
**0:09:37-0:09:43:**  of her foods that get into the amniotic fluid after birth.  
**0:09:43-0:09:47:**  Then flavors in mother's milk are cues to what she's eating.  
**0:09:47-0:09:51:**  And then mother as a model, what and what not to eat, where and where not to go, what's  
**0:09:51-0:09:53:**  a predator, what's not a predator.  
**0:09:53-0:10:02:**  So that was one huge area that was so amazing just to see that learning that takes place.  
**0:10:02-0:10:09:**  And then to follow that with work that we did with bison, looking at how many, many  
**0:10:09-0:10:15:**  species including livestock, if you let them to their own devices, they end up in families.  
**0:10:15-0:10:20:**  They live in extended families, which is amazing too.  
**0:10:20-0:10:24:**  We were very much that way historically.  
**0:10:24-0:10:29:**  Indigenous peoples lived in extended families and clans and tribes.  
**0:10:29-0:10:31:**  So they are a model in that sense.  
**0:10:31-0:10:33:**  So that was one area.  
**0:10:33-0:10:41:**  Another area that was totally shocking to me are these, you know, if I were to ask you  
**0:10:41-0:10:45:**  why you like a particular food, you would tell me because it tastes good.  
**0:10:45-0:10:49:**  If I like you, I don't like one because it tastes bad to me.  
**0:10:49-0:10:51:**  And that's certainly our experience.  
**0:10:51-0:10:58:**  But what we learned was that cells and organ systems, including the microbiome, are changing  
**0:10:58-0:11:02:**  our liking for the flavor of food as a function of their needs.  
**0:11:02-0:11:07:**  So this whole area of what we call metabolically mediated feedback relationships, big bunch  
**0:11:07-0:11:08:**  of words there.  
**0:11:08-0:11:14:**  How many, this idea that feedback is what's altering our liking for the flavor of food.  
**0:11:14-0:11:23:**  But we did so much work and it's so familiar to me now that I don't, I forget.  
**0:11:23-0:11:31:**  But I'm corresponding with a lady in China who read this book that I wrote, Nourishment.  
**0:11:31-0:11:36:**  And she always had issues with diet and eating.  
**0:11:36-0:11:41:**  And until she said the book really helped her so much.  
**0:11:41-0:11:45:**  And she said, there was a, I asked her, well, what about it?  
**0:11:45-0:11:47:**  What really caught your attention?  
**0:11:47-0:11:51:**  And she put a quote in there and it had to do with these feedbacks.  
**0:11:51-0:11:58:**  And I was saying, when we did the first experiments of that, it absolutely stopped me in my tracks  
**0:11:58-0:12:02:**  to think that we could feed something to an animal.  
**0:12:02-0:12:07:**  And then we infuse something directly into their guts, into their stomach or into their  
**0:12:07-0:12:08:**  bloodstream.  
**0:12:08-0:12:11:**  And it totally changes their liking for the flavor of the food.  
**0:12:11-0:12:18:**  It's like, wow, that's, cause then it gets you thinking, well, palatability is more than  
**0:12:18-0:12:19:**  a matter of taste.  
**0:12:19-0:12:25:**  It involves these feedbacks and these feedbacks are coming from cells and organ systems of  
**0:12:25-0:12:28:**  the body, each with their own needs.  
**0:12:28-0:12:33:**  You know, nowadays people are very much focused on the microbiome and for good reason, the  
**0:12:33-0:12:39:**  microbiome has an influence on what we want to eat, that they need to meet their needs.  
**0:12:39-0:12:40:**  Right?  
**0:12:40-0:12:45:**  And so, but you have to then realize that same for the lungs, same for the heart, same  
**0:12:45-0:12:49:**  for the liver, same for the brain, they each have needs.  
**0:12:49-0:12:51:**  And it's a democracy in a sense.  
**0:12:51-0:12:57:**  All these cells and organ systems are sending signals to our palette that are changing our  
**0:12:57-0:12:59:**  liking for the flavor of food.  
**0:12:59-0:13:01:**  That's not very scientifically said.  
**0:13:01-0:13:07:**  And there's a huge amount of research that looks at hormones, neurotransmitters, peptides,  
**0:13:07-0:13:18:**  all these are the signals that cells and organs give to change our liking as a function of  
**0:13:18-0:13:19:**  their need.  
**0:13:19-0:13:26:**  I'm thinking now of a book, A Change of Heart, it's called by Claire Sylvia.  
**0:13:26-0:13:32:**  And she's talking in there about what happened after she got heart and lung transplant.  
**0:13:32-0:13:36:**  And it's really an amazing story about everything that happened to her.  
**0:13:36-0:13:40:**  Here's this 40 year old woman that gets the heart and lungs as she came to find out of  
**0:13:40-0:13:44:**  this young man, this young guy in his twenties.  
**0:13:44-0:13:49:**  And you think, like the medical people thought at the time, the heart is just a pump, the  
**0:13:49-0:13:52:**  lungs are just machines for getting oxygen, right?  
**0:13:52-0:13:54:**  No, they're not.  
**0:13:54-0:14:00:**  You bring all this, all this quote baggage of this young male into your body.  
**0:14:00-0:14:03:**  And it was amazing the things that she experienced.  
**0:14:03-0:14:12:**  You know, you don't realize that there makes you think what is this person I call me.  
**0:14:12-0:14:19:**  But as relates to our topic, what she found was that her food preferences changed.  
**0:14:19-0:14:20:**  They broadened out.  
**0:14:20-0:14:26:**  She still kept her quote her own preferences, but she started to like all these things that  
**0:14:26-0:14:30:**  Tim, her donor, liked that she never liked before.  
**0:14:30-0:14:35:**  You know, so anyway, so that was the second huge area, this whole metabolically mediated  
**0:14:35-0:14:40:**  feedbacks and how they alter liking as a function of need.  
**0:14:40-0:14:48:**  The third part was simply to look at the availability of alternative foods and to realize the fundamental  
**0:14:48-0:14:52:**  importance of biodiversity.  
**0:14:52-0:14:59:**  You know, as a young student, an undergraduate student, ecology was a fairly young discipline  
**0:14:59-0:15:00:**  in those days.  
**0:15:00-0:15:03:**  But even then, they were talking about the importance of biodiversity.  
**0:15:03-0:15:08:**  And it leads us to your topic too, or a topic we want to talk about, the importance of shrubs  
**0:15:08-0:15:10:**  and trees and systems.  
**0:15:10-0:15:14:**  Well, that diversity is fundamentally important.  
**0:15:14-0:15:20:**  You know, you can have a great mother, you can have all these metabolic feedbacks, but  
**0:15:20-0:15:24:**  if you don't have any decent alternatives, the body isn't going to be able to meet its  
**0:15:24-0:15:25:**  needs.  
**0:15:25-0:15:31:**  So this whole notion of biodiversity and the importance of biodiversity and plant diversity  
**0:15:31-0:15:37:**  and became a third part of this work.  
**0:15:37-0:15:41:**  And I'm still actually involved, not hands on now.  
**0:15:41-0:15:48:**  I do it as a cheerleader through other young people, but studying the linkages of how plant  
**0:15:48-0:15:56:**  diversity influences the health of soils, influences the health of plants themselves,  
**0:15:56-0:16:01:**  influences the health of livestock by allowing them not only to meet their needs for nutrients,  
**0:16:01-0:16:04:**  but also to self-medicate when they need that.  
**0:16:04-0:16:14:**  And then how when animals have the ability to select from a nice variety of foods, the  
**0:16:14-0:16:21:**  vital chemical and biochemical and health promoting characteristics of their meat and  
**0:16:21-0:16:25:**  milk and cheese is greatly enhanced for humans.  
**0:16:25-0:16:34:**  So those are the three areas I would say that was wonderful to explore during the time here  
**0:16:34-0:16:38:**  on this planet doing research.  
**0:16:38-0:16:44:**  And now it's still wonderful to be a cheerleader and supporter for young people who are launching  
**0:16:44-0:16:46:**  into their careers.  
**0:16:46-0:16:51:**  And over the years, you make contacts with lots of people that you can facilitate them  
**0:16:51-0:16:56:**  getting grants, getting research going on so forth.  
**0:16:56-0:16:58:**  Yeah, that's amazing.  
**0:16:58-0:17:01:**  And it's such vast topics.  
**0:17:01-0:17:07:**  But I think maybe we discussed this earlier and you mentioned you had done some work with  
**0:17:07-0:17:13:**  some farmers to try and bring these insights into some practice and something practical  
**0:17:13-0:17:15:**  and useful for farmers.  
**0:17:15-0:17:20:**  Maybe you could give us a few examples of this so our listeners really make the bridge  
**0:17:20-0:17:25:**  and grasp how everything you talked about before really translates into practice.  
**0:17:25-0:17:32:**  Well let's start one example that comes to my mind right now of when we were working  
**0:17:32-0:17:37:**  with farmers and ranchers and doing research as a part of that.  
**0:17:37-0:17:48:**  You know in the intermountain West, this region in the western United States, there back in  
**0:17:48-0:17:56:**  the day, people planted on the rangelands there planted a grass species called crested  
**0:17:56-0:17:57:**  wheatgrass.  
**0:17:57-0:17:59:**  It's native to Eurasia.  
**0:17:59-0:18:05:**  And the reason they did that, it provided great forage during the springtime for livestock  
**0:18:05-0:18:07:**  basically and for wildlife as well.  
**0:18:07-0:18:10:**  It greens up early in the spring.  
**0:18:10-0:18:14:**  It produces lots of forage, highly nutritious.  
**0:18:14-0:18:24:**  And so many of the rangelands were simply seeded to monocultures of crested wheatgrass.  
**0:18:24-0:18:30:**  So it did provide forage but in terms of diversity of forage and diversity of forage seasonally  
**0:18:30-0:18:31:**  it wasn't the best.  
**0:18:31-0:18:37:**  So one of the projects we were involved with was thinking about can we interseed crested  
**0:18:37-0:18:40:**  wheatgrass with different species of shrubs.  
**0:18:40-0:18:44:**  Takes us to the woody plants, shrubs and trees.  
**0:18:44-0:18:50:**  So we were involved in this study and working with livestock producers that knew the importance  
**0:18:50-0:18:51:**  so why shrubs?  
**0:18:51-0:18:59:**  So during the wintertime, crested wheatgrass matures and it has a lot of standing dead  
**0:18:59-0:19:05:**  material that's a great source of energy but it's not a great source of protein.  
**0:19:05-0:19:10:**  And we knew that if we were to interseed shrubs into those crested wheatgrass stands we could  
**0:19:10-0:19:16:**  provide a source of protein for wild and domestic animals.  
**0:19:16-0:19:23:**  In addition, when it snows, we used to get lots of good snows in those areas, the shrubs  
**0:19:23-0:19:26:**  are available above the snow line.  
**0:19:26-0:19:34:**  And so we did work with people along those lines and just showing the importance of shrubs  
**0:19:34-0:19:45:**  and lots of practical work was done simply to realize the importance of plant diversity  
**0:19:45-0:19:51:**  and then to interseed stands of crested wheatgrass with different shrub species.  
**0:19:51-0:19:57:**  It was very interesting some of the work that we did where in the early studies we had I  
**0:19:57-0:20:01:**  think like eight different species of shrubs that we'd interseeded.  
**0:20:01-0:20:08:**  Palatable good nutritious species they varied in their chemistries, they all were great  
**0:20:08-0:20:12:**  sources of protein and minerals and so forth.  
**0:20:12-0:20:17:**  But you know the secondary chemistries of those varied some might be high in terpenes  
**0:20:17-0:20:23:**  plants like sagebrush for instance over here and you'll have sagebrushes in your part of  
**0:20:23-0:20:24:**  the world too.  
**0:20:24-0:20:28:**  Others might be high in tannins like mountain mahogany and so forth.  
**0:20:28-0:20:35:**  I'm giving specific ones but the idea is different shrubs have different chemistries and those  
**0:20:35-0:20:38:**  chemistries are important for animals.  
**0:20:38-0:20:45:**  What was amazing to us was to watch the we were working with sheep in one set of studies  
**0:20:45-0:20:49:**  and we turned them out in the morning and they had patterns that they would eat.  
**0:20:49-0:20:53:**  For breakfast they wanted sagebrush.  
**0:20:53-0:21:00:**  You know and sagebrush a lot of people here in our part of the country think of as not  
**0:21:00-0:21:06:**  such a great forage.  
**0:21:06-0:21:09:**  Over the years we've tried to get rid of sagebrush.  
**0:21:09-0:21:16:**  It was our grazing management practices that led landscapes to be dominated by sagebrush.  
**0:21:16-0:21:21:**  Sagebrush the chemistry of the the terpene concentrations in sagebrush vary throughout  
**0:21:21-0:21:27:**  the year as you go into the spring and summer and fall very high concentrations of terpenes  
**0:21:27-0:21:32:**  in sagebrush to the to the point where animals don't want to eat it much.  
**0:21:32-0:21:38:**  And so a lot of times we would have lots of animals on landscapes during the spring and  
**0:21:38-0:21:43:**  early summer and they would over graze the grasses and forage which led to domination  
**0:21:43-0:21:45:**  by sagebrush across the landscape.  
**0:21:45-0:21:49:**  So now people are in a battle with sagebrush we want to get rid of it.  
**0:21:49-0:21:55:**  But during the late fall and winter terpene concentrations drop in sagebrush becomes really  
**0:21:55-0:21:56:**  wonderful forage.  
**0:21:56-0:22:00:**  So here are these sheep we turn them out first thing in the morning eight different shrubs  
**0:22:00-0:22:06:**  that they could select from they want sagebrush so they go and they eat sagebrush first thing  
**0:22:06-0:22:08:**  in the morning it was amazing.  
**0:22:08-0:22:13:**  And then during the day they would forage on different shrubs and in the evening they  
**0:22:13-0:22:19:**  always wanted to to eat this this shrub called four-wing saltbrush.  
**0:22:19-0:22:26:**  And so all that was was showing us that they the animals very much appreciated the shrubs  
**0:22:26-0:22:30:**  but they they appreciated them in different ways at different times of the day.  
**0:22:30-0:22:36:**  It was a whole eye-opener to me back back 45 years ago to watch just watch the animals  
**0:22:36-0:22:37:**  do that.  
**0:22:37-0:22:44:**  And then they would also dig through the snow to eat some of the the crested wheatgrass  
**0:22:44-0:22:45:**  that was there.  
**0:22:45-0:22:51:**  And so it was practical you know those became very practical kinds of things that were linking  
**0:22:51-0:22:57:**  the importance of biodiversity, plant diversity, diversity of different chemistry of species,  
**0:22:57-0:23:01:**  these feedbacks these metabolically mediated feedbacks.  
**0:23:01-0:23:08:**  And then you know as part of a broader system mother and mother teaching her offspring and  
**0:23:08-0:23:09:**  so forth.  
**0:23:09-0:23:19:**  So yeah we did many many many many studies with with with shrubs and the value of shrubs  
**0:23:19-0:23:26:**  as as forages for animals in this case during the winter time no question about it but but  
**0:23:26-0:23:29:**  year-round the shrubs are are valuable.  
**0:23:29-0:23:35:**  And then one can think too not only for animals above ground but also that diversity of plants  
**0:23:35-0:23:41:**  is incredibly important for the health of of life below ground.  
**0:23:41-0:23:47:**  That diversity is is enabling diversity of different species and the health of those  
**0:23:47-0:23:52:**  species below ground just like it's happening above ground as well.  
**0:23:52-0:23:59:**  Are there any specific elements and shrubs or trees that make them particularly interesting  
**0:23:59-0:24:05:**  or is it just that they contribute to biodiversity and to the wide like range of possible biochemicals  
**0:24:05-0:24:09:**  that an animal can ingest?  
**0:24:09-0:24:14:**  You know it's a really good question that you ask related to that and I think historically  
**0:24:14-0:24:21:**  what what we all would have said from from work that that classical nutrition work that  
**0:24:21-0:24:29:**  we were all involved in is that shrubs provide a great source of protein to to animals during  
**0:24:29-0:24:35:**  during the during the fall and winter time in our particular case here.  
**0:24:35-0:24:43:**  You know the microorganisms in the rumen need sources of not only energy which dormant grasses  
**0:24:43-0:24:48:**  and forbs would provide but they also need a source of protein to meet their needs in  
**0:24:48-0:24:53:**  order to keep their populations healthy and that's whether it's in the soil you know same  
**0:24:53-0:24:59:**  thing in the soil as it is in in the guts of the animals and so that would have been  
**0:24:59-0:25:09:**  the classical answer is that the shrubs provide a great source of protein to to provide that  
**0:25:09-0:25:15:**  nutrient for for rumen microorganisms and then when you have a grass shrub range you  
**0:25:15-0:25:20:**  have a wonderful mix of energy and protein complementarity there.  
**0:25:20-0:25:26:**  So historically and certainly today that that's every bit as true as it was back in the day  
**0:25:26-0:25:33:**  but I think now as we've gone on more and more and more to realize the tremendous complexity  
**0:25:33-0:25:39:**  of plant species when it comes to their chemistries that it's not only these primary compounds  
**0:25:39-0:25:45:**  like energy and protein and minerals and so forth but this diverse array of secondary  
**0:25:45-0:25:51:**  compounds that come under these broad classes like phenolics and terpenes and alkaloids  
**0:25:51-0:25:55:**  and then to appreciate that when an animal is eating a meal it's introducing tens of  
**0:25:55-0:26:01:**  thousands of these compounds into its body so it becomes incredibly complex to the point  
**0:26:01-0:26:08:**  where you know you can study parts of it facets of it and we did certainly but then I think  
**0:26:08-0:26:14:**  you reach a point and this is because I'm maybe getting old now I don't have the energy  
**0:26:14-0:26:18:**  to study but you also reach a point where you realize there's no way you're going to  
**0:26:18-0:26:24:**  study a hundred thousand compounds that an animal ate in an hour long meal you know it's  
**0:26:24-0:26:31:**  just you can't study that in the ways that we used to study but you come to appreciate  
**0:26:31-0:26:36:**  that the body knows the cells and organ systems of the body know how to work with all those  
**0:26:36-0:26:42:**  compounds and that it's when you have it enable animals to have a diverse array of different  
**0:26:42-0:26:50:**  species that then animals can pick and choose from different ones and then that exposes  
**0:26:50-0:26:56:**  at a cellular level you know if you think of cells as like a fish in a stream the cells  
**0:26:56-0:27:03:**  are foraging on what's in the capillaries and these compounds if there's a diverse array  
**0:27:03-0:27:07:**  of them in the capillaries then each cell can pick and choose and I think that's very  
**0:27:07-0:27:15:**  real that's not just just by analogy that that's real and so who knows what some cell  
**0:27:15-0:27:21:**  in your liver needs you know but if that cell has access to that then it promotes itself  
**0:27:21-0:27:30:**  to prevent cancer in humans and so forth we know all these these compounds have have anti-cancer  
**0:27:30-0:27:36:**  kind of of influence and so you know we did lots of studies of food selection just it  
**0:27:36-0:27:41:**  may sound funny but how interesting it was to follow animals around and see what they're  
**0:27:41-0:27:48:**  eating during the day and if you follow any one animal you find maybe three to five plants  
**0:27:48-0:27:54:**  are the bulk of the diet but it'll eat another 50-75 plants during the day a bite here a  
**0:27:54-0:28:02:**  bite there we never used to think at least me and I think most of my friends too we never  
**0:28:02-0:28:10:**  gave too much value to that 50 to 75 other plants that were nibbled on here and there  
**0:28:10-0:28:14:**  throughout the day because we figured the three to five are what are making up the bulk  
**0:28:14-0:28:21:**  of the diet which is contributing to the productivity of the animal but now I don't think that at  
**0:28:21-0:28:29:**  all I think it's all of those plants are mattering in terms of the health of the animal above  
**0:28:29-0:28:35:**  ground and then then one comes to realize as well that every one of those animals is  
**0:28:35-0:28:43:**  unique it's it's it's different one from the next we know for for we human beings we can  
**0:28:43-0:28:51:**  be identified by our fingerprint a bloodhound can track us by by our odors if we look inside  
**0:28:51-0:28:57:**  how our bodies are built the the form and how they function every one of us is absolutely  
**0:28:57-0:29:05:**  unique and so what we need is is different and that's the same for for those animals  
**0:29:05-0:29:12:**  as we showed in study after study after study and so it becomes amazingly complex to to  
**0:29:12-0:29:18:**  try to make a quote recommendation like we often do for people of what people should  
**0:29:18-0:29:24:**  be be eating when you come to appreciate that every individual is different then you come  
**0:29:24-0:29:32:**  to realize that's another reason why diversity diversity enables individuality right that  
**0:29:32-0:29:37:**  that becomes a key key part of that and so back again to one of the things that that  
**0:29:37-0:29:43:**  I know we want to explore what why have shrubs and trees in a system you know they they enhance  
**0:29:43-0:29:49:**  diversity for creatures below ground above ground and not only the livestock but all  
**0:29:49-0:29:56:**  the all the the different wildlife species that are on the on the planet yeah I think  
**0:29:56-0:30:01:**  that's fascinating and also like you've you've explored these themes in much more detail  
**0:30:01-0:30:05:**  in other in other talks so I encourage our listeners to also go and click on the links  
**0:30:05-0:30:11:**  I'll include underneath to to kind of get a further understanding of these of these  
**0:30:11-0:30:16:**  insights but you know I thought today we could take the conversation and try and take it  
**0:30:16-0:30:20:**  from where it usually ends which is okay well diversity is amazing and it can have this  
**0:30:20-0:30:25:**  huge potential for animal health and even for productivity but you know I'm a farmer  
**0:30:25-0:30:31:**  and I hear and I'm listening to you and what do I do with this information and so one first  
**0:30:31-0:30:38:**  one question that comes to mind is how do you promote that diversity through your practices  
**0:30:38-0:30:42:**  and how do you make sure kind of that the the right plants will show up or do you just  
**0:30:42-0:30:47:**  kind of have a hands-off approach and just promote general diversity and and and trust  
**0:30:47-0:30:52:**  your animals to go and discover those useful plants by themselves like what would be your  
**0:30:52-0:31:01:**  advice to to someone that wants to to follow the principles you've just exposed yes excellent  
**0:31:01-0:31:06:**  excellent question there's several things come to mind and and we can go back and forth  
**0:31:06-0:31:11:**  on this to to try to get after what you're thinking you know one related to diversity  
**0:31:11-0:31:17:**  how do you encourage diversity you know we were always doing that through grazing management  
**0:31:17-0:31:23:**  through thinking about time and timing of grazing you know when do we graze different  
**0:31:23-0:31:32:**  pastures for instance and what is it that we want to encourage and you know we we realized  
**0:31:32-0:31:36:**  for instance in some of the work that we were doing to improve habitat for wildlife that  
**0:31:36-0:31:42:**  if we graze during the spring of the year we could encourage the growth and productivity  
**0:31:42-0:31:48:**  of shrub species shrubs and tree species in that environment by grazing grasses and fords  
**0:31:48-0:31:52:**  during the spring puts little pressure on them we didn't want to get rid of them but  
**0:31:52-0:31:57:**  we would put a little pressure on them we could get more growth on shrub species by  
**0:31:57-0:32:03:**  time and timing of grazing if we wanted to decrease the abundance of shrubs a bit we  
**0:32:03-0:32:09:**  could graze during the fall and winter so you know I raised that as as a general thought  
**0:32:09-0:32:17:**  about how the way that we graze and thinking about when we graze and how we graze can influence  
**0:32:17-0:32:23:**  the biodiversity of the landscape so that's one thing that I that that we did a lot of  
**0:32:23-0:32:29:**  work on back in the day of how how our grazing management will influence the diversity of  
**0:32:29-0:32:38:**  landscapes in terms of one of another thing that came to mind as you were were talking  
**0:32:38-0:32:43:**  had to do with exposing animals to a variety of different foods and how do you get animals  
**0:32:43-0:32:50:**  to appreciate a variety of different foods and I think of in that sense of the work that  
**0:32:50-0:32:56:**  that we did with Michel Merie in France over the years and the shepherding practices and  
**0:32:56-0:33:02:**  not that everyone needs to be a shepherd but some of the the the ideas that that they developed  
**0:33:02-0:33:11:**  and and the practices not just not only the ideas but the practices of moving animals  
**0:33:11-0:33:16:**  throughout the day and moving them to different you know in their case to different habitat  
**0:33:16-0:33:26:**  types across the landscapes and and creating in a way appetizer courses main main part  
**0:33:26-0:33:31:**  of the meal booster stages desserts all these things that's you know only in France maybe  
**0:33:31-0:33:40:**  but again not not saying everyone should be should be be a shepherd but but what they're  
**0:33:40-0:33:46:**  able to do through their moving animals and exposing animals to different plant species  
**0:33:46-0:33:53:**  at different different parts of the meal is a way to to quote educate animals to expose  
**0:33:53-0:33:58:**  animals to different different plants and different species and to encourage them to  
**0:33:58-0:34:10:**  use those species they it's it's tremendous tremendous what they do and then to realize  
**0:34:10-0:34:16:**  too that they're constantly learning from the animals so it's a two-way street right  
**0:34:16-0:34:24:**  through learning from the animals can then train the animals but also by learning from  
**0:34:24-0:34:31:**  the yeah it's a two-way street it's a two-way street for for sure you know it makes me think  
**0:34:31-0:34:35:**  about something here I'm going to digress us into this that we got involved in years  
**0:34:35-0:34:43:**  ago so we were doing work training animals to eat certain plants but also training them  
**0:34:43-0:34:49:**  to avoid particular plant species and that training to avoid is based on feedback and  
**0:34:49-0:34:56:**  the idea that if an animal eats a food and it gets sick immediately after the meal it's  
**0:34:56-0:35:03:**  going to not want to eat that food anymore especially if it's never seen the food before  
**0:35:03-0:35:07:**  it's the first time they try a food think from your own standpoint you try a food you've  
**0:35:07-0:35:13:**  never eaten before you eat it and you get sick after that nausea you get nauseated and  
**0:35:13-0:35:19:**  we know the animals can experience this nausea and so we we did a lot of work training animals  
**0:35:19-0:35:25:**  in that way where we would give them a small dose of this compound lithium chloride used  
**0:35:25-0:35:30:**  to be used as a table salt substitute for table salt in humans and we just give them  
**0:35:30-0:35:35:**  a little bit of a high dose you know we weren't trying to harm them but we were we're trying  
**0:35:35-0:35:39:**  to learn about these feedbacks but anyway we learned that boy they they learn quickly  
**0:35:39-0:35:47:**  to avoid eating a particular food so a lot of people took that especially in vineyards  
**0:35:47-0:35:52:**  and there where they wanted animals to eat eat the understory but leave the trees alone  
**0:35:52-0:36:00:**  leave the shrubs leave the grapes alone so that they would train their animals with with  
**0:36:00-0:36:05:**  this lithium chloride well we were we got asked by a group in the northwest in washington  
**0:36:05-0:36:13:**  state they were using sheep to graze in these forest plantations the idea was to have them  
**0:36:13-0:36:23:**  uh graze the grasses and forbs but not graze the trees and uh and they they had flocks  
**0:36:23-0:36:28:**  of like a thousand sheep thousand two thousand sheep that they had trained it was a lot of  
**0:36:28-0:36:33:**  work but they trained them not to eat not to eat the shrubs and to eat the eat the trees  
**0:36:33-0:36:42:**  um and it worked it worked perfectly in fact i'm getting ahead of myself that when they  
**0:36:42-0:36:45:**  first started that they hadn't trained the animals at all and the first year they did  
**0:36:45-0:36:51:**  it they went in the ewes and the lambs ate the grasses and forbs they didn't touch all  
**0:36:51-0:36:57:**  these these conifer trees these young conifer trees that they were trying to get established  
**0:36:57-0:37:02:**  um so the first year was perfect the next year they did that um when they started the  
**0:37:02-0:37:09:**  trees started to put out some new new growth some new growth the lambs got interested in  
**0:37:09-0:37:17:**  that and the lambs started to eat that new growth and as the as the season went on the  
**0:37:17-0:37:24:**  lambs actually trained their mothers trained the mothers to eat so so it had gone the young  
**0:37:24-0:37:30:**  animals exploring the environment had trained trained the ewes the third year when they  
**0:37:30-0:37:36:**  came back now the ewes have this behavior they learned from the lambs they come in they  
**0:37:36-0:37:41:**  start to eat they train their lambs so i'm trying to say that so you know the learning  
**0:37:41-0:37:47:**  can occur in all different ways and the young animals are often a source of new information  
**0:37:47-0:37:53:**  into into the group and then we can think of the shepherds as also benefiting from learning  
**0:37:53-0:37:59:**  and and this learning going in these different directions going back to the the forest plantation  
**0:37:59-0:38:04:**  story what happened there then was that they learned of the work that we were doing on  
**0:38:04-0:38:11:**  training animals to avoid eating plants and when the ewes started to eat these trees then  
**0:38:11-0:38:16:**  they called us and said you know is it possible for us to train these ewes with this lithium  
**0:38:16-0:38:21:**  chloride not to eat the trees and that's when we got it got involved and that that's a whole  
**0:38:21-0:38:29:**  other story but but it uh it ties in with what what we had wanted to talk about related  
**0:38:29-0:38:34:**  to to trees and grazing trees and so forth i'll just interrupt for a second because while  
**0:38:34-0:38:39:**  we're on the theme i think it would be interesting is is this use of lithium chloride something  
**0:38:39-0:38:43:**  that's uh feasible for farmers listening to us and thinking of maybe putting in trees  
**0:38:43-0:38:49:**  in their uh putting in animals into their orchards wanting to avoid uh their animals  
**0:38:49-0:38:53:**  eating certain plants is that something like feasible uh is that the way you'd recommend  
**0:38:53-0:39:00:**  to do it then you know there's a lot of nuance to be said to that back in the early days  
**0:39:00-0:39:05:**  when we were first doing doing the studies we we were so excited about that because like  
**0:39:05-0:39:12:**  wow we can and when you see this demonstrated when you actually do that do something like  
**0:39:12-0:39:18:**  that one day they eat this plant you simply take a capsule in a balling gun put it down  
**0:39:18-0:39:22:**  which is easy to do and the next day you expose them and they don't want to eat the plant  
**0:39:22-0:39:28:**  it gets your attention you're like amazed you know that this can happen and then so  
**0:39:28-0:39:33:**  we worked out protocols over three to five days training protocols and it was done for  
**0:39:33-0:39:40:**  poisonous plants to help cattle and sheep uh mainly is what we were horses horses as  
**0:39:40-0:39:47:**  well so so it it can work it can definitely work but there's a lot of a lot of like everything  
**0:39:47-0:39:55:**  in life no silver bullets no silver bullets so we we and some of our colleagues showed  
**0:39:55-0:40:01:**  that that you can do this and it'll last up to three years as long as we ran those studies  
**0:40:01-0:40:06:**  the animals would still avoid but to do that there are several there are several things  
**0:40:06-0:40:12:**  that are really important it works best if the if the food is unfamiliar to the animal  
**0:40:12-0:40:16:**  you know if they've been eating that food for for months and years it's much harder  
**0:40:16-0:40:21:**  to train them to avoid eating it it's like with us if the food's always been good one  
**0:40:21-0:40:25:**  time we get sick it's like well that's a one-off thing i'm going to try it again and so forth  
**0:40:25-0:40:31:**  so there gets a lot of things like that that that are involved in in the training part  
**0:40:31-0:40:40:**  of this um having a variety of alternatives available to the animal also becomes very  
**0:40:40-0:40:46:**  important if if you for if there's not much else available odds are the aversion is going  
**0:40:46-0:40:52:**  to break down because if it's eat or starve then they'll try it and what's amazing to  
**0:40:52-0:40:58:**  me is how clever animals are at being in touch with their body and sampling things and and  
**0:40:58-0:41:06:**  those feedbacks of constantly constantly being in tune with that um you know if if you train  
**0:41:06-0:41:11:**  an animal to avoid something and for whatever combination of reasons it starts it samples  
**0:41:11-0:41:16:**  that food again and it might be that a neighbor one of their buddies sample that you know  
**0:41:16-0:41:21:**  that's it oh boy i better try that too we we did studies like that too if you had trained  
**0:41:21-0:41:27:**  and untrained animals and unfortunately it's the it's the animals that are eating the food  
**0:41:27-0:41:32:**  that draw the draw the animals that have been trained not the other way around and so but  
**0:41:32-0:41:39:**  if they sample at the you know two bites two days ten bites tomorrow's 50 bites the next  
**0:41:39-0:41:45:**  day and they're on it again and so it's um there's there's a lot to it it's something  
**0:41:45-0:41:52:**  that certainly can be done if a person wants to enter into that i i coached and worked  
**0:41:52-0:42:00:**  with many many people and many people remotely too in including in spain and france and california  
**0:42:00-0:42:05:**  the people who got most interested in this were people who had vineyards that because  
**0:42:05-0:42:11:**  they wanted to be able to allow animals to graze out in those vineyards you have a natural  
**0:42:11-0:42:15:**  source of manure then that's get that can fertilize the the vineyards and so forth and  
**0:42:15-0:42:21:**  you don't want them to eat the eat the the vines though and so i got involved a lot in  
**0:42:21-0:42:26:**  and received lots of nice bottles of wine from people actually because i said i didn't  
**0:42:26-0:42:34:**  want any money to you know to to be to be to be talking with people and so forth but  
**0:42:34-0:42:39:**  yes it can be done and you know this whole business of bark chewing bark chewing in animals  
**0:42:39-0:42:45:**  and girdling of trees that that can be a big issue right then obviously can kill kill the  
**0:42:45-0:42:54:**  trees one can think you know well why on earth do they eat the bark huh why why why why are  
**0:42:54-0:42:59:**  they so destructive right why do they want to be so destructive well you know there are  
**0:42:59-0:43:05:**  compounds in bark that really can can have health benefits to animals and i think tannins  
**0:43:05-0:43:12:**  especially bark is loaded with tannins and tannins can can have a lot of benefits to  
**0:43:12-0:43:22:**  animals not only from a medicinal standpoint but they also tannins can bind to protein  
**0:43:22-0:43:28:**  proteins in food and you think well why would that be good well it can help it gets a little  
**0:43:28-0:43:35:**  bit technical but it can get the by binding to protein in the in the rumen it protects  
**0:43:35-0:43:40:**  that protein that plant protein from being broken down by microbes in the rumen but when  
**0:43:40-0:43:46:**  it gets to the lower gi tract the tannin protein complexes dissociate so that protein gets  
**0:43:46-0:43:53:**  available at the lower gi tract it's what ruminants nutritionists call bypass protein  
**0:43:53-0:43:58:**  and it has really good health benefits so that's a little bit technical maybe but but  
**0:43:58-0:44:04:**  tannins can can do those sorts of things tannins can also help animals tannins in plants can  
**0:44:04-0:44:10:**  also help animals to eat other kinds of foods that they not might not be able to eat when  
**0:44:10-0:44:17:**  i was in hawaii several years ago we were talking with with working with with big producers  
**0:44:17-0:44:24:**  there and we were looking at at plants that goats and sheep were able to eat that cattle  
**0:44:24-0:44:29:**  couldn't eat and we were thinking well why is that the case and part can be just simply  
**0:44:29-0:44:35:**  how goats and sheep are built and how they function they're different from cows right  
**0:44:35-0:44:41:**  but another thing that we were talking about is the tremendous amount of girdling of barking  
**0:44:41-0:44:48:**  that goats and sheep do and that can enable them to eat plants that cattle can't eat simply  
**0:44:48-0:44:54:**  by getting that tannin in their diet so so the barking has a very important function  
**0:44:54-0:45:00:**  and one can see too for instance here where we are during the winter a lot of the small  
**0:45:00-0:45:06:**  small mammals will will bark they'll bark they eat the bark they eat a lot of the bark  
**0:45:06-0:45:11:**  it's for it's for those kind of reasons so that might be another opportunity to to offer  
**0:45:11-0:45:18:**  animals a little bit of bark and then follow that with a with a capsule of lithium chloride  
**0:45:18-0:45:24:**  and train them not to eat bark yeah just kind of summing up everything that you've been  
**0:45:24-0:45:29:**  talking about because it's really interesting it also means that yes you can train them  
**0:45:29-0:45:36:**  uh by providing a negative feedback but also then you should be probably providing an alternative  
**0:45:36-0:45:40:**  uh source of tannins for example because they'll be searching to like balance their diet so  
**0:45:40-0:45:46:**  it's a kind of two-way thing work on the negative but also provide that alternative uh one way  
**0:45:46-0:45:51:**  or the other to prevent the the draw towards it absolutely the perfect kind of summary  
**0:45:51-0:45:57:**  of that and i love the way you're thinking about that because it's like that completes  
**0:45:57-0:46:03:**  the story right that's the that's the whole they want this for a particular reason right  
**0:46:03-0:46:08:**  there's there's you said it so nicely i'll just reinforce what you said you know they're  
**0:46:08-0:46:12:**  they want this for a particular reason it's not just because they want to destroy your  
**0:46:12-0:46:17:**  your forest plantation or your trees right so they're trying to think about what is it  
**0:46:17-0:46:22:**  that they're getting out of that is there a way that we could provide that provide that  
**0:46:22-0:46:29:**  to them and uh you know that's where i think i think of the uh i think of the shrubs that  
**0:46:29-0:46:34:**  we were involved with and many many of the shrub species woody species are high in tannins  
**0:46:34-0:46:42:**  and so if if there were a person could in our case by providing those shrubs that provides  
**0:46:42-0:46:49:**  a source of of of tannins in the diet and so they they don't need to bark the trees  
**0:46:49-0:46:54:**  which which that takes time and energy to do that right that's not easy an easy thing  
**0:46:54-0:47:00:**  to bark they have to really want that to do it so so it's a good good source i'm thinking  
**0:47:00-0:47:06:**  too and i'm jumping around on you a little bit here but i had a good friend i have a  
**0:47:06-0:47:11:**  good friend that i used to work with a ruminant nutritionist and when he retired he moved  
**0:47:11-0:47:18:**  to uh the state of missouri and in missouri they have a grass there that grows in monoculture  
**0:47:18-0:47:26:**  it's called endophyte infected tall fescue it's it's by all rights a toxic plant but  
**0:47:26-0:47:32:**  but it so has come to dominate landscapes that people have tried to learn how to live  
**0:47:32-0:47:38:**  with that plant it can take over and end up in monoculture it's very high in alkaloids  
**0:47:38-0:47:44:**  and he randy was involved with us in some of the research like i'm talking about and  
**0:47:44-0:47:50:**  what he was observing his cattle do there because there were trees available and tannin  
**0:47:50-0:47:57:**  containing forage he said i noticed that those animals will use that as an appetizer they'll  
**0:47:57-0:48:02:**  eat those tree species and he said i'm virtually certain they're getting tannin out of those  
**0:48:02-0:48:08:**  trees and that's enabling them as we were showing in our studies to utilize this plant  
**0:48:08-0:48:14:**  that's high in alkaloids a certified infected tall fescue and that takes us into a little  
**0:48:14-0:48:19:**  of the particulars but the tannins have a very high affinity for binding to a lot of  
**0:48:19-0:48:26:**  compounds i stated that earlier when i said tannins bind to proteins and they can create  
**0:48:26-0:48:32:**  a bypass protein effect for animals well the same thing happens with tannins and their  
**0:48:32-0:48:38:**  relationship with terpenes and plants like sagebrush they'll bind to that so an appetizer  
**0:48:38-0:48:46:**  of a food high in tannin enables animals to eat more of a food high in terpene the same  
**0:48:46-0:48:52:**  with alkaloids so in our particular environment and it's why it does get important to try  
**0:48:52-0:48:58:**  to know your species and know what kind of compounds that they contain not that it can  
**0:48:58-0:49:04:**  happen naturally if a person first learns the different species of plants and then you  
**0:49:04-0:49:11:**  start to learn well this one for instance i would be thinking about now bitter brush  
**0:49:11-0:49:17:**  and sagebrush bitter brush is high in tannins sagebrush is high in terpenes an appetizer  
**0:49:17-0:49:25:**  of bitter brush helps animals to utilize sagebrush and there are landscapes where i used to work  
**0:49:25-0:49:32:**  where animals had access to both bitter brush and sagebrush and you could see that they  
**0:49:32-0:49:38:**  reduced the abundance of sagebrush and i'm sure it was because they had the bitter brush  
**0:49:38-0:49:44:**  as an appetizer to help them eat sagebrush and then there was there were areas where  
**0:49:44-0:49:49:**  this is wildlife species i'm thinking about now mule deer where the mule deer couldn't  
**0:49:49-0:49:57:**  go and there was a much much more um a mix uh an even mix of sagebrush and bitter brush  
**0:49:57-0:50:02:**  where the deer couldn't go where the deer could go they had reduced the abundance of  
**0:50:02-0:50:07:**  sagebrush and the bitter brush is that making sense the bitter brush is helping them to  
**0:50:07-0:50:13:**  do them the appetizer of bitter brush is helping them to use the sagebrush but but just a question  
**0:50:13-0:50:19:**  here okay let's take my example um i'll be in a farm i'm thinking of planting some trees  
**0:50:19-0:50:24:**  for example willow is high in tannins so i'd be smart to make sure i include some willow  
**0:50:24-0:50:29:**  and give access to my animals so that you know they can use those tannins and and hopefully  
**0:50:29-0:50:35:**  that will enable them to explore new diets by by combining uh with other molecules what  
**0:50:35-0:50:41:**  would that be an approach you'd recommend absolutely the case you're you're right on  
**0:50:41-0:50:49:**  thinking you know and we see here in in uh every place every place that i've worked here  
**0:50:49-0:50:55:**  uh the value of willows and how much animals like willows and it's for for all these reasons  
**0:50:55-0:50:59:**  that we're talking about yeah so absolutely a perfect example of that you know and the  
**0:50:59-0:51:05:**  value of of willows back in the day we were did a lot of work with natural products chemists  
**0:51:05-0:51:12:**  and we were looking at at different species of shrubs and uh it's clear that tannins aren't  
**0:51:12-0:51:18:**  tannins aren't tannins right and this isn't to confuse or make it more complicated but  
**0:51:18-0:51:22:**  it's simply to state a fact the tannins in bitterbrush are different from the tannins  
**0:51:22-0:51:27:**  in black brush are different from the tannins in mountain mahogany the structures are all  
**0:51:27-0:51:34:**  different so plants plants don't want to but having said that tannins do play general kinds  
**0:51:34-0:51:42:**  of roles like we're talking about and so i i wouldn't get so fussed on on on knowing  
**0:51:42-0:51:47:**  you know all the particulars of of the tannin structures and that sort of thing but simply  
**0:51:47-0:51:53:**  knowing that certain species have certain kinds of compounds willows have tannins they  
**0:51:53-0:51:59:**  also have salicylic acid which is basic ingredient in aspirin right so if the animals have a  
**0:51:59-0:52:04:**  headache maybe they can go down i'm teasing you a little bit but would you say that naturally  
**0:52:04-0:52:10:**  in ecosystems you tend to find uh enough diversity that you have all these important classes  
**0:52:10-0:52:15:**  represented so what i mean by that is that if i'm a farmer is it enough to just work  
**0:52:15-0:52:20:**  with what's already there and maybe allow certain things to develop or do you need to  
**0:52:20-0:52:25:**  be that bit more technical to really understand what's already there what functions they play  
**0:52:25-0:52:31:**  and maybe identify a gap or a lack of of a certain plants or important functions in the  
**0:52:31-0:52:40:**  nutrition another really important point that you're raising when you started to to ask  
**0:52:40-0:52:47:**  the question what came into my mind were many of the of the native systems that we worked  
**0:52:47-0:52:54:**  in and there was really nice diversity in those those systems and so in those cases  
**0:52:54-0:53:03:**  it was work as you said working just working with what what was there and uh and not not  
**0:53:03-0:53:11:**  necessarily needing to think about introducing anything when the thing that we would introduce  
**0:53:11-0:53:17:**  was simply management for appropriate grazing management was what we were thinking about  
**0:53:17-0:53:22:**  a lot and how to you know we we like this diversity we want to keep this diversity and  
**0:53:22-0:53:28:**  so how do we manage in ways that that keep that if we need to encourage certain species  
**0:53:28-0:53:34:**  how through the time that we graze the animals that we put out there um you know we used  
**0:53:34-0:53:42:**  to see so much i'm i'll digress here a little bit and think i'm thinking of some studies  
**0:53:42-0:53:50:**  that that were done in the southern part of utah on diverse kind of natural landscapes  
**0:53:50-0:53:57:**  and the question they wanted to ask is the the influence of sheep versus cattle versus  
**0:53:57-0:54:02:**  cattle and sheep together on these landscapes and so they were they had areas that they  
**0:54:02-0:54:08:**  grazed only with sheep um during the growing season spring summer and and into the fall  
**0:54:08-0:54:13:**  other areas they grazed only with cattle and then with cattle and sheep together and you  
**0:54:13-0:54:18:**  can change the diversity of plant species by the animal species that you put on those  
**0:54:18-0:54:31:**  landscapes the sheep really like to to utilize the the the forb species there and and some  
**0:54:31-0:54:38:**  of the shrubs and so they they would would really encourage movement toward domination  
**0:54:38-0:54:44:**  by some of the grass species whereas the cattle very much preferred the grass species at that  
**0:54:44-0:54:49:**  time of the year and so you would get a movement towards forbs and shrubs the combination of  
**0:54:49-0:54:55:**  cattle and sheep you'd maintain more of a balance so that's that's you know through  
**0:54:55-0:55:02:**  the species of animals and then the time that you graze what what struck me after 40 50  
**0:55:02-0:55:07:**  years of working in that is how much we can influence the relative abundance of different  
**0:55:07-0:55:13:**  species if we think about time and timing and animal species that we put on those and  
**0:55:13-0:55:18:**  I'm saying that in a positive sense it's that you know we we can really have an influence  
**0:55:18-0:55:27:**  on on what's what's out there in those landscapes so in that sense it becomes developing a relationship  
**0:55:27-0:55:33:**  with the landscapes we know in our personal life that the amount of interest that we have  
**0:55:33-0:55:39:**  and energy that we put into our relationships with one another it influences the the quality  
**0:55:39-0:55:45:**  of the relationship it's the same with the landscape too you know and I mean that's  
**0:55:45-0:55:51:**  not for everyone I think of the people I worked with over time and the people that that did  
**0:55:51-0:55:58:**  the best were the people that just naturally loved loved the relationship with the landscape  
**0:55:58-0:56:03:**  right they they were just fascinated they loved the animals they loved the plants they  
**0:56:03-0:56:07:**  loved thinking about that they loved being involved with it and they were able to do  
**0:56:07-0:56:15:**  things that a person that's maybe not so interested couldn't do and it was it was that they were  
**0:56:15-0:56:22:**  these nurturing relationship with the with the landscape it matters a lot it's like the  
**0:56:22-0:56:28:**  kind of the the loving energy we put into something and and it's not to say that's good  
**0:56:28-0:56:34:**  or bad we're all different right in terms of what what what is interesting to us but  
**0:56:34-0:56:38:**  if it's something that fascinates you it's like the sky's the limit on what what can  
**0:56:38-0:56:45:**  be done that's the first thing I think is is work with what try to work with the landscapes  
**0:56:45-0:56:52:**  that you have rather than try to bring things in but then you know a person can always the  
**0:56:52-0:56:58:**  example I gave of the the lady in Australia you know they had removed all the trees from  
**0:56:58-0:57:03:**  those landscapes so if you want trees back you're going to have to put trees in and so  
**0:57:03-0:57:08:**  that's what they did 50,000 trees over those years they'd they'd planted on those landscapes  
**0:57:08-0:57:13:**  and totally totally transformed them back much more to how they would have been when  
**0:57:13-0:57:19:**  they there were lots of eucalyptus trees growing on those landscapes.  
**0:57:19-0:57:24:**  There's a several other questions that you know I'm gonna have to take a few steps back  
**0:57:24-0:57:30:**  because we went quite far into this you know fascinating topic but you know I asked you  
**0:57:30-0:57:37:**  a bit earlier on on what could a farmer do what are his tools to affect the amount of  
**0:57:37-0:57:41:**  diversity one thing that comes to mind for me is also the amount of fertilization you're  
**0:57:41-0:57:46:**  going to put on and and the fertility of soils because for example the region where I am  
**0:57:46-0:57:52:**  has very diverse prairie ecosystems and it's essentially because the soils aren't that  
**0:57:52-0:57:56:**  rich and there's this relationship between you know very fertile lands will tend to have  
**0:57:56-0:58:04:**  maybe less diversity than more poor diverse soils am I correct in making that link?  
**0:58:04-0:58:09:**  Yes it's a very good point that you raise and certainly the case that resource availability  
**0:58:09-0:58:16:**  in the environment sunlight nutrients water have a huge influence on on diversity on what  
**0:58:16-0:58:24:**  plant species are there and so it it becomes a balancing act as you say of thinking about  
**0:58:24-0:58:33:**  that and thinking about you know certainly when when we introduce livestock into into  
**0:58:33-0:58:39:**  an area into a system they're going to alter fertility of those landscapes by their urine  
**0:58:39-0:58:46:**  and feces right and and as they they graze they're having an influence on those systems  
**0:58:46-0:58:55:**  and so you know and I want to let me make a point here too I am maybe too enthusiastic  
**0:58:55-0:59:02:**  in a way about diversity too I think I see lots of value and I love to see that but you  
**0:59:02-0:59:09:**  know I have a friend Pablo Gregorini who's originally from Argentina he lives he and  
**0:59:09-0:59:13:**  his family live in New Zealand now and he's doing lots of work along the lines that we've  
**0:59:13-0:59:20:**  been talking about and they're showing that as you move from from even one or two species  
**0:59:20-0:59:26:**  to say a handful four to six species depending what those species are can have tremendous  
**0:59:26-0:59:33:**  influence in terms of the health of the animals and the system so so I just add that as a  
**0:59:33-0:59:40:**  caveat that you know a person doesn't have to to have maybe 100 200 species or like one  
**0:59:40-0:59:46:**  of my friends here on the the native range where they graze he tells me there's 400 species  
**0:59:46-0:59:53:**  you know maybe thinking even four to six species and if it's highly productive can can be highly  
**0:59:53-1:00:00:**  highly nutritious and valuable for for animal species as well so that's good maybe to make  
**1:00:00-1:00:07:**  that point too that you know it's it doesn't have to be hundreds of species to to be diverse  
**1:00:07-1:00:13:**  and to be functionally and meaningfully diverse as well but you know you can also see the  
**1:00:13-1:00:21:**  other way is that I'm farming on quite poor sandy soil which of course is an advantage  
**1:00:21-1:00:26:**  but I think we produce exceptional hay out of that soil and I think there's something  
**1:00:26-1:00:33:**  about plants being stressed and and pushing in a harsh high altitude environment and it's  
**1:00:33-1:00:40:**  quite interesting because you have like exceptional quality hay coming out of poor soils which  
**1:00:40-1:00:43:**  can be a bit counterintuitive because you would assume that you know the best richest  
**1:00:43-1:00:49:**  soil would produce the best hay and I'm taking this I'm just sharing the experience of the  
**1:00:49-1:00:53:**  farmers I've been working with you know this isn't anything published or whatever but been  
**1:00:53-1:00:59:**  working on five six farms and they've all told me the same thing is like cows will eat  
**1:00:59-1:01:06:**  much more of this hay that we produce here this thin mountain hay is much more edible  
**1:01:06-1:01:11:**  I don't know how you say it in English but in French is a petal means tasty for the animals  
**1:01:11-1:01:16:**  then for example the hay from the plains which is much more abundant and I think there's  
**1:01:16-1:01:21:**  something interesting and I kind of link it back to what you were also talking to about  
**1:01:21-1:01:29:**  you know secondary compounds and the health of like very diverse plant communities.  
**1:01:29-1:01:37:**  You raise a hugely interesting and important topic when you're saying that and you mentioned  
**1:01:37-1:01:42:**  that you know you don't have any research to back that but what comes to mind is a my  
**1:01:42-1:01:49:**  mind is a huge amount of research that absolutely consistent with everything that you're saying  
**1:01:49-1:01:55:**  and what it illustrates and this will depend on the compounds that we're dealing with but  
**1:01:55-1:02:03:**  let me generalize and tannins would fit into this that as you as fertility as resource  
**1:02:03-1:02:10:**  availability let's say declines you can concentrate compounds you can concentrate both primary  
**1:02:10-1:02:16:**  and secondary compounds they become more concentrated in plants you don't have the dilution that  
**1:02:16-1:02:21:**  you get due to growth when you increase for still at the or resource availability and  
**1:02:21-1:02:27:**  so you know even though it may not be you're on these poor quality soils and you're maybe  
**1:02:27-1:02:33:**  not getting the production you can have a very much a concentration of both the primary  
**1:02:33-1:02:42:**  and the secondary compounds and make very good quality kinds of food hay for animals  
**1:02:42-1:02:47:**  under those conditions so that it's a huge point that you raise and a very good point  
**1:02:47-1:02:55:**  and I often think of that relative to fruits and vegetables that we grow and that you know  
**1:02:55-1:03:00:**  if you provide too much nutrients you can get you can accent growth at the expense of  
**1:03:00-1:03:07:**  final chemical richness it's it's a kind of a balancing act between how much is how much  
**1:03:07-1:03:14:**  fertility and the plants are responding so hugely interesting and an important area we  
**1:03:14-1:03:21:**  used to think of that a lot with plants I'm thinking of a plant called sericea lespedeza  
**1:03:21-1:03:27:**  it's a it's a form that's very high in tannins and depending on where it's growing it's either  
**1:03:27-1:03:33:**  highly palatable or highly unpalatable same plant species absolutely it's simply a function  
**1:03:33-1:03:41:**  of the environment if it's growing in a really resource rich environment in this case a lot  
**1:03:41-1:03:47:**  a decent amount of water and nutrients it becomes more palatable to cattle in this case  
**1:03:47-1:03:55:**  because it because you do dilute the tannins a bit if it makes it if you get too much tannin  
**1:03:55-1:04:00:**  the animals can't can't utilize it in the case of sericea the tannins it has and so  
**1:04:00-1:04:05:**  forth so if it's growing on these harsh sites cattle don't want to eat it much because the  
**1:04:05-1:04:10:**  tannins are too concentrated in if you go the other direction and so you could imagine  
**1:04:10-1:04:18:**  a continuum of that right so it's I think hugely interesting and friends I worked with  
**1:04:18-1:04:24:**  over the years and some of the work we did too was just realizing the the importance  
**1:04:24-1:04:28:**  of what you're observing you know and so you you're absolutely right with what you and  
**1:04:28-1:04:37:**  the farmers are are are seeing it makes sense and then there's a there's a big amount of  
**1:04:37-1:04:43:**  research that absolutely supports everything you said that will be some consolation to  
**1:04:43-1:04:48:**  all of us farming on poorer soils you know we can at least comfort ourselves knowing  
**1:04:48-1:04:53:**  that we can still have a very high quality production with these concentrated fodders  
**1:04:53-1:04:59:**  and productions I was going to loop back to you know a bit before in the conversation  
**1:04:59-1:05:04:**  because we we touched upon it but I think it's a massively important aspect we talked  
**1:05:04-1:05:09:**  about training to avoid a certain food and we mentioned the ability to introduce new  
**1:05:09-1:05:14:**  types of food that's the next step after having increased diversity in your landscape while  
**1:05:14-1:05:21:**  you want your animals to use that diversity and the method to which you reach that I think  
**1:05:21-1:05:26:**  is really interesting you know let's say you know I'm on the farm I've planted new shrubs  
**1:05:26-1:05:32:**  with willows or anything else I know theoretically it's possible or I might not even know that  
**1:05:32-1:05:37:**  it's possible for animals to eat it but I might just want them to try it how do I approach  
**1:05:37-1:05:48:**  this you know there's a variety of ways that that person could approach that if you have  
**1:05:48-1:05:55:**  if you have animals that are familiar with eating those the plants that you put in or  
**1:05:55-1:06:02:**  if your neighbor has animals that are familiar you know a few a few animals to to guide the  
**1:06:02-1:06:08:**  other animals can be really valuable and I we we've gotten involved with people who come  
**1:06:08-1:06:12:**  to appreciate that and think you know if I introduce have a few of these animals that  
**1:06:12-1:06:17:**  are knowledgeable they can train my animals really quickly to to get onto those foods  
**1:06:17-1:06:23:**  so that that's that's one thought another thought there's a lady that worked with our  
**1:06:23-1:06:29:**  program for many years and went into business then for herself livestock for landscapes  
**1:06:29-1:06:36:**  her name is Kathy both and her one of her goals in in all of her work was training animals  
**1:06:36-1:06:41:**  to use foods that they ordinarily wouldn't use and so she would offer them figure techniques  
**1:06:41-1:06:49:**  to offer them in feed bunks to animals and just to get them familiar and you know you  
**1:06:49-1:06:56:**  think why wouldn't they use them why wouldn't they be familiar and I think you know on the  
**1:06:56-1:07:05:**  on the landscapes that we have there are many many species in our particular case and maybe  
**1:07:05-1:07:09:**  some species they just simply have never paid attention to it's never been a part of of  
**1:07:09-1:07:15:**  their radar screen in the supermarkets where we go here there can be six hundred thousand  
**1:07:15-1:07:20:**  different items available to you and I was thinking of this lately we have a neighbor  
**1:07:20-1:07:25:**  down the road that she's in a wheelchair right now and we ask her if she want us to do some  
**1:07:25-1:07:32:**  shopping for and when we went into Bozeman recently and she asked us to pick up a couple  
**1:07:32-1:07:40:**  of items and one were these little peas these snap peas and I had never paid attention to  
**1:07:40-1:07:45:**  those I'd walked by those I don't know how many times in the store you know and we got  
**1:07:45-1:07:51:**  those four and I thought I'm gonna get a bag for us to just absolutely love them well wasn't  
**1:07:51-1:07:56:**  that I didn't like it it's just I never had never had occurred to me that they were there  
**1:07:56-1:08:02:**  or to use them so that's a little bit how I think of Kathy's work of just offering animals  
**1:08:02-1:08:08:**  in a setting where they can become familiar with it there's a friend that I was corresponding  
**1:08:08-1:08:14:**  with about a shrub called rabbit brush that animals don't don't always utilize and cattle  
**1:08:14-1:08:19:**  he was working with cattle and he knew of some work that we'd done where we sprayed  
**1:08:19-1:08:24:**  molasses just take a little bit of molasses and spray that on the shrubs to attract the  
**1:08:24-1:08:29:**  animals that are familiar with molasses to attract them to utilize it he was sending  
**1:08:29-1:08:37:**  me pictures he was so happy how the cattle had just taken to eating this rabbit brush  
**1:08:37-1:08:42:**  like crazy where you ordinarily they don't touch it at all rabbit brush too is interesting  
**1:08:42-1:08:49:**  plant because it regrows really readily after it's you know you browse it this time of year  
**1:08:49-1:08:55:**  in the fall and winter next spring it'll grow back like crazy so it's it's a great potential  
**1:08:55-1:09:00:**  forage resource but his cattle had never used it so you know it's the ideas like that that  
**1:09:00-1:09:06:**  a person can use of just ways to try to get the animals to to try it try it out and see  
**1:09:06-1:09:12:**  it's not so bad but you wouldn't want to you know take it too far because then you're kind  
**1:09:12-1:09:17:**  of messing around with their feedback loops let's say you're spraying something with with  
**1:09:17-1:09:22:**  the molasses so you just want to do it once so they they pay attention to it but then  
**1:09:22-1:09:27:**  you want to let them still be able to decide if that is positive in their nutrition or  
**1:09:27-1:09:33:**  not right and if it's not then just drop it absolutely the case absolutely the case and  
**1:09:33-1:09:42:**  that's where too a person has to you're raising such such an important point in that sense  
**1:09:42-1:09:49:**  some of the plants that animals don't don't use they're not using because they are potentially  
**1:09:49-1:09:54:**  toxic to the animal it's a huge huge point that that we want to make here they're potentially  
**1:09:54-1:10:01:**  toxic and the animals very well may be totally avoiding them because they are so toxic at  
**1:10:01-1:10:09:**  a particular time or limiting their intake a great deal maybe 10 bites is enough of this  
**1:10:09-1:10:16:**  particular plant species so it's very true what you say that there could be this introduction  
**1:10:16-1:10:22:**  to the plant and the animal gets to experience and try it out but then letting the animal  
**1:10:22-1:10:30:**  rely on those feedback systems that that that they are so in tune with it it amazes me how  
**1:10:30-1:10:36:**  well they're able to do that and I I won't talk about all the studies we did right now  
**1:10:36-1:10:42:**  but they're coming to my mind and just thinking it's amazing how much in tune they seem to  
**1:10:42-1:10:49:**  be with their own bodies and how then I think about how easy it is for we humans to kind  
**1:10:49-1:10:54:**  of maybe not stay in tune with our own bodies but yeah a good point that you're raising  
**1:10:54-1:11:01:**  of how you know introduce them to that and so that they're familiar with it and then  
**1:11:01-1:11:07:**  allow them to to adjust their their use of that plant as a function of what their body's  
**1:11:07-1:11:11:**  able to to tolerate and need so forth.  
**1:11:11-1:11:17:**  Another interesting point is how much is linked to you know training and knowledge in the  
**1:11:17-1:11:24:**  herd and how much is linked to genetics even within a species for example you know I have  
**1:11:24-1:11:31:**  cows and they're not necessarily eating or utilizing enough the local resources is it  
**1:11:31-1:11:37:**  is it better to invest in like trying to train these cows or should I be reconsidering maybe  
**1:11:37-1:11:42:**  the the breed and going for like a harder breed of cows or you know what what how would  
**1:11:42-1:11:45:**  you see that?  
**1:11:45-1:11:52:**  Yeah that's another excellent excellent excellent question the the genetics I think gets down  
**1:11:52-1:11:58:**  to how an animal's built and how an animal's body's actually functioning and what that  
**1:11:58-1:12:07:**  animal is capable of for instance for for instance utilizing I mentioned endophyte infected  
**1:12:07-1:12:14:**  talphescu earlier and that by all rights it's a toxic plant well people who work a lot with  
**1:12:14-1:12:20:**  livestock cattle and endophyte infected talphescu in fact do select for animals that have the  
**1:12:20-1:12:27:**  ability to ingest high amounts of alkaloids so so their body how their body is able to  
**1:12:27-1:12:34:**  detoxify those alkaloids handle those alkaloids and so forth that that so there is that basis  
**1:12:34-1:12:44:**  in terms of morphology and physiology that enables animals some animals to to ingest  
**1:12:44-1:12:49:**  plants that other ones might not be able to a goat isn't a sheep isn't a cow and that  
**1:12:49-1:12:53:**  they're different in terms of their how they're built and how they function and same within  
**1:12:53-1:12:54:**  cattle breeds.  
**1:12:54-1:13:00:**  The other thing to realize is that within a breed within your your flock of animals  
**1:13:00-1:13:07:**  or herd of of animals there's going to be great variability amongst individuals in that  
**1:13:07-1:13:08:**  group to utilize.  
**1:13:08-1:13:13:**  I'm thinking of studies now that were done at the poisonous plants research lab in Logan  
**1:13:13-1:13:19:**  where they had five different breeds of cattle and they were looking at their ability to  
**1:13:19-1:13:26:**  to utilize this toxic plant called larkspur delphinium probably you have that it's it's  
**1:13:26-1:13:32:**  grows in many parts of the world it's a beautiful beautiful plant but there was more variation  
**1:13:32-1:13:39:**  within a breed than across breeds in terms of ability to to ingest this plant so it's  
**1:13:39-1:13:45:**  a key point that that you're raising there are these differences you know the degree  
**1:13:45-1:13:50:**  to which that starts to happen to in utero and early in life gets us into this whole  
**1:13:50-1:13:57:**  area of epigenetics and gene expression and what mother is doing and what genes get expressed  
**1:13:57-1:14:06:**  that end up making each individual different that that all becomes a basis of of this genetic  
**1:14:06-1:14:16:**  epigenetic kind of effect but certainly it's important and and then realizing like I say  
**1:14:16-1:14:23:**  that within the animals you have there's going to be variation and if you don't want to to  
**1:14:23-1:14:30:**  try to buy whole other animals and then again it's the relationship you have but you know  
**1:14:30-1:14:39:**  you trying to to it gets down to what what different individuals are doing and then then  
**1:14:39-1:14:44:**  how do you identify which ones are doing that in those studies they were able to to monitor  
**1:14:44-1:14:50:**  but it was amazing to see how much variation within a breed all these individuals just  
**1:14:50-1:14:57:**  totally different in terms of their ability to to ingest that that plant and yeah and  
**1:14:57-1:15:02:**  then with the endophyte infected tall fescue what happens is the the ones that aren't doing  
**1:15:02-1:15:09:**  very well get selected out of the herd the ones that do well are kept in the herd and  
**1:15:09-1:15:16:**  it's it's easier in a sense because it is such a mono monoculture kind of system so  
**1:15:16-1:15:21:**  your animals are either doing well or they're not doing well it's not a diversity of different  
**1:15:21-1:15:26:**  thing different plant species out there they're really challenged and yeah and so the the  
**1:15:26-1:15:31:**  producers are selecting for the ones that do the best it feels like listening to you  
**1:15:31-1:15:37:**  that you know because so many farmers can't operate in such a precise manner as research  
**1:15:37-1:15:41:**  where you have other tools to measure the best you can try and do is like increase your  
**1:15:41-1:15:45:**  chances by like okay let's just generally increase diversity let's try and make sure  
**1:15:45-1:15:53:**  that animals can find a diversity of molecules in the landscape and then let's observe and  
**1:15:53-1:15:59:**  remove individuals that are doing badly for whichever reason it is without trying to necessarily  
**1:15:59-1:16:03:**  understand it completely because if you don't have this kind of pattern approach to it there's  
**1:16:03-1:16:08:**  so many variables that you it'll be really hard on a on a farm level to actually understand  
**1:16:08-1:16:15:**  all these connections absolutely the case absolutely the case you know encourage diversity  
**1:16:15-1:16:21:**  see which animals are performing best and doing the things that you want done in the  
**1:16:21-1:16:26:**  landscape performing the best and then yeah and the ones that don't do well and so then  
**1:16:26-1:16:32:**  you become a little bit like nature in that sense right the the animals over time that  
**1:16:32-1:16:38:**  are in a herd of deer or elk or or whatever creature sheep or whatever creatures might  
**1:16:38-1:16:42:**  be the ones that that are able to perform well under those conditions reproduce have  
**1:16:42-1:16:49:**  their offspring and they they come to to dominate within within the the herd in that particular  
**1:16:49-1:16:55:**  area absolutely that's that's how how it all ends up then yeah because this this ties to  
**1:16:55-1:17:00:**  another thing we mentioned but maybe i didn't push it quite enough around you know some  
**1:17:00-1:17:07:**  caveats or dangers in in in bringing new elements into the diet and this experimentation you  
**1:17:07-1:17:12:**  know many people maybe would be afraid of like poisoning their animals you know is is  
**1:17:12-1:17:18:**  there some advice there on like you know maybe going slowly or just maybe trusting your animals  
**1:17:18-1:17:25:**  to to select and and and to be able to recognize something that might be toxic that's a good  
**1:17:25-1:17:31:**  another i keep saying good questions but they are good question they are very good very  
**1:17:31-1:17:37:**  good questions and uh you know what what comes to my mind is that that's where i think having  
**1:17:37-1:17:44:**  animals that know quote know your range having animals that are familiar with the landscape  
**1:17:44-1:17:50:**  and uh mothers that know know the landscape and that can train the offspring that that  
**1:17:50-1:17:56:**  becomes the real really the important buffer and then um you know and then gradually introducing  
**1:17:56-1:18:02:**  things when that when they're familiar with a landscape uh adding one new thing or or  
**1:18:02-1:18:08:**  a handful of new things to the diet for them to explore um that that becomes relatively  
**1:18:08-1:18:15:**  simple for the animals what's overwhelming is when you bring animals from uh another  
**1:18:15-1:18:20:**  totally different environment into a new environment then they've got to sort everything out they've  
**1:18:20-1:18:25:**  got to figure try to learn it all and there's that learning curve and that's when a lot  
**1:18:25-1:18:31:**  of mistakes can be made i think of when when my wife and i were living in the backwoods  
**1:18:31-1:18:39:**  of colorado on these huge landscapes that that were had combinations of a forest deciduous  
**1:18:39-1:18:46:**  and conifer trees as well as as big expanses of grasslands and there were animals that  
**1:18:46-1:18:52:**  cow calf herds that were familiar with those landscapes and they they've been born and  
**1:18:52-1:18:56:**  raised they'd had their offspring there their offspring had their offspring and so forth  
**1:18:56-1:19:01:**  and they knew those ranges really well and they performed well they they looked great  
**1:19:01-1:19:07:**  they grew well during the the spring and summer that they were there there's also a practice  
**1:19:07-1:19:12:**  in the united states where people buy what is referred to as stocker cattle they they're  
**1:19:12-1:19:18:**  animals that are perhaps roughly a year of age in that that ballpark and they buy them  
**1:19:18-1:19:24:**  in lots and then they move them to landscapes and they they they put them on those landscapes  
**1:19:24-1:19:30:**  to hopefully gain weight and then they sell them you know it's a it's a put and take kind  
**1:19:30-1:19:36:**  of system when they would put those stockers on those landscapes they didn't perform well  
**1:19:36-1:19:43:**  they and it's the same landscape the reason they don't know the landscape they're stressed  
**1:19:43-1:19:49:**  you know you could see the animals don't know where they are they don't know what's up here's  
**1:19:49-1:19:54:**  this whole new environment in terms of not only the plants but there's a lot of predators  
**1:19:54-1:20:02:**  up there too from mountain lions and bears to to wolves and so forth so and i used to  
**1:20:02-1:20:11:**  think you know they could make this better by simply taking lead animals taking mature  
**1:20:11-1:20:15:**  cows that knew that landscape and put them out there with those with those stalkers those  
**1:20:15-1:20:21:**  stalkers would would go to those animals and they they would help them make that transition  
**1:20:21-1:20:25:**  it wasn't being done and we weren't a part of what was going on so i you know i didn't  
**1:20:25-1:20:32:**  have didn't feel it was my place to to go talk to people like you know like some know-it-all  
**1:20:32-1:20:37:**  or something but but it was it was it was clear you know these animals are stressed  
**1:20:37-1:20:41:**  you could see in their movement they stick together in one tight little group rather  
**1:20:41-1:20:49:**  than spread out and um and there's lack of familiarity so it goes back to to the point  
**1:20:49-1:20:56:**  if the animals are familiar with an environment the value of that of mother and these transgenerational  
**1:20:56-1:21:02:**  linkages really starts to become evident and important in those those cases and then you  
**1:21:02-1:21:08:**  know introducing new new foods or whatever that that can all be done quite quite quite  
**1:21:08-1:21:14:**  nicely let's let's take an example for example let's say you know i have a open pasture and  
**1:21:14-1:21:20:**  then all of a sudden i'm planning out a silvopasture system and i'm planting black locust and actually  
**1:21:20-1:21:25:**  it seems black locust has a bit of a controversy because you know you read certain sources  
**1:21:25-1:21:32:**  say oh it's toxic for livestock and then you read other sources or farmers you know that  
**1:21:32-1:21:36:**  say well actually it's high in protein or whatever and animals really benefit from it  
**1:21:36-1:21:40:**  but you know let's say i'm a bit cautious because i've heard these these two stories  
**1:21:40-1:21:45:**  i've planted my trees and and now it's coming to the moment where i could start cutting  
**1:21:45-1:21:50:**  a few branches off and feeding it to my animals um yeah what's the approach there i think  
**1:21:50-1:21:55:**  exactly like you said cutting a few branches don't give them too much give them just a  
**1:21:55-1:22:02:**  little bit and allow them to sample it cautiously you know to do to do their sampling of it  
**1:22:02-1:22:09:**  and then uh let them become familiar you know we did it we did a a bunch of studies with  
**1:22:09-1:22:16:**  sheep and cattle not with black locust but that relate and uh they had to do with with  
**1:22:16-1:22:22:**  feeding animals grain and high grain diets and grain grain can make animals sick right  
**1:22:22-1:22:31:**  they can you can get quite sick on on grain acidosis and become incredibly ill and uh  
**1:22:31-1:22:37:**  the studies we were doing with sheep and cattle were were simply they were in feedlot and  
**1:22:37-1:22:41:**  it was during the last two three months of their life we were finishing them before we  
**1:22:41-1:22:47:**  slaughtered them and we had one set of animals that was on a total mixed ration so they didn't  
**1:22:47-1:22:53:**  have any choice we ground four four different four different uh sources alfalfa hay corn  
**1:22:53-1:23:02:**  silage corn barley things like that were ground and mixed and put into the ration or we simply  
**1:23:02-1:23:07:**  offered animals a choice of the ingredients allowed them to to select free choice all  
**1:23:07-1:23:12:**  you want eat away and people said you know you're going to make them sick on the grain  
**1:23:12-1:23:16:**  they're going to get sick on the grain and we were we thought a lot about that too but  
**1:23:16-1:23:23:**  what we realized is that if we put them on the other foods the alfalfa hay the corn silage  
**1:23:23-1:23:30:**  the foods that are safe and then we very gradually introduce the grain very gradually introduce  
**1:23:30-1:23:36:**  the grain to them they learn how much grain they can eat and we could offer we could offer  
**1:23:36-1:23:40:**  free choice all those ingredients and they would simply self-regulate their their intake  
**1:23:40-1:23:46:**  we never got any animals sick and it the point the key point is the point that you're making  
**1:23:46-1:23:53:**  introduce it gradually let them let them figure we could have made them very sick and the  
**1:23:53-1:23:58:**  way that happens is if animals have eaten a little bit of grain like a candy bar right  
**1:23:58-1:24:03:**  you have a little piece of candy a little piece of chocolate it's it's wonderful but  
**1:24:03-1:24:07:**  if you eat the whole box of chocolate you're going to get sick and if you don't understand  
**1:24:07-1:24:13:**  that the first time you get exposed to the whole box maybe you eat it and get sick that's  
**1:24:13-1:24:16:**  the way that that we're able to make sheep and cattle get sick give them just a little  
**1:24:16-1:24:24:**  bit and then someday give them all they want they can eat they can eat so much so quickly  
**1:24:24-1:24:30:**  that they don't realize if you allow them to to learn that this stuff can make you sick  
**1:24:30-1:24:37:**  by gradually introducing it into the diet then we I'm thinking of studies we did with  
**1:24:37-1:24:44:**  with sheep right now too where we had 24 individuals as uniform as you could make them age sex  
**1:24:44-1:24:54:**  everything else and we offered them a choice of of alfalfa pellets or or barley and it  
**1:24:54-1:24:59:**  was amazing to see no animals ever got sick and you'd have everything from animals that  
**1:24:59-1:25:04:**  wanted hardly any barley at all and mostly alfalfa hay all the way across the ones that  
**1:25:04-1:25:10:**  ate large amount of barley and not much hay you know and they were all growing doing just  
**1:25:10-1:25:15:**  fine that gets to I say that because it gets to so many points we're making how they're  
**1:25:15-1:25:22:**  built and how they're function each one's different right and so they they do what what  
**1:25:22-1:25:30:**  works for their their particular body all growing and developing just just fine but  
**1:25:30-1:25:35:**  so back to your your point it's to gradually if you have something that could be potentially  
**1:25:35-1:25:43:**  harmful gradually introducing that into the diet and and allowing them to to figure out  
**1:25:43-1:25:48:**  each one what's what works for them how much they can eat of that and then goes to another  
**1:25:48-1:25:54:**  point that you we alluded to and we've as we've mentioned the other the other items  
**1:25:54-1:26:01:**  that are in their diet are going to influence how much of that black locust they they can  
**1:26:01-1:26:06:**  actually eat and do do well with goes back to your point that some producers say this  
**1:26:06-1:26:11:**  is a toxic plant others say oh no my animals do well it's a great source of protein what  
**1:26:11-1:26:17:**  else is in the diet is is influence their animals themselves what else is in the diet  
**1:26:17-1:26:24:**  all those factors are are influencing the response of the animals and so you can take  
**1:26:24-1:26:28:**  that's what's amazed me over the years you can take exactly the same thing and is it  
**1:26:28-1:26:34:**  good or not good well it all depends always all depends on all these things the factors  
**1:26:34-1:26:39:**  we've been talking about you know we're gonna take this interview towards an end but I do  
**1:26:39-1:26:46:**  have one last question if you have the patience it's about you know how do you include this  
**1:26:46-1:26:52:**  imperative of diversity as you plan the movement of animals through the landscape we're moving  
**1:26:52-1:26:57:**  a bit away from maybe agroforestry here but I think it is important because anyone managing  
**1:26:57-1:27:03:**  animals is going to think about paddocks and what to include and and what to exclude and  
**1:27:03-1:27:08:**  you know on the one hand you kind of want to do homogeneous paddocks because you want  
**1:27:08-1:27:15:**  to have animals eat kind of evenly the plants but on the other hand you want to have diversity  
**1:27:15-1:27:22:**  overall so I guess my question is what temporal window do you have for diversity do animals  
**1:27:22-1:27:27:**  have to have like diversity every day is it okay for them to have you know eats diversity  
**1:27:27-1:27:31:**  within the month within the weeks what kind of window do you have to give them diverse  
**1:27:31-1:27:37:**  plants you know I think to the degree that you can enable animals to have diversity within  
**1:27:37-1:27:45:**  the day that's a good thing they can certainly survive fine without diversity in the day  
**1:27:45-1:27:53:**  you know there are times when when they're going to have have moved more toward monotony  
**1:27:53-1:28:01:**  I think during the winter time here and people feed alfalfa hay all winter long on on out  
**1:28:01-1:28:07:**  on on pasture there's not a lot of diversity that they have they they they perform they're  
**1:28:07-1:28:15:**  able to do it so so I think it's you know it's a question of what's feasible what's  
**1:28:15-1:28:21:**  possible to do and animals can certainly make it when when if the quality of the food is  
**1:28:21-1:28:27:**  good enough they can certainly make it during the winter without diversity to the degree  
**1:28:27-1:28:37:**  that a person can include diversity daily weekly seasonally I think it has huge value  
**1:28:37-1:28:42:**  I often think from some of the studies we did back in the days and work we did I used  
**1:28:42-1:28:48:**  to think back when we were looking at how experience early in life influences animals  
**1:28:48-1:28:53:**  ability to utilize foods you know if a little bit's good whole bunch is even better and  
**1:28:53-1:29:00:**  when when we would give them other choices after they'd been on the same food for weeks  
**1:29:00-1:29:06:**  and weeks oh they they couldn't you could see they couldn't wait to get to eat something  
**1:29:06-1:29:12:**  different you know they were sick and tired of eating the same old thing and I think that  
**1:29:12-1:29:18:**  you know if we had to eat the same thing meal after meal after meal day after day after  
**1:29:18-1:29:25:**  day we we don't like that we don't like that and in part we don't like that because it's  
**1:29:25-1:29:31:**  hard to have one food that absolutely meets all of our needs all of our needs nutritionally  
**1:29:31-1:29:37:**  as well as medicinally when we get a variety of foods it helps us to do that so I think  
**1:29:37-1:29:42:**  that's part of what what's getting manifest in the animals and then to the degree that  
**1:29:42-1:29:48:**  we can give them diversity in the pasture choices and the ways that we do that I think  
**1:29:48-1:29:54:**  it's it's a good thing for for their health and well-being for their welfare I think they  
**1:29:54-1:29:59:**  become less stressed when and I'm thinking this from studies we've done that look at  
**1:29:59-1:30:06:**  cortisol levels in in the in the animals I think they're less stressed when when they  
**1:30:06-1:30:13:**  have choices and ability to choose I probably shouldn't shouldn't digress to this degree  
**1:30:13-1:30:18:**  right here but I'll say one other thing for you you can cut it if you want but I mentioned  
**1:30:18-1:30:25:**  Pablo Gregorini earlier and the work he's doing with diversity and he has one of him  
**1:30:25-1:30:30:**  is one of his grad students did a study where they offered ewes while they were pregnant  
**1:30:30-1:30:39:**  either a diverse array of different plant species or pretty much a very limited choice  
**1:30:39-1:30:45:**  and then they looked at cortisol levels in the hair of the lambs at birth they looked  
**1:30:45-1:30:53:**  at and cortisol is the hormone involved with stress and the the the ones whose mothers  
**1:30:53-1:31:00:**  had been on on a really pretty much monoculture diet had much higher levels of cortisol in  
**1:31:00-1:31:06:**  their hair at birth so that's reflecting that mothers in more of a stressed condition during  
**1:31:06-1:31:14:**  pregnancy than not you know and I guess if I was was asked ahead of time would would  
**1:31:14-1:31:18:**  you see a difference Pablo I'd say I don't know that you would but here you know here  
**1:31:18-1:31:23:**  he's showing big differences in terms of cortisol stress levels during pregnancy as a function  
**1:31:23-1:31:29:**  of having diverse foods versus versus no food so can they make it on on monoculture certainly  
**1:31:29-1:31:36:**  they can wild wild animals do it and domestic too do they like it probably not if they can  
**1:31:36-1:31:42:**  have diverse some diversity probably good for them I think that's a that's a really  
**1:31:42-1:31:49:**  nice conclusion to this interview and I really want to thank you for such a stimulating conversation  
**1:31:49-1:31:55:**  and a lot of things to think about and I'm sure our listeners will have enjoyed it as

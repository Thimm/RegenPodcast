### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 15:33:41)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:46:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:46-0:00:49:**  We're your host Dimitri Ennityan and today we interviewed Christian and Sarah from the  
**0:00:49-0:00:52:**  Regen Network.  
**0:00:52-0:00:57:**  This interview was very interesting for us because as agroforestry farmers, we know that  
**0:00:57-0:01:04:**  the systems that we put into place have huge benefits in terms of carbon storage, biodiversity  
**0:01:04-0:01:07:**  and even de-polluting a farmlands.  
**0:01:07-0:01:13:**  And these are things that aren't valued economically or are difficult to value economically currently.  
**0:01:13-0:01:18:**  And this is what Regen Network has been working on, providing potential for farmers to benefit  
**0:01:18-0:01:22:**  from all these ecosystem services that they're investing time and money into.  
**0:01:22-0:01:25:**  Yeah, absolutely Dimitri.  
**0:01:25-0:01:31:**  What's amazing is that we hear a lot about carbon credits or biodiversity credits, payment  
**0:01:31-0:01:36:**  for ecosystem services and the reality is that it's quite confusing and hard to get  
**0:01:36-0:01:37:**  your head around.  
**0:01:37-0:01:42:**  And we're really lucky because Christian and Sarah are actually able to work really well  
**0:01:42-0:01:46:**  together in this interview to give us both like a big picture understanding as well as  
**0:01:46-0:01:49:**  zooming in into the really technical details.  
**0:01:49-0:01:53:**  So I really came out with a much better understanding of what we're talking about and that is important  
**0:01:53-0:01:58:**  because I'm sure these payment mechanisms are going to become more and more important  
**0:01:58-0:01:59:**  in the farm economy.  
**0:01:59-0:02:00:**  Super.  
**0:02:00-0:02:04:**  So without further ado, let's get into it.  
**0:02:04-0:02:07:**  So Sarah and Christian, welcome on the podcast.  
**0:02:07-0:02:08:**  Thanks so much.  
**0:02:08-0:02:09:**  So glad to be here.  
**0:02:09-0:02:10:**  Thanks for having us.  
**0:02:10-0:02:13:**  So very excited to have this chat with you.  
**0:02:13-0:02:17:**  We'd love to know a bit more about yourselves to start off with.  
**0:02:17-0:02:21:**  It would be amazing if you could just quickly introduce yourself and tell us how you got  
**0:02:21-0:02:23:**  into this adventure.  
**0:02:23-0:02:24:**  Sure.  
**0:02:24-0:02:27:**  I guess I can start out.  
**0:02:27-0:02:29:**  My name's Christian Shearer.  
**0:02:29-0:02:34:**  I'm a permaculture practitioner for a long time.  
**0:02:34-0:02:40:**  I guess this part of my life started about 17 years ago when I started a permaculture  
**0:02:40-0:02:45:**  education center in Northern Thailand.  
**0:02:45-0:02:50:**  I assume that many of your listeners are familiar with permaculture, but for those who are not,  
**0:02:50-0:02:55:**  permaculture is a design science that's based around working in harmony with nature, seeing  
**0:02:55-0:03:01:**  how that we can work with natural systems rather than against natural systems.  
**0:03:01-0:03:06:**  And certainly when we're talking about agroforestry and other agricultural systems, it really,  
**0:03:06-0:03:09:**  really comes into play.  
**0:03:09-0:03:13:**  Harvesting water, catching water, recycling nutrients, all this stuff is at the center  
**0:03:13-0:03:20:**  of really productive permaculture systems.  
**0:03:20-0:03:24:**  I lived in Southeast Asia for a long time and worked with smallholder farmers and then  
**0:03:24-0:03:31:**  got wrapped up in really in all sorts of different ecological agriculture applications and just  
**0:03:31-0:03:38:**  started to see how hard farmers work and how little reward they get for that, whether that's  
**0:03:38-0:03:46:**  financial reward or emotional reward for that, which is just crazy because all of us literally  
**0:03:46-0:03:52:**  survive off of the work of our farmers.  
**0:03:52-0:03:58:**  In all those years, I have come to really respect and appreciate the hard work of farmers  
**0:03:58-0:04:04:**  all around the world and wanted to do what I could to contribute to not only farmers  
**0:04:04-0:04:09:**  doing better in their lives, but helping them to shift towards more ecologically friendly  
**0:04:09-0:04:15:**  systems because my passion for agriculture comes in two fronts.  
**0:04:15-0:04:20:**  It's both in a passion for working with farmers and seeing rural and agricultural communities  
**0:04:20-0:04:25:**  thrive and that means financially better off and ecologically better off.  
**0:04:25-0:04:29:**  And then my passion also lies in the realm of ecological health.  
**0:04:29-0:04:35:**  And I see agriculture as one of the most important levers in the world for reversing global climate  
**0:04:35-0:04:42:**  change, improving our ecological situation and upgrading ecology all around the world.  
**0:04:42-0:04:48:**  So my work with TerraGenesis International, my previous company was all about that.  
**0:04:48-0:04:52:**  My work with Regen Network at this time is all about that.  
**0:04:52-0:04:58:**  And it's exciting to see how much action is happening in that space.  
**0:04:58-0:04:59:**  Nice.  
**0:04:59-0:05:00:**  It's very interesting.  
**0:05:00-0:05:03:**  Sarah, maybe you can introduce yourself as well.  
**0:05:03-0:05:06:**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**0:05:06-0:05:12:**  My name is Sarah Baxendale and I'm the Director of Finance for Regen Network currently.  
**0:05:12-0:05:16:**  And I am a banking assistant turned farmer.  
**0:05:16-0:05:24:**  I was working in New York City in a fancy corporate job and I became involved with the  
**0:05:24-0:05:30:**  Occupy Wall Street movement in Zuccotti Park in the financial district and was one of the  
**0:05:30-0:05:34:**  coordinators of the sustainability working group there.  
**0:05:34-0:05:40:**  And in conjunction with the New York based environmental activism community I became  
**0:05:40-0:05:44:**  a part of, I became very exposed to permaculture.  
**0:05:44-0:05:49:**  So I too am a permaculture designer and teacher.  
**0:05:49-0:05:58:**  So it was a really interesting way to be introduced to conversations around environmental impact  
**0:05:58-0:05:59:**  in New York City.  
**0:05:59-0:06:06:**  So a lot of my work, which is sort of different than Christian's work, is that my work has  
**0:06:06-0:06:11:**  been primarily urban in my career over the last decade or so.  
**0:06:11-0:06:18:**  And I've worked with, at this point, about at least 100 small projects in Boston, in  
**0:06:18-0:06:26:**  Philadelphia, in New York, and Pittsburgh primarily around designing and implementing  
**0:06:26-0:06:30:**  urban ecological design solutions.  
**0:06:30-0:06:37:**  So I'm a lover of the city and my permaculture background is very city permaculture as the  
**0:06:37-0:06:43:**  way that we were taught to look at design systems using the patterns of nature.  
**0:06:43-0:06:50:**  And so my work took me most recently to the state of Pennsylvania, which is in the US  
**0:06:50-0:06:52:**  mid-Atlantic region.  
**0:06:52-0:06:59:**  And for the past six years prior to joining Regen Network, I worked as a park planner  
**0:06:59-0:07:05:**  for the city of Pittsburgh and I helped to redesign over a thousand acres of parkland  
**0:07:05-0:07:13:**  using green infrastructure projects as a way to manage stormwater combined sewer overflow  
**0:07:13-0:07:18:**  that the EPA was demanding that the city of Pittsburgh manage.  
**0:07:18-0:07:25:**  And I had the privilege, because my family is from Pittsburgh, to actually work on the  
**0:07:25-0:07:33:**  street where my grandfather grew up helping to redevelop a property that was formerly  
**0:07:33-0:07:38:**  a federal housing authority complex that was 107 acres.  
**0:07:38-0:07:43:**  And we, over six years in conjunction with the community and the city, turned it into  
**0:07:43-0:07:47:**  the largest urban agriculture farm in the United States.  
**0:07:47-0:07:54:**  And it contains the first adult urban farmer training program where adults can come and  
**0:07:54-0:07:59:**  rent a quarter acre, a half acre, and start a business.  
**0:07:59-0:08:06:**  It also contains the largest orchard in the city of Pittsburgh with 252 fruit trees, the  
**0:08:06-0:08:14:**  largest children's farm in the mid-Atlantic region at an acre and a half, and it is also  
**0:08:14-0:08:20:**  a restoration forest project where the land has been put in permanent preservation.  
**0:08:20-0:08:25:**  So I managed a very, very large urban agriculture redevelopment project.  
**0:08:25-0:08:31:**  It's actually one of Obama's top six sustainability projects in the country.  
**0:08:31-0:08:37:**  And when I left there, I had the privilege of joining Regen Network and bringing the  
**0:08:37-0:08:42:**  whole idea that you should know the name of your farmer and that we all eat three times  
**0:08:42-0:08:49:**  a day and that farmers need technical and financial support to be successful.  
**0:08:49-0:08:55:**  And so I bring all the lens of having been a farmer myself and having a great desire  
**0:08:55-0:09:01:**  to empower farmers across the globe, as well as directly affect climate change to the work  
**0:09:01-0:09:05:**  that I have the privilege of doing with Regen.  
**0:09:05-0:09:06:**  Nice.  
**0:09:06-0:09:15:**  I would say maybe the perfect time to ask you guys, what is Regen exactly and what does  
**0:09:15-0:09:16:**  it do?  
**0:09:16-0:09:23:**  My co-founder Gregory Landwey and I started Regen Network back in 2017 after working with  
**0:09:23-0:09:30:**  our company, TerraGenesis International, on trying to help natural products companies  
**0:09:30-0:09:37:**  shift their supply from organic and fair trade supply to regenerative supply.  
**0:09:37-0:09:40:**  And most of those companies had no idea what that meant, and we were trying to help them  
**0:09:40-0:09:45:**  understand what it meant and help them figure out how they could intervene with their supply  
**0:09:45-0:09:52:**  chains and upgrade them towards agroforestry and cover cropping and rotational grazed animals,  
**0:09:52-0:09:53:**  etc.  
**0:09:53-0:09:58:**  But one of the things that we realized is that the technology was not there to serve  
**0:09:58-0:10:00:**  that purpose.  
**0:10:00-0:10:05:**  And so we ended up starting a branch of TerraGenesis called Regen Network, which then ended up  
**0:10:05-0:10:08:**  becoming its own company.  
**0:10:08-0:10:13:**  So let me dive into that a little bit, and I'm going to stay rather high level here because  
**0:10:13-0:10:17:**  I want us to get to the point where we're actually talking about how it affects agroforestry  
**0:10:17-0:10:20:**  and ecological agriculture.  
**0:10:20-0:10:24:**  But to begin with, there's two layers to our company.  
**0:10:24-0:10:28:**  And on this call, we're mostly going to be focusing on the second layer of our work because  
**0:10:28-0:10:33:**  that's where it crosses with agriculture.  
**0:10:33-0:10:36:**  But let me give a high level overview of both of those layers.  
**0:10:36-0:10:39:**  So first of all is the layer one portion of our work.  
**0:10:39-0:10:46:**  This is the underlying technological infrastructure for ecological data and ecological agreements.  
**0:10:46-0:10:54:**  We recognized that there needed to be a new set of infrastructure, a new set of tools  
**0:10:54-0:11:04:**  that underlies the way in which people share data, create agreements, have transparency  
**0:11:04-0:11:07:**  around what's real and what's not real.  
**0:11:07-0:11:13:**  It literally lays down the road upon which all the eco projects can travel.  
**0:11:13-0:11:15:**  It's like a shared resource.  
**0:11:15-0:11:18:**  That makes sense.  
**0:11:18-0:11:19:**  Yeah.  
**0:11:19-0:11:25:**  And the way that we're building Regen Network, once it's built, it's put out into the commons.  
**0:11:25-0:11:27:**  It's 100% open source.  
**0:11:27-0:11:29:**  It's governed by the community.  
**0:11:29-0:11:31:**  It's transparent and open.  
**0:11:31-0:11:37:**  And it's built this way so that all the different stakeholders can have a shared understanding  
**0:11:37-0:11:42:**  and shared trust about what's true and what isn't true about ecological data and ecological  
**0:11:42-0:11:43:**  agreements.  
**0:11:43-0:11:49:**  Because part of our belief right now is that the problem, the ecological challenge that  
**0:11:49-0:11:56:**  the world is facing has a lot to do with an imbalance in people's access to information.  
**0:11:56-0:12:02:**  So one party will say, yeah, these things happened.  
**0:12:02-0:12:06:**  We have regenerated the soil in this place.  
**0:12:06-0:12:09:**  And the other people are like, how do we know that that's true?  
**0:12:09-0:12:13:**  And they're like, well, you just need to trust us because we have the data.  
**0:12:13-0:12:14:**  We have the scientists.  
**0:12:14-0:12:15:**  Just trust us.  
**0:12:15-0:12:17:**  It's true.  
**0:12:17-0:12:24:**  And the worst example of this are the oil companies and the mining and extraction companies  
**0:12:24-0:12:27:**  that make claims about what happened at their sites.  
**0:12:27-0:12:33:**  And then later on, we find out that those claims are completely false.  
**0:12:33-0:12:37:**  But it's because they had the money to hire the scientists.  
**0:12:37-0:12:42:**  And then the scientists made the conclusions that they asked them to make.  
**0:12:42-0:12:47:**  With Regen Networks layer one infrastructure, that's not going to be possible anymore.  
**0:12:47-0:12:52:**  If you want to make scientific claims, you're going to have to publish the methodologies  
**0:12:52-0:12:57:**  that you're using and make public the ways in which you're making those claims.  
**0:12:57-0:13:02:**  So that layer one technology is built with blockchain infrastructure.  
**0:13:02-0:13:08:**  It's built with a whole software development toolkit that enables third party application  
**0:13:08-0:13:13:**  developers to be able to build all sorts of different applications on top of it.  
**0:13:13-0:13:18:**  There's a whole world of interesting things we could go into there, but I'm going to stop  
**0:13:18-0:13:21:**  there for the layer one.  
**0:13:21-0:13:24:**  Unless you guys have questions, we certainly can go there.  
**0:13:24-0:13:29:**  I think we're going to delve into that also after some aspects that we want to understand  
**0:13:29-0:13:31:**  better for sure, but keep going.  
**0:13:31-0:13:32:**  Great.  
**0:13:32-0:13:33:**  Great.  
**0:13:33-0:13:38:**  And then layer two is the applications that are built using that infrastructure.  
**0:13:38-0:13:43:**  And at Regen Network, our first application is called Regen Registry.  
**0:13:43-0:13:48:**  It's a registry for carbon and other ecosystem services credits that aims at democratizing  
**0:13:48-0:13:53:**  the carbon credit markets and acknowledging whole systems regeneration rather than just  
**0:13:53-0:14:01:**  fragmenting carbon into a stand alone solution to the world's problems.  
**0:14:01-0:14:09:**  So the aim of the registry, the aim of Regen Registry is to be a marketplace for a world  
**0:14:09-0:14:15:**  of different ecosystem services credits because we understand that all of the farmers out  
**0:14:15-0:14:18:**  there are all working in their own context.  
**0:14:18-0:14:23:**  Each watershed is its own unique place with its own unique context.  
**0:14:23-0:14:32:**  And the management practices and the varieties of fruit and nuts and animals that you're  
**0:14:32-0:14:35:**  implementing are different than somewhere else in the world.  
**0:14:35-0:14:42:**  And so the verification of ecological outcomes that are happening in your place is going  
**0:14:42-0:14:45:**  to be unique from other places.  
**0:14:45-0:14:52:**  We want to enable that uniqueness to shine through.  
**0:14:52-0:14:56:**  With Regen Registry, every project gets its own project page.  
**0:14:56-0:15:01:**  Every credit issued from that project is tracked and recorded transparently through the layer  
**0:15:01-0:15:03:**  one technology.  
**0:15:03-0:15:08:**  And to make it really clear how this works, there's really three parts to this project  
**0:15:08-0:15:10:**  and to this process.  
**0:15:10-0:15:14:**  And Sarah is going to be much better at diving into the details of this.  
**0:15:14-0:15:17:**  But just on a high level, talk about those three parts.  
**0:15:17-0:15:24:**  First of all, when a farmer or rancher approaches us about issuing credits on our site, the  
**0:15:24-0:15:28:**  first thing we need to do is think about methodology design.  
**0:15:28-0:15:35:**  What methodology are we going to use to verify that real world impact has actually happened  
**0:15:35-0:15:36:**  on your site?  
**0:15:36-0:15:39:**  And then the second thing is monitoring and reporting.  
**0:15:39-0:15:44:**  How do we collect the data to understand what has really happened and what's the right data  
**0:15:44-0:15:45:**  to collect?  
**0:15:45-0:15:51:**  And then third thing is the credit issuance and then the sales of those credits to corporations  
**0:15:51-0:15:55:**  or individuals that are looking to meet their climate commitments.  
**0:15:55-0:16:05:**  I wanted to just ask a question that's still in that kind of bigger picture, but how can  
**0:16:05-0:16:10:**  Regen Network then support agroforestry systems?  
**0:16:10-0:16:13:**  Just to make it really clear for our listeners.  
**0:16:13-0:16:17:**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**0:16:17-0:16:25:**  One of the fundamental theories of change that Regen Network is holding is that if the  
**0:16:25-0:16:37:**  economics of agriculture shifts in a direction such that farmers and ranchers are financially  
**0:16:37-0:16:44:**  incentivized to use ecologically friendly practices rather than using chemical and conventional  
**0:16:44-0:16:51:**  practices that management practices around the world could rapidly change.  
**0:16:51-0:16:55:**  Because we're talking about individual people, individual families that are making these  
**0:16:55-0:16:59:**  choices year by year about how it is that they're going to manage their properties.  
**0:16:59-0:17:06:**  As soon as they understand that the farmer or rancher down the road is getting paid more  
**0:17:06-0:17:10:**  because they're employing ecological farming practices rather than employing the other  
**0:17:10-0:17:16:**  way, then that becomes very interesting for them to shift their practices.  
**0:17:16-0:17:24:**  So Regen Network is building the infrastructure to be able to monitor and verify ecological  
**0:17:24-0:17:35:**  impact, issue digitally secure digital assets that allow them to sell that impact as a second  
**0:17:35-0:17:43:**  yield on their property and thus benefit financially from those actions.  
**0:17:43-0:17:46:**  Okay, that's super interesting.  
**0:17:46-0:17:53:**  And possibly could you share with us, we talked about it previously when we were talking before  
**0:17:53-0:17:58:**  the interview about this example about this farm that you've started working with.  
**0:17:58-0:18:03:**  Could you describe a bit more how this works in practice?  
**0:18:03-0:18:10:**  Yeah, so the example you are referring to is called Wilmot Farm and it is a many thousand  
**0:18:10-0:18:16:**  hectare ranch in Australia and New South Wales.  
**0:18:16-0:18:24:**  This is our first carbon credit issuance for what we call the carbon plus grasslands methods.  
**0:18:24-0:18:28:**  And what's happening on this ranch is that you have this really innovative rancher who  
**0:18:28-0:18:35:**  has been doing high intensity rotational grazing for a number of years and what we were able  
**0:18:35-0:18:43:**  to measure using a combination of soil samples and remote sensing methods as we were able  
**0:18:43-0:18:49:**  to measure the increases in soil organic carbon over time from these clusters of cattle sort  
**0:18:49-0:18:54:**  of like rapidly moving around the property to different paddocks at different times of  
**0:18:54-0:18:56:**  the year.  
**0:18:56-0:19:02:**  And what's really great about working with a project like Wilmot Farm is that they are  
**0:19:02-0:19:09:**  a very talented series of practitioners and what they're doing is essentially the example  
**0:19:09-0:19:14:**  that we think can be adopted in that particular region of the world.  
**0:19:14-0:19:20:**  And by being able to work with this sort of like gold star use case example that allows  
**0:19:20-0:19:27:**  us to prove in conjunction with this farm that rotational grazing is a way to sequester  
**0:19:27-0:19:32:**  additional carbon in the soil to prove that it can be measured using our remote sensing  
**0:19:32-0:19:41:**  methods and for us to essentially put forth a new type of carbon credit into the marketplace.  
**0:19:41-0:19:45:**  And we think about carbon credits a little bit differently than the way they've been  
**0:19:45-0:19:47:**  thought about historically.  
**0:19:47-0:19:54:**  Our approach we've dubbed carbon plus and what we recognize is that carbon credit buyers  
**0:19:54-0:20:00:**  are looking for those carbon outcomes that can be monitored and verified and packaged  
**0:20:00-0:20:06:**  into a carbon credit because everybody's trying to sink as much carbon back into the earth  
**0:20:06-0:20:11:**  or sink carbon through other means in order to immediately address climate challenges  
**0:20:11-0:20:13:**  and climate impacts.  
**0:20:13-0:20:18:**  But the way that we look at projects is through this lens that Krishna has been describing  
**0:20:18-0:20:21:**  this ecological agriculture.  
**0:20:21-0:20:28:**  And so we have this pile of ecological co-benefits that are the plus part of the plus in the  
**0:20:28-0:20:34:**  carbon credits and there we look at other indicators on a property of what's happening  
**0:20:34-0:20:38:**  to the ecosystem because of this change in practice.  
**0:20:38-0:20:44:**  So in the example of Wilmot Farm we were able to use remote sensing to come up with a metric  
**0:20:44-0:20:50:**  to look at the quality of ecosystem vigor across the entire property to come up with  
**0:20:50-0:20:56:**  metrics that looked more holistically at the quality of the soil health.  
**0:20:56-0:21:03:**  And then more generally depending on the type of project we can look at other types of indicators  
**0:21:03-0:21:11:**  like biodiversity indicators or density of forest or water quality improvements or decreases  
**0:21:11-0:21:14:**  in flooding on a property.  
**0:21:14-0:21:19:**  The co-benefits indicators are all kind of uniquely packaged with the best management  
**0:21:19-0:21:24:**  practice that we are monitoring for the carbon outcomes.  
**0:21:24-0:21:29:**  In the example you explained you're measuring carbon that has already been stored in the  
**0:21:29-0:21:34:**  soil and I'm wondering is that how you're going to measure in the future?  
**0:21:34-0:21:39:**  If I'm going to give an example in agroforestry would you always issue credits on carbon that  
**0:21:39-0:21:45:**  has already been stored in the soil that is on a mature agroforestry system or would you  
**0:21:45-0:21:52:**  also have a way of incentivizing a change in practice that would deliver that carbon  
**0:21:52-0:21:54:**  storage in the future?  
**0:21:54-0:22:00:**  Yeah, so we can actually do both.  
**0:22:00-0:22:10:**  What we're limited by are we use the Sentinel-2 satellites in the European Space Agency that  
**0:22:10-0:22:11:**  went up in 2016.  
**0:22:11-0:22:17:**  So starting in 2017 they started to have really good global imagery data that's all free and  
**0:22:17-0:22:19:**  publicly available.  
**0:22:19-0:22:29:**  So any property that has been doing practices as early as 2017 we could establish 2017 as  
**0:22:29-0:22:35:**  a baseline for a project if they have the appropriate input data for the method that  
**0:22:35-0:22:37:**  we're using.  
**0:22:37-0:22:40:**  So our approach allows us to do two things.  
**0:22:40-0:22:47:**  It allows us to say, okay you've already got 100 almond trees, you historically planted  
**0:22:47-0:22:52:**  them, but we can monitor the increase in the scale of those trees and the increase in the  
**0:22:52-0:22:56:**  soil organic carbon from 2017 forward.  
**0:22:56-0:23:03:**  We also have the opportunity and have historically partnered with projects where people are starting  
**0:23:03-0:23:04:**  from a blank slate.  
**0:23:04-0:23:07:**  It's just an empty piece of property.  
**0:23:07-0:23:10:**  They want to plant 100 fruit trees.  
**0:23:10-0:23:16:**  They want to then do it in order to issue carbon credits as well as glean all the fruit  
**0:23:16-0:23:18:**  products off of it.  
**0:23:18-0:23:23:**  And in those cases we have the ability to partner with someone and model out how much  
**0:23:23-0:23:28:**  carbon that they would get over the 10-year carbon credit issuance time period to give  
**0:23:28-0:23:34:**  them a sense of how much funding they might receive for their best management practice  
**0:23:34-0:23:41:**  decisions and then partner with them to monitor that property over that time period, issue  
**0:23:41-0:23:47:**  those credits, help to sell those credits to individuals and companies that are interested  
**0:23:47-0:23:53:**  in a high quality holistic agriculture and ecology based carbon credit and ultimately  
**0:23:53-0:24:00:**  help those farmers and ranchers receive money for the ecological outcome benefits of having  
**0:24:00-0:24:04:**  planted those agroforestry systems on their property.  
**0:24:04-0:24:09:**  So we have the ability to do both and the ability to meet a project where it's at just  
**0:24:09-0:24:13:**  depending on who it is and what part of the world that they're in and where they are at.  
**0:24:13-0:24:18:**  It makes it very easy for us to meet people where they're at and then help them move forward  
**0:24:18-0:24:24:**  from wherever it is that they are at and want to get to.  
**0:24:24-0:24:32:**  So basically someone could buy carbon plus credits but based on future carbon sequestration  
**0:24:32-0:24:36:**  and actually buy them and fund the planting of the trees that would then sequester that  
**0:24:36-0:24:41:**  carbon maybe five or ten years down the line.  
**0:24:41-0:24:46:**  Yeah, technically a company has the ability to do so.  
**0:24:46-0:24:54:**  In order for that, in order for us to issue carbon credits for future years, we would  
**0:24:54-0:25:01:**  have to have a company that wants to buy essentially the full decade of monitoring time period  
**0:25:01-0:25:07:**  of credits in order to provide a farmer the funding upfront in order to have the money  
**0:25:07-0:25:10:**  to plant those trees.  
**0:25:10-0:25:17:**  We in a ten year time period do five monitoring rounds with remote sensing and from that we  
**0:25:17-0:25:24:**  issue four batches, four vintages of carbon credits in a ten year time period.  
**0:25:24-0:25:29:**  Great, thanks for clarifying that.  
**0:25:29-0:25:36:**  Just going back to when you were explaining that issuing carbon credits plus also incorporate  
**0:25:36-0:25:40:**  this idea of ecosystem vigor and then go beyond the normal carbon credit.  
**0:25:40-0:25:46:**  Could you tell us a bit more what you're able to measure in terms of ecosystem services  
**0:25:46-0:25:47:**  beyond carbon?  
**0:25:47-0:25:53:**  Sure, so it depends on the system that someone is utilizing.  
**0:25:53-0:25:57:**  We've worked with ranchers doing rotational grazing.  
**0:25:57-0:26:02:**  We've worked with organizations that are using sheep and vineyards.  
**0:26:02-0:26:09:**  We've worked with agroforestry projects and we're starting to work with your sort of standard  
**0:26:09-0:26:13:**  crop farmers or your regenerative crop farmers.  
**0:26:13-0:26:16:**  So it depends on where you are in the world and it depends on the best management practice  
**0:26:16-0:26:19:**  as to what's happening in that ecosystem.  
**0:26:19-0:26:28:**  But it primarily comes down to three or four basic things and you can kind of segment this  
**0:26:28-0:26:31:**  depending on what the practice is.  
**0:26:31-0:26:37:**  We look at ecosystem vigor because we want to look at the ecosystem whole.  
**0:26:37-0:26:42:**  Where there are water bodies on a property we have the ability to look at water patterns  
**0:26:42-0:26:45:**  and water quality.  
**0:26:45-0:26:53:**  We also look at biodiversity, diversity of plant species, diversity of animal species,  
**0:26:53-0:26:59:**  the sort of ecosystem biodiversity interaction of a property.  
**0:26:59-0:27:02:**  And then one of the main indicators that we focus on is soil health.  
**0:27:02-0:27:08:**  So it's really looking at the composition and the quality and the change in soil, the  
**0:27:08-0:27:12:**  change in its water holding capacity, the change in its macro and micronutrients over  
**0:27:12-0:27:13:**  time.  
**0:27:13-0:27:21:**  Because what we've found is that a lot of the sort of untapped, unverified, unmonitored  
**0:27:21-0:27:26:**  carbon that everyone around the world is trying to figure out how to measure is really soil  
**0:27:26-0:27:27:**  carbon.  
**0:27:27-0:27:32:**  A lot of people have figured out like, you know, how much carbon is sequestered by a  
**0:27:32-0:27:37:**  tree over its lifetime, but not a lot of people have figured out how to look at the soil and  
**0:27:37-0:27:43:**  to approach the soil as the big carbon sink that we inherently know that it is.  
**0:27:43-0:27:49:**  So a lot of our ecological indicators are tailored around those three or four pillars.  
**0:27:49-0:27:55:**  And each project, it really is unique because it's in a different part of the country, it's  
**0:27:55-0:28:00:**  in a different part of the world, it's wetter, it's drier, it has a different growing season,  
**0:28:00-0:28:05:**  has different rates of growth of the plant, each farmer is choosing a different best management  
**0:28:05-0:28:06:**  practice.  
**0:28:06-0:28:11:**  So we try to tailor that palette of looking at ecosystem benefits to the unique ecosystem  
**0:28:11-0:28:17:**  that we're in, and tailoring and accompanying that to the choices that each individual farmer  
**0:28:17-0:28:20:**  is making on their property.  
**0:28:20-0:28:23:**  All right, that's fascinating.  
**0:28:23-0:28:27:**  But for me, it really brings up this question of how do you measure all that data in terms  
**0:28:27-0:28:31:**  of you know, what tools are you using to measure for example, biodiversity?  
**0:28:31-0:28:37:**  Yeah, so there's really an amazing amount of information that one can glean from satellite  
**0:28:37-0:28:46:**  data, everything from land use classification to the change in, you know, plant density  
**0:28:46-0:28:53:**  over time, you can also classify different trees and different plant species, once you  
**0:28:53-0:28:59:**  find the spectral signature of one, you can essentially train an algorithm to find that  
**0:28:59-0:29:02:**  plant across a specific area.  
**0:29:02-0:29:04:**  It's really incredible.  
**0:29:04-0:29:09:**  It's really cool, actually, what you can do with the satellite information these days  
**0:29:09-0:29:16:**  and the European Space Agency Sentinel one and two satellites have been becoming increasingly  
**0:29:16-0:29:17:**  more complex.  
**0:29:17-0:29:24:**  So we use that as a way to be able to look at more information faster, and to be able  
**0:29:24-0:29:30:**  to bring down the volume of ground truthing data that is necessary on a property.  
**0:29:30-0:29:37:**  So when we partner with a new project, we have like a whole survey of questions, we  
**0:29:37-0:29:41:**  ask them about what that farmer is seeing on their property, you know, they might be  
**0:29:41-0:29:46:**  seeing that, you know, their fields are becoming more diverse, they're, you know, they didn't  
**0:29:46-0:29:51:**  flood as much as the neighbor did during a certain storm, but their streams are running  
**0:29:51-0:29:52:**  clear.  
**0:29:52-0:29:57:**  And so we gather sort of their qualitative reflections about their own property.  
**0:29:57-0:30:01:**  And then from that, we take a look at what we can do with the available satellite data  
**0:30:01-0:30:06:**  in that area, because it's not always the exact same amount of, you know, satellite  
**0:30:06-0:30:11:**  information, depending on where you're on the world and what time of year it is.  
**0:30:11-0:30:17:**  And then we sit down with the farmer and specifically asked for a limited series of ground truthing  
**0:30:17-0:30:23:**  information that either helps us to have sort of a double check on what we're seeing from  
**0:30:23-0:30:29:**  the satellite, or provides us a limited series of input that we then calibrate the satellite  
**0:30:29-0:30:30:**  to.  
**0:30:30-0:30:37:**  So in the example of soil organic carbon, if you were to, if you're a farmer, and you  
**0:30:37-0:30:41:**  were to engage with one of the existing carbon credit registries, what they asked you to  
**0:30:41-0:30:47:**  do is to essentially take 1000s and 1000s of soil samples across, you know, it might  
**0:30:47-0:30:50:**  be 100 hectare property.  
**0:30:50-0:30:55:**  And people, farmers find that to be too expensive and too cumbersome.  
**0:30:55-0:31:03:**  And so our method conversely, only requires 20 samples randomly around a property for  
**0:31:03-0:31:07:**  a 2000 hectare property size.  
**0:31:07-0:31:14:**  And from those 20 soil samples, we're able to calibrate the satellite, compare and contrast  
**0:31:14-0:31:20:**  the information that we're finding, train the satellite to then map across the rest  
**0:31:20-0:31:21:**  of the area.  
**0:31:21-0:31:26:**  And essentially map the outcomes of those soil sample reports via remote sensing across  
**0:31:26-0:31:29:**  the entire property at scale.  
**0:31:29-0:31:33:**  And what we found from it is, I find very fascinating.  
**0:31:33-0:31:40:**  The remote sensing outcomes are about 93% accurate in comparison to soil samples.  
**0:31:40-0:31:43:**  And given how much, yeah, it's really remarkable.  
**0:31:43-0:31:48:**  And if you think about it, like it's very cumbersome to take a soil sample in the field.  
**0:31:48-0:31:52:**  It takes a long time to wait for the lab.  
**0:31:52-0:31:57:**  It's a whole time intensive, labor intensive process.  
**0:31:57-0:32:00:**  And a lot of times when you're taking soil samples, you're just kind of like taking some  
**0:32:00-0:32:07:**  dirt here, taking some dirt there and hoping that it's representative of the whole property.  
**0:32:07-0:32:13:**  So the method we're using acknowledges the fact that you can, unless you're measuring  
**0:32:13-0:32:19:**  literally every square inch of your property, you're never going to have like a full picture  
**0:32:19-0:32:21:**  of your property's soil anyways.  
**0:32:21-0:32:24:**  It's just not really practically possible.  
**0:32:24-0:32:30:**  So we're finding that remote sensing allows us to circumvent that burdensome process by  
**0:32:30-0:32:34:**  limiting the amount of ground truth data.  
**0:32:34-0:32:36:**  Right now you're talking about carbon in the soil, right?  
**0:32:36-0:32:41:**  You're not measuring the, for example, the nutrient levels and et cetera.  
**0:32:41-0:32:44:**  We are measuring the macro micronutrients.  
**0:32:44-0:32:46:**  We measure all the cation exchanges.  
**0:32:46-0:32:50:**  We may get your bolt density and we measure soil organic carbon.  
**0:32:50-0:32:56:**  And from those, in conjunction with the satellite tools, we are able to measure soil organic  
**0:32:56-0:33:04:**  carbon, carbon stock outcome changes, as well as soil health and soil health metric indicators.  
**0:33:04-0:33:10:**  So they are accompanied together to provide us enough information to use the individual  
**0:33:10-0:33:16:**  tools in an ArcGIS or KGIS scenario that allows us to model outcomes.  
**0:33:16-0:33:20:**  So you'll take the samples, you'll measure samples from the soil to look at the micronutrients  
**0:33:20-0:33:23:**  et cetera, to calibrate the satellite.  
**0:33:23-0:33:26:**  The satellite is not the one that's measuring micronutrients in the soil.  
**0:33:26-0:33:27:**  That is correct.  
**0:33:27-0:33:28:**  Yeah.  
**0:33:28-0:33:33:**  There's a number of like statistical processes and very detailed buttons that are pressed  
**0:33:33-0:33:34:**  along that pathway.  
**0:33:34-0:33:39:**  But the big picture is we take a very limited series of soil samples and use it to calibrate  
**0:33:39-0:33:45:**  the satellite so that it then takes what are in those soil sample outcome data and models  
**0:33:45-0:33:47:**  it across the entire property.  
**0:33:47-0:33:53:**  So you can get a carbon stock outcome or a property wild soil health indicator.  
**0:33:53-0:33:59:**  And if we had a picture in front of us, we have these like beautiful interactive maps  
**0:33:59-0:34:05:**  where it shows the soil organic carbon changes on different parts of the property each time  
**0:34:05-0:34:07:**  it's measured.  
**0:34:07-0:34:12:**  And so we're able to see like the pathway of where cattle have gone because that's the  
**0:34:12-0:34:17:**  pathway of where the carbon is most dense in the property.  
**0:34:17-0:34:23:**  And in the case of Wilmot, we were able to see from the modeled satellite soil organic  
**0:34:23-0:34:27:**  carbon outcomes, the fences of the paddocks.  
**0:34:27-0:34:32:**  You could literally see they were just in this specific area.  
**0:34:32-0:34:34:**  There's clearly a fence there.  
**0:34:34-0:34:39:**  The carbon in this part of the property is higher than it is on the other side of the  
**0:34:39-0:34:43:**  fence where they haven't been for six months.  
**0:34:43-0:34:48:**  Do you get this kind of accuracy with your other indicators as well?  
**0:34:48-0:34:52:**  Because now you mentioned this 93, if I remember percent for the carbon.  
**0:34:52-0:34:56:**  Do you get that with also like biodiversity, water quality?  
**0:34:56-0:34:57:**  Yeah.  
**0:34:57-0:35:05:**  So it's unique to each property and that's where those two are a little bit harder to  
**0:35:05-0:35:08:**  have a, you know, just sort of a black and white response to.  
**0:35:08-0:35:14:**  But part of what we look at with water is we look at water through the lens of soil  
**0:35:14-0:35:15:**  cleaning water.  
**0:35:15-0:35:20:**  So we look at the interactions of the soil health indicators and the water patterns on  
**0:35:20-0:35:21:**  a property.  
**0:35:21-0:35:28:**  So we can actually map with the satellites, the moisture levels and the water patterns  
**0:35:28-0:35:33:**  across the property, which tells us water dynamic information.  
**0:35:33-0:35:38:**  And then if we're say measuring water quality in a stream, we'll have a farmer take just  
**0:35:38-0:35:43:**  like a couple of little water samples, send them to a water lab and then look at the quality  
**0:35:43-0:35:50:**  of the water over time as we look at the quality of the soil health over time.  
**0:35:50-0:35:56:**  As we look at the soil as this cleansing sponge to the water that is on the property itself.  
**0:35:56-0:36:02:**  So that one's a little bit more around dynamic modeling and with remote sensing, you can  
**0:36:02-0:36:09:**  actually model the patterns of waves in the ocean and model the melting of glaciers because  
**0:36:09-0:36:14:**  you can see the dynamic physical changes in those areas.  
**0:36:14-0:36:19:**  And so there's actually an amazing amount of water tools that exist in ArcGIS and QGIS  
**0:36:19-0:36:25:**  to look at watershed wide issues or what's happening in a delta system.  
**0:36:25-0:36:29:**  You know what's happening with erosion from water pattern weather changes already.  
**0:36:29-0:36:30:**  Yeah.  
**0:36:30-0:36:35:**  So just to zoom out a little bit and put a little bit of this into context about our  
**0:36:35-0:36:40:**  business model and the way that we're working as a company, as a company.  
**0:36:40-0:36:46:**  We have an incredible science team that is led by a PhD remote sensing scientist that's  
**0:36:46-0:36:53:**  creating really innovative remote sensing satellite powered methodologies for measuring  
**0:36:53-0:36:55:**  specific indicators on the ground.  
**0:36:55-0:36:59:**  A lot of that is just what Sarah was just describing.  
**0:36:59-0:37:08:**  But I also want to recognize that as a company, we aim to work in a decentralized way where  
**0:37:08-0:37:14:**  region network doesn't need to be the creator of every methodology and the provider of monitoring  
**0:37:14-0:37:18:**  for every single aspect of these properties.  
**0:37:18-0:37:24:**  So it may be that we have a client who says, you know, I am growing a chestnut operation  
**0:37:24-0:37:31:**  in Germany and I've been working with the World Wildlife Fund on bird friendly chestnut  
**0:37:31-0:37:32:**  operations.  
**0:37:32-0:37:38:**  We have a methodology to measure the biodiversity of bird species and we'd like to use that  
**0:37:38-0:37:39:**  methodology.  
**0:37:39-0:37:45:**  And we have all the data collection provided by this third party and at region network,  
**0:37:45-0:37:47:**  we can just say, great.  
**0:37:47-0:37:53:**  We don't know, you know, how robust your methodology is, but it sounds like it's a great tool that's  
**0:37:53-0:37:57:**  been developed by great partners.  
**0:37:57-0:38:05:**  Let's create a credit built around this bird friendly agroforestry operation and, you know,  
**0:38:05-0:38:12:**  call it the, you know, bird friendly biodiversity credit.  
**0:38:12-0:38:17:**  And then as long as we publish the information associated with the methodology itself and  
**0:38:17-0:38:23:**  then publish the outcomes of that, of the application of that methodology, we can then  
**0:38:23-0:38:26:**  put that credit into the public.  
**0:38:26-0:38:36:**  So my main point of sharing this is that if region network was doing this alone, we could  
**0:38:36-0:38:38:**  only get so far in the world.  
**0:38:38-0:38:45:**  But what we're inviting is that we want scientists and universities and nonprofits and other  
**0:38:45-0:38:50:**  organizations to get involved, to create methodologies that work for their specific context and that  
**0:38:50-0:38:54:**  cover specific needs that farmers and ranchers have in their areas.  
**0:38:54-0:39:00:**  And with that information, we can then create a credit class, issue digitally secured credits,  
**0:39:00-0:39:05:**  and then get that financial ball rolling.  
**0:39:05-0:39:10:**  Thanks for, you know, bringing those elements because you preempted one of my questions  
**0:39:10-0:39:13:**  about, you know, scaling up such methodologies.  
**0:39:13-0:39:17:**  But I think it's much clearer now that you've shared these details.  
**0:39:17-0:39:22:**  What I wanted to understand a bit better is, okay, so now it's pretty clear, understand  
**0:39:22-0:39:30:**  how you measure different ecological parameters and assess soil health and ecological health.  
**0:39:30-0:39:34:**  How do you then transform that into a credit that you can sell to a company?  
**0:39:34-0:39:41:**  Yeah, so our, you know, as Christian was saying, you know, the goal of our company, you know,  
**0:39:41-0:39:46:**  is not to be the only ones pressing the buttons for farmers, you know, and doing the monitoring  
**0:39:46-0:39:48:**  or the credit design.  
**0:39:48-0:39:54:**  But the process to issue a credit is that a credit class must first be designed and  
**0:39:54-0:39:57:**  then a methodology to monitor that.  
**0:39:57-0:40:02:**  And it could be, you know, a traditional methodology, it could be remote sensing methodology.  
**0:40:02-0:40:05:**  There's not really any limitations on that.  
**0:40:05-0:40:10:**  Once a methodology is peer reviewed, it's eligible to have credits issued for it.  
**0:40:10-0:40:18:**  So the credit classes specifically talk about how the items or the ecological outcomes that  
**0:40:18-0:40:24:**  have been monitored are packaged together into a carbon plus credit.  
**0:40:24-0:40:29:**  And then ultimately, what physically happens is, you know, we take the outcomes of the  
**0:40:29-0:40:36:**  monitoring reports, we issue on a project page, the number of credits that represent  
**0:40:36-0:40:42:**  the carbon stock and ecological outcome changes between two monitoring periods.  
**0:40:42-0:40:48:**  And then that number of credits becomes available for sale on the regen registry.  
**0:40:48-0:40:55:**  Our company provides an optional service at this phase where if a farmer or, you know,  
**0:40:55-0:41:01:**  an entity already has their own community of buyers, maybe it's the people that sign  
**0:41:01-0:41:08:**  up for the CSA, you know, that this is being issued from, or maybe it's a ranching operation  
**0:41:08-0:41:10:**  that already has local corporate partners.  
**0:41:10-0:41:15:**  If folks can sell their credits themselves, they are welcome to go ahead and sell them  
**0:41:15-0:41:19:**  without the assistance of our company.  
**0:41:19-0:41:23:**  But if people don't have those types of connections, and they have the option of signing up for  
**0:41:23-0:41:29:**  a credit brokerage service, where we work to link them with individuals and corporations  
**0:41:29-0:41:35:**  that have goals of, you know, addressing climate change, and then they're able to purchase  
**0:41:35-0:41:39:**  those credits on the regen registry.  
**0:41:39-0:41:45:**  So mainly the clients at the moment, what motives do these clients have in purchasing  
**0:41:45-0:41:46:**  credits?  
**0:41:46-0:41:50:**  So you mentioned, you could be an organization that wants to act positively on the climate,  
**0:41:50-0:41:56:**  so you buy those credits, or you could be a business that has some regulatory constraints  
**0:41:56-0:41:58:**  as well.  
**0:41:58-0:42:03:**  So our credits all exist in what's called the voluntary market space.  
**0:42:03-0:42:09:**  There's a compliance market space, and that's where a lot of your big energy companies,  
**0:42:09-0:42:12:**  for example, are required to operate.  
**0:42:12-0:42:14:**  So we operate in a voluntary space.  
**0:42:14-0:42:20:**  So companies that are saying, you know, we want to become climate neutral, or carbon  
**0:42:20-0:42:26:**  neutral, or climate positive, and in order to do so, they're unable to address all the  
**0:42:26-0:42:33:**  carbon in their supply chain through, you know, light bulb changes, or, you know, changing  
**0:42:33-0:42:38:**  the way a factory operates, they end up with extra carbon that they theoretically have  
**0:42:38-0:42:41:**  to figure out, you know, how to offset.  
**0:42:41-0:42:46:**  And so we structure our carbon credits as carbon removals, because they are pulling  
**0:42:46-0:42:50:**  carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere into the earth.  
**0:42:50-0:42:57:**  And then we partner with companies that have these goals so that they can pick from a portfolio  
**0:42:57-0:43:01:**  of options that meet their goals.  
**0:43:01-0:43:08:**  And our projects and our credits focus on looking at ecological and social outcome indicators  
**0:43:08-0:43:14:**  that are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which is a series of goals  
**0:43:14-0:43:19:**  that many companies are using to drive their business operations.  
**0:43:19-0:43:25:**  So if I'm a company, and I come to Regen Network, I can look through all the project pages,  
**0:43:25-0:43:31:**  I could say, okay, my employees are really into forests this year, we're going to pick  
**0:43:31-0:43:38:**  forestry projects, and they can pick from a portfolio of projects that are on the registry  
**0:43:38-0:43:42:**  and choose how many carbon credits they want to buy from each project and go ahead and  
**0:43:42-0:43:46:**  place a purchase right there on the platform.  
**0:43:46-0:43:53:**  We have a list of over 1000 companies that have made public commitments to, to reduce  
**0:43:53-0:43:57:**  in their carbon footprint or even going carbon positive over time.  
**0:43:57-0:44:04:**  And this is a huge, there's a huge movement amongst corporations, international corporations  
**0:44:04-0:44:08:**  around the world that are recognizing that governments are not able to solve this problem.  
**0:44:08-0:44:12:**  This is especially true in our country, the United States, where our government is not  
**0:44:12-0:44:15:**  stepping up to solve the climate issue.  
**0:44:15-0:44:20:**  So corporations are stepping in and saying, we're going to take a lead on this.  
**0:44:20-0:44:25:**  And I'm talking about corporations like Microsoft, who recently said, we're going to offset all  
**0:44:25-0:44:29:**  of the carbon that we've ever produced back to 1975.  
**0:44:29-0:44:33:**  I'm talking about corporations like Delta Airlines that earlier in the year came out  
**0:44:33-0:44:38:**  and said, we're going to become the first carbon neutral airline, offsetting all of  
**0:44:38-0:44:45:**  the carbon that our company produces through every aspect of our company.  
**0:44:45-0:44:51:**  You know, that the ride share company lift offsets every single mile that every driver  
**0:44:51-0:44:53:**  in their company drives.  
**0:44:53-0:44:59:**  And through that process, like Sarah was just describing, those companies are incentivized  
**0:44:59-0:45:05:**  to reduce their impact first, you know, how can we, you know, reduce the amount of oil  
**0:45:05-0:45:10:**  that is used or gasoline that's used in our cars in our lift program.  
**0:45:10-0:45:14:**  Let's get people to ride share, let's get people to use bikes rather than cars and use  
**0:45:14-0:45:17:**  little scooters in city rather than taking rides.  
**0:45:17-0:45:21:**  But when they don't do that, because inevitably these companies can never get to net zero  
**0:45:21-0:45:26:**  on their own, they then purchase ecological offsets through a company like ours and through  
**0:45:26-0:45:33:**  the voluntary markets to then get to net zero or get to net positive.  
**0:45:33-0:45:36:**  And that's where the voluntary markets come into play.  
**0:45:36-0:45:41:**  And that's where our company like Regeo Network can really help.  
**0:45:41-0:45:46:**  And how do you decide on the pricing of these carbon credits?  
**0:45:46-0:45:50:**  Because so far I understand pretty well the whole chain of process.  
**0:45:50-0:45:54:**  But then at some point you're left with, okay, well, we have all this ecological data and  
**0:45:54-0:45:57:**  then we have to transform it into a credit with a set price.  
**0:45:57-0:45:58:**  How does that process occur?  
**0:45:58-0:46:04:**  Yeah, I mean, that's a really, really is a market mechanism and it's all over the place.  
**0:46:04-0:46:09:**  For anyone out there that's following the carbon markets, you know that carbon sells  
**0:46:09-0:46:16:**  from anywhere from 40 cents a ton for certain types of carbon all the way up to, you know,  
**0:46:16-0:46:17:**  50 or 100.  
**0:46:17-0:46:25:**  I saw Stripe just bought some carbon for $75 a ton trying to assist in a startup company  
**0:46:25-0:46:30:**  that's working on sequestering carbon in an innovative way.  
**0:46:30-0:46:38:**  So when we go to price the carbon, it's really a matter of what is it that a corporate partner  
**0:46:38-0:46:45:**  is looking for and how can we match what they need in a way that really meets their corporate  
**0:46:45-0:46:51:**  needs and their budgetary needs around this.  
**0:46:51-0:46:54:**  And for us, there's a lot of storytelling involved in this work.  
**0:46:54-0:47:00:**  So not only are we collecting really robust data on what's actually happening on the ground  
**0:47:00-0:47:07:**  and being able to help a corporate buyer know for sure that the money that they're spending  
**0:47:07-0:47:13:**  is actually translated into real world impact, but also we're able to tell that story in  
**0:47:13-0:47:20:**  a way that's really compelling and interesting for the company themselves and their board  
**0:47:20-0:47:26:**  and their shareholders and their customers to really understand that the company is doing  
**0:47:26-0:47:29:**  something real.  
**0:47:29-0:47:35:**  And I'd say the combination of really clear good data that proves real world outcomes  
**0:47:35-0:47:42:**  and a story about a farmer and their family and a place being regenerated, that together  
**0:47:42-0:47:47:**  combines to help us set a price that works for all parties.  
**0:47:47-0:47:52:**  I think it would be really interesting, Christian and Sarah, to start talking a bit about what  
**0:47:52-0:47:58:**  it means for farmers in practice, really from the farmer's perspective.  
**0:47:58-0:48:00:**  And we have a few questions based on that.  
**0:48:00-0:48:06:**  So you already touched upon it earlier on, but maybe we can go into a bit more depth  
**0:48:06-0:48:07:**  here.  
**0:48:07-0:48:13:**  One of the first ones is, how much work does it actually represent for the farmer on the  
**0:48:13-0:48:21:**  ground in order to satisfy the data needs to get a credit?  
**0:48:21-0:48:31:**  So as your listeners know, to farm regeneratively is something that takes a lot of skill.  
**0:48:31-0:48:37:**  And it's something that you're going to be constantly learning and growing your capacity  
**0:48:37-0:48:39:**  in over time.  
**0:48:39-0:48:45:**  As you start to grow your first chestnut trees, you start to grow your first almonds or start  
**0:48:45-0:48:50:**  rotationally grazing your animals, you're going to learn a lot through the process.  
**0:48:50-0:48:54:**  And you're never going to stop getting better at it as long as you continue to take a deep  
**0:48:54-0:48:59:**  interest in what's happening to your property, to your animals, to your trees and to your  
**0:48:59-0:49:02:**  ecology in general.  
**0:49:02-0:49:08:**  So without a doubt, this is something that really does take skill and takes effort.  
**0:49:08-0:49:15:**  Now to answer your questions specifically is very challenging because all of these systems  
**0:49:15-0:49:17:**  are very different.  
**0:49:17-0:49:22:**  And each farmer or rancher has a different background, a different experience, a different  
**0:49:22-0:49:27:**  understanding of how to engage with their soil, with their animals, with their tree  
**0:49:27-0:49:28:**  systems.  
**0:49:28-0:49:40:**  And so each farmer, each rancher has a unique experience around what it takes to make this  
**0:49:40-0:49:41:**  happen.  
**0:49:41-0:49:47:**  Now what we do know is that if you're farming in the conventional way, in the way that most  
**0:49:47-0:49:56:**  agronomical school systems teach you to farm, you are generally farming in a way that degrades  
**0:49:56-0:49:57:**  the environment.  
**0:49:57-0:50:00:**  You're losing topsoil every year.  
**0:50:00-0:50:06:**  You're adding chemicals, you're reducing biodiversity, you're reducing the health of the water systems  
**0:50:06-0:50:09:**  around your farming operation.  
**0:50:09-0:50:17:**  And to shift from a system that follows those kinds of practices to a system that really  
**0:50:17-0:50:25:**  acknowledges and uplifts the dynamic nature of life in your system, honestly is a paradigmatic  
**0:50:25-0:50:32:**  shift in the way that you're understanding your agricultural systems.  
**0:50:32-0:50:38:**  Now is that going to be so hard that it's not worth even trying?  
**0:50:38-0:50:39:**  Absolutely not.  
**0:50:39-0:50:45:**  Is it going to be something that takes a lot of effort to understand in a constant process  
**0:50:45-0:50:47:**  of learning or growing?  
**0:50:47-0:50:48:**  Yes.  
**0:50:48-0:50:55:**  Are you going to succeed in sequestering carbon into your soil right away?  
**0:50:55-0:50:56:**  Maybe not.  
**0:50:56-0:50:58:**  Some people do, some people don't.  
**0:50:58-0:51:04:**  It may take some experimentation and trying this or trying that, seeing how it works to  
**0:51:04-0:51:09:**  intercrop various things that you can chop and drop into the landscape.  
**0:51:09-0:51:17:**  It may take experimentation with the size of the paddocks that you rotate your animals  
**0:51:17-0:51:24:**  into and the frequency with which you rotate to try to understand which rotational pattern  
**0:51:24-0:51:29:**  is the one that's going to be most optimal for soil health.  
**0:51:29-0:51:42:**  It's not nearly as cut and dry and programmatic, I would say, as the conventional agricultural  
**0:51:42-0:51:49:**  systems that are what our parents and grandparents have been practicing.  
**0:51:49-0:51:50:**  Yeah.  
**0:51:50-0:51:54:**  So let's create an imaginary use farmer here.  
**0:51:54-0:51:58:**  So we're going to call the farmer Sally.  
**0:51:58-0:52:10:**  Farmer Sally has 75 hectares of peach trees somewhere in the Northeast United States.  
**0:52:10-0:52:17:**  And farmer Sally wants to have carbon credits issues that take into account the carbon stock  
**0:52:17-0:52:25:**  changes in soil organic carbon in her orchards, as well as the above ground biomass carbon  
**0:52:25-0:52:29:**  holding capacity of her peach trees.  
**0:52:29-0:52:37:**  So in this case, we would chat with farmer Sally and learn about what she's doing with  
**0:52:37-0:52:42:**  her trees, how she takes care of them, how old they are.  
**0:52:42-0:52:46:**  Is there anything, are she using any animals to graze in between?  
**0:52:46-0:52:48:**  Is she just mowing?  
**0:52:48-0:52:51:**  What's the patterns that she's seeing around her property?  
**0:52:51-0:52:56:**  And that's very much like a simple intake form and a couple of kind of casual conversations  
**0:52:56-0:52:58:**  to get a sense of that.  
**0:52:58-0:53:06:**  And then we would partner with farmer Sally to ask her to collect or provide information  
**0:53:06-0:53:10:**  that has been historically collected around some of these items.  
**0:53:10-0:53:14:**  So we would ask for soil samples.  
**0:53:14-0:53:22:**  And at 75 hectare size, we would only need 20 soil samples from the entire orchard.  
**0:53:22-0:53:29:**  We would want them to go to a lab and have soil organic carbon percentage, macro micronutrients,  
**0:53:29-0:53:37:**  the cation exchange percentages, as well as bulk density measurements for each location.  
**0:53:37-0:53:42:**  And that collecting 20 samples is something that can be done in a couple hours out in  
**0:53:42-0:53:44:**  the orchard.  
**0:53:44-0:53:51:**  Then we would be asking her questions like, what species are these?  
**0:53:51-0:53:52:**  When did you plant them?  
**0:53:52-0:54:00:**  Can you go out and measure a couple of diameter at base heights so we can see how big the  
**0:54:00-0:54:04:**  tree stalks are in a couple of areas?  
**0:54:04-0:54:08:**  How tall do you think some of your trees currently are?  
**0:54:08-0:54:14:**  And with just sort of like that limited series of a couple of ground truth points, we can  
**0:54:14-0:54:19:**  then start using the satellite data and map out her property.  
**0:54:19-0:54:25:**  So I would map out from the boundaries and be able to identify exactly which peach varieties  
**0:54:25-0:54:31:**  are in which areas, how big they are, what we can calculate what the above ground carbon  
**0:54:31-0:54:38:**  stock is for those trees, whether they're newly planted one-year trees or they're maturing  
**0:54:38-0:54:41:**  out 20-year-old peach trees.  
**0:54:41-0:54:47:**  And we can come up with a carbon stock number for all of the above ground biomass associated  
**0:54:47-0:54:49:**  with her orchard.  
**0:54:49-0:54:54:**  We then take the soil samples, do the remote sensing calibration and come up with a amount  
**0:54:54-0:55:00:**  of soil organic carbon sequestration and carbon stocks in her orchard.  
**0:55:00-0:55:03:**  And from that, we would say, hey, Sally, we did all the math.  
**0:55:03-0:55:12:**  We came up with this amount of carbon that is this many carbon plus agroforestry credits.  
**0:55:12-0:55:16:**  We were able to monitor these other ecological indicators that help tell the story of your  
**0:55:16-0:55:18:**  property as well.  
**0:55:18-0:55:24:**  And then we would issue credits to her and be able to keep it really simple and be able  
**0:55:24-0:55:27:**  to sell the credits in the market system.  
**0:55:27-0:55:34:**  So we approach this as a one ton of carbon sequestered is one carbon plus credit, keeping  
**0:55:34-0:55:37:**  the math really easy for everybody.  
**0:55:37-0:55:45:**  And if we assumed that the above ground carbon was an average of 14.88 tons per hectare per  
**0:55:45-0:55:51:**  year and the soil organic carbon is 4.89 tons per hectare per year and the credit price  
**0:55:51-0:56:01:**  is $15 per credit, then the total revenues that could be expected to be about a quarter  
**0:56:01-0:56:07:**  million dollars, the total costs of monitoring and verification and soil sample and credit  
**0:56:07-0:56:11:**  issuance would be about $175,000.  
**0:56:11-0:56:21:**  So Sally could make off of a 75 hectare orchard about 75K split up into four separate credit  
**0:56:21-0:56:24:**  issuances over a 10 year time period.  
**0:56:24-0:56:31:**  So it's like having an additional annual farm income level over a period of a decade or  
**0:56:31-0:56:32:**  more.  
**0:56:32-0:56:35:**  And in some of our use cases, some of the carbon is a little higher.  
**0:56:35-0:56:38:**  Some of these cases, their carbon stocks are a little bit lower.  
**0:56:38-0:56:42:**  It just depends on each individual farmer and each individual property.  
**0:56:42-0:56:47:**  But that's kind of a ballpark of what would happen if we were to actually partner with  
**0:56:47-0:56:51:**  an orchard and go through the steps with an individual farmer.  
**0:56:51-0:56:54:**  Wow, that's quite a lot of money.  
**0:56:54-0:56:56:**  It's a decent amount.  
**0:56:56-0:56:59:**  Yeah, we love more money to farmers.  
**0:56:59-0:57:01:**  That's what we're trying to get.  
**0:57:01-0:57:08:**  We're trying to help keep their process super simple, super digestible, really, really easy  
**0:57:08-0:57:14:**  to fill out the form and partner with us and do all the monitoring cost effectively and  
**0:57:14-0:57:18:**  efficiently because we understand that farmers are busy.  
**0:57:18-0:57:21:**  We think their time is extremely valuable.  
**0:57:21-0:57:23:**  We think the work they do is extremely valuable.  
**0:57:23-0:57:29:**  And we think that the world should be rewarding them for their amazing ecological practices  
**0:57:29-0:57:35:**  and acknowledging the roles that farmers have in preserving and restoring ecosystems that  
**0:57:35-0:57:38:**  we all inherently survive upon.  
**0:57:38-0:57:43:**  This is really core to our mission that we've designed this process with farmers to make  
**0:57:43-0:57:46:**  it literally as easy as we can possibly manage.  
**0:57:46-0:57:51:**  And a lot of our core team have been or are farmers ourselves.  
**0:57:51-0:57:58:**  So we have asked ourselves all along this way, how much information would I be able  
**0:57:58-0:58:00:**  to collect in my orchard?  
**0:58:00-0:58:02:**  How much time would I have to spend to this?  
**0:58:02-0:58:07:**  And how can I how could I make this process as easy as possible for farmers to engage  
**0:58:07-0:58:08:**  with?  
**0:58:08-0:58:15:**  And at the end of this 10 year period, could the farmer potentially start again then and  
**0:58:15-0:58:20:**  on the condition that they're still continuing to sequester carbon and then maybe reissue  
**0:58:20-0:58:23:**  another 10 year period with that on the long term?  
**0:58:23-0:58:24:**  Is that possible?  
**0:58:24-0:58:30:**  Yeah, so our credit terms are 10 years and at the end of them, a farmer has the option  
**0:58:30-0:58:33:**  to renew for another 10 year cycle.  
**0:58:33-0:58:39:**  So if during that time period they've, you know, at year eight, they've just planted,  
**0:58:39-0:58:43:**  you know, a whole new orchard section or something like that, you know, we can add that to the  
**0:58:43-0:58:49:**  bundled location of their property and continue to monitor the outcomes for existing trees  
**0:58:49-0:58:54:**  and new trees or new management practices that have been added throughout that 10 year  
**0:58:54-0:58:56:**  lifetime.  
**0:58:56-0:59:01:**  Because then I guess the the from the perspective of the of the buyers that they would want  
**0:59:01-0:59:06:**  to make sure that if they invest in these carbon credits that after the 10 years and  
**0:59:06-0:59:10:**  that the farmer received all this money that he that carbon is still going to maintain  
**0:59:10-0:59:14:**  the soil and nothing is going to jeopardize that.  
**0:59:14-0:59:15:**  Yep.  
**0:59:15-0:59:19:**  So the term associated with that is called permanence.  
**0:59:19-0:59:23:**  And the way that we approach this is relatively flexible.  
**0:59:23-0:59:30:**  We have a 25 year permanence time period for the carbon associated with the 10 year monitoring  
**0:59:30-0:59:32:**  issuance.  
**0:59:32-0:59:34:**  And there are two options a farmer can take.  
**0:59:34-0:59:37:**  Farmers have the option of putting a covenant on their land.  
**0:59:37-0:59:44:**  So if it was ever sold, they would have to maintain that section of the property, you  
**0:59:44-0:59:49:**  know, with the conditions that are associated with the carbon credits or because a lot of  
**0:59:49-0:59:52:**  farmers don't like to put covenants on their land.  
**0:59:52-0:59:54:**  It's a little too permanent for a lot of people.  
**0:59:54-0:59:59:**  The other option that's the more flexible version is that we have something called a  
**0:59:59-1:00:06:**  permanence buffer where we will hold back 20 percent of all the credits for each issuance  
**1:00:06-1:00:08:**  into essentially like a holding account.  
**1:00:08-1:00:17:**  And when we do that final monitoring in year 10 and reconcile the carbon, we basically  
**1:00:17-1:00:23:**  have held back some of the credits in case there's any carbon loss or in case there's,  
**1:00:23-1:00:25:**  you know, and some of the math doesn't add up.  
**1:00:25-1:00:32:**  We can basically release that permanence buffer either to cover any carbon loss that has happened  
**1:00:32-1:00:38:**  during the total 10 year time period, or we would just issue those credits out, you know,  
**1:00:38-1:00:44:**  as a bigger lump at the end because we held them back just to make sure that the carbon  
**1:00:44-1:00:48:**  was indeed accounted for appropriately.  
**1:00:48-1:00:56:**  It seems that what you're describing is supporting farmers that are already doing, you know,  
**1:00:56-1:00:59:**  good practices and taking care of their soil.  
**1:00:59-1:01:04:**  Could we imagine a scenario where these carbon credits fund the transition of conventional  
**1:01:04-1:01:10:**  farmers to regenerative practices and help them kind of counterbalance the additional  
**1:01:10-1:01:12:**  costs and risks that goes with transitioning?  
**1:01:12-1:01:16:**  I know I already alluded to this a bit earlier, but I was thinking maybe we could summarize  
**1:01:16-1:01:18:**  that through an example as well.  
**1:01:18-1:01:27:**  Yeah, so the way that would work on our part is if we had a credit buyer that wanted to  
**1:01:27-1:01:36:**  partner with a project, you know, that was transitioning and wanted to essentially prepay  
**1:01:36-1:01:43:**  carbon credit purchases in order to help fund that farmer implementing those new management  
**1:01:43-1:01:46:**  practices or planting those new trees.  
**1:01:46-1:01:54:**  Our organization doesn't do technical support for farmers beyond the sort of carbon plus  
**1:01:54-1:01:59:**  initiatives that we have, but we actually have a number of amazing partners that what  
**1:01:59-1:02:07:**  they do is they partner with agroforestry projects specifically to help them get the  
**1:02:07-1:02:15:**  upfront startup funding that is a barrier for transitioning and there are groups that  
**1:02:15-1:02:20:**  do that through finding investors that invest in the trees themselves as if they're like  
**1:02:20-1:02:22:**  an asset.  
**1:02:22-1:02:27:**  And there are a lot of technical support and grant programs that support transitioning  
**1:02:27-1:02:33:**  farmers, at least in the United States, that are adopting orchard management or regenerative  
**1:02:33-1:02:34:**  practices.  
**1:02:34-1:02:42:**  So we typically like to partner with organizations that can help people with the startup costs.  
**1:02:42-1:02:48:**  Every once in a while there is a buyer that wants to buy the whole credit issuance and  
**1:02:48-1:02:53:**  wants to see a project happen so badly they'll just prepay and then that money can go to  
**1:02:53-1:02:58:**  the farmer in order to get the trees purchased and the trees planted.  
**1:02:58-1:03:03:**  We interviewed a few weeks back Propagate Ventures who had an interesting way as well  
**1:03:03-1:03:04:**  of funding farms.  
**1:03:04-1:03:08:**  I've seen online that you guys seem to know each other.  
**1:03:08-1:03:10:**  They were really interesting.  
**1:03:10-1:03:15:**  So we're going to link here our listeners to Propagate Ventures and check out that interview  
**1:03:15-1:03:22:**  because it will marry itself very well with what's being said right now about Regen Network.  
**1:03:22-1:03:26:**  So what I wanted to say about this is that you can create quite direct relationships  
**1:03:26-1:03:31:**  between a buyer and farmers that want to sell the carbon credit.  
**1:03:31-1:03:39:**  Yeah, so we have talked to companies that are so excited about having an intimate connection  
**1:03:39-1:03:46:**  with their environmental and social initiatives and they want to be able to visit the farmer  
**1:03:46-1:03:49:**  and meet the farmer or they want to be able to talk to them.  
**1:03:49-1:03:54:**  Sometimes there's projects where it's honestly just easier to put the farmer and the buyer  
**1:03:54-1:03:59:**  and us in a room and say, okay farmer, what are you doing on your property?  
**1:03:59-1:04:02:**  Okay company, what are your focuses?  
**1:04:02-1:04:03:**  Is it water?  
**1:04:03-1:04:04:**  Is it biodiversity?  
**1:04:04-1:04:10:**  Let's figure out how we can sort of marry this land and this data with the story that  
**1:04:10-1:04:13:**  that company is really after.  
**1:04:13-1:04:17:**  Some companies love that intimate connection and we definitely have the ability to provide  
**1:04:17-1:04:18:**  that.  
**1:04:18-1:04:22:**  For companies that, you know, that's just a little too much work for them.  
**1:04:22-1:04:25:**  They can very easily just go on Regen Registry.  
**1:04:25-1:04:30:**  Each project page tells an intimate story of each project, shows where the property  
**1:04:30-1:04:33:**  is and tells you what they're doing.  
**1:04:33-1:04:39:**  You can see all of the monitoring report information, what the outcomes that we've been monitored  
**1:04:39-1:04:40:**  are.  
**1:04:40-1:04:44:**  There's videos, there's photos, there's maps, all kinds of cool stuff.  
**1:04:44-1:04:48:**  So for a company that's like, that's too much work for them, they can go on there and filter  
**1:04:48-1:04:54:**  for agroforestry or filter for forest and then look through the forestry projects and fall  
**1:04:54-1:05:00:**  in love with one of the stories of the farmers on the platform and just invest their credit  
**1:05:00-1:05:05:**  purchases right there without having to go through all of the high touch, you know, getting  
**1:05:05-1:05:08:**  to know the farmer intimately because not everybody has the time for that.  
**1:05:08-1:05:12:**  So we have the flexibility to sort of meet companies and meet farmers where they're at  
**1:05:12-1:05:15:**  because some farmers don't want to talk to people and some companies don't want to talk  
**1:05:15-1:05:16:**  to farmers.  
**1:05:16-1:05:22:**  But sometimes they do want to have a conversation and we can put them in the Zoom room together.  
**1:05:22-1:05:32:**  I want to add to this that I think that there's also a lot of really interesting international  
**1:05:32-1:05:37:**  climate change finance that's also coming out, the things like green bonds and impact  
**1:05:37-1:05:40:**  investing that could also play a part here.  
**1:05:40-1:05:46:**  So in a similar way that Propagate Ventures creates pre-purchase agreements for the produce  
**1:05:46-1:05:53:**  coming off of their agroforestry systems, as it becomes more accepted that as a farmer  
**1:05:53-1:05:59:**  shifts to ecologically friendly practices that they can be ensured that they are going  
**1:05:59-1:06:06:**  to receive ecological assets like carbon credits and biodiversity credits from their actions,  
**1:06:06-1:06:11:**  then there is a role for an impact investor to get involved and say, hey, I can provide  
**1:06:11-1:06:16:**  the capital upfront as long as I can share in the rewards of the ecological outcomes  
**1:06:16-1:06:17:**  that you produce.  
**1:06:17-1:06:24:**  And so I'm sure that we'll be seeing more and more of that rolling out as well.  
**1:06:24-1:06:29:**  Once we're on the economics, looking at the value of all of this, I also wanted to ask  
**1:06:29-1:06:33:**  about, we've talked a lot about carbon and the value of carbon right now, but what about  
**1:06:33-1:06:35:**  the value of biodiversity, for example?  
**1:06:35-1:06:38:**  Do you have a metric of like a ton of bugs per hectare?  
**1:06:38-1:06:42:**  I don't know how you could, I'm joking now, but I don't know how you can measure it exactly.  
**1:06:42-1:06:48:**  But I'm curious to see what's the value of biodiversity compared to the value of like  
**1:06:48-1:06:53:**  of a biodiversity credit or compared to carbon, what's it worth?  
**1:06:53-1:06:58:**  Well, you asked what the value is, which is a very different question than what's the  
**1:06:58-1:07:01:**  price of these things.  
**1:07:01-1:07:06:**  Maybe I should talk more about the price then to make it more specific, but yes, I understand.  
**1:07:06-1:07:07:**  Yeah, sure.  
**1:07:07-1:07:13:**  So just really quickly, the reason I make that difference there is that there are some  
**1:07:13-1:07:18:**  really interesting reports out about the value of ecosystem services and they are incredibly  
**1:07:18-1:07:19:**  high.  
**1:07:19-1:07:26:**  So even as we're talking about $25 or $50 a ton for these things, there are reports  
**1:07:26-1:07:32:**  out there that show that the value of ecosystem services coming off of one hectare of agroforestry  
**1:07:32-1:07:37:**  land could be in the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars of value to society.  
**1:07:37-1:07:38:**  Right.  
**1:07:38-1:07:40:**  And biodiversity being one of those things.  
**1:07:40-1:07:47:**  Unfortunately, in terms of the price of biodiversity credits, the market is still really small  
**1:07:47-1:07:48:**  for them.  
**1:07:48-1:07:54:**  It's a pretty nascent market and most of the prices are kept confidential between different  
**1:07:54-1:08:02:**  parties when they engage in the voluntary biodiversity purchases.  
**1:08:02-1:08:09:**  Unfortunately, I can't give you a very specific answer there.  
**1:08:09-1:08:13:**  Biodiversity is a challenging one because it's so different in every single place.  
**1:08:13-1:08:17:**  I mean, are you talking about the biodiversity in an arid desert situation?  
**1:08:17-1:08:19:**  Are you talking about biodiversity in the Amazon?  
**1:08:19-1:08:22:**  Are you talking about the biodiversity in Belgium?  
**1:08:22-1:08:28:**  It touches upon the complexity you have to deal with when you're finding prices and  
**1:08:28-1:08:29:**  metrics, etc.  
**1:08:29-1:08:32:**  It's one of the most fascinating things about your work there.  
**1:08:32-1:08:34:**  You're dealing with so much complexity.  
**1:08:34-1:08:41:**  And turning it into the language of economics and of modern society, it's not easy, it  
**1:08:41-1:08:42:**  seems.  
**1:08:42-1:08:48:**  I think this is part of why we're approaching carbon plus with all the ecological and social  
**1:08:48-1:08:56:**  indicators as a pathway for individuals and companies to start thinking beyond carbon  
**1:08:56-1:09:02:**  so that we can increase our collective understanding of how ecology works and what economic and  
**1:09:02-1:09:05:**  social values it has.  
**1:09:05-1:09:11:**  So that having a conversation around, hey, this is a biodiversity credit becomes more  
**1:09:11-1:09:13:**  normalized.  
**1:09:13-1:09:19:**  Part of our challenge as a company is we're trying to innovate and have a whole ecosystem  
**1:09:19-1:09:20:**  conversation.  
**1:09:20-1:09:28:**  That includes carbon, but is really highlighting the entire ecological interaction of the earth.  
**1:09:28-1:09:32:**  And that is just not everybody can identify many plants.  
**1:09:32-1:09:36:**  That's why we find a lot of companies ask about forestry credit.  
**1:09:36-1:09:40:**  And it's because their staff members can identify a tree.  
**1:09:40-1:09:43:**  They can't necessarily identify an herb.  
**1:09:43-1:09:44:**  They don't know their cactuses.  
**1:09:44-1:09:48:**  They don't understand necessarily like watershed ecosystems.  
**1:09:48-1:09:54:**  I mean, these are things that us as ecology, biology, agricultural people that we probably  
**1:09:54-1:09:56:**  could talk about all day.  
**1:09:56-1:10:00:**  And so we spend a lot of time educating buyers.  
**1:10:00-1:10:02:**  Why beyond carbon?  
**1:10:02-1:10:03:**  Why look at a whole ecosystem?  
**1:10:03-1:10:06:**  What do we mean by ecosystem?  
**1:10:06-1:10:11:**  What does happen on a property when somebody makes a management practice change?  
**1:10:11-1:10:14:**  Why is that an important thing to incentivize?  
**1:10:14-1:10:17:**  And then ultimately, how do we collectively value that?  
**1:10:17-1:10:20:**  And that is sort of a social conversation right now.  
**1:10:20-1:10:22:**  You know, what's a company willing to pay?  
**1:10:22-1:10:23:**  What do we think it's worth?  
**1:10:23-1:10:25:**  What are the reports say?  
**1:10:25-1:10:27:**  How dire is climate change?  
**1:10:27-1:10:29:**  You know, how what's it's like what you're saying.  
**1:10:29-1:10:33:**  What's the value of a handful of pollinators?  
**1:10:33-1:10:37:**  You know, you could track that through the whole where do the pollinators go and what  
**1:10:37-1:10:43:**  are they, you know, spreading pollen to and how many crops does a single bee, you know,  
**1:10:43-1:10:48:**  flutter into and out of and how much of our agricultural production in a year just one  
**1:10:48-1:10:49:**  bee touch.  
**1:10:49-1:10:53:**  I mean, these are complex conversations to have.  
**1:10:53-1:10:58:**  So we spend a lot of time educating farmers about our process and a lot of time educating  
**1:10:58-1:11:04:**  companies and individuals about an entire ecosystem of challenges that we have to step  
**1:11:04-1:11:08:**  up to the plate and try to solve one by one.  
**1:11:08-1:11:13:**  So if we even move the dial a little bit from carbon to ecosystem conversations, we're getting  
**1:11:13-1:11:19:**  closer to things like biodiversity or watershed ecosystem frameworks or different things that  
**1:11:19-1:11:23:**  are much more complex like that.  
**1:11:23-1:11:28:**  It's really fortunate that carbon can be used like this as a metric, a useful metric, not  
**1:11:28-1:11:35:**  only for sequestration and climate change, but also for soil health and all the importance  
**1:11:35-1:11:37:**  it has in the soil ecosystem.  
**1:11:37-1:11:40:**  So I guess that's very helpful.  
**1:11:40-1:11:47:**  I wanted to maybe take things down one level and go back to some practical questions.  
**1:11:47-1:11:52:**  But what's the minimal scale that you would be working with with a farm?  
**1:11:52-1:11:57:**  Because you mentioned some monitoring costs, which I'm assuming most of them are fixed  
**1:11:57-1:12:01:**  in terms of doing the soil analysis, etc.  
**1:12:01-1:12:07:**  So small farms, can you work with them as well?  
**1:12:07-1:12:15:**  So in the founding of Regen Network, both Gregory Landwey and I, a couple of co-founders  
**1:12:15-1:12:18:**  to spend a lot of time working with smallholder farmers.  
**1:12:18-1:12:22:**  One of our aims as a company is to get to the point where we can be working with farmers  
**1:12:22-1:12:28:**  who are farming, you know, half a hectare, one hectare, two hectares of land area, and  
**1:12:28-1:12:32:**  be able to do that in such a way that they also can be benefiting from the way that they're  
**1:12:32-1:12:38:**  serving the ecology and building ecological benefit.  
**1:12:38-1:12:42:**  Now there definitely is an economy of scale going on.  
**1:12:42-1:12:49:**  And until we can reduce the cost of monitoring, and we have enough of a robust data set that  
**1:12:49-1:12:54:**  we can extend and correlate into those small farms, for the time being, we haven't been  
**1:12:54-1:13:02:**  able to proforma out small farms like that and make it profitable for them to engage  
**1:13:02-1:13:04:**  in this at this time.  
**1:13:04-1:13:10:**  But we're seeing that as we automate these remote sensing methodologies, the price of  
**1:13:10-1:13:12:**  that monitoring is coming down and down.  
**1:13:12-1:13:17:**  And we see a point in the not too distant future where we will be able to engage with  
**1:13:17-1:13:20:**  smallholder farmers on that scale.  
**1:13:20-1:13:25:**  Now, Sarah, maybe you can speak to what is the kind of minimal size that we're seeing  
**1:13:25-1:13:33:**  for farms at this time to fall in the net positive financial outcomes with an engagement  
**1:13:33-1:13:34:**  like this?  
**1:13:34-1:13:43:**  Yeah, so from the technical detail, the answer to this question is a function of three things  
**1:13:43-1:13:44:**  that are all variable.  
**1:13:44-1:13:50:**  So there is not a straight answer to this exactly.  
**1:13:50-1:13:54:**  The appropriate scale is determined in part by credit price.  
**1:13:54-1:14:00:**  The higher the credit price, the smaller a parcel can be.  
**1:14:00-1:14:04:**  And also the carbon stock valuation.  
**1:14:04-1:14:11:**  So the percentage or the tons per hectare per year of above ground biomass than agroforestry  
**1:14:11-1:14:14:**  and tons per hectare per year for soil organic carbon.  
**1:14:14-1:14:19:**  As there is more carbon in the soil, you can work with smaller properties.  
**1:14:19-1:14:25:**  So the example I gave earlier was 70 hectares.  
**1:14:25-1:14:34:**  And at sort of the average Northeast US modeled rates for those carbon sequestration metrics  
**1:14:34-1:14:43:**  I just mentioned and a $15 credit price, a 70 hectare size is about the minimum of what  
**1:14:43-1:14:47:**  can be profitable for a farmer.  
**1:14:47-1:14:54:**  And right now we're in the process of trying to figure out how we can make the process  
**1:14:54-1:14:58:**  even more affordable for smaller farmers.  
**1:14:58-1:15:06:**  And part of that comes with our goal to automate as much of the remote sensing methodology  
**1:15:06-1:15:12:**  work as we can, which drives the cost down significantly for each monitoring round.  
**1:15:12-1:15:18:**  But there ultimately is a question to be asked for each farmer.  
**1:15:18-1:15:23:**  Our remote sensing methods may not be the appropriate monitoring tool for all property  
**1:15:23-1:15:24:**  sizes.  
**1:15:24-1:15:32:**  There are other ecological monitoring systems that can be used for very small use cases  
**1:15:32-1:15:39:**  that can model out how much carbon is probably in your trees very approximately, but can  
**1:15:39-1:15:40:**  model it.  
**1:15:40-1:15:47:**  And so for a very small farmer, in some cases, those models may be the more cost effective  
**1:15:47-1:15:51:**  monitoring approach than the remote sensing methods that we use.  
**1:15:51-1:15:55:**  Our remote sensing methods are very accurate.  
**1:15:55-1:15:59:**  They're very much based on a measurement framework, but that measurement framework is not always  
**1:15:59-1:16:04:**  needed by every credit buyer and is not always appropriate for every property scale at this  
**1:16:04-1:16:05:**  point.  
**1:16:05-1:16:06:**  Okay.  
**1:16:06-1:16:10:**  That's very interesting.  
**1:16:10-1:16:13:**  You know, the problem is that we always reach the end of our interviews and we have so many  
**1:16:13-1:16:19:**  things to ask, and then we have to scramble together the most interesting questions that  
**1:16:19-1:16:20:**  we can.  
**1:16:20-1:16:25:**  And one of the things that I thought throughout the whole interview now is, you know, this  
**1:16:25-1:16:26:**  is great.  
**1:16:26-1:16:30:**  All this data is amazing for obviously for creating carbon credits and creating income  
**1:16:30-1:16:31:**  for the farmers in this way.  
**1:16:31-1:16:36:**  But also it seems to be a huge amount of information and data that the farmer can use to improve  
**1:16:36-1:16:37:**  his techniques.  
**1:16:37-1:16:44:**  And so all this data, are you also, for example, capable of selling it to a farmer or providing  
**1:16:44-1:16:48:**  it to farmers so that they can then use to understand, okay, you know, I did this there  
**1:16:48-1:16:50:**  and the carbon improved in this way.  
**1:16:50-1:16:55:**  And you seem to be able to be very specific and especially geographically speaking, you  
**1:16:55-1:16:56:**  know, you can be very precise.  
**1:16:56-1:17:00:**  Is this something that's part of the services you could offer?  
**1:17:00-1:17:01:**  Absolutely.  
**1:17:01-1:17:06:**  And first of all, before we get into selling the data to the farmers, we want to make sure  
**1:17:06-1:17:12:**  that people understand that we're not running the Facebook business model here where we  
**1:17:12-1:17:17:**  take your data and don't value it in that direction.  
**1:17:17-1:17:22:**  So first of all, when we collect data from farmers, farmers have an option.  
**1:17:22-1:17:28:**  Farmers are the owners of that data, and they have an option of either releasing into a  
**1:17:28-1:17:33:**  pool of data that they can then sell it from or releasing it in a kind of a Creative Commons  
**1:17:33-1:17:41:**  license where others able to use and benefit from that data for free.  
**1:17:41-1:17:47:**  We're not in the business of trying to monetize that data as a primary aim here.  
**1:17:47-1:17:53:**  Our primary business is to serve farmers and help them to get to move on their path towards  
**1:17:53-1:17:55:**  ecological soundness.  
**1:17:55-1:17:59:**  I wish we could pull up a screenshot here for your viewers, because there's some really  
**1:17:59-1:18:04:**  beautiful imagery that Sarah was describing earlier that's coming off of the Wilmot Ranch  
**1:18:04-1:18:09:**  that we worked with in New South Wales, Australia.  
**1:18:09-1:18:13:**  That literally shows the difference between two different paddocks.  
**1:18:13-1:18:18:**  And we don't know what the farmers did on the ground that made the difference between  
**1:18:18-1:18:21:**  the amount of carbon they sequestered on one side of the fence compared to the other side  
**1:18:21-1:18:23:**  of the fence.  
**1:18:23-1:18:29:**  But when we feed that information back to the farmer that paddock five did much better  
**1:18:29-1:18:34:**  than paddock three, the farmer can then clearly use that information in informing how they  
**1:18:34-1:18:40:**  then move their animals around in the following years and continue to sequester even more  
**1:18:40-1:18:42:**  carbon and build even better soil.  
**1:18:42-1:18:46:**  So yeah, incredibly valuable stuff being able to be fed back.  
**1:18:46-1:18:54:**  Yeah, so I wanted to add also just that the data we're collecting from a farm is qualitative  
**1:18:54-1:19:01:**  in order to fill up the project page where they write their own story and they share  
**1:19:01-1:19:06:**  where their farm is and they choose to share their own photos and videos.  
**1:19:06-1:19:10:**  But the amount of information that we're collecting to do the monitoring is actually incredibly  
**1:19:10-1:19:11:**  limited.  
**1:19:11-1:19:19:**  It's really a handful of ground truth information and soil samples and a property boundary.  
**1:19:19-1:19:24:**  So we're not collecting tens and tons of management data from farmers unless they're specifically  
**1:19:24-1:19:27:**  called for in the monitoring methodology.  
**1:19:27-1:19:34:**  And one of our strategies that we're starting to move towards is partnering with farm management  
**1:19:34-1:19:39:**  applications that farmers are already using so they can like literally press a button  
**1:19:39-1:19:44:**  and say, I want to, you know, I want to issue carbon credits on Regen Network.  
**1:19:44-1:19:49:**  And then it basically sends us their data from their farm management app to our intake  
**1:19:49-1:19:53:**  form and automatically get some started with the process.  
**1:19:53-1:19:58:**  So they don't even have to like export stuff and upload stuff.  
**1:19:58-1:20:03:**  I mean, our information gathering is not, you know, the outcomes can be used to inform  
**1:20:03-1:20:08:**  someone making better best management practice decisions.  
**1:20:08-1:20:12:**  And those types of maps that Christian is discussing are really amazing visuals to support  
**1:20:12-1:20:13:**  that aim.  
**1:20:13-1:20:20:**  But, you know, we're not collecting piles and piles of farmer data.  
**1:20:20-1:20:26:**  Just because we don't need that much farmer data to do a lot of the, you know, a lot of  
**1:20:26-1:20:33:**  the monitoring that we do in-house, it just really doesn't require like, it does not require  
**1:20:33-1:20:34:**  every single detail about a farm.  
**1:20:34-1:20:37:**  It only requires a specific set of information.  
**1:20:37-1:20:42:**  And we try to not collect information that isn't directly related to what we need, because  
**1:20:42-1:20:47:**  we think that's cumbersome to a farmer.  
**1:20:47-1:20:53:**  Just to understand, at the moment all this is happening in the US, what kind of plan  
**1:20:53-1:20:57:**  do you have for scaling Regen Network?  
**1:20:57-1:20:59:**  Are you planning it will be available internationally?  
**1:20:59-1:21:03:**  And if so, in how many months or years?  
**1:21:03-1:21:06:**  Regen Network is in a moment of growth right now.  
**1:21:06-1:21:10:**  We've just added three developers to our team over the last couple of months, and we're  
**1:21:10-1:21:14:**  adding a couple more developers to our team by the end of the year.  
**1:21:14-1:21:23:**  We're currently heads down focused on developing those layer one tools to provide the ecological  
**1:21:23-1:21:26:**  infrastructure for a world of different applications.  
**1:21:26-1:21:33:**  Our Regen Ledger, our blockchain associated with our project is launching in Q1 of 2021.  
**1:21:33-1:21:38:**  So it's a big moment for our company where these tools actually become decentralized  
**1:21:38-1:21:44:**  and we can galvanize a community of people around those tools to build applications to  
**1:21:44-1:21:46:**  address all sorts of needs.  
**1:21:46-1:21:55:**  For Regen Registry, our first credits on the registry are basically going live very shortly.  
**1:21:55-1:22:00:**  And we have a pipeline of projects coming behind that will then fill that out.  
**1:22:00-1:22:07:**  So the next 12 months, 18 months are going to be huge for our company.  
**1:22:07-1:22:13:**  It's going to be really exciting to see where we can go and how far we can get in that time.  
**1:22:13-1:22:20:**  I would also add our entire team is international and our first project is based in Australia.  
**1:22:20-1:22:28:**  So we may be a US based company, but our ability to monitor ecological indicators and best  
**1:22:28-1:22:35:**  management practices is really very global in nature and global by design.  
**1:22:35-1:22:38:**  Thank you.  
**1:22:38-1:22:42:**  Maybe as the final question, what are the main challenges that you face in the next  
**1:22:42-1:22:53:**  months or years to upscale your operation and have regenerative agriculture change scale?  
**1:22:53-1:22:59:**  I'll speak from a high level here about the challenges that Regen Network faces.  
**1:22:59-1:23:06:**  I think one of the big challenges is for people to understand that we're stepping out of the  
**1:23:06-1:23:13:**  conventional business model and moving into a model that invites a network of participation.  
**1:23:13-1:23:18:**  At Regen Network, we often say we want to out cooperate the competition.  
**1:23:18-1:23:25:**  We're building a decentralized system that invites in the participation of farmers and  
**1:23:25-1:23:32:**  citizen scientists and universities and others to bring their knowledge and their expertise  
**1:23:32-1:23:38:**  to the table so that we can all move forward and advance this.  
**1:23:38-1:23:42:**  Reversing global climate change and getting our planet back on an ecological path towards  
**1:23:42-1:23:46:**  health is the most important thing that we can be doing right now.  
**1:23:46-1:23:56:**  And personally, I'm just not interested in the old school competitive business model  
**1:23:56-1:24:00:**  techniques that people are used to.  
**1:24:00-1:24:06:**  So there's a paradigm shift that is sometimes difficult for people to wrap their heads around  
**1:24:06-1:24:10:**  when they're trying to understand how it is that we're working and how it is that we're  
**1:24:10-1:24:12:**  trying to bring this to the world.  
**1:24:12-1:24:17:**  That for me is one of the biggest challenges that I've seen going forward.  
**1:24:17-1:24:22:**  Yeah, I'm always in a more detailed level than Christian.  
**1:24:22-1:24:27:**  I always love his explanations, like a big picture framework.  
**1:24:27-1:24:34:**  I think to accompany what Christian said, carbon credits are inherently complicated.  
**1:24:34-1:24:42:**  So a lot of terms you have to understand there's a lot of requirements that carbon credit buyers  
**1:24:42-1:24:51:**  have that pin us in around how much we can innovate and still develop a credit that say  
**1:24:51-1:24:54:**  a Microsoft's going to feel comfortable buying.  
**1:24:54-1:25:01:**  So that middle ground is challenging for us from a design perspective to simplify it as  
**1:25:01-1:25:07:**  much as we can for a farmer while still having this very high quality framework that the  
**1:25:07-1:25:09:**  broader market currently demands.  
**1:25:09-1:25:18:**  I think that as companies become more comfortable with ecology, that may shift a little bit  
**1:25:18-1:25:24:**  because they may understand why some of those frameworks are a little too stringent for  
**1:25:24-1:25:29:**  actually getting enough projects, issuing carbon credits around the globe and having  
**1:25:29-1:25:35:**  companies buy them that we actually do something at a global scale around climate change.  
**1:25:35-1:25:41:**  I think that another challenge I see is that a lot of corporations right now have just  
**1:25:41-1:25:47:**  made big goals, but they haven't all come up with an explanation of how they're going  
**1:25:47-1:25:49:**  to meet those big goals.  
**1:25:49-1:25:54:**  A lot of companies that we're talking to are just kind of mapping their supply chain, trying  
**1:25:54-1:26:00:**  to figure out what their carbon load of their company is in order to then ask themselves  
**1:26:00-1:26:04:**  in the next year or two, okay, now what do we do about it?  
**1:26:04-1:26:10:**  So we're finding that we're kind of ahead of some of the curve with the number of these  
**1:26:10-1:26:12:**  things that we're developing.  
**1:26:12-1:26:16:**  And we spend a lot of time educating farmers and a lot of time educating companies.  
**1:26:16-1:26:23:**  So we're really looking forward to when companies start to understand ecology at a deeper level  
**1:26:23-1:26:29:**  and are coming to the table saying, carbon is valuable, but the ecosystem is also valuable.  
**1:26:29-1:26:33:**  We're coming to Regen Network because you understand how to couple both together.  
**1:26:33-1:26:38:**  And that's the story that we want to align ourselves with as a company trying to create  
**1:26:38-1:26:39:**  climate impact.  
**1:26:39-1:26:41:**  We want a whole systems impact.  
**1:26:41-1:26:46:**  We're not just trying to put a carbon credit on the accounting board and say, I sunk some  
**1:26:46-1:26:48:**  carbon.  
**1:26:48-1:26:51:**  We will look forward to when companies are coming to us saying, we want to restore a  
**1:26:51-1:26:55:**  whole ecosystem and when we're storing the Amazon, we want to empower farmers and we  
**1:26:55-1:26:58:**  want to re-hole ecosystems.  
**1:26:58-1:27:04:**  When that paradigm shift happens, that's when we are sort of the perfect company for companies  
**1:27:04-1:27:05:**  to partner with.  
**1:27:05-1:27:10:**  And so we hold that aim knowing that that's where we're heading because that's where we  
**1:27:10-1:27:16:**  think the conversation needs to go.  
**1:27:16-1:27:20:**  We wish you good luck with that because it would be amazing to see this grow.  
**1:27:20-1:27:29:**  And as farmers ourselves, it'd be amazing to see these tools come to us and help us  
**1:27:29-1:27:33:**  have more profitable and ecologically rich farms.  
**1:27:33-1:27:34:**  Absolutely.  
**1:27:34-1:27:42:**  Thanks for having us on and thanks for all those listeners out there who are revitalizing  
**1:27:42-1:27:45:**  the ecologies in your landscapes.

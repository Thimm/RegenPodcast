### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 18 Apr 2022 07:55:57)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:33:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:33-0:00:34:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:34-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:48:**  Hi and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:50:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:50-0:00:54:**  This episode is brought to you in collaboration with AgriMix, a network that brings together  
**0:00:54-0:01:00:**  farmers, researchers and policy makers to explore agroecological solutions in Europe.  
**0:01:00-0:01:03:**  They are sharing their network with us so that we can bring interesting agroforestry  
**0:01:03-0:01:06:**  projects on the podcast.  
**0:01:06-0:01:10:**  My guest is today Carl Schuard, who produces pigs in France.  
**0:01:10-0:01:14:**  He has received EU funding for his project, so we try and understand with him what kind  
**0:01:14-0:01:17:**  of opportunity that means for farmers.  
**0:01:17-0:01:20:**  He also shares some of the challenges he has encountered with deers and we assess together  
**0:01:20-0:01:25:**  the potential for increasing the proportion of perennials in pigs' diets.  
**0:01:25-0:01:28:**  I hope you enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:28-0:01:30:**  Hello Carl and welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:30-0:01:31:**  Hello.  
**0:01:31-0:01:37:**  Why don't we get started by a bit of a story of how you started your farm and some context  
**0:01:37-0:01:39:**  on your farm.  
**0:01:39-0:01:48:**  Okay, well before I came to France I was a teacher in agricultural subjects in Scotland,  
**0:01:48-0:01:50:**  south of Scotland.  
**0:01:50-0:01:54:**  I had gone into teaching which wasn't the first choice of career really.  
**0:01:54-0:02:01:**  I wanted to farm but the capital needs of that made it impossible in Britain.  
**0:02:01-0:02:09:**  In the 90s there was a lot of publicity suggesting there were opportunities for farmers in France,  
**0:02:09-0:02:11:**  for young farmers.  
**0:02:11-0:02:20:**  So we decided to have a go at it and we moved here in 1990 and we rented a farm for seven  
**0:02:20-0:02:24:**  years before buying the farm where we are now.  
**0:02:24-0:02:31:**  And what does the farm look like, a bit in terms of climate and main productions?  
**0:02:31-0:02:38:**  The farm is situated in Main Iloire which has quite a soft temperate environment, climate  
**0:02:38-0:02:40:**  sorry.  
**0:02:40-0:02:45:**  It's a farm in what was an old slate mining area.  
**0:02:45-0:02:48:**  So we're on a sort of sandy loam.  
**0:02:48-0:02:50:**  It's 45 hectares.  
**0:02:50-0:02:59:**  We converted to organic in 1997 so we've been organic for over 20 years.  
**0:02:59-0:03:06:**  The farm itself is very nice because the house and buildings are in the centre of the land  
**0:03:06-0:03:12:**  so it's very well, very easy to organise and access all the various fields.  
**0:03:12-0:03:15:**  Your main production, you raise pigs if I'm correct?  
**0:03:15-0:03:21:**  Funnily enough when we first came to France we started with sheep but my personal background  
**0:03:21-0:03:23:**  is more within pigs.  
**0:03:23-0:03:29:**  I just didn't, was sceptical or worried about starting with pigs because as you know pigs  
**0:03:29-0:03:37:**  have up and down cycles which can be quite brutal economically speaking and I was worried  
**0:03:37-0:03:42:**  coming to France with having to cope with a new language, a new administration so I  
**0:03:42-0:03:44:**  didn't at first go in.  
**0:03:44-0:03:51:**  But then as sheep farming took a turn for the worse we decided that I should return  
**0:03:51-0:04:01:**  to pigs and it coincided if you like with the outbreak of the mad cow disease which  
**0:04:01-0:04:08:**  then led to the development of organic farming and that suited my sort of philosophy and  
**0:04:08-0:04:10:**  approach to keeping animals.  
**0:04:10-0:04:19:**  So we decided to try to go into organic pigs which meant keeping the pigs outside and there  
**0:04:19-0:04:26:**  was a huge demand so it helped us to get going in that way because the pigs were easy to  
**0:04:26-0:04:27:**  sell.  
**0:04:27-0:04:36:**  Currently today we are running 40 to 50 organic blue pigs.  
**0:04:36-0:04:41:**  Pigs aren't actually blue, they're actually a cross between a saddleback and a landrace  
**0:04:41-0:04:50:**  which gives a pig with slate-like coloured tashes on it, patches on it which give it  
**0:04:50-0:04:52:**  the blue name.  
**0:04:52-0:05:00:**  These are kept outdoors in four bands of 10 to 12 which produce every six weeks.  
**0:05:00-0:05:08:**  We consecrate about 15 hectares which is about a third of our surface to the pigs for their  
**0:05:08-0:05:15:**  breeding and their rearing and the remainder of the land is in a mixture of perennial and  
**0:05:15-0:05:20:**  annual crops, cereal crops.  
**0:05:20-0:05:28:**  We became conscious of the fact that the organic standards were coming somewhat diluted and  
**0:05:28-0:05:34:**  more and more people were doing organic pigs or called inorganic pigs in buildings and  
**0:05:34-0:05:45:**  we wanted to try and go more towards a pig of quality and a pig with higher welfare standards  
**0:05:45-0:05:50:**  which to us meant rearing them as long as possible outdoors.  
**0:05:50-0:05:57:**  There was another aspect which was feed costs, the primary cost of pig production and we  
**0:05:57-0:06:03:**  wanted to try and do something about reducing that where possible.  
**0:06:03-0:06:08:**  So there was an economic interest to try and cut feed costs but also to enhance the quality  
**0:06:08-0:06:16:**  of the meat by introducing forage crops and that's something that agroforestry actually  
**0:06:16-0:06:22:**  lent itself to rather which we can explain in due course.  
**0:06:22-0:06:28:**  Well since you mentioned agroforestry, how did you first come across the term and what's  
**0:06:28-0:06:32:**  kind of the story that led you to implementing it on your farm?  
**0:06:32-0:06:40:**  It comes back to some extent as to my beliefs in what being a farmer is and I believe that  
**0:06:40-0:06:44:**  farming is about stewardship of the landscape.  
**0:06:44-0:06:53:**  In other words, it's not about, in France there's a term exploitant agricole which if  
**0:06:53-0:06:58:**  you translate it literally sounds like you're exploiting the land and I don't believe that's  
**0:06:58-0:07:00:**  what farming's about.  
**0:07:00-0:07:07:**  So I have this notion that one should work with the land and landscape and integrate  
**0:07:07-0:07:09:**  it into your activity.  
**0:07:09-0:07:17:**  So for me that included trees and before we actually opted into an agroforestry programme  
**0:07:17-0:07:22:**  we were already planting apple trees.  
**0:07:22-0:07:30:**  We planted around 60 apple trees in two different orchards and we started to experiment with  
**0:07:30-0:07:37:**  pigs in these orchards and I wouldn't say exactly at the same moment but around that  
**0:07:37-0:07:45:**  sort of time there became I think more concern globally for the environment with climate  
**0:07:45-0:07:55:**  change and regionally there were initiatives to encourage agroforestry as a means to fight  
**0:07:55-0:08:00:**  against climate change and enhance soil fertility.  
**0:08:00-0:08:08:**  So this seemed a natural path for us to follow in addition to what we'd already done.  
**0:08:08-0:08:11:**  And how did the project start?  
**0:08:11-0:08:16:**  Maybe if we take it from the beginning, where did you turn to get some kind of technical  
**0:08:16-0:08:19:**  support or information?  
**0:08:19-0:08:27:**  The technical support in our region comes from an association called Silver Agra and  
**0:08:27-0:08:35:**  there we had access to a technician or an advisor, Samuel Le Gray.  
**0:08:35-0:08:46:**  Samuel came and we discussed how we could integrate agroforestry into our farming system.  
**0:08:46-0:08:54:**  By that I mean how to decide the spacings and the layout of the trees, the species and  
**0:08:54-0:08:55:**  so forth.  
**0:08:55-0:09:04:**  And Samuel put together a project for us in consultation with me which was then presented  
**0:09:04-0:09:08:**  to the region.  
**0:09:08-0:09:14:**  It's partly, in short, it's funded partly by Europe and partly by the region.  
**0:09:14-0:09:20:**  In our case the region pays to Loire and otherwise Europe.  
**0:09:20-0:09:30:**  If I translate it, it's the European Funds for Rural Development, FEDA if you use the  
**0:09:30-0:09:32:**  abbreviation for it.  
**0:09:32-0:09:42:**  And they offer a subsidy of 60% of the total cost and the region pays to Loire another  
**0:09:42-0:09:45:**  20%.  
**0:09:45-0:09:53:**  And obviously you have to sign up, they have to approve the project which is where the  
**0:09:53-0:09:57:**  local association comes in with their expertise.  
**0:09:57-0:10:02:**  Well it's interesting to explore this because at least in Europe there's a lot of funds  
**0:10:02-0:10:08:**  now for hedges and different agroforestry systems but of course every time you take  
**0:10:08-0:10:11:**  money you have to accept certain constraints with it.  
**0:10:11-0:10:18:**  And I think it might be interesting to understand how did this source of funding affect the  
**0:10:18-0:10:23:**  design of the agroforestry system and how it shaped it in a sense.  
**0:10:23-0:10:32:**  The things that I remember that you have to respect are the distances, the density of  
**0:10:32-0:10:40:**  trees and the choice of species.  
**0:10:40-0:10:51:**  Things actually have changed because basically the choice of species is done according to  
**0:10:51-0:10:59:**  the soil type and actually on our farm we have very different soil types which meant  
**0:10:59-0:11:09:**  that the choice of varieties was for trees corresponding for example to dry areas, semi-humid,  
**0:11:09-0:11:13:**  very humid areas.  
**0:11:13-0:11:23:**  The one thing that I do slightly regret is perhaps there wasn't enough discussion as  
**0:11:23-0:11:33:**  to the specific integration of given species to the farm system, in other words in my case  
**0:11:33-0:11:35:**  pig production.  
**0:11:35-0:11:45:**  And there were also some constraints which I believe have changed as to the inclusion  
**0:11:45-0:11:48:**  of fruit trees.  
**0:11:48-0:11:57:**  At the time you weren't actually allowed to incorporate fruit trees within the tree mix.  
**0:11:57-0:12:07:**  Now I believe you can have 20% and that seems a little bit disappointing really because  
**0:12:07-0:12:13:**  our aim was to, one of the aims, I mean there are various benefits to having the trees,  
**0:12:13-0:12:21:**  but one of them was to provide an alternative food source and a food source that could have  
**0:12:21-0:12:26:**  a beneficial effect on the quality of the meat.  
**0:12:26-0:12:31:**  At the time it didn't feel like a huge constraint in terms of the spacing's kind of corresponded  
**0:12:31-0:12:34:**  to what seemed interesting anyway.  
**0:12:34-0:12:40:**  To have it approved, I mean you have to rely on the professionalism and expertise of the  
**0:12:40-0:12:52:**  association who were presumably deemed acceptable by Europe, they were accredited I presume  
**0:12:52-0:13:01:**  by Europe and the Paise de la Loire as being capable of producing the plants, so that was  
**0:13:01-0:13:07:**  your credibility working with them.  
**0:13:07-0:13:16:**  So yes it was working with the association, they were the ones who knew the necessary  
**0:13:16-0:13:20:**  constraints more than me.  
**0:13:20-0:13:30:**  From a farming point of view it was more working towards finding out or the appropriate and  
**0:13:30-0:13:36:**  planning the appropriate distance of the trees to fit in with your cultural practices and  
**0:13:36-0:13:40:**  grazing practices.  
**0:13:40-0:13:50:**  In our case we spaced our tree rows, they were planted in lines north to south at 26  
**0:13:50-0:13:56:**  metre intervals and the idea of that is that between each, on either side of the tree there  
**0:13:56-0:14:03:**  is a metre space obviously to allow for root development and that leaves you a 24 metre  
**0:14:03-0:14:12:**  space on which to cultivate which corresponds to most modern day implements of 6 metres  
**0:14:12-0:14:16:**  width, so that represents four passages.  
**0:14:16-0:14:23:**  If you think of our farm as four quarters, square quarters which is roughly the northern  
**0:14:23-0:14:32:**  part which represents two large fields of, one parcel is 11 and a half hectares and the  
**0:14:32-0:14:41:**  other is 6 and a half hectares, that's all in agroforestry.  
**0:14:41-0:14:49:**  For the pigs it was surprisingly easy to adapt, my pigs obviously are born outside, they are  
**0:14:49-0:14:59:**  familiar with electric fences and by the time they come into the forage parts of the agroforestry,  
**0:14:59-0:15:04:**  in other words in the alleys, between the trees, we found that they respond and respect  
**0:15:04-0:15:14:**  very well a very simple ribbon type electric fencing system as opposed to a wire, in other  
**0:15:14-0:15:21:**  words it's a ribbon which is very visible, one strand along the side of the rows and  
**0:15:21-0:15:27:**  they respect it, in other words there's no problems we've encountered with pigs trying  
**0:15:27-0:15:37:**  to root out trees or root round them, they're protected and we operate a system of, a bit  
**0:15:37-0:15:46:**  similar to how cattle farms work with an electric wire in front and one behind, so we put the  
**0:15:46-0:15:57:**  pigs on a given section of an alley which will depend to the number of pigs and then  
**0:15:57-0:16:05:**  they graze on that particular area for a given time till I consider that they've eaten it  
**0:16:05-0:16:13:**  down and then I close it off and move them onto another paddock in front of that, so  
**0:16:13-0:16:21:**  they basically move systematically up an alley and then once they've reached the top we can  
**0:16:21-0:16:32:**  shut that alley off and leave it to recover it or they start again from the bottom, it's  
**0:16:32-0:16:42:**  a flexible pattern and certain alleys we shut off with a view to making haylage in plastic  
**0:16:42-0:16:49:**  bales which then the pigs get the benefit of that during the winter months.  
**0:16:49-0:16:54:**  The one thing I found very good, certainly bearing in mind we're an organic farm, is  
**0:16:54-0:17:06:**  that you can manage much more imaginative rotational systems, be it grazing or growing  
**0:17:06-0:17:14:**  cereal crops or other because the nature of the alleys, if you imagine one of the fields,  
**0:17:14-0:17:23:**  the 11 hectare field has effectively 10 alleys in it, so whereas before either you monocultured  
**0:17:23-0:17:32:**  or you split it by approximately, but now I can define each alley, give it a number  
**0:17:32-0:17:41:**  for example, and I can have several different crops and therefore a much richer rotation  
**0:17:41-0:17:47:**  within the same field, so I find it very good for that.  
**0:17:47-0:17:53:**  Of course, if I understand the trees are still quite small because this was all planted pretty  
**0:17:53-0:18:00:**  recently, can you remind me what year you put these systems into place?  
**0:18:00-0:18:08:**  We actually planted at the beginning of 2017, the project was started in 2016 but obviously  
**0:18:08-0:18:13:**  there are certain times of the year when you don't plant, sometimes you do, and by memory  
**0:18:13-0:18:18:**  we planted at about the same epoch then as we are now.  
**0:18:18-0:18:23:**  And you mentioned you were a bit disappointed that the trees weren't more integrated to  
**0:18:23-0:18:31:**  your main enterprise which is pigs, but at the time or even now, what kind of expectations  
**0:18:31-0:18:34:**  would you have of including trees?  
**0:18:34-0:18:41:**  You've said that the motive was at the beginning environmental and more land management based,  
**0:18:41-0:18:48:**  but in terms of even advantages for the animals, is shade for example a key issue for pigs  
**0:18:48-0:18:53:**  in the summer or on the contrary, is it more like protection in the winter?  
**0:18:53-0:18:58:**  Can you give us a bit more of an idea from your farmer perspective?  
**0:18:58-0:19:02:**  There's multiple advantages for the livestock, certainly shade.  
**0:19:02-0:19:11:**  I think we all know the original wild boar, wild pigs are more forest like creatures,  
**0:19:11-0:19:23:**  they live in the woods, so you're trying to reach out to that sort of environment, they're  
**0:19:23-0:19:32:**  generally pale skinned, so they do burn pigs in sunlight, so shade is very important.  
**0:19:32-0:19:38:**  Well the other thing that comes to mind might be feed as well.  
**0:19:38-0:19:43:**  Is there any kind of substantial feed that you could expect from a mature agroforestry  
**0:19:43-0:19:49:**  system or would that just be a little sprinkle on top?  
**0:19:49-0:19:56:**  I think it's difficult to quantify the exact feed benefits because there are some, obviously  
**0:19:56-0:20:06:**  you've got nuts and fruit like apples, acorns, chestnuts, which are sort of visible if you  
**0:20:06-0:20:19:**  like, but then as the trees develop you're drawing a richer insect and grub population  
**0:20:19-0:20:28:**  and it's very difficult to quantify but I did read a study that claimed that a pig will  
**0:20:28-0:20:36:**  consume something like half a kilo of earthworms, so to attract earthworms you obviously need  
**0:20:36-0:20:45:**  a good organic matter status and obviously maturing trees in an agroforestry project  
**0:20:45-0:20:49:**  will bring that.  
**0:20:49-0:20:59:**  I think probably, again I personally think the future of farming and certainly where  
**0:20:59-0:21:06:**  pigs are concerned may change and I think we have to change perhaps our criteria for  
**0:21:06-0:21:13:**  what represents productivity and so forth and I think at the moment the aim is just  
**0:21:13-0:21:21:**  get your pigs off out of the system as quick as possible and off the market and I think  
**0:21:21-0:21:28:**  agroforestry perhaps represents a chance to look at, to go more towards perhaps a slow  
**0:21:28-0:21:33:**  food approach to pig production.  
**0:21:33-0:21:45:**  So perhaps a pig on that system will eat well but eat a more varied diet and produce a richer,  
**0:21:45-0:21:51:**  more nutrient dense piece of meat.  
**0:21:51-0:21:56:**  That's the hope, that's how I see it.  
**0:21:56-0:22:01:**  I think there are economies on your global feed bill that are possible and that's one  
**0:22:01-0:22:10:**  of the things we're studying in the agro mix project that I'm involved with to see what  
**0:22:10-0:22:20:**  percentage you can perhaps comfortably drop your concentrate feed costs by through agroforestry.  
**0:22:20-0:22:28:**  That is interesting and I'm wondering in the future what kind of landscape do you visualize  
**0:22:28-0:22:36:**  because would you let the system go more towards like a forest ecosystem but then the issue  
**0:22:36-0:22:40:**  with that is with less light you would lose a lot of the grazing aspect or would you envision  
**0:22:40-0:22:47:**  more of a kind of savannah type system with some productive trees but then still a lot  
**0:22:47-0:22:55:**  of like, still a dominant grass layer so that the pigs can continue grazing?  
**0:22:55-0:23:00:**  Yeah I think I would go somewhere between the two.  
**0:23:00-0:23:10:**  I, a mixture actually of, well let's say, dense, there's coppices of dense plantation  
**0:23:10-0:23:18:**  within an area but at the same time with, if you like, the agroforestry system of more  
**0:23:18-0:23:29:**  linear because if you're going to rotate perhaps or integrate other animals in then it lends  
**0:23:29-0:23:36:**  itself to that, having trees more uniformly laid out because once you get into a hazard  
**0:23:36-0:23:41:**  arrangement it's very difficult to manage so it's a compromise I think.  
**0:23:41-0:23:47:**  I mean I think in an ideal world, you know, I think pigs are creatures of a forest and  
**0:23:47-0:23:53:**  if you had woodland, yes, to run them in, yeah that would be great.  
**0:23:53-0:24:04:**  Whether that's sustainable over a long period because of course you can't change, you have  
**0:24:04-0:24:11:**  to either abandon the wood, in other words pigs in or pigs out, you can't sow an alternative  
**0:24:11-0:24:13:**  crop in there in between.  
**0:24:13-0:24:19:**  And I imagine, going back to this idea of feed because I think a lot of people have  
**0:24:19-0:24:27:**  these images of pigs eating acorns or pig eating chestnuts but I assume to get the results  
**0:24:27-0:24:34:**  you want and to do it in an economically viable way you have to be pretty technical with the  
**0:24:34-0:24:39:**  different moments of feed and when you're fattening pigs it's a specific diet at a certain  
**0:24:39-0:24:43:**  moment of the year so you can't really base your system on something as seasonal as that,  
**0:24:43-0:24:48:**  it would just have to be a bit of a kind of add-on, a bit of diversity to their diets  
**0:24:48-0:24:53:**  but you would still have to have the bulk of your feed that's along the same lines as  
**0:24:53-0:24:58:**  today which is to say grains or you know annual plants.  
**0:24:58-0:25:08:**  Yeah yes you do, although we are looking at, well we already have them, we work with, we're  
**0:25:08-0:25:22:**  using Fodabeat, we're looking at Jerusalem artichokes and we do grow and have been working  
**0:25:22-0:25:34:**  with looseairn as a crop because they, and we have got evidence that you can, they do  
**0:25:34-0:25:37:**  reduce the need for concentrates.  
**0:25:37-0:25:44:**  The reason why I asked this is because I recorded an interview a few weeks ago with Eric Tonesmeyer  
**0:25:44-0:25:53:**  who basically, his thesis was that a good way to make our diets more perennial was to  
**0:25:53-0:25:58:**  start making livestock's diets more perennial before you know changing people's diets, saying  
**0:25:58-0:26:04:**  you know it's easier to give chestnuts to pigs than having all French people eat chestnuts  
**0:26:04-0:26:10:**  and flour based bread but you know when we look into how it actually functions that's  
**0:26:10-0:26:16:**  why I'm asking you know how realistic do you see that in terms of how does that intersect  
**0:26:16-0:26:23:**  with your production cycles and I imagine like logistically it would be quite complex  
**0:26:23-0:26:29:**  yeah to have like a totally perennial base for pigs' diets.  
**0:26:29-0:26:36:**  Yeah I think it's possible, I think it comes down to scale, I mean as I mentioned earlier  
**0:26:36-0:26:43:**  we have a couple of apple orchards which obviously can be included in the agroforestry, it's  
**0:26:43-0:26:52:**  not, it wasn't subsidised, that was a personal choice to plant those and yeah we've run pigs  
**0:26:52-0:27:03:**  directly under the apple orchards and that's a traditional way of doing things but you  
**0:27:03-0:27:14:**  know obviously there's a limited window there in the season and it comes down to volume  
**0:27:14-0:27:23:**  which raises the question of, that's one of the things that has struck me as far as the  
**0:27:23-0:27:31:**  agroforestry and actually this farm and the question and when I mentioned earlier about  
**0:27:31-0:27:37:**  the during the planning of the project we didn't have, we didn't sort of talk about  
**0:27:37-0:27:44:**  specifically about, we didn't relate the pigs to the tree planting it was just right agroforestry  
**0:27:44-0:27:53:**  the land, the trees and then we went our own way as far as integrating the pigs into it  
**0:27:53-0:28:00:**  but I do think that it would be interesting to look at a whole farm picture for example  
**0:28:00-0:28:09:**  and perhaps if I was doing it all over again to say right okay here's the basis I'm planning  
**0:28:09-0:28:18:**  a 50 sow unit fattening through to slaughter and I've got this agricultural project, sorry  
**0:28:18-0:28:25:**  agroforestry project and look at it and maybe say well hang on a minute it might be better  
**0:28:25-0:28:33:**  to have a more multi-species approach to it to get the most out of that project and the  
**0:28:33-0:28:42:**  farm, by that I mean maybe you know I haven't got the sums in front of me but imagine you  
**0:28:42-0:28:58:**  said well let's okay let's not do 50 sows let's do 20 sows and 15 cows or look at rearing  
**0:28:58-0:29:06:**  chickens within the trees you know combinations of to try and have to try and arrive obviously  
**0:29:06-0:29:12:**  one has to be keep your eye on the ball and produce a living and there's the question  
**0:29:12-0:29:22:**  of in my case being a one-man band you know being able to cope with it all but I think  
**0:29:22-0:29:29:**  that mixity or mixed mixing livestock would be would be a way forward.  
**0:29:29-0:29:35:**  Going back a bit more to the the practical daily level could you describe to us what  
**0:29:35-0:29:42:**  it looks like to manage these trees that you've planted on the farm both in terms of what  
**0:29:42-0:29:47:**  their uptake requires in terms of workload and how that might have affected the workflow  
**0:29:47-0:29:53:**  through the year but also understanding maybe some of the challenges that have risen in  
**0:29:53-0:29:57:**  terms of implementing these trees and taking care of them.  
**0:29:57-0:30:05:**  Probably the biggest challenge we've had has been through pest damage namely deer despite  
**0:30:05-0:30:12:**  the fact that the trees were were staked and protected with guards the deer are terribly  
**0:30:12-0:30:19:**  persistent and we we've had a lot of damage.  
**0:30:19-0:30:24:**  In the two the two areas you know I mentioned I have two fields principally one of 11 hectares  
**0:30:24-0:30:33:**  one of six the six six hectare field is actually fenced with a sheep netting all the way around  
**0:30:33-0:30:41:**  and noticeably the that was bit that was to some extent to for the BO security because  
**0:30:41-0:30:45:**  it's that field that we're doing the work with grazing the pigs between the rows of  
**0:30:45-0:30:54:**  trees so there's been noticeably less deer damage however a given agroforestry project  
**0:30:54-0:31:01:**  it would it would add an enormous cost if it was deemed that you should fence the whole  
**0:31:01-0:31:04:**  the whole area destined for planting.  
**0:31:04-0:31:14:**  So anyway we've had we've had problems with that and we're now which has led to tree deaths  
**0:31:14-0:31:22:**  and therefore replanting we've now actually moved on to putting a repulsive which is a  
**0:31:22-0:31:30:**  non-chemical one it's an approved one it's a natural repulsive based on blood I believe  
**0:31:30-0:31:39:**  sounds gross but we're trying that and sheep's wool apparently is a repellent to deer so  
**0:31:39-0:31:44:**  that that's been what was probably the most challenging and the most disappointing to  
**0:31:44-0:31:47:**  go out and find damage if not destroy trees.  
**0:31:47-0:31:52:**  And since you've had all these issues with deers have you had any echoes or you know  
**0:31:52-0:31:56:**  have you seen anything that you could have done differently to prevent this damage do  
**0:31:56-0:31:57:**  you think?  
**0:31:57-0:32:02:**  I think we did everything that was necessary in other words we protected the trees with  
**0:32:02-0:32:11:**  guards and stakes I think what what we should have done is perhaps used a repulsive from  
**0:32:11-0:32:17:**  the beginning rather than than wait to this stage.  
**0:32:17-0:32:24:**  And moving on to bit management one of the challenges that comes to my mind is if you're  
**0:32:24-0:32:30:**  used to have a big field of 11 hectares or whatever and you all of a sudden put in trees  
**0:32:30-0:32:36:**  in areas of uncultivated land that's that many more borders that you have in your field  
**0:32:36-0:32:43:**  with potential you know weeds coming out of them and some technical issues around that  
**0:32:43-0:32:49:**  how have you been you know tackling that issue of managing the understory of those tree lines?  
**0:32:49-0:32:56:**  Well we tend to I mean it depends what you have growing in the alleys by the trees because  
**0:32:56-0:33:00:**  obviously if you've got a cereal crop that becomes a given time of the year when you  
**0:33:00-0:33:06:**  can't access because you've got the crop growing and you would be running in a standing crop  
**0:33:06-0:33:18:**  so but usually for the weed control I have I think we call it a broyer in French don't  
**0:33:18-0:33:26:**  we but a topper a weed topper which goes to take the weeds down so we cut them obviously  
**0:33:26-0:33:33:**  we're organic so we don't spray obviously so it's mechanical work which is not that  
**0:33:33-0:33:41:**  easy obviously because with trees even at eight meters apart it's you can't you obviously  
**0:33:41-0:33:46:**  can't drive a straight line because you go over your trees so it's not that easy but  
**0:33:46-0:33:57:**  at the same time the weeds and the plants I always remember one of my college professors  
**0:33:57-0:34:05:**  describing weeds as plants whose virtues we haven't yet discovered and I think you know  
**0:34:05-0:34:14:**  that they provide a habitat for insects and bird life so I'm not too obsessive about whacking  
**0:34:14-0:34:20:**  the weeds down to be honest I don't it's not been a big amount of a particular problem  
**0:34:20-0:34:26:**  in my eyes but have you had any issues for example with brambles taking over or you know  
**0:34:26-0:34:32:**  as you leave pieces of land undisturbed for a while you might have some undesirable species  
**0:34:32-0:34:39:**  or not at all it's funny but within the agro within the agro forestry brambles have not  
**0:34:39-0:34:49:**  been an issue I do have brambles in other places but to be honest the one thing I've  
**0:34:49-0:34:56:**  noticed is that brambles do our nature's way of actually helping trees get established  
**0:34:56-0:35:04:**  because the one thing brambles do is they keep deer off because they but obviously you  
**0:35:04-0:35:14:**  know you can't let a great infestation take place but I'm not I haven't had an issue with  
**0:35:14-0:35:24:**  that no in fact I have a little experiment outside of the described agro forestry fields  
**0:35:24-0:35:33:**  in the pig field where I have my breeding stock and in certain of my parks maternity  
**0:35:33-0:35:40:**  parks for example I have brambles that have taken hold and at first I was going to try  
**0:35:40-0:35:48:**  and rip them out and then I had the idea to to try and plant a few trees within those  
**0:35:48-0:35:56:**  brambles even though the pigs are running free around just to see if their trees would  
**0:35:56-0:36:02:**  develop naturally and be left alone by the pigs because obviously if I planted a tree  
**0:36:02-0:36:10:**  within a free standing within a one of the pig fields it would get rooted out so we'll  
**0:36:10-0:36:17:**  see what happens that's just a by the by approach but it is interesting to just at least know  
**0:36:17-0:36:22:**  that for you you know having some vegetation developing close to your arable crops hasn't  
**0:36:22-0:36:27:**  caused any major issues and I think that's that's an interesting takeaway for anyone  
**0:36:27-0:36:32:**  listening yeah and I also but I also think one of the things we haven't talked about  
**0:36:32-0:36:39:**  yet is is actually alternative management strategies for the space between the trees  
**0:36:39-0:36:49:**  and it's something that we are touching upon in the agri mix project and it's been suggested  
**0:36:49-0:36:58:**  that for example we could look at integrating aromatic plants it's as we say in English  
**0:36:58-0:37:05:**  horses for courses that somebody on a given project might find that quite interesting  
**0:37:05-0:37:15:**  to explore with it in between the trees soft fruit herbs flowers yeah in other words there  
**0:37:15-0:37:23:**  could be alternatives to to just having grass between or weeds between the trees it could  
**0:37:23-0:37:30:**  be actually seen as a as a minor productive well minor or major productive a complementary  
**0:37:30-0:37:39:**  product productivity and so we we planted some mint and there's anyone that knows mint  
**0:37:39-0:37:46:**  knows that it spreads voraciously and and that's worked quite well it's it's it's moved  
**0:37:46-0:37:56:**  its way up and may may prove to be a good alternative to to having to to to to mechanically  
**0:37:56-0:38:01:**  cut weeds it kind of shows that some things that might be let's say technically feasible  
**0:38:01-0:38:08:**  or ecologically feasible or even with a productive potential like maybe densifying and having  
**0:38:08-0:38:13:**  productive crops in the understory that still requires you know you either to have the time  
**0:38:13-0:38:18:**  to do it which I doubt you have because you're already you know running like a full-time  
**0:38:18-0:38:24:**  business or finding someone to collaborate with and and that kind of ties into a conversation  
**0:38:24-0:38:29:**  I was having in my last episode about you know the the possibility of layering enterprises  
**0:38:29-0:38:35:**  on a one same piece of land and maybe creating opportunities for for younger farmers and  
**0:38:35-0:38:39:**  and you finding maybe a young person in the region that wants to get started and doesn't  
**0:38:39-0:38:46:**  have access to land and say well listen I've got you know X amount of meters of tree lines  
**0:38:46-0:38:52:**  and you're welcome to come in and grow a crop on that tree line and you know again that  
**0:38:52-0:38:58:**  sounds like a good idea then you know how feasible is it in terms of you know on practical  
**0:38:58-0:39:04:**  terms like it you'd have to see that but I do find it interesting like it seems like  
**0:39:04-0:39:09:**  one of the limits of agroforestry at the moment is finding new structures social structures  
**0:39:09-0:39:16:**  and work structures to enable like us to really reach the full potential of the land yeah  
**0:39:16-0:39:24:**  yeah no I agree I I always find it curious that on a farm I on my farm of 45 hectares  
**0:39:24-0:39:29:**  it's it's there's a there's an old bread oven which no longer functions and it but it's  
**0:39:29-0:39:35:**  very clear from the size of that bread oven that it catered for a lot more than just the  
**0:39:35-0:39:42:**  farmer and we know in that that there were a lot more people involved one way and another  
**0:39:42-0:39:46:**  I mean some of them on domestic chores within the house looking after children what have  
**0:39:46-0:39:54:**  you but but I do feel that when we talk about the future and we talk about food shortages  
**0:39:54-0:40:00:**  and the population growing that we only scratch at the surface really of what our farms are  
**0:40:00-0:40:12:**  capable of producing and and I'm having the farm within alleys is is is is is is a way  
**0:40:12-0:40:20:**  of diversifying and as you say it's a complicated issue but you could imagine giving access  
**0:40:20-0:40:31:**  to to somebody else to to produce vegetables or or within within the alleys and a great  
**0:40:31-0:40:40:**  a much greater diversification and productivity on the farm I feel could be possible when  
**0:40:40-0:40:51:**  I when I read about India and how the productivity that the some of the Indian farmers have off  
**0:40:51-0:40:57:**  a one acre plot you know it gives you room for thought obviously it's complicated in  
**0:40:57-0:41:06:**  Europe because of because of labor charges and what have you but perhaps in the future  
**0:41:06-0:41:13:**  an alternative to that and you know I remember discussing this with a farmer with a bit of  
**0:41:13-0:41:20:**  a similar system to what you've been describing arable you know arable crops a bit with some  
**0:41:20-0:41:25:**  tree lines and quite widely spaced trees well he was saying that he'd much prefer having  
**0:41:25-0:41:29:**  hedges instead of these like wide spaced trees you know if you're gonna have a line that  
**0:41:29-0:41:34:**  he prefers to just have to manage a hedge because he felt that would be a bit cleaner  
**0:41:34-0:41:38:**  in the landscape with you know less weeds around it would that something that would  
**0:41:38-0:41:45:**  resonate with you as well or are you happy with those kind of widely spaced trees well  
**0:41:45-0:41:53:**  it's funny you should say that but this morning we just finished planting 600 meters of hedge  
**0:41:53-0:42:04:**  line in which in a in a in a in a another field which is a 12 13 hectare field which is now  
**0:42:04-0:42:11:**  because of that hedge planting split into three parcels of four hectares approximately  
**0:42:11-0:42:17:**  and and just on the same lines of what you think of what you've the point you've just  
**0:42:17-0:42:27:**  made um I I wanted to break that field up with an agroforestry idea but when I when  
**0:42:27-0:42:35:**  I think about it I think uh hedge line I don't know why why not as opposed you know I don't  
**0:42:35-0:42:45:**  know why where the the notion of having trees only at eight meter intervals came about I  
**0:42:45-0:42:51:**  mean we know that eight meter spacing is for the eventual canopies when the trees there  
**0:42:51-0:42:59:**  that they're not overcrowded but there's all that space underneath which as as the the  
**0:42:59-0:43:08:**  person you mentioned said um planting shrubs and other things cuts out the need for weeding  
**0:43:08-0:43:16:**  and provides a more interesting biodiversity again so so yeah proof of pudding is yes we've  
**0:43:16-0:43:23:**  put in place hedges as opposed to agroforestry and of course within it within a hedge I mean  
**0:43:23-0:43:30:**  a hedge can be managed um one thinks of a hedge a privet hedge which is uniform square  
**0:43:30-0:43:37:**  but this we're not talking about that we're talking about hedges of diverse species some  
**0:43:37-0:43:44:**  of which can be left to develop into trees so you can manage that hedge as you wish for  
**0:43:44-0:43:52:**  the future it can become an agroforestry hedge and so uh you know just maybe wrapping up  
**0:43:52-0:43:59:**  this uh this management um discussion uh you know there's the planting there's uh establishing  
**0:43:59-0:44:05:**  the trees but then on the kind of yearly base uh do you do any pruning or any weeding or  
**0:44:05-0:44:14:**  do you just let them be yeah I actually um I do that we I sometimes do that with um the  
**0:44:14-0:44:24:**  advisor from um from the association silvia he'll come and we'll prune the trees to encourage  
**0:44:24-0:44:33:**  them to take the desirable shape if you like so that that's um and and whilst doing that  
**0:44:33-0:44:41:**  that's the moment when you can identify any trees that need replacing or or or sometimes  
**0:44:41-0:44:46:**  what we found sadly due to the deer damage is the trees haven't actually been killed  
**0:44:46-0:44:52:**  but they've been damaged to the degree that they're better off being cut down to ground  
**0:44:52-0:44:59:**  level and and then letting them re reshoot um which obviously is a bit frustrating um  
**0:44:59-0:45:06:**  in terms of the time scale of things because you know it's taking them backwards rather  
**0:45:06-0:45:14:**  than forwards but um it's better it saves planting you're not losing a tree you know  
**0:45:14-0:45:21:**  as we as we take this uh interview to an end I did want to ask uh you know very honestly  
**0:45:21-0:45:27:**  uh today do you see agroforestry as something that uh can pay for itself that a farmer can  
**0:45:27-0:45:33:**  do uh you know out of just like uh just a purity farming concern or or does it have  
**0:45:33-0:45:40:**  to be something driven by an ideal and convictions I think uh it depends how you define paying  
**0:45:40-0:45:46:**  I mean for me it pays me every time I step outside into the environment because as I  
**0:45:46-0:45:54:**  stated earlier for me farming is is is being integrated into your environment and it gives  
**0:45:54-0:46:01:**  me enormous pleasure just stepping out into my fields and seeing all those trees um you  
**0:46:01-0:46:09:**  know given my age of 60 plus uh no it will not pay for me it's it's uh but it but I hope  
**0:46:09-0:46:18:**  it it will pay um for the future generation um and my children and their children um I  
**0:46:18-0:46:26:**  don't there's no short-term profit I mean obviously eventually there is a there is a  
**0:46:26-0:46:32:**  timber value there's there's now we people take branch prune trees and use the branches  
**0:46:32-0:46:39:**  for heating so yeah there's something to be had out of it and also um you know as we've  
**0:46:39-0:46:47:**  said maybe there's a an opportunity for marketing produce that benefits from the fruit and nuts  
**0:46:47-0:46:56:**  uh from this as a food from the trees and enhances the uh the flavor of the meat so  
**0:46:56-0:47:04:**  yeah no but I I honestly if I have one thing I think it's you do it out of conviction um  
**0:47:04-0:47:10:**  and as a gesture for the planet and the environment and future generations  
**0:47:10-0:47:15:**  thank you for this really interesting conversation and uh you know hopefully we can check in  
**0:47:15-0:47:21:**  in a few years and hear about uh how you overcame the the deer challenge and how your trees  
**0:47:21-0:47:28:**  are doing yeah very much so thank you for listening as usual you'll find the relevant  
**0:47:28-0:47:33:**  links down below in the description you can contact us through our website or through  
**0:47:33-0:47:39:**  our social media we'd be very grateful if you considered supporting the podcast so that  
**0:47:39-0:47:45:**  we can make this sustainable in the long run thank you

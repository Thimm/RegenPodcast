### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:24:27)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:45:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:50:**  I have the pleasure of interviewing Eric Tonesmeyer who is the author of The Carbon Farming Solution  
**0:00:50-0:00:54:**  among other great books on agroforestry and perennial crops.  
**0:00:54-0:00:58:**  The first part of the interview is focused on understanding the carbon sequestration  
**0:00:58-0:01:02:**  potential of agroforestry, focusing especially on silvopasture.  
**0:01:02-0:01:06:**  I found this very helpful to recap how essential it is to increase the number of trees in our  
**0:01:06-0:01:09:**  landscapes as we attempt to tackle climate change.  
**0:01:09-0:01:14:**  Another great part of the conversation is his current work on alley cropping and outlining  
**0:01:14-0:01:19:**  where it makes more sense as well as what prevents its uptake.  
**0:01:19-0:01:22:**  Hello Eric, welcome to the show.  
**0:01:22-0:01:26:**  Thank you so much for joining us today.  
**0:01:26-0:01:27:**  Thanks very much for having me.  
**0:01:27-0:01:30:**  It's good to be here.  
**0:01:30-0:01:36:**  Maybe to get started, you could just tell us how you first started getting interested  
**0:01:36-0:01:39:**  in agroforestry and trees in general.  
**0:01:39-0:01:40:**  Sure.  
**0:01:40-0:01:53:**  I was just out of high school in 1990 and I came across a conference talk on permaculture  
**0:01:53-0:01:59:**  and read some of the very early books, the first books on permaculture which were really  
**0:01:59-0:02:07:**  about what today we would call multi strata agroforestry.  
**0:02:07-0:02:11:**  I decided that's what I wanted to do with my life and that's really what I've done ever  
**0:02:11-0:02:12:**  since.  
**0:02:12-0:02:19:**  How did you come to write your book on carbon and the role of farming and carbon sequestration?  
**0:02:19-0:02:20:**  Sure.  
**0:02:20-0:02:26:**  Well, I had been doing work with agroforestry and perennial crops for many, many years but  
**0:02:26-0:02:34:**  it was in maybe 2008 that I read a book by Tim Flannery who's an Australian scientist  
**0:02:34-0:02:35:**  whose work.  
**0:02:35-0:02:38:**  Anything he writes on any subject.  
**0:02:38-0:02:44:**  He had a new book on climate change called Now or Never.  
**0:02:44-0:02:49:**  That was my realizing that this wasn't just a problem for the future but it was very much  
**0:02:49-0:02:56:**  a time of reckoning on that.  
**0:02:56-0:03:02:**  There was a particular passage where he said, yes, trees can play a really important role  
**0:03:02-0:03:09:**  but there's only so much land available for trees because we have to keep land for farming.  
**0:03:09-0:03:16:**  I thought, well, there are kinds of farming that involve trees and if so esteemed a scientist  
**0:03:16-0:03:23:**  as Tim Flannery maybe doesn't know that yet then maybe there's a role for me here to promote  
**0:03:23-0:03:30:**  these perennial agricultural systems and their potential role for climate change.  
**0:03:30-0:03:40:**  So that's when I began work on what became the Carbon Farming book which came out nine  
**0:03:40-0:03:41:**  years later.  
**0:03:41-0:03:49:**  So there was a long learning curve of coming to understand the science and the issues around  
**0:03:49-0:03:54:**  climate change mitigation in general and then learning the systems and the species doing  
**0:03:54-0:04:02:**  sort of a global search through those in a global inventory of species and practices.  
**0:04:02-0:04:10:**  And after researching the topic for so many years are you still convinced that necessarily  
**0:04:10-0:04:13:**  storing carbon has to go through trees?  
**0:04:13-0:04:18:**  Just to clarify my question, a lot of people are working also on other types of regenerative  
**0:04:18-0:04:25:**  agriculture that don't include trees and I think many people still think trees are one  
**0:04:25-0:04:30:**  possibility but not necessarily an obligation into regenerative processes.  
**0:04:30-0:04:32:**  What's your view on that?  
**0:04:32-0:04:38:**  Well I don't think that they're the right fit for every farm in every case but the numbers  
**0:04:38-0:04:45:**  seem pretty clear that wherever they can be included they greatly increase the amount  
**0:04:45-0:04:50:**  of carbon both in the soil and in the biomass of the trees.  
**0:04:50-0:04:58:**  So in almost every case we see that a good system let's say with cover crops and crop  
**0:04:58-0:05:05:**  rotation and compost application is good but when you add trees it becomes better.  
**0:05:05-0:05:06:**  In terms of carbon it's better.  
**0:05:06-0:05:09:**  That doesn't mean it's necessarily more profitable.  
**0:05:09-0:05:12:**  It doesn't mean it's the right choice for that farm.  
**0:05:12-0:05:18:**  Whether water is limiting that could still be a bad idea.  
**0:05:18-0:05:25:**  There isn't any one uniform way to do it but it's almost always better when you add more  
**0:05:25-0:05:27:**  trees like a lot better.  
**0:05:27-0:05:32:**  Three times better, five times better, ten times better in terms of carbon.  
**0:05:32-0:05:38:**  And that still people read that tell me they've read that book all the time and then don't  
**0:05:38-0:05:39:**  think about the trees at all.  
**0:05:39-0:05:45:**  I'm like the only talk about soil so I think the core concept of that book really is if  
**0:05:45-0:05:50:**  you can add trees you should still is something that very much needs to be advocated for while  
**0:05:50-0:05:54:**  the notion that soil can sequester carbon which was sort of new at that time is very  
**0:05:54-0:06:00:**  widely accepted now that the importance of trees I think is still really not taken as  
**0:06:00-0:06:03:**  seriously as it should be.  
**0:06:03-0:06:09:**  And of course it's difficult to go into too much detail in this short podcast and I really  
**0:06:09-0:06:15:**  recommend all of our listeners to go straight to your book because there's a ton of really  
**0:06:15-0:06:19:**  useful information and it's really a fascinating read.  
**0:06:19-0:06:24:**  But just maybe to give a short context what makes trees so good at storing carbon?  
**0:06:24-0:06:26:**  Why are they so important?  
**0:06:26-0:06:27:**  Sure.  
**0:06:27-0:06:34:**  Well first the biomass of the trees itself, the wood of the trees, the branches and the  
**0:06:34-0:06:37:**  trunk and the roots all hold carbon.  
**0:06:37-0:06:44:**  If you dry them out they're about 50% carbon on a dry weight basis, about half carbon.  
**0:06:44-0:06:47:**  So first of all there's that.  
**0:06:47-0:06:54:**  But also they do a very good job increasing soil organic matter which is one of the fundamental  
**0:06:54-0:07:01:**  components of carbon farming as well.  
**0:07:01-0:07:03:**  They have deeper roots.  
**0:07:03-0:07:07:**  They have roots that are alive all winter long unlike in an annual system where there's  
**0:07:07-0:07:12:**  periods where there's no living roots in the soil.  
**0:07:12-0:07:17:**  The roots die back, the root hairs die back every year and that contributes a lot of organic  
**0:07:17-0:07:18:**  matter.  
**0:07:18-0:07:24:**  The roots drop to the soil and decompose and that provides a lot of organic matter.  
**0:07:24-0:07:28:**  So they just do a good job.  
**0:07:28-0:07:31:**  And of course there's as you mentioned two dimensions.  
**0:07:31-0:07:36:**  There's storing carbon and wood products maybe in through their biomass that can be used  
**0:07:36-0:07:38:**  in construction etc.  
**0:07:38-0:07:44:**  And there's the fact that they help store carbon in the soils.  
**0:07:44-0:07:50:**  Would you argue that it's more long-lived to export those tree trunks and keep them  
**0:07:50-0:07:56:**  in houses for example or construction because I mean carbon stored in soils can easily be  
**0:07:56-0:07:58:**  reverted right?  
**0:07:58-0:08:04:**  One of the weaknesses of any kind of agricultural carbon sequestration is that that carbon can  
**0:08:04-0:08:14:**  be lost if let's say there's a fire, the tree carbon may be lost or if the farmer returns  
**0:08:14-0:08:21:**  to plowing the soil again the soil carbon can be lost very quickly or if the climate  
**0:08:21-0:08:25:**  dries out which we're seeing happening in many places in the world already that the  
**0:08:25-0:08:32:**  land is becoming a net emitter of carbon because it's just getting so dry that it is losing  
**0:08:32-0:08:34:**  the carbon that it has.  
**0:08:34-0:08:41:**  Whereas carbon that's stored in a building or furniture or books or something like that  
**0:08:41-0:08:44:**  is stored for the life of that product.  
**0:08:44-0:08:49:**  Now books and houses and furniture can burn as well and that is a concern with climate  
**0:08:49-0:08:59:**  change but that is a pretty good secure storage and if and only if that new trees are planted  
**0:08:59-0:09:07:**  or if the old tree re-sprouts and regrows then you start the cycle again of carbon sequestration  
**0:09:07-0:09:13:**  and actually that's one of the real advantages of trees in carbon farming systems is that  
**0:09:13-0:09:18:**  in an ordinary grazing system or an improved regenerative annual farming system you get  
**0:09:18-0:09:28:**  a few decades of carbon sequestration and then it stops or it slows down to almost nothing  
**0:09:28-0:09:32:**  and then you're back to where you began you can become a source of emissions again or  
**0:09:32-0:09:34:**  whatever.  
**0:09:34-0:09:39:**  What's unique about agroforestry is you can plant trees and then they can be harvested  
**0:09:39-0:09:44:**  at some point stored in some long-term way like we were saying timber or books or what  
**0:09:44-0:09:50:**  have you and then replanted or resprouted and they begin the cycle of active carbon  
**0:09:50-0:09:57:**  sequestration again so instead of only lasting 30 or 50 years you could maybe continue for  
**0:09:57-0:10:03:**  centuries by operating in that way so that's sort of a hack of saturation which is really  
**0:10:03-0:10:11:**  important especially if you're trying to offset let's say the emissions of the methane and  
**0:10:11-0:10:16:**  nitrous oxide emissions of grazing animals on a farm like that once your soil is full  
**0:10:16-0:10:22:**  of carbon you're out of luck unless you can reset the cycle with trees.  
**0:10:22-0:10:28:**  So you would disagree with you know we've heard some claims saying that for example  
**0:10:28-0:10:33:**  intensive rotational grazing alone or on a very large scale would be enough to sequester  
**0:10:33-0:10:38:**  enough carbon to reverse climate change it seems that what you're saying is that through  
**0:10:38-0:10:41:**  your research you found that that wouldn't necessarily be the case.  
**0:10:41-0:10:49:**  I would very much say that's not the case first of all because of the issue of saturation  
**0:10:49-0:10:54:**  that it only goes for so many years and then slows down but also just if you look at the  
**0:10:54-0:11:02:**  sequestration rates of that are actually shown in science and apply them to the amount of  
**0:11:02-0:11:06:**  grazing land that they could be applied to that's not enough to to do the job at all  
**0:11:06-0:11:13:**  it's it's one powerful tool it's a very important very powerful tool but at Project Drawdown  
**0:11:13-0:11:18:**  for example we found that it wasn't that it was wasn't even our most powerful agricultural  
**0:11:18-0:11:26:**  practice it's only as part of a program that includes action across agriculture and the  
**0:11:26-0:11:31:**  food system and also in transportation and electricity generation and building design  
**0:11:31-0:11:37:**  and urban planning and everything else reducing of consumption in the wealthy countries only  
**0:11:37-0:11:41:**  with all those things together can we achieve mitigation.  
**0:11:41-0:11:51:**  So I think some of the grazing advocates in their enthusiasm have over promised what kind  
**0:11:51-0:11:55:**  of impact is possible with that and in fact if you look at the numbers that have come  
**0:11:55-0:12:02:**  out recently in studies funded by enthusiasts of that kind of grazing mostly the sequestration  
**0:12:02-0:12:08:**  rates have not been as high as they initially promised in fact they've gone down the last  
**0:12:08-0:12:16:**  couple of studies they've been going down so I don't think it's enough to say there's  
**0:12:16-0:12:21:**  no single practice that's going to do it it takes lots of action everywhere and I think  
**0:12:21-0:12:25:**  ultimately we're not well served by that kind of over promising.  
**0:12:25-0:12:29:**  Which is an over promising that happens as well in the world of agroforestry and on trees  
**0:12:29-0:12:36:**  and I think for now we often discuss this with Dimitri but I think we've reached the  
**0:12:36-0:12:45:**  conclusion of being very cautious with any silver bullets and very seductive unique solution  
**0:12:45-0:12:48:**  because there's a part of us that really wants to believe in them and it's probably linked  
**0:12:48-0:12:55:**  to psychology of despair or something faced with the situation we're in we want to think  
**0:12:55-0:13:03:**  about the savior that changes it all but definitely I agree with what you're saying.  
**0:13:03-0:13:07:**  One of the things we learned at Project Drawdown and I went to work for Drawdown just as I  
**0:13:07-0:13:15:**  was finishing work on the draft of the carbon farming book is that you can sort of make  
**0:13:15-0:13:19:**  estimates of what the technical potential might be if you took this practice and did  
**0:13:19-0:13:24:**  it to all of the world's grassland but you don't get to have all of the world's grassland  
**0:13:24-0:13:30:**  the way to do it sort of responsibly is to say well how much is there now how much land  
**0:13:30-0:13:37:**  is there in alley cropping or in managed grazing or whatever practice now and how much could  
**0:13:37-0:13:43:**  there be how much potential land is there available for that and what rate is it spreading  
**0:13:43-0:13:50:**  at now what's the sort of most ambitious rate that it might grow at but you're never going  
**0:13:50-0:13:55:**  to get a hundred percent of the world's farmers to do anything because farmers are very independent  
**0:13:55-0:14:00:**  minded people so first you'll never get a hundred percent for that and then some countries  
**0:14:00-0:14:05:**  are in the middle of you know wars and conflicts those are not places where it's going to be  
**0:14:05-0:14:11:**  easy to get a practice to achieve a hundred percent adoption right and so on so we the  
**0:14:11-0:14:16:**  difference between the technical potential and the achievable potential can be a very  
**0:14:16-0:14:23:**  big difference and really we should be more concerned with what's achievable than what's  
**0:14:23-0:14:30:**  theoretically possible although I do believe in in thinking really big when it comes to  
**0:14:30-0:14:39:**  climate change mitigation we don't get there without extremely ambitious programs but I  
**0:14:39-0:14:45:**  don't see us achieving the full technical potential and 100 adoption of all these practices  
**0:14:45-0:14:50:**  and often they want each other's land too this person wants grassland for grazing this  
**0:14:50-0:14:55:**  person wants it for silva pasture this person wants it for afforestation well there's only  
**0:14:55-0:15:03:**  so much land we can't in some cases we can use it for multiple things but we can't always  
**0:15:03-0:15:11:**  so there's a lot of practices maybe trying to make themselves give themselves all of  
**0:15:11-0:15:15:**  the available land when really they may need to share that with other practices and approaches  
**0:15:15-0:15:25:**  some land needs to be reforested for example so those are some of the kind of complexities  
**0:15:25-0:15:28:**  when you get to looking at it at the global level which we did with Rotem which was really  
**0:15:28-0:15:36:**  new and really fascinating for me to learn about that was really fun and interestingly  
**0:15:36-0:15:41:**  because we talked about trees and we also talked about grazing well the one one of the  
**0:15:41-0:15:47:**  surprisingly high impact solutions that you put forward was silva pasture so the mix of  
**0:15:47-0:15:53:**  those two elements could you tell us a bit more about you know that's that's agroforestry  
**0:15:53-0:15:59:**  system and how come it scored up so high on the in the drawdown project yeah that's we  
**0:15:59-0:16:04:**  got that question a lot because to many people it's such a new practice it is pretty widely  
**0:16:04-0:16:10:**  practiced around the world but not in some places really barely at all so like here in  
**0:16:10-0:16:16:**  the us it's barely practiced at all there's a couple of reasons one is that it's already  
**0:16:16-0:16:27:**  very widespread on an estimated 15 of the world's grazing land so it starts with a good  
**0:16:27-0:16:34:**  it has a head start you might say and then it has a there's quite a bit of grassland  
**0:16:34-0:16:40:**  that is suitable for silva pasture so the sort of maximum potential you could do it  
**0:16:40-0:16:47:**  on is pretty high not all grassland we figured that you could that all humid grassland would  
**0:16:47-0:16:56:**  serve for silva pasture and that some semi-arid grassland i've heard people say like darren  
**0:16:56-0:17:03:**  dowry says he can establish trees down to about 450 millimeters of rainfall a year but  
**0:17:03-0:17:08:**  really there's a point where it's kind of too dry for silva pasture or where it becomes  
**0:17:08-0:17:13:**  much more difficult to establish trees so sort of taking only the grassland that we  
**0:17:13-0:17:18:**  think gets enough rainfall to establish trees this still gives you an awful lot of an awful  
**0:17:18-0:17:25:**  lot of of potential grassland i think it was over 700 million hectares i mean really a  
**0:17:25-0:17:32:**  lot which is a small percentage of global grassland but still and then you have a very  
**0:17:32-0:17:37:**  high carbon sequestration rate the annual rate of carbon sequestered per year is very  
**0:17:37-0:17:43:**  high so when you take a lot of land plus a very high carbon sequestration rate you you  
**0:17:43-0:17:48:**  do okay and actually the the growth rate the adoption rate we modeled for silva pasture  
**0:17:48-0:17:56:**  was very modest we because we didn't have any examples of it spreading really rapidly  
**0:17:56-0:18:02:**  to to base that assumption on so it didn't nearly achieve its potential in the drawdown  
**0:18:02-0:18:09:**  its technical potential in the drawdown model but it just it does a really great job sequestering  
**0:18:09-0:18:16:**  carbon it's very very powerful and and we do see certain places where particularly columbia  
**0:18:16-0:18:24:**  and central america where it's and parts of mexico where it's taking off very very rapidly  
**0:18:24-0:18:28:**  and um i think that's uh something i'm paying close attention to i was just at the latin  
**0:18:28-0:18:36:**  american congress of silva pasture last week uh virtually and um there's a lot of excitement  
**0:18:36-0:18:42:**  that columbian national government is is including silva pasture as one of the like three core  
**0:18:42-0:18:50:**  pillars of their national uh mitigation efforts so um i do think there is some um we we may  
**0:18:50-0:18:58:**  be seeing a really big transformation of land in columbia um uh into silva pasture because  
**0:18:58-0:19:03:**  they've done so much of the the groundwork to make that possible already they're maybe  
**0:19:03-0:19:09:**  ready with excuse me with some extra um money and resources behind them to really take off  
**0:19:09-0:19:14:**  and transform the landscape there which would be fantastic i guess we'll have to start a  
**0:19:14-0:19:21:**  spanish podcast then to follow uh follow all of that uh action over there but i was going  
**0:19:21-0:19:26:**  to ask why does silva pasture then perform uh so much better than other agroforestry  
**0:19:26-0:19:35:**  systems sure well okay um it has to do with the com with the combination of the available  
**0:19:35-0:19:41:**  land the growth rate and the sequestration rate so alley cropping i think we actually  
**0:19:41-0:19:48:**  showed growing faster well we called it um tree intercropping because it includes alley  
**0:19:48-0:19:54:**  cropping and various other kinds of silver wearable systems um that's growing very rapidly  
**0:19:54-0:20:01:**  so we have a fast rate of growth but a lower carbon sequestration rate because you're typically  
**0:20:01-0:20:06:**  plowing between the trees you're burning up a lot of the carbon and it goes back into  
**0:20:06-0:20:13:**  the atmosphere again so the rate is lower even though the growth rate is faster um and  
**0:20:13-0:20:19:**  with multi-strata agroforestry has even a higher carbon sequestration rate than silva  
**0:20:19-0:20:27:**  pasture but um we chose to model it that it was restricted to the humid tropics which  
**0:20:27-0:20:35:**  mostly to all practical intents and purposes it is um on a commercial level like shade  
**0:20:35-0:20:40:**  coffee and shade cacao and things like that really we don't have that and then dry places  
**0:20:40-0:20:50:**  or cold places yet commercially um and also the amount of the area in multi-strata agroforestry  
**0:20:50-0:20:56:**  hasn't really changed in the last century in any discernible way that scientists have  
**0:20:56-0:21:03:**  been able to notice so it's not whereas like urban food forests and backyard food forests  
**0:21:03-0:21:09:**  have taken off really well there's not a million hectares of that even in the whole world yet  
**0:21:09-0:21:15:**  right so it's still very micro scale um so we we so there was a practice where we only  
**0:21:15-0:21:20:**  had a very small gain in the area but because it has such a high sequestration rate it still  
**0:21:20-0:21:29:**  has a big impact compared to let's say um nutrient management you know applying fertilizer  
**0:21:29-0:21:36:**  more thoughtfully um the per hectare impact is very very slim but because it can be it's  
**0:21:36-0:21:42:**  spreading so rapidly and it can be done on almost all of the world's cropland you have  
**0:21:42-0:21:48:**  about the same impact as multi-strata agroforestry even though one is growing really fast and  
**0:21:48-0:21:56:**  one is growing really slowly so it's this kind of um mix back and also uh all of the  
**0:21:56-0:22:04:**  agroforestry systems tend to be much more expensive to install to establish and to take  
**0:22:04-0:22:11:**  more years to pay back the farmer so there is this um a there are some economic barriers  
**0:22:11-0:22:17:**  without really friendly policies it's harder to establish those practices than say cover  
**0:22:17-0:22:23:**  cropping or managed grazing or nutrient management or low methane rice or some of these other  
**0:22:23-0:22:30:**  um agricultural practices so then you had to make a bit of a hypothesis on silver pasture  
**0:22:30-0:22:35:**  and kind of assessing you know how easy is it for this to be taken up by farmers because  
**0:22:35-0:22:42:**  one thing is to say potentially you know this many uh hectares are available in terms of  
**0:22:42-0:22:46:**  climate and conditions as you mentioned about rainfall but then it's another thing of saying  
**0:22:46-0:22:51:**  socially and economically how realistic is it for farmers to take it quickly so that's  
**0:22:51-0:22:55:**  if i understand properly that's also part of the hypothesis you you have behind different  
**0:22:55-0:22:59:**  models that is something that we took into account  
**0:22:59-0:23:08:**  and um uh and uh it's hard to do that i think uh one of drawdown's longer term goals is  
**0:23:08-0:23:17:**  to is to do more regional analyses and national level analyses and at that once you drill  
**0:23:17-0:23:22:**  down to a more specific region like if you looked at even just the eu level for example  
**0:23:22-0:23:27:**  it would be much easier to do that than looking at the whole planet where circumstances are  
**0:23:27-0:23:31:**  very different from different countries um and even the kind of silvopasture is different  
**0:23:31-0:23:44:**  like what we see in um a lot of eastern africa is that um um the land is managed by pastoralists  
**0:23:44-0:23:49:**  who don't own the land but bring their traveling herds through and there it's not so much a  
**0:23:49-0:23:57:**  matter of planting trees as managing the grazing in such a way that um the trees that naturally  
**0:23:57-0:24:03:**  emerge are allowed to do so and not browse down by livestock so that's a a different  
**0:24:03-0:24:09:**  it's sort of a passive silvopasture where you just let it happen you stop preventing  
**0:24:09-0:24:17:**  it from happening um which is really different from the sort of european mode where you go  
**0:24:17-0:24:22:**  out and you plant the trees in a row and all of that um so it's much more affordable to  
**0:24:22-0:24:29:**  establish costs nothing to establish except a little bit of extra work um but it would  
**0:24:29-0:24:35:**  take really different policies to encourage those two different kinds of silvopasture  
**0:24:35-0:24:44:**  and there might be um uh it might be much easier to market um european silvopasture  
**0:24:44-0:24:52:**  as a climate-friendly meat and milk and wool as opposed to you know um the livestock being  
**0:24:52-0:24:58:**  raised by messiah pastoralists who do not have access to those kinds of premium climate-friendly  
**0:24:58-0:25:03:**  markets things like that so um so it's hard to figure that out at a global level i guess  
**0:25:03-0:25:10:**  it makes more sense to to break it down region by region and think about what um uh what's  
**0:25:10-0:25:15:**  going to work but we did take that into account and that's why we don't have all of the world's  
**0:25:15-0:25:22:**  land in silvopasture or all of the world's grazing land and managed grazing because while  
**0:25:22-0:25:29:**  that would be lovely we don't see that um we don't see any historical evidence that  
**0:25:29-0:25:38:**  that's possible well at least from our uh regional perspective um we chatted to fabian  
**0:25:38-0:25:43:**  from the french agroforestry association a few months back and we asked them which which  
**0:25:43-0:25:48:**  agroforestry systems that have most uh demand and traction on and silvopasture was one of  
**0:25:48-0:25:56:**  them and definitely it's it feels that one of the let's say uh uh strong points of silvopasture  
**0:25:56-0:26:02:**  is that a lot of people with animals are already feeling very intense heat stress in summers  
**0:26:02-0:26:07:**  and just looking for shelter for their animals if only that you know which is already uh  
**0:26:07-0:26:15:**  you know a simpler objective to reach than for example fodder or really providing of  
**0:26:15-0:26:19:**  an animal's forage from silvopasture that's i think still quite experimental and has some  
**0:26:19-0:26:24:**  practical limitations but seeing people planting hedges and trees to just give some shade to  
**0:26:24-0:26:31:**  the animals is definitely something we see all around us at least in france um for sure  
**0:26:31-0:26:37:**  that's that's really the global trend yeah is is shade for livestock is increasingly  
**0:26:37-0:26:42:**  important and just going to get and i would add shade for farm workers is also very important  
**0:26:42-0:26:50:**  um uh the number of days that are above the temperature at which um humans and livestock  
**0:26:50-0:26:54:**  begin to take damage from heat is is is on the rise almost everywhere in the world and  
**0:26:54-0:27:02:**  is projected to uh be catastrophically bad so shade is is really important for that for  
**0:27:02-0:27:10:**  sure yeah just to wrap up the topic on silvopasture i just want to make sure we understand really  
**0:27:10-0:27:16:**  the mechanisms of of carbon sequestration you know we said that after a while uh grassland  
**0:27:16-0:27:22:**  stops storing carbon because it's saturated to its full potential um how does a tree help  
**0:27:22-0:27:31:**  taking that limit further sure the first thing is it does is it adds carbon above ground  
**0:27:31-0:27:38:**  often quite a lot of carbon above ground um so that's a huge it it takes the um carbon  
**0:27:38-0:27:44:**  that's being sequestered into another dimension you know um up into the air um but also it  
**0:27:44-0:27:53:**  increases both the the annual rate of carbon sequestration in the soil um but also the  
**0:27:53-0:28:01:**  total amount that can be stored so whereas what you mostly see with managed grazing systems  
**0:28:01-0:28:07:**  is a gain of maybe 30 to 50 tons of carbon per hectare in the soil with silvopasture  
**0:28:07-0:28:16:**  that can be as high as 250 just in the soil so you're expanding the soil storage capacity  
**0:28:16-0:28:25:**  um uh you're expanding its potential while also increasing above ground biomass from  
**0:28:25-0:28:31:**  functionally zero maybe four to twelve tons per hectare in the grass itself but you're  
**0:28:31-0:28:39:**  taking that quite a bit higher 30 40 50 sometimes 100 tons per hectare in in that above ground  
**0:28:39-0:28:46:**  biomass so um it really uh and ratonel writes about this that um you know we sort of think  
**0:28:46-0:28:51:**  that you can hit a certain point and then you're full in terms of saturation but if  
**0:28:51-0:28:56:**  you add another practice you can increase it again and then another practice and another  
**0:28:56-0:29:02:**  practice how many layers can we add while planting trees might not be the first practice  
**0:29:02-0:29:08:**  that a farmer does they might start by optimizing their stocking rate of livestock and so on  
**0:29:08-0:29:18:**  um seeding uh legume forages or something for example um from from the numbers that  
**0:29:18-0:29:27:**  i have seen uh uh nothing is as powerful as trees in a pasture and have have researchers  
**0:29:27-0:29:33:**  been able to to understand uh how it increases that uh potential is it through bringing carbon  
**0:29:33-0:29:41:**  deeper into the soil profile or is it maybe another type of carbon i would say i know  
**0:29:41-0:29:47:**  more about that in the alley cropping area than in silvopasture but a lot of it is just  
**0:29:47-0:29:55:**  because of the increased inputs of uh of biomass between the dropping of leaves and the shedding  
**0:29:55-0:30:03:**  of root hairs um uh it's kind of like dumping a bunch of compost on the on the field every  
**0:30:03-0:30:10:**  year um quite a lot um so a lot of it has to do with that and often the growing season  
**0:30:10-0:30:18:**  of the trees and the grasses are not the same so you have a longer overall season of photosynthesis  
**0:30:18-0:30:23:**  then you might like let's say in the summer when it gets dry and the grass is going dormant  
**0:30:23-0:30:28:**  if you have cool season grasses the trees are continuing to photosynthesize during that  
**0:30:28-0:30:33:**  period and at the same time those cool season grasses are going to photosynthesize in the  
**0:30:33-0:30:41:**  winter when the trees are dormant and have lost their leaves so um there's some complementarity  
**0:30:41-0:30:46:**  that trees and grass are doing different things at different times and they if it's well designed  
**0:30:46-0:30:51:**  and you have the right density of trees that aren't shading out all the grass and so on  
**0:30:51-0:30:58:**  um then then you can get sometimes you can do better than either trees alone or pasture  
**0:30:58-0:31:03:**  alone would get and that's really what we're aiming for with with agroforestry is to do  
**0:31:03-0:31:10:**  better than either trees or or grass or crops alone great but there isn't a special there  
**0:31:10-0:31:16:**  isn't a different kind of carbon sequestration or a different pathway or mechanism that i  
**0:31:16-0:31:22:**  that i know of it's just the same thing but but uh more more powerful and again not in  
**0:31:22-0:31:28:**  every situation if it's not in really dry places and not under certain other circumstances  
**0:31:28-0:31:35:**  but overall it seems much more powerful i guess what's so complicated is within within  
**0:31:35-0:31:40:**  just silver pasture you know because we're taking this example they might miss very different  
**0:31:40-0:31:45:**  uh practices you might have silver pasture where you're actually growing timber and exporting  
**0:31:45-0:31:50:**  that wood and using it for construction or furniture as we mentioned before or you might  
**0:31:50-0:31:57:**  just have some you know short cycle shrubs or trees that are just have a role of of providing  
**0:31:57-0:32:02:**  shade in our cycled back pretty quickly into the soil with obviously like a very different  
**0:32:02-0:32:09:**  potential in time to sequester carbon so i imagine that was quite a headache and that  
**0:32:09-0:32:14:**  when when governments like you were mentioning south american governments basing a mitigation  
**0:32:14-0:32:21:**  policy on on such practices um yeah it's quite uncertain and broad in a way isn't it it's  
**0:32:21-0:32:26:**  nice in that case let's say you're looking at columbia because you can say well the  
**0:32:26-0:32:31:**  main practices are you know this and this and that and the sequestration rate for those  
**0:32:31-0:32:37:**  is this and we think they can grow that much um they have less variables to work with than  
**0:32:37-0:32:43:**  a global study and it's not only the sort of the the patterning and the management of  
**0:32:43-0:32:49:**  the trees the layout and the density and the management but also the species of trees some  
**0:32:49-0:32:54:**  trees sequester more carbon than others and some will go um fast growing trees like poplars  
**0:32:54-0:33:01:**  will sequester more carbon in the first few decades but in the long run oaks slower growing  
**0:33:01-0:33:08:**  trees with denser wood will sequester more carbon so um it sort of depends what kind  
**0:33:08-0:33:12:**  of time scale you want to measure it on and a lot of it we don't really fully know yet  
**0:33:12-0:33:19:**  i think um um yeah if you're cutting the trees very short like if you're pollarding to feed  
**0:33:19-0:33:25:**  the foliage to livestock then there's carbon in that trunk and in the roots but you don't  
**0:33:25-0:33:30:**  have the whole crown of the tree so there's probably less carbon in that system than in  
**0:33:30-0:33:38:**  one that has full-size trees um there are um many many variables to to think about yeah  
**0:33:38-0:33:44:**  yeah great well yeah it's anyway thank you for that work because it's very useful to  
**0:33:44-0:33:50:**  have a bit this attempt at least to have a big picture view of these very complex questions  
**0:33:50-0:33:56:**  and this brings me to another theme that's very present in your book which is basically  
**0:33:56-0:34:02:**  as a as a solution you put forward is shifting towards more towards perennial cultures because  
**0:34:02-0:34:08:**  of their potential for carbon sequestration and my first question as a as a frenchman  
**0:34:08-0:34:16:**  that absolutely loves bread made with wheat um you know how how do you change people's  
**0:34:16-0:34:22:**  diets and and their culture um because i can just imagine uh the face of my neighbors as  
**0:34:22-0:34:28:**  i try and offer them a loaf of 100 chestnut flour bread and you know that that would be  
**0:34:28-0:34:38:**  a big step i um yes uh um and one of the folks in in in permaculture who advocates around  
**0:34:38-0:34:43:**  agroforestry and parental crops a lot is a guy named jeff lotton who um said to me once  
**0:34:43-0:34:48:**  that uh the hardest thing to get anyone to do that that as soon as someone is about two  
**0:34:48-0:34:55:**  years old they will never want to change what they eat for their basic staple food again  
**0:34:55-0:35:01:**  if it's rice if it's potatoes if it's bread it's locked in by the time people are two  
**0:35:01-0:35:09:**  years old and i i love bread as well so um i couldn't it would be hard for me to switch  
**0:35:09-0:35:15:**  to bananas or plantains or breadfruit or or or whatever um i think the first thing to  
**0:35:15-0:35:21:**  do is to change what we feed to livestock because they a pig doesn't care nearly as  
**0:35:21-0:35:26:**  much as a person about what kind of carbohydrates it's eating they're very happy to eat those  
**0:35:26-0:35:33:**  chestnuts or acorns or whatever it might be um and given that about a third of the crops  
**0:35:33-0:35:40:**  that we grow in the world are to feed livestock that's a big potential transformation right  
**0:35:40-0:35:48:**  there they don't care so or they don't have the option of caring anyway so i that that's  
**0:35:48-0:35:54:**  a third of our cropland right there that could be perennialized if everything else was working  
**0:35:54-0:36:02:**  well if the yields were appropriate and so on um and also um um somewhere around nine  
**0:36:02-0:36:08:**  or ten percent of all of our crops in the world are grown for feedstock for industry  
**0:36:08-0:36:17:**  raw materials for industry um uh for bioplastic for the chemicals industry things like that  
**0:36:17-0:36:26:**  and again flavor is not as important to a you know bioprocessing tank uh as it is to  
**0:36:26-0:36:31:**  to a person so i think there's potential to perennialize that as well with again assuming  
**0:36:31-0:36:37:**  you have the same yields and everything else works as well um a fermenting vat doesn't  
**0:36:37-0:36:45:**  care what kind of starch goes into it to a certain degree um so that's you know almost  
**0:36:45-0:36:52:**  half of farmland is taken care of that way um and and one important thing is that we  
**0:36:52-0:36:59:**  are work people are working on perennializing grains and um i think that will offer um many  
**0:36:59-0:37:05:**  of the of the staples we're accustomed to like um rice there's some perennial rice yielding  
**0:37:05-0:37:11:**  very very well in its fifth year now um on a number of different farms around china and  
**0:37:11-0:37:18:**  southeast asia it's it's grown like rice it's harvested like rice it's processed like processed  
**0:37:18-0:37:26:**  like rice it's eaten like rice it tastes like rice it is rice so um that's very easy as  
**0:37:26-0:37:32:**  well so there are some direct now we'll never have a perennial potato or carrot you can't  
**0:37:32-0:37:38:**  really perennialize root production um and i don't think we need to make all of agriculture  
**0:37:38-0:37:48:**  perennial we just need to make it as perennial as we can so on flat prime fertile soil we  
**0:37:48-0:37:54:**  can grow annuals in good ways and that's great um but that's what is it may be only a third  
**0:37:54-0:37:59:**  or a quarter of the world's farmland is actually really very good farmland anyway a lot of  
**0:37:59-0:38:05:**  it is highly erodible or is on a slope or for some other reason not ideal and those  
**0:38:05-0:38:11:**  are the places to me where we at least want to begin with perennializing maybe by mixing  
**0:38:11-0:38:17:**  the annual crops like wheat that we love with trees so we have an annual system that has  
**0:38:17-0:38:22:**  a tree component um but those are also good places to think about as perennial grains  
**0:38:22-0:38:30:**  come in um or to work on chestnuts and i've had a wonderful chestnut polenta um and i  
**0:38:30-0:38:40:**  think in in the context of an economic system that actually values the the ecosystem services  
**0:38:40-0:38:48:**  and the climate benefits and drawbacks of agriculture it might start to make a lot more  
**0:38:48-0:38:55:**  sense to do a lot more things with chestnuts than we do now um to use one example so um  
**0:38:55-0:39:03:**  uh but i i don't see um the french abandoning bread for chestnuts entirely i don't think  
**0:39:03-0:39:09:**  that would be fair to do and i don't think we should ask china to stop eating rice and  
**0:39:09-0:39:15:**  so on right but uh how much can we perennialize is really the question how far can we go and  
**0:39:15-0:39:21:**  the answer is much farther than we are now much much much farther even with what we know  
**0:39:21-0:39:26:**  how to do now and then there are things that will be coming 10 or 15 years from now better  
**0:39:26-0:39:34:**  perennial grains and so on that will really um enable another round of further perennialization  
**0:39:34-0:39:44:**  that um is still um uh uh that isn't yet possible i guess part of the reason why this hasn't  
**0:39:44-0:39:51:**  happened until now is that it still requires to change uh that a lot of the farming economy  
**0:39:51-0:39:54:**  and the way people relate to their food and what they're willing to pay if i take the  
**0:39:54-0:40:02:**  example of livestock for example uh we do have pigs you know eating acorns or um or  
**0:40:02-0:40:07:**  chestnuts but they are like a niche product high quality and people are willing to pay  
**0:40:07-0:40:13:**  a lot of money for that because of course in terms of the production models you can't  
**0:40:13-0:40:19:**  produce at the same price the same amount of meat uh feeding you know ready-made formula  
**0:40:19-0:40:26:**  for pigs in an industrial way or having a more perennially based system so you know  
**0:40:26-0:40:31:**  that's that's the other issue is we still go back to culture and and these huge uh social  
**0:40:31-0:40:37:**  uh locks that it it seems um the the first step in some ways there or or a wonderful  
**0:40:37-0:40:44:**  step if we can make it happen is to to get rid of the subsidies that are making that  
**0:40:44-0:40:50:**  kind of unsustainable agriculture possible and i i read a study a year or two ago that  
**0:40:50-0:40:59:**  globally it's about 700 billion dollars u.s dollars per year are going into subsidizing  
**0:40:59-0:41:05:**  agriculture whether it's the cap or other kinds of efforts like that um and about one  
**0:41:05-0:41:11:**  percent of those were sustainable climate-friendly practices so we're paying for the wrong kinds  
**0:41:11-0:41:18:**  of agriculture already which makes it very hard to compete with so if we could remove  
**0:41:18-0:41:28:**  some of those subsidies for the kinds of agriculture that are not climate-friendly um that makes  
**0:41:28-0:41:34:**  a bit more of what we would call here a level playing field a more fair competition between  
**0:41:34-0:41:40:**  regenerative practices then if we could take some of that money that is freed up and actually  
**0:41:40-0:41:45:**  use it to encourage the adoption of these practices to build markets to build the supply  
**0:41:45-0:41:54:**  chain infrastructure we need to make chestnuts reach their full potential let's say um to  
**0:41:54-0:42:00:**  pay farmers to plant trees on their farms to develop the kinds of education and outreach  
**0:42:00-0:42:06:**  programs that are necessary to help farmers adopt those practices well which trees which  
**0:42:06-0:42:14:**  varieties of those trees what distance what planting technique uh um developing the mechanization  
**0:42:14-0:42:22:**  systems that can make those uh more economically efficient to to to use um it's not that there  
**0:42:22-0:42:28:**  isn't money to do those things it's that we're spending it on um you know feedlots and and  
**0:42:28-0:42:32:**  things like that on on all kind of maybe the wrong kinds of agriculture which one can argue  
**0:42:32-0:42:38:**  those are climate-friendly because they intensify production and grow more land on the same  
**0:42:38-0:42:47:**  let's say hectare of land you know um uh which theoretically means less deforestation perhaps  
**0:42:47-0:42:53:**  for agriculture but that argument ignores that silvopasture and alley cropping also  
**0:42:53-0:43:02:**  intensify production quite a bit um so you can have you can increase productivity without  
**0:43:02-0:43:10:**  increasing uh you know pollution and emissions and and the and um uh having animal welfare  
**0:43:10-0:43:16:**  issues and all of that it's not really that you have to choose industrial agriculture  
**0:43:16-0:43:21:**  or a low yielding regenerative agriculture there's very much high yielding regenerative  
**0:43:21-0:43:29:**  agriculture and um um uh that's a would be a very wise place for for money to go in terms  
**0:43:29-0:43:35:**  of those those subsidies and and research and development and outreach money and so  
**0:43:35-0:43:42:**  on but beyond beyond the fact that um perennial crops have to compete with a highly subsidized  
**0:43:42-0:43:47:**  system it still seems at least for the moment with the methods we have it still has a handicap  
**0:43:47-0:43:53:**  in terms of the labor it requires and the fact that it's sometimes harder to mechanize  
**0:43:53-0:44:00:**  and in a place like france or europe or i guess even the us where labor is so expensive at  
**0:44:00-0:44:06:**  the moment that might be a big yeah a big limitation it's a big hurdle and it's interesting  
**0:44:06-0:44:13:**  in the tropics the opposite is true that it's actually more late it's more labor efficient  
**0:44:13-0:44:19:**  to grow perennial staples than to grow annual staples because where labor is done by hand  
**0:44:19-0:44:28:**  or with draft animals um perennials are less work uh but where we have these huge uh combines  
**0:44:28-0:44:37:**  and other pieces of equipment um uh it's much more efficient to grow annual crops than perennial  
**0:44:37-0:44:44:**  crops at present i did a little work on that in the book where i compared um the hours  
**0:44:44-0:44:52:**  per ton of food um from some annual crops and some perennial crops in california and  
**0:44:52-0:45:01:**  all of the annual crops um were more efficient than any of the perennial crops and the most  
**0:45:01-0:45:09:**  efficient annual crop was a hundred times had a hundred times less hours per ton of  
**0:45:09-0:45:14:**  product than the least efficient perennial crop so some of them in the middle were pretty  
**0:45:14-0:45:23:**  close cowpeas and walnuts maybe or almonds were pretty close but overall it's clear that  
**0:45:23-0:45:32:**  with um that there's a need for more efficient uh harvest and mechanization um and yet with  
**0:45:32-0:45:36:**  the perennial grains again when when they're really fully ready and they're not really  
**0:45:36-0:45:43:**  fully ready yet we do have a few early ones out of the gate which is exciting um those  
**0:45:43-0:45:50:**  will um will use all of the equipment we already use so they'll use the regular combine and  
**0:45:50-0:45:57:**  everything else um which makes them um very exciting the drawback is that they don't really  
**0:45:57-0:46:03:**  exist yet in any serious way we do have kernza which has been released which yields about  
**0:46:03-0:46:09:**  as well as quinoa um somewhere around a ton or a ton and a half per hectare so not really  
**0:46:09-0:46:20:**  competitive with um uh weed or or or corn or something but it is um the value is higher  
**0:46:20-0:46:27:**  the value per ton is higher so it can be economically viable for farmers to do that now um and i'm  
**0:46:27-0:46:36:**  sure that the people who bred it um ultimately would like it to yield as well as wheat does  
**0:46:36-0:46:41:**  but we're not uh we're not there yet these things take time plant breeding is slow and  
**0:46:41-0:46:46:**  plant breeding with perennials is slow and if you were to look at them the research budget  
**0:46:46-0:46:54:**  let's say the global research budget for wheat versus kernza it must be you know 10 000 times  
**0:46:54-0:47:03:**  more euros being spent on wheat than on perennial grade so uh so again a reallocation of priorities  
**0:47:03-0:47:08:**  might be desirable there a reallocation of research money could really help to move the  
**0:47:08-0:47:13:**  perennial grain um effort forward and also i think there's some new ways to think about  
**0:47:13-0:47:21:**  perennial crops what i like about the badger set um uh research project that i i write  
**0:47:21-0:47:27:**  about in the book a little bit is they're rethinking tree crops from you know a tree  
**0:47:27-0:47:31:**  where you come out with a tree shaker and shake down the nuts and then you come with  
**0:47:31-0:47:36:**  another machine and make a windrow and another one and pick that up um they're planting the  
**0:47:36-0:47:46:**  trees very close in double rows like like half a meter or a meter apart um uh and then  
**0:47:46-0:47:53:**  they compass them every five to ten years and come with a um it's the kind of mechanical  
**0:47:53-0:47:58:**  harvester we use for blueberries here i think it might be like what you would use for black  
**0:47:58-0:48:06:**  currents that rides over the whole hedgerow and harvest all of the um nuts that way so  
**0:48:06-0:48:12:**  instead of growing hazelnuts let's say as a tree where you shake it and pick them up  
**0:48:12-0:48:16:**  off the ground you grow them as a hedge and you just ride over the whole hedge with one  
**0:48:16-0:48:27:**  machine and harvest all the nuts in one pass which makes for a much um uh many less hours  
**0:48:27-0:48:32:**  per ton of nut that is harvested and we do see that system a little bit being used in  
**0:48:32-0:48:44:**  um some mediterranean olive production um uh in greece i think and also with um seabuckthorn  
**0:48:44-0:48:50:**  in parts of europe so that that sort of approach to a really different way of thinking about  
**0:48:50-0:48:56:**  harvesting tree crops and both olives and seabuckthorn are perennial staple crops they're  
**0:48:56-0:49:02:**  oil crops so um i i think that's another interesting way to go is to think really differently  
**0:49:02-0:49:10:**  about how we grow these plants um and how we would approach harvesting them there's  
**0:49:10-0:49:17:**  also issues around harvesting in polyculture systems which sound like they're not impossible  
**0:49:17-0:49:24:**  to resolve it's just no one's really thought about that so much before so um none of those  
**0:49:24-0:49:29:**  are likely to be resolved right away i think we sort of have to start with growing let's  
**0:49:29-0:49:35:**  say chestnuts or hazelnuts as more specialty products right now and gradually figure out  
**0:49:35-0:49:42:**  how to transition them to occupying more and more of the staple crop market which unfortunately  
**0:49:42-0:49:50:**  means that the price will go down uh as well so um i don't have all of that um figured  
**0:49:50-0:49:56:**  out just yeah yes but listening to you and uh you know taking the example of mechanization  
**0:49:56-0:50:02:**  it seems that it all comes down to political will which kind of says a lot and says nothing  
**0:50:02-0:50:07:**  because you know you can wait it seems like you can wait a long time for for that to actually  
**0:50:07-0:50:14:**  be a force for change but you know we at the moment people are inventing much crazier technologies  
**0:50:14-0:50:19:**  to try and solve climate change with very complex capture carbon capture units etc i  
**0:50:19-0:50:25:**  mean if there was money and a political will to develop and efficiently mechanize perennial  
**0:50:25-0:50:31:**  crops i'm pretty sure that would be within the realm of human uh civility you know i  
**0:50:31-0:50:36:**  mean i mean if you put things back into proportion and i think that applies to a lot of the things  
**0:50:36-0:50:42:**  you've been saying throughout this um you know first uh 50 minutes of interview um you  
**0:50:42-0:50:48:**  know a lot of things are technically feasible now it's about building the economic and social  
**0:50:48-0:50:55:**  structures um you know enabling that on a large scale and uh yeah well i you know i  
**0:50:55-0:51:03:**  i i really want us to move on to kind of the the last uh theme i have uh in in stock which  
**0:51:03-0:51:09:**  is um alley cropping because uh you told me and mentioned that you had been working more  
**0:51:09-0:51:14:**  recently on specifically alley cropping and i'd love to hear a bit more about that research  
**0:51:14-0:51:26:**  sure i um i um am currently uh um under contract with uh an ngo here in the us called interlace  
**0:51:26-0:51:36:**  commons uh so i'm working with their director megan juro um on a manual on alley cropping  
**0:51:36-0:51:42:**  for the united states which we feel will have a lot of relevance anywhere in the cold climates  
**0:51:42-0:51:50:**  of the world in europe and argentina and canada and eastern asia and so on um and i i will  
**0:51:50-0:51:56:**  say that very much uh one of our big influences is certainly the work that's being done in  
**0:51:56-0:52:01:**  france and we've been reading uh reading that work very closely um we're certainly looking  
**0:52:01-0:52:08:**  at what people are doing in the united states and in canada and we're looking at um uh there  
**0:52:08-0:52:13:**  was some really great work done in china in the 1970s and 1980s there's some interesting  
**0:52:13-0:52:19:**  things happening in north korea um but i i think we could all agree that france is sort  
**0:52:19-0:52:24:**  of carrying the banner for alley cropping and mechanized alley cropping in cold climates  
**0:52:24-0:52:32:**  you all are really uh absolutely um uh the lead on that and we're we're very very happy  
**0:52:32-0:52:38:**  to be following in that lead as as best we can um particularly when it comes to some  
**0:52:38-0:52:46:**  of the calculations around um predicting how much shade is going to come at what time and  
**0:52:46-0:52:54:**  how that relates to the spacing and density of trees um uh and one of the things that  
**0:52:54-0:53:01:**  i really like that's come out of the french work is the emphasis on um winter grains winter  
**0:53:01-0:53:10:**  cereals with deciduous trees where you have two different seasons in which these different  
**0:53:10-0:53:14:**  plants are using the sunlight so they're not competing for like because there are different  
**0:53:14-0:53:20:**  seasons which is the same thing we see uh in in this hell region of africa there's a  
**0:53:20-0:53:27:**  practice called um evergreen agriculture where they use this um a tree fiderbia albida it's  
**0:53:27-0:53:35:**  a nitrogen fixing tree it's a sort of like an acacia um and that tree puts on leaves  
**0:53:35-0:53:41:**  in the dry season but drops its leaves for the wet season so you're growing crops under  
**0:53:41-0:53:47:**  trees but the trees have no leaves on them and then in the winter the trees have leaves  
**0:53:47-0:53:51:**  and there's no crops underneath so that's it's very much the same thing that we see  
**0:53:51-0:53:55:**  in france actually it's much more widespread in africa than alley cropping is in france  
**0:53:55-0:54:03:**  but that kind of um looking at the phenology the timing seems to be one of the keys worldwide  
**0:54:03-0:54:09:**  to making polycultures work into making agroforestry work so i really like that and we do have  
**0:54:09-0:54:13:**  some mediterranean climates here in the us parts of the western united states are mediterranean  
**0:54:13-0:54:19:**  quite a bit of our farmland there in the west is mediterranean climate um so that might  
**0:54:19-0:54:24:**  be more directly used the rest of us have to just sort of adopt the concept in some  
**0:54:24-0:54:31:**  way we do have winter crops here as well but um in in the central and eastern part of the  
**0:54:31-0:54:38:**  country but because we have rainfall all through the year um it's not quite as good a way i  
**0:54:38-0:54:46:**  know in the french systems the the winter cereals uh sort of train the trees to grow  
**0:54:46-0:54:51:**  their roots more deeply because of competition for water and here we have rain all year round  
**0:54:51-0:54:58:**  so that's not going to be quite as much of a of a benefit um to us yes uh let's see um  
**0:54:58-0:55:04:**  i could say more are there particular things you're curious about about that uh manual  
**0:55:04-0:55:08:**  well uh i definitely want to go a bit more into some detail but i think i'll be a bit  
**0:55:08-0:55:16:**  uh provoking and and ask if you think that alley cropping um does it really have a key  
**0:55:16-0:55:23:**  role to play in uh temperate climate agriculture uh both on climatic and also on economic realities  
**0:55:23-0:55:29:**  i'll just elaborate a bit on that but you know throughout the talk so many times we  
**0:55:29-0:55:35:**  come back to the fact that agroforestry performs better in the tropics it's also more linked  
**0:55:35-0:55:41:**  to traditional practices you know alley cropping is quite a recent practice here in europe  
**0:55:41-0:55:47:**  and and has come a lot i think from trying to adapt more tropical systems to temperate  
**0:55:47-0:55:52:**  climates so that does you know ask the question whether you think we can still make it work  
**0:55:52-0:55:56:**  or are we trying to go and and build something that's not really adapted  
**0:55:56-0:56:06:**  well that's a great question um i will say that uh in some ways it is a really new system  
**0:56:06-0:56:11:**  and in some ways uh you know if you think about bocage and other kinds of very traditional  
**0:56:11-0:56:19:**  systems in europe they go back to the origins of agriculture there so the um uh some of  
**0:56:19-0:56:25:**  the german fruit tree intercropping systems and some of the more mediterranean fruit and  
**0:56:25-0:56:31:**  nut and and vegetable and grain intercropping systems do go back quite a long way but that  
**0:56:31-0:56:37:**  has sort of mostly been really removed from the landscape for quite some time now uh here  
**0:56:37-0:56:45:**  in the u.s uh in the eastern part where i live um the indigenous people here the practice  
**0:56:45-0:56:53:**  was uh very much to mix trees with corn mulberry trees and walnut trees and persimmon trees  
**0:56:53-0:57:00:**  and all manner of things plums native plums and grapes were all intercropped with annual  
**0:57:00-0:57:05:**  crops here and that's a very cold part of the part of the world much colder than anywhere  
**0:57:05-0:57:15:**  in france where i live um so uh i think it's uh it's not that there was never any here  
**0:57:15-0:57:27:**  but it was never perhaps the dominant force in quite such a way yes um um well i guess  
**0:57:27-0:57:34:**  the question is this how much do we want a world that limits warming to 1.5 degrees uh  
**0:57:34-0:57:40:**  i don't think we i i think um if you could do a practice like alley cropping that sequestered  
**0:57:40-0:57:48:**  three to five times more carbon per hectare than the best annual cropping systems wouldn't  
**0:57:48-0:57:53:**  you want to do that i think that's really how much mitigation do you want and also in  
**0:57:53-0:58:00:**  terms of adaptation alley cropping is looking more and more like a good idea because as  
**0:58:00-0:58:07:**  um first of all for some shade you know but um as rainfall gets more intense and we do  
**0:58:07-0:58:14:**  see rainfall intensity going up in most of the world's cropland uh that makes erosion  
**0:58:14-0:58:20:**  much more powerful water erosion gets much more powerful and the practices that maybe  
**0:58:20-0:58:28:**  have been good enough for erosion control will no longer be sufficient um and rows of  
**0:58:28-0:58:34:**  trees with grass underneath uh on or near the contour of a field are a very very powerful  
**0:58:34-0:58:41:**  erosion control practice um so i think we're going to see more need for it as climate change  
**0:58:41-0:58:47:**  gets worse and yet we also need it to keep climate change from from getting worse so  
**0:58:47-0:58:53:**  i think um with but a bunch of things need to be in place to make it work there do need  
**0:58:53-0:58:59:**  to be markets for those products or there need to be and or there need to be subsidies  
**0:58:59-0:59:06:**  for farmers to plant those trees or financing like low interest loans for them to wait until  
**0:59:06-0:59:11:**  they actually get money from those crops and all of that has to be in place the biggest  
**0:59:11-0:59:19:**  barrier i see in the cold climate parts of the world in the global north let's say uh  
**0:59:19-0:59:28:**  is the use of herbicide it's so widely used um um with gmo crops uh in many parts of the  
**0:59:28-0:59:32:**  world and not so much in the eu i think right because you've been able to hold those off  
**0:59:32-0:59:41:**  a little bit better um that you can't establish trees in those fields because uh in the u.s.  
**0:59:41-0:59:49:**  and canada and argentina they actually spray herbicide from airplanes multiple times a  
**0:59:49-0:59:59:**  year so the buffer uh is uh like 200 to 600 meters if you want to have a row of trees  
**0:59:59-1:00:05:**  that's just not possible so the the spread of that system which does sequester a little  
**1:00:05-1:00:12:**  carbon where you reduce tillage and use cover crops and spray herbicide a lot whether it's  
**1:00:12-1:00:22:**  from airplanes or big sprayers on tractors um basically makes alley cropping impossible  
**1:00:22-1:00:29:**  uh and that's most farms in the u.s. and canada and argentina today and in southern brazil  
**1:00:29-1:00:36:**  the sort of temperate the southern cone they call it in south america um uh and there's  
**1:00:36-1:00:40:**  quite a bit of that in you know temperate india and china as well in certain parts of  
**1:00:40-1:00:46:**  the eu people are certainly spraying that stuff i think so um i see in a way that's  
**1:00:46-1:00:51:**  the biggest barrier to the wide scale adoption of alley cropping is you can't establish trees  
**1:00:51-1:00:56:**  in fields with herbicide with that that much herbicide of those kinds of broad spectrum  
**1:00:56-1:01:03:**  herbicides sprayed at that intensity and frequency so i think that's the um at least outside  
**1:01:03-1:01:10:**  of the eu i think that's the biggest strategic barrier is they have to choose that or this  
**1:01:10-1:01:17:**  you can't do both of those practices um but there might be a window of opportunity because  
**1:01:17-1:01:22:**  i mean some people do use uh herbicides to suppress weeds around trees so it must be  
**1:01:22-1:01:28:**  a question of dosage and maybe some kind of compromise can be found um you know that works  
**1:01:28-1:01:35:**  but um you know just uh i think some interesting elements to this uh alley cropping conversation  
**1:01:35-1:01:42:**  is also the legitimate questions of like do we really need to put trees in the part you  
**1:01:42-1:01:47:**  know in the plot or could we not leave them around and you know i always refer back to  
**1:01:47-1:01:51:**  this conversation and this interview that dimitri did with roan reed um a few months  
**1:01:51-1:01:56:**  back and he had a really interesting perspective because he was actually quite against the  
**1:01:56-1:02:01:**  idea of alley cropping saying you know you back in the eu have a very subsidized agriculture  
**1:02:01-1:02:07:**  uh back in australia farmers need to be much more responsive to the kind of commodity crop  
**1:02:07-1:02:12:**  um you know to the markets and be able to be very flexible in the kind of crops they're  
**1:02:12-1:02:18:**  going to grow and keep their hands very free and of course as you mentioned one thing that's  
**1:02:18-1:02:23:**  clear from books like christian dupras and fabian liaga's book on agroforestry which  
**1:02:23-1:02:28:**  i think you were alluding to earlier on is that it makes very clear that you you can't  
**1:02:28-1:02:36:**  just put any tree with any crop it's actually a very complex game of interactions with some  
**1:02:36-1:02:42:**  some facilitation mechanisms and some of competition and you know it's something that's highly  
**1:02:42-1:02:48:**  technical and that by no means is obvious so i think uh in certain cases it one could  
**1:02:48-1:02:54:**  make the the case of saying well trees are amazing but you know maybe let's uh subdivide  
**1:02:54-1:03:00:**  some plots and maybe let's have some hedges but maybe it's too risky to have uh these  
**1:03:00-1:03:06:**  lines with a defined interline which locks me into these spring um you know spring productions  
**1:03:06-1:03:11:**  because i have to do that before uh the competition of water is too high etc etc but i'm a bit  
**1:03:11-1:03:16:**  spoiling the work here because we should have christian dupran the podcast in not too long  
**1:03:16-1:03:22:**  so you know sorry for this monologue but i think it's an interesting point um well i  
**1:03:22-1:03:27:**  don't think it's the right thing everywhere and that everyone should always do it at all  
**1:03:27-1:03:34:**  and i and i certainly think um we can't blame farmers for needing to stay flexible in the  
**1:03:34-1:03:42:**  face of what the market does um absolutely uh i do think we could make it a more friendly  
**1:03:42-1:03:48:**  environment for them to make those decisions but i think also there's sort of like a set  
**1:03:48-1:03:55:**  of stages of perennializing a crop farm um or us making it more regenerative the first  
**1:03:55-1:04:03:**  might be cover crops um and anything to improve soil organic matter and probably nutrient  
**1:04:03-1:04:10:**  management goes in that first phase as well um then we might look at at the border the  
**1:04:10-1:04:16:**  edges of the fields and getting some hedgerows in or some plantings along water bodies along  
**1:04:16-1:04:23:**  streams and excuse me drainage and things like that so that's a kind of and then maybe  
**1:04:23-1:04:29:**  some strips of perennial grasses in the field as well a long contour for erosion control  
**1:04:29-1:04:36:**  and filtering out uh um excess nutrients and things like that those are all ways to perennialize  
**1:04:36-1:04:42:**  the field that don't um that preserve the flexibility of that farmer to grow what they  
**1:04:42-1:04:48:**  need when they need and those are all very good things and they have modest carbon benefits  
**1:04:48-1:04:55:**  um and i think particularly for for as i said before flat fertile land that's a great way  
**1:04:55-1:05:01:**  to go but on land that is low has a slope or is easy to erode i think those are places  
**1:05:01-1:05:07:**  where strategically we might think more about prioritizing alley cropping um one of the  
**1:05:07-1:05:14:**  pieces of work we did on this book was looking at how far apart rows should be where people  
**1:05:14-1:05:20:**  are farming on slopes which i don't see a lot of in france i mostly see people farming  
**1:05:20-1:05:25:**  on beautiful flat land but in a lot of the world people are farming on slopes um how  
**1:05:25-1:05:34:**  far apart should uh should those um rows of trees be in order to prevent erosion and at  
**1:05:34-1:05:40:**  what point do they need to be so close together for erosion control that you can't really  
**1:05:40-1:05:46:**  alley crop anymore or you should switch to a shrub crop instead of a tree crop in order  
**1:05:46-1:05:55:**  to make that work and the answer really depends on soil types some uh we spent uncounted hours  
**1:05:55-1:06:02:**  doing interviews about this and reading about this with different um soil uh experts um  
**1:06:02-1:06:11:**  it depends on this on the on the soil type a lot the erodibility of a soil type but um  
**1:06:11-1:06:20:**  there are many cases where it's possible to have um a 45 meter spacing between uh rows  
**1:06:20-1:06:28:**  of trees um on a slope and that's certainly plenty of space to grow uh very fine crops  
**1:06:28-1:06:33:**  in between companion crops in between those rows of trees but as the slope gets steeper  
**1:06:33-1:06:38:**  those rows have to get closer together and in more erodible soils they need to be very  
**1:06:38-1:06:50:**  close so it depends on um uh on those things quite a bit um um but we've we've actually  
**1:06:50-1:06:54:**  gotten some answers on that and been able to put some calculations in that people can  
**1:06:54-1:07:02:**  do based on um um some kinds of information that are pretty easy to get about your um  
**1:07:02-1:07:08:**  about the erodibility of your of your soils so um that's exciting that's really exciting  
**1:07:08-1:07:12:**  that's sort of a i feel like a little bit of a new contribution we've been able to make  
**1:07:12-1:07:18:**  for this book is to get to the bottom of those questions and um again i i haven't seen that  
**1:07:18-1:07:23:**  kind of practice coming out of france very much because you do have a lot of flat beautiful  
**1:07:23-1:07:27:**  farmland and it looks like most agro most alley cropping there is happening in relatively  
**1:07:27-1:07:36:**  flat land but um a lot of the farmland in the united states is is pretty steep um five  
**1:07:36-1:07:42:**  percent eight percent twelve percent slopes um and uh those are places where erosion is  
**1:07:42-1:07:49:**  happening and uh and where it will get worse with climate change so um that's uh to me  
**1:07:49-1:07:54:**  is a real kind of priority place for uh for thinking about alley cropping again the the  
**1:07:54-1:08:00:**  last place we maybe need to worry about it is beautiful flat prime land unless you want  
**1:08:00-1:08:06:**  to do it there which is great um um or i look at um some of the work that's happening in  
**1:08:06-1:08:15:**  north korea which is the climate um almost scandinavian really in terms of um uh cold  
**1:08:15-1:08:23:**  um and um their people are farming on very steep very steep hillsides growing corn on  
**1:08:23-1:08:28:**  very steep hillsides with terrible erosion because there's a real food security situation  
**1:08:28-1:08:37:**  um and uh that's a place where um contour rows of shrubs have proven very effective  
**1:08:37-1:08:44:**  uh they especially like aronia which is one of our native shrub crops from here um but  
**1:08:44-1:08:48:**  they're trying all kinds of different things um so that would be you know the most steep  
**1:08:48-1:08:53:**  and most degraded kind of land would be the first priority area to perennialize as well  
**1:08:53-1:09:03:**  as possible um and until we have perennial corn which is going to be a long time 30 or  
**1:09:03-1:09:09:**  40 years if we're lucky um we need the best ways to grow corn where where people want  
**1:09:09-1:09:15:**  corn and they want corn that's what they want so we sort of in a way you know in the world  
**1:09:15-1:09:21:**  of food sovereignty they say um that people have the right to culturally appropriate food  
**1:09:21-1:09:26:**  so i think rather than try to get everyone to eat breadfruit and chestnuts even though  
**1:09:26-1:09:33:**  everyone should eat more breadfruit and chestnuts um you know we try and get them to grow what  
**1:09:33-1:09:38:**  they like as much as possible and then the maybe their processed foods are made out of  
**1:09:38-1:09:45:**  chestnut and breadfruit and and so on right um pasta might be made out of those things  
**1:09:45-1:09:49:**  or more of those things might be mixed in and it's possible to add a lot of these things  
**1:09:49-1:09:59:**  to um to uh to breads and pasta and things like that without interfering with the flavor  
**1:09:59-1:10:06:**  but 100 percent chestnut does not make good bread at all but 10 percent is very nice 20  
**1:10:06-1:10:14:**  percent is very nice um so uh you know i'm not admit i'm not envisioning 100 perennial  
**1:10:14-1:10:20:**  anywhere in the world probably on maybe on an individual farm but not in any individual  
**1:10:20-1:10:25:**  valley or mountainside or anything i think we just want to go as far as we can we want  
**1:10:25-1:10:32:**  to push as far as we can sure and uh because it seems you have quite a overview and you've  
**1:10:32-1:10:38:**  been doing research and interviews um could you give us a few examples of you know the  
**1:10:38-1:10:44:**  main motives for uh farmers turning to agroforestry uh erosion control definitely seems to be  
**1:10:44-1:10:50:**  the one coming back in the examples you're quoting are there any other kind of strong  
**1:10:50-1:11:01:**  motives sure i mean um uh diversification is big just more crops especially for um some  
**1:11:01-1:11:06:**  of the more direct market oriented farms that are maybe already doing vegetables and want  
**1:11:06-1:11:11:**  to be able to add small fruits and tree fruits it's kind of very natural thing for them to  
**1:11:11-1:11:21:**  add um uh in in a lot of cases i'm seeing it uh that people really farmers really care  
**1:11:21-1:11:30:**  about soil health and they can see that perennials have a very powerful uh ability to improve  
**1:11:30-1:11:38:**  soil health so what is that uh how can then they ask the question how can i incorporate  
**1:11:38-1:11:44:**  perennials into my existing operation and i just need to find one that fits into my  
**1:11:44-1:11:51:**  existing markets um so that i think is pretty big and also in some cases we're seeing water  
**1:11:51-1:12:00:**  quality where cities are finding that their their drinking water is contaminated with  
**1:12:00-1:12:09:**  fertilizer um and uh they look all up the watershed to say what can we do to improve  
**1:12:09-1:12:15:**  water quality from farms to reduce runoff and to reduce nutrient leaching from farms  
**1:12:15-1:12:22:**  all the way up to the very end of the tiny stream that our river comes from um and that's  
**1:12:22-1:12:28:**  uh that is definitely um supporting some of these kinds of practices being implemented  
**1:12:28-1:12:34:**  as well so um i think that uh there's a whole range of things but those are the ones that  
**1:12:34-1:12:39:**  i'm mostly mostly seeing i don't interact with as many farmers as some of the other  
**1:12:39-1:12:46:**  people i work with but i hear stories from them anyway and in terms of the limiting factors  
**1:12:46-1:12:52:**  uh do you think today what's kind of holding back um into cropping on what level is it  
**1:12:52-1:12:58:**  is it cultural is it linked to commercializing these additional crops is it even technical  
**1:12:58-1:13:05:**  in terms of the knowledge and developing these innovative ways of farming i i know that some  
**1:13:05-1:13:12:**  of it is just farmers need to go see it on another farm somewhere they need to see what  
**1:13:12-1:13:18:**  it looks like and they need to ask questions of another farmer and to some degree we still  
**1:13:18-1:13:22:**  don't have enough farms for people to be able to do that here in the united states at least  
**1:13:22-1:13:29:**  right i i would love to raise some money to send a bunch of us farmers to montpellier  
**1:13:29-1:13:35:**  to go and see see what this looks like or send them to columbia or send them to china  
**1:13:35-1:13:39:**  to go and see what these things look like um because i think that's really important  
**1:13:39-1:13:48:**  to to see how a farmer does does it and to ask them those questions is so important um  
**1:13:48-1:13:53:**  and i think to some degree there's still some questions about which trees and which crops  
**1:13:53-1:13:58:**  and what spacing and what management system there are some sort of technical research  
**1:13:58-1:14:06:**  kind of questions there to be answered for sure um but i have found here for example  
**1:14:06-1:14:15:**  with our um uh department of of agriculture does provide payment for environmental services  
**1:14:15-1:14:23:**  for alley cropping for example but almost no states have decided to use that option  
**1:14:23-1:14:30:**  and almost no one in that agency actually even knows that that's a practice or how to  
**1:14:30-1:14:39:**  use it or how to implement it so um i think it's still very far away from what people  
**1:14:39-1:14:46:**  think is agriculture in in sort of as a cultural barrier i think you're not supposed to plant  
**1:14:46-1:14:50:**  trees in your fields you're supposed to get rid of all the trees out of your fields and  
**1:14:50-1:14:56:**  i think that's still pretty people think it means that you'll have less that you'll have  
**1:14:56-1:15:03:**  less yields that you'll have less profit um and then there's all the question of learning  
**1:15:03-1:15:10:**  a whole new kind of product how to care for it how do you do pest control on your trees  
**1:15:10-1:15:15:**  how to market your wood or your fruit or your nuts or whatever it is um that's asking a  
**1:15:15-1:15:21:**  lot of a farmer to to do that and i think we're still mostly seeing the farmers who  
**1:15:21-1:15:28:**  are really driven to innovate are the ones who are doing it it's not the it's not the  
**1:15:28-1:15:33:**  people who are only adopting cover crops now after people have been you know 30 years after  
**1:15:33-1:15:37:**  the push for cover crops started it's the people who would have been adopting cover  
**1:15:37-1:15:44:**  crops 30 years ago who are now adopting alley cropping without assistance mostly from their  
**1:15:44-1:15:52:**  governments without markets without consumer interest in their product particularly uh  
**1:15:52-1:15:58:**  and i'm very um very impressed by and i have a lot of respect for those farmers and we  
**1:15:58-1:16:09:**  are seeing uh at least here um in the us and canada a real a very noticeable movement of  
**1:16:09-1:16:14:**  farmers picking up this practice which you would didn't even see 10 years ago so there  
**1:16:14-1:16:19:**  is something happening there is some movement building which really wasn't i didn't see  
**1:16:19-1:16:24:**  10 years ago so that's very exciting and i do think that carbon and soil health are big  
**1:16:24-1:16:33:**  motivators for that um i think there's there's still a a lot to be done because it seems  
**1:16:33-1:16:40:**  that it's a lot to ask from a farmer who's you know working 70 hours a week who's also  
**1:16:40-1:16:46:**  financially stressed to have that extra will to complexify even more his operation you  
**1:16:46-1:16:51:**  know because uh when you talk with farmers if they can already make it work with the  
**1:16:51-1:16:56:**  current um well i'm making a generalization but let's say based on some conversations  
**1:16:56-1:17:01:**  uh i think you know a lot of people would be happy if they can just make it work with  
**1:17:01-1:17:05:**  their current system and maybe optimize that and innovate through that and i think that  
**1:17:05-1:17:11:**  applies to regenerative farmers as well where you know if you're um if you're a broad acre  
**1:17:11-1:17:16:**  uh farmer you might be very interested in testing out a lot of innovative things with  
**1:17:16-1:17:24:**  cover crops if you're a livestock farmer you might just be excited about getting into intensive  
**1:17:24-1:17:29:**  rotational grazing but then adding trees at this moment where there's so much innovation  
**1:17:29-1:17:36:**  to be done in each branch is is really uh yeah you need um yeah it's a lot i i sort  
**1:17:36-1:17:43:**  of think that trees in the field like alley cropping and silvopasture are more likely  
**1:17:43-1:17:48:**  to come in this second wave 10 to 15 years from now not that we don't have very innovative  
**1:17:48-1:17:53:**  farmers doing it and not that we shouldn't be doing everything we can to support that  
**1:17:53-1:17:58:**  but i think for most farmers right now it's still cover crops and trees around the edge  
**1:17:58-1:18:04:**  of the field is probably the right next step for most of those people and once you're doing  
**1:18:04-1:18:10:**  that or once you are doing some innovative grazing and you figure that out maybe trees  
**1:18:10-1:18:17:**  are the next step after that i'm not sure that it's the first step for a conventional  
**1:18:17-1:18:24:**  farmer um it's it's asking a lot it's asking a lot and without payment for environmental  
**1:18:24-1:18:30:**  services or whatever without a sort of supportive environment in the various ways that that  
**1:18:30-1:18:35:**  looks i don't see a lot of people doing that yet i don't see a lot of conventional farmers  
**1:18:35-1:18:43:**  doing that um and they shouldn't it would be unwise for them to do that i think but  
**1:18:43-1:18:49:**  we but when they can see a farm like that near them and talk to that farmer and hear  
**1:18:49-1:18:54:**  what they're doing and see that it's working when they can get actual help from their government  
**1:18:54-1:19:00:**  and university to help them learn how to make this work when they can see that it makes  
**1:19:00-1:19:04:**  good sense for them to do that when they can get a good loan or some other way to help  
**1:19:04-1:19:09:**  them with the financing of it that's when when all those pieces are in place that's  
**1:19:09-1:19:16:**  when i think it could really take off um one one last question on alley cropping although  
**1:19:16-1:19:23:**  we could be going on for a long time um because you have a bit of this overview you know two  
**1:19:23-1:19:29:**  of the two of the main options that people have and that we see for planting perennial  
**1:19:29-1:19:35:**  crops and intercropping systems are either going to nut trees or timber do you have some  
**1:19:35-1:19:40:**  general points of comparison of course bearing in mind that this will depend on you know  
**1:19:40-1:19:45:**  local context and can vary but are there some trends that you were able to to take out and  
**1:19:45-1:19:52:**  on these two options it's interesting reading how much uh how important timber is in european  
**1:19:52-1:19:59:**  alley cropping uh and i think the first wave of alley cropping here in the united states  
**1:19:59-1:20:05:**  was looking a lot at timber as well but almost all the new producers we're talking to here  
**1:20:05-1:20:12:**  uh want fruit and nut trees and not timber trees they don't want to wait 60 years to  
**1:20:12-1:20:19:**  get their investment back um which i certainly understand why someone would be concerned  
**1:20:19-1:20:27:**  about that um the advantage with nuts uh is that they start to bring in money much much  
**1:20:27-1:20:35:**  sooner and they provide it every year or every other year for for many decades which is certainly  
**1:20:35-1:20:44:**  in terms of the cash flow much more desirable than waiting for for timber um the value of  
**1:20:44-1:20:50:**  timber can be extremely high and if you have the kind of patience to be able to wait and  
**1:20:50-1:20:55:**  do that and have the right markets and can you know do what you need to do in order to  
**1:20:55-1:21:03:**  to get a high price for it um it seems like a very very desirable um market and of course  
**1:21:03-1:21:09:**  the carbon benefits are great if that timber is not maybe so much for pulp wood or biomass  
**1:21:09-1:21:14:**  energy but if it's going into buildings or whatever that's a beautiful way to to hold  
**1:21:14-1:21:24:**  that carbon um and there aren't that many cases where trees are good for both nuts and  
**1:21:24-1:21:31:**  timber it's very unfortunate it really seems like walnuts can really be good for both black  
**1:21:31-1:21:39:**  walnuts and european walnuts um but chestnuts at least the chestnuts we can grow here don't  
**1:21:39-1:21:46:**  have a good tree form you know don't have a good straight form um almonds aren't almonds  
**1:21:46-1:21:52:**  would be more like a fruit wood i guess hazelnuts would be no no help in that department either  
**1:21:52-1:21:59:**  maybe some of the turkish types that grow as a tree form you know um that uh what is  
**1:21:59-1:22:06:**  that corallis kalurna the turkish tree hazel um but uh you you mostly you sort of have  
**1:22:06-1:22:13:**  to pecan is not terribly good wood um so you kind of have to choose one or the other mostly  
**1:22:13-1:22:17:**  with some exceptions like the walnuts and and then the fruit woods as well but even  
**1:22:17-1:22:21:**  then you're looking at a different pruning style than the than a fruit tree is normally  
**1:22:21-1:22:27:**  grown with you're looking at a single leader straight trunk with a high pruning um which  
**1:22:27-1:22:36:**  is a different management system than fruit growers are usually used to so um it's uh  
**1:22:36-1:22:44:**  that's a challenge uh for sure we have been looking at the what are the um timber trees  
**1:22:44-1:22:49:**  that provide a return in a shorter period of time you know you could do pulp wood with  
**1:22:49-1:22:57:**  hybrid poplar in a very short period but the value is very low um some people here are  
**1:22:57-1:23:05:**  doing um i think you all say false acacia right for robinia um or robinier maybe you  
**1:23:05-1:23:13:**  say um yeah that is uh people will grow it here on a short rotation for fence posts so  
**1:23:13-1:23:18:**  in a relatively short time you have some money turning around and you get some nitrogen fixation  
**1:23:18-1:23:25:**  in the in the meantime um uh and we have an alder species alnus rubra in the west here  
**1:23:25-1:23:32:**  which is very fast growing um and pretty good quality hardwood um otherwise we're really  
**1:23:32-1:23:41:**  looking at that 50 or 60 years or 100 or 120 years which um uh in the current economic  
**1:23:41-1:23:48:**  situation is hard to get farmers excited about i do think a world in which there's an incentive  
**1:23:48-1:23:53:**  to plant a tree that will grow for 120 years would be a wonderful world but i don't mostly  
**1:23:53-1:24:01:**  see that being um um that workable for most farmers at this point compared to the nuts  
**1:24:01-1:24:09:**  or or or the fruits um i think uh one one big area of uncertainty um in intercropping  
**1:24:09-1:24:15:**  but i mean in any project to shift to perennial crops is the huge uncertainty linked to climate  
**1:24:15-1:24:21:**  change i'll give a very practical example i'm in a region in aardesh i'm on the altitude  
**1:24:21-1:24:26:**  plateaus and i'm going to get into livestock farming but there's a potential here for taking  
**1:24:26-1:24:32:**  over a lot of chestnuts old chestnut plantations and it's a one of the key uh productions of  
**1:24:32-1:24:39:**  our dish is chestnuts the issue is with climate change increasing amounts of droughts and  
**1:24:39-1:24:44:**  the diseases that go with it and i made the calculation thinking it's extremely risky  
**1:24:44-1:24:49:**  for me to get into that business where the old trees aren't necessarily adapted if i'm  
**1:24:49-1:24:55:**  planting new trees in i have to wait 10 to 15 years for a decent production what will  
**1:24:55-1:25:01:**  what will the climate look like in 10-15 years i'm not even that sure um so i guess my question  
**1:25:01-1:25:08:**  is in in this world of uncertainty what place and what strategies for perennial crops you  
**1:25:08-1:25:13:**  want to get the most detailed uh climate projections for your region that you can so we have the  
**1:25:13-1:25:22:**  ipcc provides this nice kind of general global tool which has some regional specificity and  
**1:25:22-1:25:29:**  it does look at things like how many cold nights are you going to lose which is very  
**1:25:29-1:25:38:**  important for certain fruits and nuts and so on the heat days and precipitation and  
**1:25:38-1:25:44:**  the length of dry periods and all these things amount of snowfall that changes terrain um  
**1:25:44-1:25:49:**  it's really important to look if you're thinking about a crop that's going to live 40 or 50  
**1:25:49-1:25:57:**  or 100 or 200 years uh can it live there now and can it live in all the foreseeable futures  
**1:25:57-1:26:05:**  um so i think that sort of makes us look a little more to crops that have a um a broad  
**1:26:05-1:26:12:**  amplitude of climates they're suitable to rather than a very narrow range um and also  
**1:26:12-1:26:17:**  for those of us in the northern hemisphere probably to look to things from farther south  
**1:26:17-1:26:25:**  or uh lower in elevation than where we are now um uh or at least where we're not on the  
**1:26:25-1:26:32:**  extreme southern end of their range you know um if it also extends quite a bit to the south  
**1:26:32-1:26:39:**  or or lower in elevation than you then you're probably okay uh in terms of cold and heat  
**1:26:39-1:26:46:**  but then there's the the precipitation questions and it may be that um uh places that do not  
**1:26:46-1:26:55:**  require irrigation now will require them um looking at projections for uh eastern europe  
**1:26:55-1:27:04:**  for example um in a four degrees of warming world the sahara desert moves up into hungary  
**1:27:04-1:27:10:**  so um that would be a very extreme change to hungarian agriculture very very extreme  
**1:27:10-1:27:16:**  um and actually a lot of the mediterranean region sort of goes sahara in those in those  
**1:27:16-1:27:24:**  scenarios so um thinking about uh uh irrigation if you want to keep growing the same crops  
**1:27:24-1:27:30:**  would be the very least you would want to do um uh in that kind of a scenario and thinking  
**1:27:30-1:27:36:**  about really changing crops all together the question is what can you plant now that will  
**1:27:36-1:27:41:**  still work great maybe you can grow olives in 80 years but you can't grow olives now  
**1:27:41-1:27:46:**  don't plant olives yet but but maybe pomegranates are a good mix right maybe they are suitable  
**1:27:46-1:27:52:**  now and into the future so it's just another layer to add is not only what grows where  
**1:27:52-1:27:58:**  i live but what what grows in these three different possible futures here it makes it  
**1:27:58-1:28:07:**  harder um and certain crops like um mulberries and and uh like our our native black walnut  
**1:28:07-1:28:16:**  here that have a very wide range of of climates that they can handle are may be a wiser investment  
**1:28:16-1:28:23:**  i think um than very delicate things that are very particular about um about uh where  
**1:28:23-1:28:30:**  and how they grow so eric where can people find out about your work uh and every all  
**1:28:30-1:28:36:**  the projects you have been involved in great well i i have a couple of blogs going uh at  
**1:28:36-1:28:45:**  um perennial solutions and paradise lot and uh and uh my carbon farming site but the current  
**1:28:45-1:28:53:**  place is i have a patreon campaign patreon.com slash eric tomesmeyer um where i'm um uh posting  
**1:28:53-1:28:58:**  all kinds of things about what i'm working on and for those who who subscribe there i  
**1:28:58-1:29:04:**  post uh excerpts and things that early versions of things that they can take a look at and  
**1:29:04-1:29:10:**  things like that well thank you very much and uh until next time then yes thank you  
**1:29:10-1:29:17:**  thanks very much thank you for listening and making it till the end as usual all the relevant  
**1:29:17-1:29:22:**  links are uh under the episodes and really feel free to reach out to us through our social  
**1:29:22-1:29:27:**  media or our website to let us know if you have any questions or a guest that you would

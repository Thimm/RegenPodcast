### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 16:56:30)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:49:**  Hi everyone, welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast, we're your hosts Dimitri and Etienne.  
**0:00:49-0:00:53:**  We're starting with a bit of a special episode since we're going to be talking about our  
**0:00:53-0:00:57:**  own experience on Massey farm in Greece.  
**0:00:57-0:01:01:**  This is a way to share our experience with you but also to set the stage for the rest  
**0:01:01-0:01:05:**  of the podcast series since the reason we're doing it is a direct consequence of the many  
**0:01:05-0:01:09:**  questions we ask ourselves while working on the land.  
**0:01:09-0:01:13:**  We decided to structure this episode by setting on the table some of the big questions that  
**0:01:13-0:01:18:**  every agroforestry project faces at some point or another.  
**0:01:18-0:01:23:**  We're going to talk about economic models, land, which trees to choose, scale, complexity,  
**0:01:23-0:01:25:**  machines and animals.  
**0:01:25-0:01:30:**  For each one of them, we first explain how we tackle that question on the farm and share  
**0:01:30-0:01:34:**  some things we learned, some of our successes and mistakes.  
**0:01:34-0:01:38:**  For each topic, we then identify the key points that we find interesting to explore with our  
**0:01:38-0:01:41:**  future guests.  
**0:01:41-0:01:45:**  These are linked to our experience and so by nature they're limited.  
**0:01:45-0:01:49:**  That's why if you think we're missing some important aspects, well please reach out to  
**0:01:49-0:01:53:**  us so that we can make sure we enrich our discussions and interviews.  
**0:01:53-0:01:58:**  So Dimitri, how about you tell us a bit about MazzeFarm?  
**0:01:58-0:02:06:**  MazzeFarm was created in 2017 by my family and I and was greatly inspired by the likes  
**0:02:06-0:02:11:**  of Mark Shepherd, Ernst Gotch and the Regen Ag movement in general.  
**0:02:11-0:02:17:**  We're trying to tackle the challenges of producing food whilst regenerating land.  
**0:02:17-0:02:23:**  The idea is that if we mimic natural processes, accelerating them with our inputs and labor,  
**0:02:23-0:02:29:**  we should be able to regenerate severely degraded land and turn it into productive land.  
**0:02:29-0:02:34:**  So we set out with the objectives to create knowledge, adapt it to the Mediterranean context,  
**0:02:34-0:02:41:**  to test out techniques, to do some R&D and build solutions.  
**0:02:41-0:02:47:**  We went about looking for degraded regions of Greece, a historically degraded country,  
**0:02:47-0:02:52:**  bought 5 hectares of land and started MazzeFarm.  
**0:02:52-0:02:56:**  Our process and path naturally led us to agroforestry.  
**0:02:56-0:03:01:**  Most of Greece actually used to either be oak forest or oak savannah more than 10,000  
**0:03:01-0:03:05:**  years ago before humans significantly changed the landscape.  
**0:03:05-0:03:10:**  And these forests were growing without fertilizer and without irrigation, providing for an abundance  
**0:03:10-0:03:11:**  of wildlife.  
**0:03:11-0:03:17:**  Now I'm not necessarily saying that we can feed the world population in such a hands-off  
**0:03:17-0:03:23:**  way, but there are dynamics in nature that create fertility and conditions for life.  
**0:03:23-0:03:28:**  And the hypothesis we're testing out at Mazze is that if we can farm by harnessing these  
**0:03:28-0:03:35:**  patterns instead of going against them, we can be productive whilst regenerating land.  
**0:03:35-0:03:40:**  To illustrate this a bit further, there's the concept of natural succession.  
**0:03:40-0:03:45:**  This is the process in which a bare piece of disturbed land will naturally in time turn  
**0:03:45-0:03:47:**  into a forest.  
**0:03:47-0:03:52:**  So we're trying to harness these forest dynamics to create a productive system, producing in  
**0:03:52-0:04:01:**  a way that requires less inputs, is ecological and can sustain itself into the future.  
**0:04:01-0:04:04:**  So we're going to start by talking about finances.  
**0:04:04-0:04:08:**  Any project needs to face the first question of what economic model?  
**0:04:08-0:04:14:**  Well, as Dimitri just explained, MazzeFarm has a strong R&D focus, which means that it  
**0:04:14-0:04:17:**  has a kind of hybrid business model.  
**0:04:17-0:04:21:**  Because of the main objective is to generate knowledge, this means that we have higher  
**0:04:21-0:04:26:**  costs linked to testing different things out, as well as high risk, since by definition  
**0:04:26-0:04:31:**  you're doing something innovative with no guarantees of success.  
**0:04:31-0:04:36:**  In order to be able to keep our focus on experimenting and testing out tree systems, we opted for  
**0:04:36-0:04:42:**  financing the initial years with philanthropic investment and crowdfunding, while simultaneously  
**0:04:42-0:04:47:**  ramping up our production, transformation of products and sales to learn and adapt to  
**0:04:47-0:04:49:**  the market.  
**0:04:49-0:04:54:**  Once we reach full production and we are satisfied with our tree systems, our crops will become  
**0:04:54-0:04:57:**  the main income of the farm.  
**0:04:57-0:05:02:**  Because of the size of our land and the difficulties of mechanizing production, we have focused  
**0:05:02-0:05:08:**  on developing high quality products with high added value targeted for niche markets.  
**0:05:08-0:05:12:**  We're now focusing on testing out cash flow enterprises such as Berries to understand  
**0:05:12-0:05:16:**  what are the best associations with our tree systems.  
**0:05:16-0:05:21:**  We are quite isolated from our market since the local demand for high quality organic-ish  
**0:05:21-0:05:23:**  products is quite low.  
**0:05:23-0:05:28:**  That's because the purchasing power of locals is limited while many people have gardens  
**0:05:28-0:05:31:**  where they produce their own fruit and vegetables.  
**0:05:31-0:05:36:**  This focused our strategy on traditional, high quality crops that could be dried and  
**0:05:36-0:05:40:**  stored to facilitate distribution outside the island.  
**0:05:40-0:05:45:**  Drying offers a double advantage as it increases storability, therefore reducing waste, but  
**0:05:45-0:05:48:**  also because it adds value to the product.  
**0:05:48-0:05:52:**  The transformation of products is key to our commercial strategy.  
**0:05:52-0:05:56:**  To give you a few examples, we're focusing on making dried figs, but also considering  
**0:05:56-0:06:00:**  dried berries and dried pomegranates.  
**0:06:00-0:06:04:**  We decided that we didn't want to wait for our first harvest to build a customer base  
**0:06:04-0:06:06:**  and test out the market.  
**0:06:06-0:06:11:**  So we partnered up with an organic neighbor who produces dried figs to help them transform  
**0:06:11-0:06:16:**  their production and distribute it under a sister brand, Mazzy Spoon.  
**0:06:16-0:06:21:**  They are an aging couple who are delighted to get some extra hands helping out, while  
**0:06:21-0:06:26:**  we gain some experience, a customer base, and a first income.  
**0:06:26-0:06:30:**  This isn't replicable everywhere, but for us it worked really well to start selling  
**0:06:30-0:06:36:**  a transformed product and then integrate our production progressively from there.  
**0:06:36-0:06:41:**  What became clear to us is that economic models solely based on production remain challenging  
**0:06:41-0:06:43:**  for really degraded land.  
**0:06:43-0:06:47:**  The good news though is that there's a lot of public interest in planting trees and a  
**0:06:47-0:06:49:**  lot of possibilities for funding.  
**0:06:49-0:06:54:**  These can help spread the cost of implementing agroforestry between the farmer, the consumer,  
**0:06:54-0:06:58:**  companies and public administration.  
**0:06:58-0:07:03:**  One of the problems with tree crops in general is creating short term cash flow.  
**0:07:03-0:07:07:**  Of course, if your main crop is not trees and you're just integrating them to another  
**0:07:07-0:07:11:**  enterprise the situation will be different.  
**0:07:11-0:07:16:**  There are of course different ways to cash flow the first years into harvest with complementary  
**0:07:16-0:07:21:**  enterprises that produce the first year such as chickens or vegetables.  
**0:07:21-0:07:25:**  But that's not necessarily easy to implement when your main focus is a relatively large  
**0:07:25-0:07:27:**  scale tree crop system.  
**0:07:27-0:07:32:**  Many things come in the way such as lack of time, experience and knowledge of having to  
**0:07:32-0:07:35:**  manage everything at the same time.  
**0:07:35-0:07:39:**  Really getting to the bottom of successful agroforestry business models will be one of  
**0:07:39-0:07:43:**  the most important and exciting topics we'll be tackling in the podcast.  
**0:07:43-0:07:48:**  How to successfully integrate different enterprises in a way that is coherent both commercially,  
**0:07:48-0:07:50:**  practically and ecologically.  
**0:07:50-0:07:54:**  How does agroforestry integrate with a farmer's current market and infrastructure?  
**0:07:54-0:07:57:**  Or how does one create a new market?  
**0:07:57-0:08:02:**  Another important element is to understand what funding possibilities are out there.  
**0:08:02-0:08:06:**  I know that in France for example you can get two thirds of the cost of planting trees  
**0:08:06-0:08:08:**  covered.  
**0:08:08-0:08:13:**  So we're looking forward to identifying the innovative financing schemes out there.  
**0:08:13-0:08:16:**  So how did we end up with this land?  
**0:08:16-0:08:21:**  The type of land we chose was defined by the vision and R&D objectives of the farm described  
**0:08:21-0:08:22:**  earlier.  
**0:08:22-0:08:28:**  We weren't looking for the ideal land and definitely didn't end up with it either.  
**0:08:28-0:08:33:**  The idea was that if it works here in Stira it can work anywhere.  
**0:08:33-0:08:38:**  We chose a land that could test out our model for Greece, which means small acreage, so  
**0:08:38-0:08:44:**  the average farm in Greece is 4 hectares, limited mechanization, hilly, rocky.  
**0:08:44-0:08:51:**  We have an average slope of around 50%, 15%, which means it's prone to erosion, a big problem  
**0:08:51-0:08:56:**  in hilly Greece, and where perennial crops are the most adapted.  
**0:08:56-0:09:01:**  We have low fertility due to overgrazing and historic agricultural use, it was actually  
**0:09:01-0:09:04:**  farmed by a monastery in the past for many years.  
**0:09:04-0:09:08:**  And we also have shallow soil in most places.  
**0:09:08-0:09:14:**  The land is on top of a hill with a lot of wind as well, so the odds are definitely against  
**0:09:14-0:09:15:**  us.  
**0:09:15-0:09:19:**  We have water problems, fertility problems, and wind problems.  
**0:09:19-0:09:23:**  And I believe that our lack of experience made us take a land that may be a bit too  
**0:09:23-0:09:28:**  challenging and only now we're really seeing and feeling that.  
**0:09:28-0:09:33:**  But linking it back to agroforestry, it's interesting that the more difficult the land  
**0:09:33-0:09:38:**  is, the more agroforestry has to offer in agronomical advantages, but also the more  
**0:09:38-0:09:41:**  costly it is to put into place.  
**0:09:41-0:09:43:**  So what's the right balance?  
**0:09:43-0:09:48:**  Marginal land can be cheaper and so offer economic opportunities, but can also be too  
**0:09:48-0:09:54:**  marginal and incur serious costs and low production to maintain a business.  
**0:09:54-0:09:58:**  It also makes you ask the question of what is the best adapted agroforestry practice  
**0:09:58-0:10:00:**  for what land?  
**0:10:00-0:10:04:**  Would the most adapted system for us be silver pasture with wild wood producing trees or  
**0:10:04-0:10:08:**  the mixed fruit orchard system that we chose?  
**0:10:08-0:10:12:**  The land issue is foundational to start any farm enterprise and we'll be asking ourselves  
**0:10:12-0:10:18:**  many questions like what are basic requirements for productive agroforestry systems?  
**0:10:18-0:10:22:**  What innovative ways are there to access land when one doesn't necessarily have the capital  
**0:10:22-0:10:23:**  to buy it?  
**0:10:23-0:10:29:**  Is it possible to rent land with these types of systems?  
**0:10:29-0:10:33:**  So logically after finding land, the next question is what do you put on it?  
**0:10:33-0:10:35:**  Which trees?  
**0:10:35-0:10:42:**  The main crops that we have planted are pomegranates, figs, pistachios, almonds, and prickly pears.  
**0:10:42-0:10:47:**  We selected these crops after careful observation of the surrounding vegetation.  
**0:10:47-0:10:52:**  We knew we had difficult land so we were looking for trees that are doing well without irrigation,  
**0:10:52-0:10:54:**  inputs or management.  
**0:10:54-0:10:59:**  In the surrounding mountains you can find fig trees growing on their own, wild pistachio  
**0:10:59-0:11:01:**  trees and wild almonds.  
**0:11:01-0:11:06:**  Prickly pears grow without human care and although pomegranates are rarely growing wild,  
**0:11:06-0:11:10:**  you often see abandoned trees still producing.  
**0:11:10-0:11:14:**  Alongside our productive trees we planted many other trees, either as support species  
**0:11:14-0:11:16:**  or as windbreaks.  
**0:11:16-0:11:19:**  We planted two types of trees.  
**0:11:19-0:11:24:**  Some were selected to kickstart things because they are both hardy and fast-growing.  
**0:11:24-0:11:29:**  This led us to plant many eucalyptuses and acacia selenia, which produce much more biomass  
**0:11:29-0:11:31:**  than local trees.  
**0:11:31-0:11:35:**  These trees allow us to have an impact on the land quickly.  
**0:11:35-0:11:39:**  We also invested a lot of time and energy in planting diverse windbreaks and hedges  
**0:11:39-0:11:44:**  to host biodiversity and serve as ecological corridors on the farm.  
**0:11:44-0:11:49:**  These are often slower growing local trees for example carob, cypress and oaks.  
**0:11:49-0:11:53:**  We even planted oaks in our tree lines to see if in the long run they can become support  
**0:11:53-0:11:55:**  species for our productive trees.  
**0:11:55-0:12:00:**  We're excited to see how they evolve and their impact in the next years.  
**0:12:00-0:12:04:**  Although we knew the importance of genetics and varieties, we were greatly limited by  
**0:12:04-0:12:08:**  what was available in Greece and our own knowledge.  
**0:12:08-0:12:12:**  Progressively we've been testing different nurseries out and have ordered from Italy  
**0:12:12-0:12:14:**  last winter.  
**0:12:14-0:12:19:**  Finding the right partners to work with that can provide the quality of plants you need  
**0:12:19-0:12:24:**  takes time, and it was clearly detrimental that we did not have that network when we  
**0:12:24-0:12:26:**  started.  
**0:12:26-0:12:30:**  Because of these difficulties, we started some nursery work as well, but we quickly  
**0:12:30-0:12:34:**  realized that it's highly technical work and that working with genetics was beyond our  
**0:12:34-0:12:36:**  capabilities at the time.  
**0:12:36-0:12:41:**  I really believe that, unless you're already an expert, identifying the people who have  
**0:12:41-0:12:46:**  that knowledge and building strong partnerships is the safest route.  
**0:12:46-0:12:50:**  Working with genetics to adapt to climate change and pests really seems like something  
**0:12:50-0:12:54:**  crucial, but it's one of our weaknesses because we lack that expertise.  
**0:12:54-0:12:57:**  And I'm really looking forward to getting the right people on the podcast so that we  
**0:12:57-0:13:02:**  can learn to fully harness that potential.  
**0:13:02-0:13:05:**  Understanding the potential of different types of trees and how they can be used in different  
**0:13:05-0:13:08:**  contexts is crucial for agroforestry.  
**0:13:08-0:13:10:**  Should we use native species only?  
**0:13:10-0:13:12:**  Should we use invasive species as well?  
**0:13:12-0:13:18:**  What combinations of trees work well, and which ones are adapted to each type of land?  
**0:13:18-0:13:20:**  What varieties should we privilege?  
**0:13:20-0:13:23:**  What are the trade-offs between heirloom or modern varieties?  
**0:13:23-0:13:28:**  I mean, the list is endless, and there's so much knowledge out there we can tap into together.  
**0:13:28-0:13:33:**  At what scale can agroforestry work?  
**0:13:33-0:13:37:**  As I mentioned earlier, we have a 5 hectare land.  
**0:13:37-0:13:41:**  We're actually looking for something bigger, but we didn't find it easily for a reasonable  
**0:13:41-0:13:42:**  price.  
**0:13:42-0:13:47:**  And at the end of the day, it's probably a good thing we didn't find it so early.  
**0:13:47-0:13:51:**  Although it came a bit late, we did finally do a proper business plan, once we had the  
**0:13:51-0:13:56:**  experience to make a decent one that was representative of reality.  
**0:13:56-0:14:01:**  We found that when the land becomes productive, if we manage to control investments and with  
**0:14:01-0:14:06:**  a well-planned commercial strategy, we can sustain the business and even be profitable  
**0:14:06-0:14:08:**  on 5 hectares.  
**0:14:08-0:14:15:**  And that is with 400 fig trees, 250 pistachios, 400 pomegranates, and 250 almonds.  
**0:14:15-0:14:20:**  We decided to plant out the whole land quickly, in the first two planting seasons.  
**0:14:20-0:14:25:**  One reason is that we wanted to test things at a certain scale in order to get a better  
**0:14:25-0:14:28:**  understanding of the systems we implemented.  
**0:14:28-0:14:31:**  The other is that we were tempted to get going quickly because we were aware of how much  
**0:14:31-0:14:37:**  time the trees take to grow, and we didn't want to lose that time.  
**0:14:37-0:14:42:**  Taking a step back, it's really exciting how agroforestry is a great toolkit at whatever  
**0:14:42-0:14:43:**  the scale.  
**0:14:43-0:14:47:**  We'll really be exploring this diversity in the podcast, looking at simple large-scale  
**0:14:47-0:14:54:**  systems or intensively managed smaller scale ones, and probably everything in between.  
**0:14:54-0:14:58:**  There's three important considerations when looking at scale.  
**0:14:58-0:15:01:**  What's the type of agroforestry system adapted to one situation?  
**0:15:01-0:15:04:**  What's the ultimate size that makes economic sense?  
**0:15:04-0:15:06:**  And how quickly to reach that size?  
**0:15:06-0:15:08:**  So let's break them down a bit.  
**0:15:08-0:15:13:**  For the type of agroforestry system, we have to ask ourselves, how can perennial systems  
**0:15:13-0:15:17:**  merge with and benefit current systems?  
**0:15:17-0:15:20:**  They have to adapt to the land, market, and crops present.  
**0:15:20-0:15:25:**  If properly selected, they have the potential to enhance the value of the land by harnessing  
**0:15:25-0:15:31:**  its assets, as well as reducing the effects of some of the major drawbacks present.  
**0:15:31-0:15:36:**  On Massey Farm, for example, we're on an exposed hill, which means lots of wind and lots of  
**0:15:36-0:15:37:**  sun.  
**0:15:37-0:15:43:**  So we planted many functional windbreaks to solve that problem in the future, and we were  
**0:15:43-0:15:49:**  also able to plant very densely, taking advantage of the sun.  
**0:15:49-0:15:54:**  The next is, what's the appropriate size for the type of agroforestry being implemented?  
**0:15:54-0:15:56:**  What does the business plan say?  
**0:15:56-0:16:01:**  Can we build very productive small-scale plots where high management, high production, combined  
**0:16:01-0:16:04:**  with limited investment create profit?  
**0:16:04-0:16:09:**  Carbon credits and other ecosystem service funding may also be a consideration here.  
**0:16:09-0:16:12:**  This would help with scaling the operation, for example.  
**0:16:12-0:16:17:**  But the size ultimately depends on the farmer's resources and capabilities.  
**0:16:17-0:16:23:**  Finally, it seems that how quickly we reach that size will also ultimately depend on the  
**0:16:23-0:16:26:**  resources and capabilities of the farmer.  
**0:16:26-0:16:31:**  On the farm, for example, we implemented quickly with limited experience and limited local  
**0:16:31-0:16:36:**  knowledge, which meant that we were quite inefficient and incurred some unnecessary  
**0:16:36-0:16:38:**  costs.  
**0:16:38-0:16:43:**  How complex to go is one of the questions we are constantly discussing with Dimitri  
**0:16:43-0:16:46:**  on our numerous agroforestry rounds.  
**0:16:46-0:16:51:**  Imitating natural patterns pushes us towards complexity, diversity, and towards integrating  
**0:16:51-0:16:55:**  different productive elements as much as we can.  
**0:16:55-0:17:00:**  As Dimitri explained at the beginning, replicating these natural patterns is a strategy to achieve  
**0:17:00-0:17:03:**  general health of the system and of the soil.  
**0:17:03-0:17:06:**  In Massey, we pushed this logic quite far in the initial design.  
**0:17:06-0:17:11:**  First, we planted a great diversity of crops, as mentioned earlier.  
**0:17:11-0:17:16:**  Then, instead of separating the land and specialized sections, we integrated the different crops  
**0:17:16-0:17:17:**  together.  
**0:17:17-0:17:23:**  The idea here is to stratify, or stack, crops to make the most efficient use of space.  
**0:17:23-0:17:28:**  To give you an example, lines of pomegranates are intercropped as a shade tolerant lower  
**0:17:28-0:17:34:**  layer, with lines of figs and pistachio trees which sit slightly above.  
**0:17:34-0:17:37:**  Another layer of complexity is that we are trying to harness natural succession to repair  
**0:17:37-0:17:40:**  the soil and prepare it for production.  
**0:17:40-0:17:45:**  To do so, we include within the tree lines what we call support species.  
**0:17:45-0:17:49:**  These pioneer trees, or shrubs, are included to support our main crop through providing  
**0:17:49-0:17:55:**  shelter and biomass while decompacting the soil and releasing root exudates to promote  
**0:17:55-0:17:57:**  soil biology.  
**0:17:57-0:18:02:**  These plants are regularly pruned to produce biomass that will be used as an input.  
**0:18:02-0:18:07:**  Another example of that is prickly pears, which are included within certain lines.  
**0:18:07-0:18:12:**  Again, the idea here is to have these hardy, pioneer plants prepare the conditions for  
**0:18:12-0:18:16:**  our fruit trees while also producing a crop.  
**0:18:16-0:18:21:**  While all this makes a lot of ecological sense and offers some clear benefits, it does come  
**0:18:21-0:18:26:**  at a certain cost and with some difficulties.  
**0:18:26-0:18:31:**  One consequence of this diversity is the amount of trees to plant between the windbreaks,  
**0:18:31-0:18:33:**  hedges and support species.  
**0:18:33-0:18:39:**  We literally added thousands of trees to our main tree crops, which has a significant cost.  
**0:18:39-0:18:45:**  The general trend is that the more complex the system is, the more time it takes to manage.  
**0:18:45-0:18:49:**  For example, the support species are an interesting tool, but you have to add the time of planting  
**0:18:49-0:18:53:**  them and pruning them, which again adds costs.  
**0:18:53-0:18:59:**  As you complexify, you tend to make things harder to manage since it's harder to standardize.  
**0:18:59-0:19:03:**  Each time you want to prune or harvest a specific crop, well, you have to walk almost the whole  
**0:19:03-0:19:05:**  land.  
**0:19:05-0:19:09:**  Another consequence of complexity is that it makes it harder to give instructions and  
**0:19:09-0:19:13:**  people help efficiently because you have to spend so much time training them and explaining  
**0:19:13-0:19:16:**  the system to them.  
**0:19:16-0:19:21:**  Because complex systems often require so much specific knowledge, and because they are so  
**0:19:21-0:19:24:**  innovative, they are also risky in the short term.  
**0:19:24-0:19:29:**  They require knowledge for each type of crop and the interaction with the soil and the  
**0:19:29-0:19:32:**  climate and the different varieties.  
**0:19:32-0:19:37:**  This is why, if R&D is not an objective in itself, and you do not have a clear budget  
**0:19:37-0:19:43:**  for it, it is safer to start with simpler systems that are complexified over time.  
**0:19:43-0:19:48:**  This allows you to grow alongside your project and mitigate some of the risk that goes with  
**0:19:48-0:19:49:**  complexifying.  
**0:19:49-0:19:54:**  We are constantly trying to balance the benefits this diversity and complexity provides to  
**0:19:54-0:19:56:**  the higher costs that come with it.  
**0:19:56-0:20:01:**  Since we are always so constrained by time and money, it's about how much can we simplify  
**0:20:01-0:20:07:**  these systems without compromising the ecological functions we are seeking?  
**0:20:07-0:20:12:**  Many concepts out there, stratification, natural succession, etc., are only theories until  
**0:20:12-0:20:17:**  you find how to put them to work in practice.  
**0:20:17-0:20:21:**  Understanding better their role is necessary to understand to what extent they are worth  
**0:20:21-0:20:23:**  the extra work.  
**0:20:23-0:20:27:**  This is what we are attempting at Massey Farm, but many other projects can contribute their  
**0:20:27-0:20:29:**  experience to the conversation.  
**0:20:29-0:20:33:**  We'll get to talk to a great diversity of projects, some with simpler systems, some  
**0:20:33-0:20:39:**  with more complex ones, and try to get a sense of how that is working for them.  
**0:20:39-0:20:44:**  There will be no right or wrong, but rather it's about identifying the parameters to choose  
**0:20:44-0:20:49:**  the right balance between complexity and practicality.  
**0:20:49-0:20:52:**  How are we fixing the soil and ensuring fertility?  
**0:20:52-0:20:55:**  These are big topics on all farms.  
**0:20:55-0:20:59:**  I'll provide a brief summary of what we did on the farm as we tried out a lot of different  
**0:20:59-0:21:00:**  things.  
**0:21:00-0:21:07:**  We prepared most of our tree lines by ripping to as deep as 80 cm whenever possible, breaking  
**0:21:07-0:21:09:**  the shell bedrock.  
**0:21:09-0:21:14:**  We then applied chicken manure on the tree lines, tilled it in and planted into that.  
**0:21:14-0:21:19:**  This past year we started balancing and remineralizing our soil based on help from consultants that  
**0:21:19-0:21:21:**  work with the approach of William Albrecht.  
**0:21:21-0:21:26:**  And we've been applying a thin layer of manure on the soil as well in the most degraded areas.  
**0:21:26-0:21:31:**  All fruit trees were planted with composts, we tried different kinds, some of them bought  
**0:21:31-0:21:35:**  and some of them we made, and the trees were all inoculated with mycorrhiza.  
**0:21:35-0:21:41:**  At the beginning we mulched with straw and everything flew away with the wind, so we  
**0:21:41-0:21:45:**  bought a chipper and started making wood chips ourselves from local olive farms that would  
**0:21:45-0:21:48:**  otherwise burn the branches.  
**0:21:48-0:21:52:**  What's also important to mention is that we've been sowing a mix of more than 20 cover crops  
**0:21:52-0:21:59:**  in the pasture and we have irrigation pipes for all our tree lines.  
**0:21:59-0:22:04:**  We weren't actually as happy as we would have liked with our tree growth.  
**0:22:04-0:22:09:**  The areas that were already fertile grew very well, but the areas that were degraded struggled  
**0:22:09-0:22:11:**  a lot more.  
**0:22:11-0:22:15:**  What we realized these past three years is just how technical managing inputs properly  
**0:22:15-0:22:16:**  is.  
**0:22:16-0:22:20:**  As we all know, getting a tree to produce a few years earlier thanks to good fertilization  
**0:22:20-0:22:25:**  and soil prep, can make a huge difference for the cash flow.  
**0:22:25-0:22:31:**  There are so many techniques, products, philosophies out there and we really want to get into and  
**0:22:31-0:22:34:**  find out which ones work.  
**0:22:34-0:22:38:**  We want to find out what knowledge a farmer needs to get started efficiently and where  
**0:22:38-0:22:43:**  does he or she get it.  
**0:22:43-0:22:46:**  Inputs can also have a huge energetic and financial cost.  
**0:22:46-0:22:51:**  If you just take the woodchips as an example, they had a clear effect on soil moisture,  
**0:22:51-0:22:55:**  weed suppression and promoting soil life, but they represented a huge labor cost to  
**0:22:55-0:22:57:**  produce and apply.  
**0:22:57-0:22:59:**  So how effective were they really?  
**0:22:59-0:23:04:**  For some it may be easy to source, even free, and to apply with appropriate machines.  
**0:23:04-0:23:06:**  For others like us, not so much.  
**0:23:06-0:23:12:**  But in general we can safely say that the inputs are expensive on many levels.  
**0:23:12-0:23:16:**  As we mentioned earlier, the support species, or wild trees in between the fruit trees,  
**0:23:16-0:23:20:**  are meant to be replacing inputs in the median turn.  
**0:23:20-0:23:25:**  Their prunings will provide fertility, carbon, and they will feed the soil life and do much  
**0:23:25-0:23:26:**  more.  
**0:23:26-0:23:30:**  The pruning however does represent a high labor cost, but we're testing it out and  
**0:23:30-0:23:35:**  collecting time data to find out if it's worth it compared to importing all that biomass  
**0:23:35-0:23:37:**  from outside the farm.  
**0:23:37-0:23:43:**  We're also trying to work with the grasses as a quick decomposing, fast-acting mulch,  
**0:23:43-0:23:47:**  and on-site composting on the tree lines.  
**0:23:47-0:23:52:**  But we're having some difficulties with machines to do that efficiently on the farm.  
**0:23:52-0:23:57:**  To summarize, we need to find out the most effective ways to create good physical, chemical,  
**0:23:57-0:24:01:**  and biological conditions in the soil as fast as possible.  
**0:24:01-0:24:05:**  How many inputs need to be invested in the soil to breach the threshold that will give  
**0:24:05-0:24:10:**  the trees a great start whilst limiting these expensive costs?  
**0:24:10-0:24:14:**  How do you make sure trees are not dependent on our inputs and activate their own fertility  
**0:24:14-0:24:15:**  mechanisms?  
**0:24:15-0:24:23:**  It's just such a huge, complex, and technical topic, and fascinating really.  
**0:24:23-0:24:26:**  So what machines to use then once you have that system?  
**0:24:26-0:24:30:**  Well, machines are not our strong point, so we'll keep this section brief.  
**0:24:30-0:24:37:**  We have quite specific constraints with steep land, rocky terrain, typical of Greece.  
**0:24:37-0:24:42:**  Because of the slope and a dense tree system, it's quite difficult to mechanize.  
**0:24:42-0:24:47:**  We tested out many different machines to understand what is best adapted to our farm.  
**0:24:47-0:24:51:**  Our objective is to have few machines, but some that are versatile and that we can use  
**0:24:51-0:24:53:**  to do many different things.  
**0:24:53-0:24:57:**  For managing the interlines, we have been testing various attachments on the two-wheel  
**0:24:57-0:25:01:**  tractor to avoid putting heavy machinery on the land.  
**0:25:01-0:25:05:**  What's become clear for us is the necessity of finding a balance between using machines  
**0:25:05-0:25:10:**  to increase efficiency, but without letting them become money drains because of maintenance  
**0:25:10-0:25:12:**  and depreciation.  
**0:25:12-0:25:17:**  The good news for both of us, and for our listeners, is that so many farmers are coming  
**0:25:17-0:25:21:**  up with smart innovations and appropriate use of machines.  
**0:25:21-0:25:25:**  Machinery will be a cornerstone of upscaling successfully agroforestry systems and reducing  
**0:25:25-0:25:27:**  management time.  
**0:25:27-0:25:32:**  On the other hand, we also need to reinvent the way we use machines in light of our dependence  
**0:25:32-0:25:35:**  on fossil fuels and the cost of machinery itself.  
**0:25:35-0:25:39:**  As we progress, we'll get to understand better what machines are farmers using to manage  
**0:25:39-0:25:44:**  their systems and what tools are appropriate for each scale.  
**0:25:44-0:25:47:**  So how do we integrate animals?  
**0:25:47-0:25:52:**  We've been aware of the ecological and economic benefits of including animals in our farm  
**0:25:52-0:25:57:**  systems, but on Massey Farm, we've hesitated to integrate them yet.  
**0:25:57-0:26:01:**  This is because it represents one more thing to know how to manage and care for.  
**0:26:01-0:26:07:**  We started already with little experience and a lot on our plate, so we didn't really  
**0:26:07-0:26:11:**  feel capable of managing an extra complex element.  
**0:26:11-0:26:14:**  The other reason is that we didn't want to risk damage to the young trees.  
**0:26:14-0:26:18:**  Like everything, it requires a lot of knowledge to get right.  
**0:26:18-0:26:24:**  We do, however, regularly discuss this topic and we want to develop it as much as possible.  
**0:26:24-0:26:29:**  Obviously, silvopasture is a major system integrating trees and animals with many scientifically  
**0:26:29-0:26:32:**  proven advantages and established models.  
**0:26:32-0:26:37:**  Taking it a bit further, we also want to find out how we can integrate animals in other  
**0:26:37-0:26:42:**  systems such as orchards, vineyards, and even arable land.  
**0:26:42-0:26:46:**  There are a lot of technical questions to get into, like what combinations of trees  
**0:26:46-0:26:51:**  and animals, what specific breeds are best suited for which type of agroforestry systems,  
**0:26:51-0:26:55:**  how to maximize the symbiosis between these elements, or how to protect the young trees  
**0:26:55-0:26:56:**  efficiently.  
**0:26:56-0:27:01:**  These are all questions that remain unanswered on the farm, but we know of lots of very interesting  
**0:27:01-0:27:04:**  projects happening around this topic.  
**0:27:04-0:27:10:**  Well, that's us for today then, and we have only focused on the points where we thought  
**0:27:10-0:27:15:**  we could contribute the most interesting content linked to our experience, but we will be exploring  
**0:27:15-0:27:21:**  many other topics on the podcast such as infrastructure, forest management, specific agronomic techniques,  
**0:27:21-0:27:22:**  and much more.  
**0:27:22-0:27:27:**  We also skimmed over the surface a lot of things we talked about on MAZZIE, and so if  
**0:27:27-0:27:32:**  you have specific questions about MAZZIE Farm because it's relevant to your own experience,  
**0:27:32-0:27:36:**  well, don't hesitate to reach us out and we'll answer your questions and we might even do  
**0:27:36-0:27:41:**  a more specific Q&A episode later in the series.  
**0:27:41-0:27:45:**  So please share with us any specific topics or questions that you would like us to see  
**0:27:45-0:27:49:**  to cover with our future guests, and don't hesitate to connect with us on social media  
**0:27:49-0:27:51:**  and our website.  
**0:27:51-0:27:55:**  We hope you are as excited as we are about this podcast and that you will join us as  
**0:27:55-0:27:57:**  we continue learning about agroforestry.  
**0:27:57-0:28:12:**  See you soon.

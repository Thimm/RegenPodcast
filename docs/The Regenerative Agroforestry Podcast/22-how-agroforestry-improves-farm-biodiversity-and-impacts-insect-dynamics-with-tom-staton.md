### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sun, 13 Jun 2021 17:26:02)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:30:**  a promising technique called agroforestry.  
**0:00:30-0:00:35:**  In order to find out how it can help us with these challenges, we'll be interviewing farmers,  
**0:00:35-0:00:40:**  scientists, and other experts to share with you their experiences, practical advice, and  
**0:00:40-0:00:44:**  scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:48:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:53:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we had a chat with Tom Statton, PhD researcher at Reading  
**0:00:53-0:00:57:**  University talking about insects and agroforestry.  
**0:00:57-0:01:01:**  Often in agroforestry we talk about, or in tree planting, we talk about the ecological  
**0:01:01-0:01:08:**  benefits and we wanted to find out more about how that works, how beneficial they really  
**0:01:08-0:01:15:**  are and is everything that is being said about agroforestry, is it showing up in the field  
**0:01:15-0:01:16:**  as well?  
**0:01:16-0:01:22:**  And we had a really interesting conversation with Tom about this who brings up some fascinating  
**0:01:22-0:01:30:**  elements in terms of management styles, understories in trees, types of insects that are favoured  
**0:01:30-0:01:32:**  and not favoured, and more.  
**0:01:32-0:01:37:**  So I hope you enjoy this interview and let us know what you think.  
**0:01:37-0:01:39:**  Hello Tom and welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:39-0:01:45:**  Hello Dimitri and thanks for the invitation, it's very nice to be here.  
**0:01:45-0:01:51:**  Awesome, well I think to start off it would be really great for our listeners to have  
**0:01:51-0:01:58:**  a bit of an idea of who you are and what you're doing and some of your current activities  
**0:01:58-0:02:00:**  at the moment.  
**0:02:00-0:02:09:**  Sure yeah, so I'm a PhD student in my fourth year now, so right at the end of my PhD.  
**0:02:09-0:02:15:**  I'm at the University of Reading in the UK, which is in southern England.  
**0:02:15-0:02:22:**  And really I suppose in terms of my background, my background is really in ecology and biology.  
**0:02:22-0:02:28:**  So I did a biology degree, then I did the masters in biological recording and ecological  
**0:02:28-0:02:29:**  monitoring.  
**0:02:29-0:02:35:**  Then I worked as a consultant ecologist for a few years, advising developers and people  
**0:02:35-0:02:36:**  like that.  
**0:02:36-0:02:41:**  Then I fancied the change, so I started a PhD.  
**0:02:41-0:02:47:**  So really my background is in ecology and I'm interested in any applied ecological problem  
**0:02:47-0:02:55:**  really of which agriculture, there's lots to be interested in there.  
**0:02:55-0:02:57:**  So that's how I got into this.  
**0:02:57-0:03:06:**  Okay so my PhD, I'm really looking at biodiversity and agroforestry and particularly plants and  
**0:03:06-0:03:07:**  insect diversity.  
**0:03:07-0:03:13:**  But I'm particularly interested in looking at that from an applied angle, so from a farming  
**0:03:13-0:03:14:**  perspective.  
**0:03:14-0:03:19:**  What are the good aspects of biodiversity in agroforestry?  
**0:03:19-0:03:24:**  So things like pollinators or the natural predators of pests.  
**0:03:24-0:03:30:**  And also what are the challenging aspects, so things like weeds and insect pests.  
**0:03:30-0:03:36:**  So it's trying to weigh up those pros and cons really of biodiversity and agroforestry.  
**0:03:36-0:03:39:**  Okay, how did you get involved with agroforestry in the first place?  
**0:03:39-0:03:43:**  How did you start working in agroforestry research?  
**0:03:43-0:03:51:**  Yeah, well it was really coming to the PhD and I was looking for PhD opportunities.  
**0:03:51-0:03:58:**  I saw this one advertised and it looks like an interesting topic really, so it went from  
**0:03:58-0:03:59:**  there.  
**0:03:59-0:04:03:**  But as I say, I'm interested in applied ecological problems.  
**0:04:03-0:04:08:**  I like getting out into the field as well and getting my hands dirty and collecting  
**0:04:08-0:04:09:**  data.  
**0:04:09-0:04:15:**  And so this project really takes away these boxes in terms of being a very applied practical  
**0:04:15-0:04:16:**  project.  
**0:04:16-0:04:20:**  So yeah, that's how I got into it.  
**0:04:20-0:04:25:**  Okay, it was quite exciting to find your research actually.  
**0:04:25-0:04:31:**  That was advised to us by Sally and Joe, who we interviewed in a previous episode.  
**0:04:31-0:04:38:**  And for us, one of the objectives of this talk would be to really delve into the nuance  
**0:04:38-0:04:47:**  of how agroforestry and under what conditions and with what management does it have an influence  
**0:04:47-0:04:54:**  on our insects and therefore how that can influence also the economics of the farm by,  
**0:04:54-0:04:59:**  for example, favoring or defavoring predatory insects that can help with other types of  
**0:04:59-0:05:04:**  pests, such as aphids, et cetera.  
**0:05:04-0:05:08:**  And I know your research touches a lot of points based on this.  
**0:05:08-0:05:14:**  So it would be awesome if you could give us a bit of an intro as to what you found out  
**0:05:14-0:05:18:**  in your research about insects and agroforestry.  
**0:05:18-0:05:23:**  How have insects been favored or defavored in an agroforestry context compared to an  
**0:05:23-0:05:25:**  arable context?  
**0:05:25-0:05:32:**  Yeah, so I mean, what you said about nuance earlier is very true.  
**0:05:32-0:05:40:**  And I think when I started out on the project, I was kind of seeing it in a quite polarized  
**0:05:40-0:05:46:**  view and seeing, well, can agroforestry be a positive solution, not just for biodiversity,  
**0:05:46-0:05:51:**  but for pest suppression and for pollinators.  
**0:05:51-0:05:55:**  Whereas as I've gone through the project, I've realized that the reality is a bit more  
**0:05:55-0:06:01:**  nuanced and there's pros and cons really of biodiversity.  
**0:06:01-0:06:09:**  So I think firstly, in terms of biodiversity overall, we're certainly finding strong evidence  
**0:06:09-0:06:17:**  that agroforestry does improve biodiversity in terms of plants and insects, species compared  
**0:06:17-0:06:21:**  to monocultures of arable.  
**0:06:21-0:06:27:**  And that's as we would expect really, and there's previous evidence for that as well.  
**0:06:27-0:06:34:**  So there's a growing body of evidence supporting that conclusion.  
**0:06:34-0:06:41:**  But in terms of the applied perspective, so looking at pests and pollinators, we've really  
**0:06:41-0:06:44:**  found that it's quite a nuanced result really.  
**0:06:44-0:06:53:**  So rather than agroforestry universally suppressing all insect pests, we're finding that some  
**0:06:53-0:07:00:**  are suppressed, whereas others seem to be a bit more of a problem in agroforestry.  
**0:07:00-0:07:10:**  So for example, the pollen beetles in Orssey rape, we found way less of them in agroforestry.  
**0:07:10-0:07:19:**  So 57% fewer pollen beetles in agroforestry compared to pure monocroping of Orssey rape.  
**0:07:19-0:07:23:**  So huge difference.  
**0:07:23-0:07:27:**  Whereas the flip side of that is something like slugs, where we found 39% more slugs  
**0:07:27-0:07:32:**  in agroforestry than in pure arable fields.  
**0:07:32-0:07:37:**  So it's a bit of a mixed bag really in terms of pest abundance.  
**0:07:37-0:07:43:**  And we can explain that in terms of the traits of those insects.  
**0:07:43-0:07:49:**  So pollen beetles are very mobile, they're very attracted to a big flower resource.  
**0:07:49-0:07:52:**  And so a big field of Orssey rape is perfect for pollen beetle because they can get in  
**0:07:52-0:07:53:**  very quickly.  
**0:07:53-0:07:55:**  There's loads of food for them.  
**0:07:55-0:07:59:**  And they have a very quick life cycle.  
**0:07:59-0:08:04:**  So the high disturbance of the arable field doesn't really affect them.  
**0:08:04-0:08:06:**  Whereas slugs are very different.  
**0:08:06-0:08:09:**  Of course, they're not mobile.  
**0:08:09-0:08:14:**  They're not particularly attracted to any particular resource.  
**0:08:14-0:08:19:**  And so they do quite well in agroforestry because, well, probably because of a number  
**0:08:19-0:08:27:**  of reasons, including the refuge from cultivation and also the higher moisture stability in  
**0:08:27-0:08:29:**  the soil.  
**0:08:29-0:08:35:**  The soils tend to retain more moisture in agroforestry.  
**0:08:35-0:08:39:**  So it's quite a nuanced result.  
**0:08:39-0:08:44:**  The other thing that we found was certainly higher diversity of natural enemies.  
**0:08:44-0:08:49:**  So natural enemies are the predators and parasitoids of pests.  
**0:08:49-0:08:58:**  We did find higher diversity of them in agroforestry than in arable, which suggests a higher level  
**0:08:58-0:09:01:**  of natural pest control.  
**0:09:01-0:09:09:**  Okay, so I saw on one of the, I think it's your latest research paper, excuse me if I'm  
**0:09:09-0:09:14:**  not familiar exactly with the dates and the names, etc.  
**0:09:14-0:09:21:**  But I found that you had seen an increase in ground predators in the agroforestry system,  
**0:09:21-0:09:23:**  such as beetles.  
**0:09:23-0:09:28:**  And I'm just going to push the logic a bit and see to understand why things have worked  
**0:09:28-0:09:31:**  or why things are working in this way and why not.  
**0:09:31-0:09:35:**  But for example, if the ground beetles have been favoured and they eat slugs, would we  
**0:09:35-0:09:40:**  expect at some point for things to even out?  
**0:09:40-0:09:44:**  I mean, I don't know, do we have a sense of how things could evolve with this example  
**0:09:44-0:09:48:**  now of this basic relationship between the beetles and the slugs?  
**0:09:48-0:09:56:**  Yeah, I think in that respect, yeah, you're right about the ground predators in agroforestry.  
**0:09:56-0:10:04:**  Agroforestry does seem to favour those, particularly those ground based predators.  
**0:10:04-0:10:11:**  But I think in terms of pest populations, pest populations depend on how many of those  
**0:10:11-0:10:20:**  pests are being eaten, but also by how suitable the habitat is for those pests.  
**0:10:20-0:10:25:**  So it may be that there's more predators of slugs in agroforestry.  
**0:10:25-0:10:30:**  But also if the habitat is so much better that it outweighs that top down predation,  
**0:10:30-0:10:37:**  then you'll end up with more slugs, which I suspect is what's happening in agroforestry.  
**0:10:37-0:10:40:**  There are more predators.  
**0:10:40-0:10:46:**  The habitat suitability for slugs outweighs that factor.  
**0:10:46-0:10:48:**  Yeah, nice.  
**0:10:48-0:10:52:**  And I mean, what about the insects such as pollination?  
**0:10:52-0:10:59:**  I saw there was also some interesting results in terms of pollinators in the system.  
**0:10:59-0:11:00:**  Could you tell us a bit about that as well?  
**0:11:00-0:11:08:**  Yeah, so yeah, that is a bit more simple really, in that it is pretty much universally beneficial  
**0:11:08-0:11:13:**  effects of pollinators in agroforestry.  
**0:11:13-0:11:16:**  So yeah, we're writing a paper at the moment on that.  
**0:11:16-0:11:22:**  And there was a paper that came out last year actually from a previous PhD student at Reading.  
**0:11:22-0:11:28:**  And we're finding about two times more pollinators in agroforestry than in arable field, which  
**0:11:28-0:11:33:**  basically which is a big effect.  
**0:11:33-0:11:34:**  A lot more.  
**0:11:34-0:11:35:**  Yeah, yeah.  
**0:11:35-0:11:40:**  And not just numbers of pollinators, but also the species richness of particularly of wild  
**0:11:40-0:11:41:**  bees.  
**0:11:41-0:11:47:**  So there's a lot more species of wild bees in agroforestry.  
**0:11:47-0:11:52:**  And interestingly, we've been looking at which species of bees particularly benefit.  
**0:11:52-0:11:55:**  So is it just common bee species that you're getting more of?  
**0:11:55-0:12:00:**  Or is it favouring declining, rarer species?  
**0:12:00-0:12:04:**  And it seems that it is those rarer declining species which are particularly benefiting  
**0:12:04-0:12:05:**  from agroforestry.  
**0:12:05-0:12:16:**  So species, particularly smaller winged species are benefiting most from agroforestry.  
**0:12:16-0:12:21:**  And those smaller winged species are also more vulnerable to population declines.  
**0:12:21-0:12:28:**  Because they're much less mobile, they're much more sensitive to localised habitat conditions.  
**0:12:28-0:12:33:**  So that's really promising in terms of agroforestry being a really effective tool for conserving  
**0:12:33-0:12:36:**  wild bees.  
**0:12:36-0:12:38:**  Which is very important.  
**0:12:38-0:12:45:**  I'm sure your listeners have heard lots about catastrophic insect declines globally.  
**0:12:45-0:12:51:**  And bees are certainly taking a big brunt of that in terms of their vulnerability to  
**0:12:51-0:12:52:**  extinction.  
**0:12:52-0:12:58:**  So yeah, agroforestry looks like a really good way of mitigating that and bringing bees  
**0:12:58-0:12:59:**  back into farms.  
**0:12:59-0:13:05:**  Which is of course good for conservation, but also good for farming and pollination,  
**0:13:05-0:13:06:**  crop pollination.  
**0:13:06-0:13:11:**  And from my understanding, I had read this by looking at the resources in your research  
**0:13:11-0:13:12:**  and kind of drilling in.  
**0:13:12-0:13:17:**  Wild bees are, I think it was research in China, I'm not sure, but they found that wild  
**0:13:17-0:13:23:**  bees are more effective than normal bees or than let's say cultivated bees, it's not the  
**0:13:23-0:13:27:**  right term, but at pollinating, right?  
**0:13:27-0:13:35:**  Yes, yeah, there's lots of evidence for comparing managed bees like honey bees.  
**0:13:35-0:13:43:**  In the UK we normally have managed honey bee hives around the edges of crop fields to pollinate  
**0:13:43-0:13:44:**  the crops.  
**0:13:44-0:13:49:**  So there's been studies looking at how effective wild pollinators are compared to honey bees.  
**0:13:49-0:13:55:**  And there's lots of evidence that having those wild pollinators really helps to improve pollination.  
**0:13:55-0:14:02:**  So there was one study that came out recently that looked at, that compared the weight of  
**0:14:02-0:14:06:**  strawberries pollinated by honey bees versus wild bees.  
**0:14:06-0:14:12:**  And they found that the strawberries pollinated by wild bees were significantly heavier than  
**0:14:12-0:14:15:**  those that had been pollinated by honey bees.  
**0:14:15-0:14:20:**  Wow, I mean, I really wonder why would that be the case, right?  
**0:14:20-0:14:21:**  I mean, that's crazy.  
**0:14:21-0:14:24:**  Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's lots of reasons for that.  
**0:14:24-0:14:31:**  But I'm really having a good diversity of different bee shapes and sizes so the pollen  
**0:14:31-0:14:34:**  can get into different places.  
**0:14:34-0:14:40:**  It seems to be important, whereas honey bees are quite limited in terms of where they take  
**0:14:40-0:14:43:**  the pollen and how they move it around, basically.  
**0:14:43-0:14:49:**  And so can we assume that that's the case with other species as well?  
**0:14:49-0:14:53:**  Because I mean, I guess flying insects like bees can be, maybe it was, you specifically  
**0:14:53-0:15:01:**  studied these ones, but can we assume that the complexity of other insect groups will  
**0:15:01-0:15:08:**  also be emphasised and their importance in the ecosystem can also, is also an important  
**0:15:08-0:15:14:**  consideration in agroforestry, yes, you know, more simple monocrop fields without the complex  
**0:15:14-0:15:15:**  layers?  
**0:15:15-0:15:16:**  Absolutely, yeah.  
**0:15:16-0:15:22:**  Yeah, so there's lots of interest in that in the way in the ecological research, looking  
**0:15:22-0:15:30:**  at the importance of diversity for pollination, as I've mentioned, but also for natural pest  
**0:15:30-0:15:31:**  regulation.  
**0:15:31-0:15:39:**  And so there was a study that looked at what we call the functional diversity of predators  
**0:15:39-0:15:45:**  and parasitoids, which is basically the number of different types of predators that you have.  
**0:15:45-0:15:52:**  So it looks at the hunting mode of predators, so whether they're ambush predators, or whether  
**0:15:52-0:15:58:**  they're active, or whether they sit and wait.  
**0:15:58-0:16:04:**  And also whether, which part of the plants they use, so whether they run along the ground  
**0:16:04-0:16:06:**  or whether they're aerial.  
**0:16:06-0:16:13:**  And things like this looked at this functional diversity and found that the functional diversity  
**0:16:13-0:16:20:**  of predators was the most important predictor of pest regulation or pest suppression.  
**0:16:20-0:16:26:**  And more important even than the number of different species of predators that you have.  
**0:16:26-0:16:33:**  So having these, not just different species of predators, but different functions of predators  
**0:16:33-0:16:40:**  is really important for this natural pest suppression.  
**0:16:40-0:16:46:**  So yeah, it's really interesting to look at it from this functional biodiversity.  
**0:16:46-0:16:53:**  And I mean, for me, it really makes me wonder, what is it in the agroforestry system that  
**0:16:53-0:16:55:**  favors this biodiversity?  
**0:16:55-0:17:01:**  Is it the more diverse food source, the more diverse structure of the environment that  
**0:17:01-0:17:03:**  creates more habitats?  
**0:17:03-0:17:10:**  We have an idea of what creates better conditions for accommodating higher biodiversity of insects.  
**0:17:10-0:17:14:**  Yeah, so it's a good question.  
**0:17:14-0:17:17:**  And again, there's a lot of reasons for that.  
**0:17:17-0:17:26:**  They're really introducing plant diversity into a field always benefits biodiversity  
**0:17:26-0:17:31:**  in general, because of course, plants underpin the whole food web.  
**0:17:31-0:17:36:**  So you have more plant diversity, you have more insect diversity.  
**0:17:36-0:17:40:**  And so agroforestry is a good way of doing that.  
**0:17:40-0:17:49:**  One really, excuse me, one important factor in terms of that plant diversity is of course,  
**0:17:49-0:17:55:**  how the space below the trees is managed, particularly in an alley cropping system where  
**0:17:55-0:17:58:**  you have strips of trees.  
**0:17:58-0:18:07:**  And then that space is an opportunity really to provide a food source for invertebrates  
**0:18:07-0:18:12:**  and insects and other wildlife.  
**0:18:12-0:18:18:**  And so one of the things we've looked at actually is to compare tall flowering understories.  
**0:18:18-0:18:24:**  So the understory being the vegetation below the trees, compared to regular limo understories  
**0:18:24-0:18:26:**  to suppress the vegetation.  
**0:18:26-0:18:33:**  We found significantly higher diversity associated with those taller flowering understories,  
**0:18:33-0:18:36:**  particularly early in the season.  
**0:18:36-0:18:41:**  So it seems that that vegetation is really important, particularly for overwintering  
**0:18:41-0:18:44:**  of insects.  
**0:18:44-0:18:51:**  And particularly, interestingly, the main benefit of that was on the beneficial insects,  
**0:18:51-0:18:54:**  so the predators of pests and the pollinators.  
**0:18:54-0:19:00:**  Whereas we didn't really see any worsening of pest problems from those taller flowering  
**0:19:00-0:19:01:**  understories.  
**0:19:01-0:19:08:**  So it seems that vegetation below the trees is an important reason why agroforestry can  
**0:19:08-0:19:10:**  be so beneficial to biodiversity.  
**0:19:10-0:19:14:**  Okay, that's really interesting.  
**0:19:14-0:19:17:**  One of your papers focuses solely on this, right?  
**0:19:17-0:19:21:**  It's just looking at how the management of that understory will influence the...  
**0:19:21-0:19:27:**  It compares quite a lot to the flower strips that we also talk a lot about.  
**0:19:27-0:19:30:**  This is a bit diverging a bit from agroforestry, but that's also an important conservation  
**0:19:30-0:19:35:**  technique that we're seeing popping up around the place.  
**0:19:35-0:19:36:**  And so I wonder what's...  
**0:19:36-0:19:43:**  Just stepping back a little bit, what's the benefit of a flower strip?  
**0:19:43-0:19:49:**  Yes, a flower strip with trees, also called agroforestry.  
**0:19:49-0:19:50:**  What's the difference there?  
**0:19:50-0:19:53:**  I mean, do the trees have an influence?  
**0:19:53-0:19:58:**  Well, the trees will have a microclimatic influence.  
**0:19:58-0:20:05:**  So there's good evidence again that the trees produce wind speeds in the crop alleys in  
**0:20:05-0:20:07:**  between the trees.  
**0:20:07-0:20:12:**  And that will have an effect on flying insects.  
**0:20:12-0:20:17:**  So again, thinking of things like bees, especially the smaller bees are quite sensitive to wind  
**0:20:17-0:20:18:**  speeds.  
**0:20:18-0:20:24:**  So reducing wind speeds by introducing trees will be beneficial to them.  
**0:20:24-0:20:30:**  So that's probably the main mechanism by which the trees will benefit biodiversity.  
**0:20:30-0:20:38:**  But of course, the other kind of a side of biodiversity, the reason trees are planted  
**0:20:38-0:20:42:**  is for economic benefit.  
**0:20:42-0:20:50:**  And that's really important because wildlife friendly farming techniques need to work economically.  
**0:20:50-0:20:56:**  And the disadvantage with having flower strips is that they're not providing you with an  
**0:20:56-0:20:59:**  income, a direct income that is.  
**0:20:59-0:21:04:**  So there's a limit to how many flower strips a farmer is going to plant and they're probably  
**0:21:04-0:21:07:**  not going to plant them across that field every 24 meters.  
**0:21:07-0:21:12:**  Whereas an agroforestry, that's exactly what farmers do because they're receiving an income  
**0:21:12-0:21:13:**  from those trees.  
**0:21:13-0:21:21:**  So the trees are providing an economic justification to have a high density of these flower strips  
**0:21:21-0:21:23:**  across the field.  
**0:21:23-0:21:29:**  And also a justification for keeping them there in the long term.  
**0:21:29-0:21:33:**  Okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  
**0:21:33-0:21:42:**  But again, if I can drill this in a bit more, is there not some role for the tree in the  
**0:21:42-0:21:46:**  direct benefits in terms of food and shelter to the insects?  
**0:21:46-0:21:49:**  Yes, there is, there is absolutely, yeah.  
**0:21:49-0:21:55:**  And that's probably a slightly neglected kind of topic in ecological research.  
**0:21:55-0:22:02:**  In fact, there was a paper that came up very recently on bees, looking at the importance  
**0:22:02-0:22:06:**  of trees for bees.  
**0:22:06-0:22:13:**  And it found that things like tree sap and resin are actually really important for bees  
**0:22:13-0:22:18:**  because they use them to build their nests, which we don't really think about.  
**0:22:18-0:22:24:**  We just think about having lots of flowers for bees, but actually they do need these  
**0:22:24-0:22:29:**  other sources of food like resin and sap.  
**0:22:29-0:22:30:**  Interesting.  
**0:22:30-0:22:37:**  So, yeah, and yeah, of course the same goes for other insects, that we use these resources  
**0:22:37-0:22:38:**  of endopom trees.  
**0:22:38-0:22:42:**  And the flowering, as you say, many trees are very early flowering.  
**0:22:42-0:22:50:**  For example, apple trees, which are the main tree species we've been studying in our agroforestry  
**0:22:50-0:22:58:**  field sites, flower very early and provide a really abundant floral resource early in  
**0:22:58-0:22:59:**  the season.  
**0:22:59-0:23:05:**  And that's, again, that's good evidence that having that temporal availability of food  
**0:23:05-0:23:09:**  sources is really important for bees because when they come out of hibernation, they need  
**0:23:09-0:23:15:**  to, or they emerge from the nests, they need an immediate source of food really.  
**0:23:15-0:23:22:**  So having early flowering and also late flowering species is really important for their populations.  
**0:23:22-0:23:29:**  I mean, maybe it's a good time now and maybe it's also a bit late, but first it would be  
**0:23:29-0:23:36:**  great for you to mention kind of the setup of the plot where you were measuring data.  
**0:23:36-0:23:39:**  Just to clarify, are we talking about a hedge system?  
**0:23:39-0:23:42:**  Are we talking about what agroforestry system are we talking about?  
**0:23:42-0:23:44:**  Where have you done your measures?  
**0:23:44-0:23:51:**  Yeah, so we selected three sites, all in the UK, all in a similar part of the UK.  
**0:23:51-0:23:55:**  So they're all quite climatically similar.  
**0:23:55-0:24:01:**  And all of the three sites are working farms, so they're all commercial farms, they're not  
**0:24:01-0:24:05:**  university setups.  
**0:24:05-0:24:12:**  And each of the farms has an agroforestry field as well as a monoculture arable field  
**0:24:12-0:24:16:**  within the same management, and in most cases right next door to each other.  
**0:24:16-0:24:21:**  So we were able to compare, and really the whole aim of the research was to compare the  
**0:24:21-0:24:26:**  agroforestry fields to the arable fields.  
**0:24:26-0:24:34:**  And yeah, in terms of the agroforestry setups, they were, so they're alley cropping systems.  
**0:24:34-0:24:38:**  So it's a row of trees or a strip of trees.  
**0:24:38-0:24:45:**  Then you have a crop alley, which was 24 metres wide, all of the sites.  
**0:24:45-0:24:50:**  And then another row of trees, another crop alley, so on.  
**0:24:50-0:24:55:**  So the tree rows were mostly apple trees.  
**0:24:55-0:25:03:**  One of the sites was a bit more diverse, more of a range of fruit and nut species, but mostly  
**0:25:03-0:25:04:**  apples.  
**0:25:04-0:25:12:**  And these are planted on semi-dwarf rootstock, so they get about three or four metres tall.  
**0:25:12-0:25:20:**  So the shading impact on the crop isn't too severe compared to bigger timber trees.  
**0:25:20-0:25:26:**  And the tree rows are set within a three or four metre wide strip.  
**0:25:26-0:25:34:**  And then the space below the trees, the understory, was sown with some kind of flower mix at all  
**0:25:34-0:25:36:**  of the sites.  
**0:25:36-0:25:45:**  And that varied from a nectar-rich, quite diverse wildflower mix at some of the sites,  
**0:25:45-0:25:51:**  through to a clover mix at one of the sites.  
**0:25:51-0:25:52:**  And what else?  
**0:25:52-0:25:58:**  So the trees were around, the trees were planted, well, at the time we were collecting the data,  
**0:25:58-0:26:05:**  the trees were about between three and eight or nine years old, something like that, depending  
**0:26:05-0:26:08:**  on the site.  
**0:26:08-0:26:15:**  So reasonably young, really, in terms of the establishment time.  
**0:26:15-0:26:19:**  And two of the sites were organically managed.  
**0:26:19-0:26:29:**  The other one wasn't organic, but they do limit their pesticide use, and also mint-till.  
**0:26:29-0:26:35:**  So they're all kind of practicing some kind of ecological farming technique alongside  
**0:26:35-0:26:37:**  the ecofaristry.  
**0:26:37-0:26:43:**  For me, it makes me wonder a bit about, you know, we looked at, we talked about increased  
**0:26:43-0:26:46:**  biodiversity.  
**0:26:46-0:26:52:**  We talked about increased predators, especially early in the season, which is when there is  
**0:26:52-0:27:00:**  also a lot of pressure from herbivorous insects like aphids, et cetera.  
**0:27:00-0:27:08:**  Did this increased biodiversity express itself in an improvement in the crop performance,  
**0:27:08-0:27:15:**  be it either the apple or the intercrop grains, for example?  
**0:27:15-0:27:22:**  So firstly, before I answer that, I meant to say the crops in the ecofaristry.  
**0:27:22-0:27:26:**  The ecofaristry systems were mostly cereals.  
**0:27:26-0:27:28:**  So we had mostly oats, actually.  
**0:27:28-0:27:31:**  There was a bit of barley and wheat.  
**0:27:31-0:27:35:**  One of the sites grew, obviously, grape in one of the years.  
**0:27:35-0:27:37:**  So they were all cereal-based rotations.  
**0:27:37-0:27:45:**  Yeah, so in terms of benefits to the crop, in terms of the different understory treatments,  
**0:27:45-0:27:54:**  we compared aphid colonies in the apple trees above the flowering mix versus the mown understories.  
**0:27:54-0:28:00:**  We found significantly fewer aphids in the apple trees above the understories, which  
**0:28:00-0:28:05:**  had been regularly mown, and also significantly more natural enemies early in the season in  
**0:28:05-0:28:06:**  the trees.  
**0:28:06-0:28:12:**  By natural enemies, I mean predators and parasitoids.  
**0:28:12-0:28:18:**  So there was a nice link there between the higher abundance of predators and suppressed  
**0:28:18-0:28:24:**  aphid colonies associated with those flower strips.  
**0:28:24-0:28:26:**  And we also followed that through to the apple crop.  
**0:28:26-0:28:36:**  And we found, again, significantly fewer aphid-damaged apples above the flowering understories.  
**0:28:36-0:28:40:**  So there was an observable effect on the apple crop.  
**0:28:40-0:28:44:**  So it was quite nice to be able to follow that through from predators.  
**0:28:44-0:28:50:**  More predators, fewer pests, and fewer pest damage.  
**0:28:50-0:28:59:**  But in terms of a comparison between agroforestry and monoculture, arable, the problem was there  
**0:28:59-0:29:06:**  wasn't really significant enough pests to build up anywhere to see any observable crop  
**0:29:06-0:29:09:**  damage.  
**0:29:09-0:29:16:**  So we weren't able to measure crop damage because there wasn't enough of it from pests.  
**0:29:16-0:29:25:**  But really, in terms of the value of having natural enemies, because in a way it's a bit  
**0:29:25-0:29:32:**  of a tough sell trying to promote naturally occurring predators on farms at the moment  
**0:29:32-0:29:40:**  because pesticides are so cheap and readily available and mostly effective.  
**0:29:40-0:29:45:**  So why would a farmer stop using pesticides and try to promote these naturally occurring  
**0:29:45-0:29:52:**  predators when they have this reasonably reliable and cheap quick fix in terms of pesticides?  
**0:29:52-0:30:00:**  And I think the answer to that is in really the long-term insurance value of having these  
**0:30:00-0:30:08:**  natural predators, particularly in terms of we look at the way pesticide regulation is  
**0:30:08-0:30:13:**  going in recent years, particularly in Europe and the EU.  
**0:30:13-0:30:18:**  It's getting tighter and tighter as we're becoming more aware of the environmental and  
**0:30:18-0:30:24:**  human health risks associated with pesticides.  
**0:30:24-0:30:29:**  But also the evolution of pest resistance.  
**0:30:29-0:30:36:**  So we're having to continually develop new pesticide products as the insects find ways  
**0:30:36-0:30:39:**  around them basically and find ways to tolerate them.  
**0:30:39-0:30:45:**  And that will continue for as long as we're using pesticides.  
**0:30:45-0:30:53:**  So really the value is, of course, added to that climate change and shifting distributions  
**0:30:53-0:30:54:**  of new pests.  
**0:30:54-0:31:00:**  We can have new species arriving in areas where we didn't find them before.  
**0:31:00-0:31:07:**  So having a good diversity of predators is really important to have that insurance and  
**0:31:07-0:31:12:**  that resilience against future risks.  
**0:31:12-0:31:15:**  And that's where the value is, which is a bit of a tough sell because you're talking  
**0:31:15-0:31:24:**  about a slightly intangible long-term benefit rather than a short-term quick fix.  
**0:31:24-0:31:31:**  But yeah, that's where we see the value.  
**0:31:31-0:31:36:**  And yeah, I'm not completely against pesticides, but the more tools we have in our toolkit  
**0:31:36-0:31:43:**  to protect our crops and our food production from pests can only be a good thing.  
**0:31:43-0:31:47:**  No, that completely makes sense to me and resonates with me.  
**0:31:47-0:31:52:**  I was just recently working in Switzerland where they are going to vote, I think on the  
**0:31:52-0:31:54:**  12th of June.  
**0:31:54-0:32:03:**  The population is going to vote in a referendum style to ban basically, if I'm not wrong,  
**0:32:03-0:32:10:**  it's all pesticides, synthetic pesticides uses in agriculture.  
**0:32:10-0:32:16:**  So I think it's insecticides, herbicides, they're going to ban a lot of the chemical  
**0:32:16-0:32:18:**  tools that the farmers have.  
**0:32:18-0:32:21:**  And the farmers are lobbying quite heavily to not let that happen because it is quite  
**0:32:21-0:32:24:**  extreme to just take away all these tools from the farmers.  
**0:32:24-0:32:29:**  And there are some serious side effects of that, which go beyond ecology, which go in  
**0:32:29-0:32:38:**  basically what's, I mean, that's another conversation, but the point is that there's pressure, more  
**0:32:38-0:32:44:**  and more pressure from citizens, from politicians and et cetera, to get rid of these tools that  
**0:32:44-0:32:45:**  farmers currently have.  
**0:32:45-0:32:47:**  And so we have to find alternatives.  
**0:32:47-0:32:52:**  But I really like to connect that with what you said earlier on of, you know, well, if  
**0:32:52-0:32:58:**  you're going to put, if flower strips benefit trees, benefit insects and benefits the resilience  
**0:32:58-0:33:05:**  of your system and the strength of your ecosystem, then being able to make some kind of money  
**0:33:05-0:33:09:**  from that strip by using agroforestry.  
**0:33:09-0:33:14:**  And a lot of our interviews are based on this, on interview practitioners and look at how  
**0:33:14-0:33:17:**  they are, how their economic model works.  
**0:33:17-0:33:24:**  You know, how can people put trees on their landscapes and make it profitable for them?  
**0:33:24-0:33:27:**  And actually we interviewed Stephen Briggs on this.  
**0:33:27-0:33:29:**  That was, you may have done research on his farm.  
**0:33:29-0:33:30:**  I'm not sure.  
**0:33:30-0:33:31:**  Yes.  
**0:33:31-0:33:35:**  But so it's interesting actually to connect your research with his, with the conversation  
**0:33:35-0:33:40:**  with him, because, you know, he was very happy with apples, as you said, you know, low shade  
**0:33:40-0:33:46:**  and apples that produce an income quite quickly and that can be value, can be transformed  
**0:33:46-0:33:49:**  and can gain value very well.  
**0:33:49-0:33:58:**  So that's, I think that's a really interesting way to merge, you know, the productive needs  
**0:33:58-0:34:04:**  of the farm with the ecological requirements of our ecosystem and now of society as well.  
**0:34:04-0:34:10:**  Yeah, that's my little rant, but now I'm going to start interviewing you again.  
**0:34:10-0:34:11:**  I completely agree.  
**0:34:11-0:34:12:**  Yeah.  
**0:34:12-0:34:16:**  And it has to be, it has to work ecologically and economically.  
**0:34:16-0:34:23:**  Yeah, that's, that's, you know, both, both are very important.  
**0:34:23-0:34:28:**  And we have been looking at the economics of agroforestry, particularly of intercropping  
**0:34:28-0:34:32:**  apples with cereals.  
**0:34:32-0:34:33:**  We've been, we've been looking at that as well.  
**0:34:33-0:34:36:**  So yeah, I'd be happy to talk more about that.  
**0:34:36-0:34:39:**  Yeah, that, I think it's a great moment.  
**0:34:39-0:34:43:**  I'm curious, what results did you find when looking at the economics?  
**0:34:43-0:34:46:**  How was, could you break that down a little for us?  
**0:34:46-0:34:51:**  Yeah, so we, firstly, we did quite a theoretical exercise.  
**0:34:51-0:35:01:**  So we basically came up with 18 theoretical farms, all of which had an agroforestry field  
**0:35:01-0:35:03:**  and an arable field.  
**0:35:03-0:35:08:**  And the question was really, is the agroforestry more profitable than arable?  
**0:35:08-0:35:14:**  And if so, at what point does agroforestry, after how many years does agroforestry become  
**0:35:14-0:35:19:**  more profitable than the business as usual arable system?  
**0:35:19-0:35:27:**  And the agroforestry, as I say, was intercropping apples with cereals with 24 meter wide alleys.  
**0:35:27-0:35:32:**  So basically, Stephen Briggs' system.  
**0:35:32-0:35:39:**  And of those, so we tested 18 scenarios based on whether they were organic or conventional  
**0:35:39-0:35:44:**  management, and also looking at different productivity levels of the apples and the  
**0:35:44-0:35:46:**  arable crops.  
**0:35:46-0:35:51:**  So we combined different productivity levels of each in each of organic and conventional  
**0:35:51-0:35:52:**  systems.  
**0:35:52-0:36:00:**  And we found that of the 18 scenarios, 15 of those, in 15 of those agroforestry was  
**0:36:00-0:36:04:**  more profitable than arable within 20 years.  
**0:36:04-0:36:10:**  And we chose 20 years because that's about the productive lifespan of apple trees on  
**0:36:10-0:36:14:**  these rootstocks.  
**0:36:14-0:36:18:**  So in most cases, agroforestry was more profitable eventually.  
**0:36:18-0:36:23:**  But the next question was, well, how many years does a farmer have to wait to see that  
**0:36:23-0:36:28:**  profitability compared to business as usual farming?  
**0:36:28-0:36:33:**  And that was between seven and 12 years.  
**0:36:33-0:36:40:**  It became more profitable to farm using this agroforestry system rather than monoculture  
**0:36:40-0:36:41:**  arable.  
**0:36:41-0:36:49:**  So there's quite a substantial period a farmer has to wait to see that profitability come  
**0:36:49-0:36:52:**  to fruition really.  
**0:36:52-0:36:55:**  And this is, of course, I should say this is assuming that there's no grants.  
**0:36:55-0:37:00:**  So it's assuming the farmer doesn't receive any grant to plant the trees, doesn't receive  
**0:37:00-0:37:03:**  any stewardship support from the government or anything.  
**0:37:03-0:37:10:**  So it's just equal subsidies between the two systems.  
**0:37:10-0:37:17:**  So after we tested the 18 theoretical scenarios, we then wanted to test that using real world  
**0:37:17-0:37:18:**  data.  
**0:37:18-0:37:25:**  So Stephen Briggs, who you spoke to on a previous episode, one of the farmers at one of our  
**0:37:25-0:37:32:**  study sites, he kindly shared with us some yield and economic data.  
**0:37:32-0:37:37:**  So he shared with us the yields he was getting from the agroforestry and the arable fields  
**0:37:37-0:37:42:**  and also how much it cost him to set up.  
**0:37:42-0:37:50:**  And so we then tested the profitability of his system of the agroforestry versus arable.  
**0:37:50-0:37:55:**  And that confirms that the agroforestry was more profitable than arable, or at least we  
**0:37:55-0:37:59:**  would expect it to be within 20 years.  
**0:37:59-0:38:08:**  So that was a nice confirmation really of our theoretical expectations.  
**0:38:08-0:38:13:**  And I mean, when you talk about a profitability that starts between seven and 12 years and  
**0:38:13-0:38:20:**  then would last until or would exist until 20 years when the trees would need to be changed  
**0:38:20-0:38:28:**  overall, have you managed to use some calculations such as the internal rate of return or calculations,  
**0:38:28-0:38:35:**  including the time value of money in order to see is it more valuable after 20 years  
**0:38:35-0:38:38:**  to invest in agroforestry rather than not?  
**0:38:38-0:38:40:**  Yeah, yes, we have been doing that.  
**0:38:40-0:38:47:**  So we've been including discount rates in our calculations.  
**0:38:47-0:38:56:**  And yeah, in all of those 15 of 18 scenarios I mentioned, the discounted rate of profitability,  
**0:38:56-0:39:07:**  i.e. in discounting future profitability, was higher from the agroforestry than arable.  
**0:39:07-0:39:13:**  So yeah, it does show that it's a worthwhile investment provided the apple trees.  
**0:39:13-0:39:20:**  So in the three scenarios which weren't more profitable, in all of them, the reason they  
**0:39:20-0:39:26:**  weren't more profitable was because the apple production level was low.  
**0:39:26-0:39:35:**  The apple yields were low and the profitability of agroforestry never caught up with the arable.  
**0:39:35-0:39:37:**  Okay, very interesting.  
**0:39:37-0:39:43:**  I mean, that leads kind of nicely to one of the questions that I wanted to, one of the  
**0:39:43-0:39:52:**  aspects that I wanted to delve into with you is looking at the management regime of the  
**0:39:52-0:39:53:**  tree line.  
**0:39:53-0:40:01:**  So looking in a bit more detail, it's clearly more beneficial for biodiversity and for predatory  
**0:40:01-0:40:07:**  insects, etc., to leave the flower stripped or the strip underneath the trees to have  
**0:40:07-0:40:13:**  it planted as flowers and to leave them flower and to not mow them.  
**0:40:13-0:40:18:**  Has your research showed that there are some concerns in terms of weeds, weed pressure  
**0:40:18-0:40:24:**  for the intercrop around these agroforestry lines?  
**0:40:24-0:40:31:**  Yeah, so that's another interesting topic and we haven't really mentioned weeds yet.  
**0:40:31-0:40:34:**  So again, the effects on weeds is again quite nuanced.  
**0:40:34-0:40:42:**  It's similar to the effect we find on insect pests in that it's not like agroforestry universally  
**0:40:42-0:40:46:**  suppresses weeds or that all weeds are more of a problem in agroforestry.  
**0:40:46-0:40:50:**  It really depends on the weed.  
**0:40:50-0:41:00:**  So we did also measure weed cover in the agroforestry fields and compared them to the arable fields.  
**0:41:00-0:41:09:**  And we found that the effect of agroforestry on weeds, we can really characterise by whether  
**0:41:09-0:41:16:**  they're perennial creepers or more annual seed-spreading species.  
**0:41:16-0:41:24:**  So for example, something like blackgrass, which is a very common weed in the UK anyway,  
**0:41:24-0:41:27:**  is an annual grass and it produces lots of seeds.  
**0:41:27-0:41:34:**  And so arable fields are basically creating blackgrass heaven by arable farming because  
**0:41:34-0:41:39:**  they like disturbed ground so their seeds can get in and germinate.  
**0:41:39-0:41:43:**  They grow very quickly, go to seed very quickly and then spread.  
**0:41:43-0:41:48:**  So the arable way of farming is kind of perfect for blackgrass.  
**0:41:48-0:41:53:**  Whereas in agroforestry, it's more broken up.  
**0:41:53-0:41:57:**  Particularly, you have vegetation below the trees.  
**0:41:57-0:42:00:**  They can't really get into that.  
**0:42:00-0:42:06:**  So we found that blackgrass level certainly weren't any higher in agroforestry than in  
**0:42:06-0:42:08:**  arable.  
**0:42:08-0:42:18:**  Whereas something like a perennial creeping weed, like creeping thistle, if they can get  
**0:42:18-0:42:22:**  a foothold in the tree rows, then they can become a problem.  
**0:42:22-0:42:28:**  So they then creep out vegetatively into the crop alleys from the tree rows.  
**0:42:28-0:42:35:**  So it's more vegetative spread of weeds is the challenge in agroforestry rather than  
**0:42:35-0:42:36:**  seeds coming in.  
**0:42:36-0:42:41:**  Because I mean, the weed seeds, I mean, just to understand the logic, the weed seeds of  
**0:42:41-0:42:47:**  the fast reproducing, flying type or easily dispersed weed seeds.  
**0:42:47-0:42:50:**  I mean, they're there anyways, they're around.  
**0:42:50-0:42:51:**  Right?  
**0:42:51-0:42:53:**  That's kind of, I'm trying to understand how that would happen.  
**0:42:53-0:42:56:**  If they're already around, it's not necessarily going to be a man.  
**0:42:56-0:43:02:**  And if they're managed with the tillage and with maybe herbicides, etc.  
**0:43:02-0:43:03:**  That's not necessarily what's going to be the problem.  
**0:43:03-0:43:09:**  The problem is that we're creating channels throughout the land where perennial creeping  
**0:43:09-0:43:11:**  weeds can establish themselves and expand out.  
**0:43:11-0:43:12:**  Exactly.  
**0:43:12-0:43:13:**  Yeah.  
**0:43:13-0:43:14:**  Yeah.  
**0:43:14-0:43:15:**  That's right.  
**0:43:15-0:43:16:**  Yeah.  
**0:43:16-0:43:17:**  Yeah.  
**0:43:17-0:43:21:**  So because of that, the management of the tree row understory is obviously becomes very  
**0:43:21-0:43:26:**  important in terms of managing the weed problem in agroforestry.  
**0:43:26-0:43:27:**  Okay.  
**0:43:27-0:43:28:**  Could you tell us more about that?  
**0:43:28-0:43:31:**  So some of the implications around the management?  
**0:43:31-0:43:32:**  Yeah.  
**0:43:32-0:43:39:**  So yeah, I mentioned earlier a bit about the research we did on comparing on-mown versus  
**0:43:39-0:43:43:**  mown understories.  
**0:43:43-0:43:48:**  And I mentioned the benefits of those on-mown flowering understories for biodiversity.  
**0:43:48-0:43:56:**  But in that, I wouldn't suggest that the vegetation is never mown.  
**0:43:56-0:44:02:**  So by on-mown, we just mean, let the flowers come up in the spring and summer.  
**0:44:02-0:44:08:**  But it still needs some management, even if that's just cutting once every year or two.  
**0:44:08-0:44:14:**  And I think really, the management of the understory needs to be guided by site conditions.  
**0:44:14-0:44:21:**  So something like creeping thistle, there's an optimal time to cut thistles so that it  
**0:44:21-0:44:26:**  knocks them back when their underground reserves are at their lowest, which I think is just  
**0:44:26-0:44:30:**  before they come into flowering or something like that.  
**0:44:30-0:44:37:**  So if this was a particular problem on the farm, then the cutting should be timed to  
**0:44:37-0:44:42:**  maximize that thistle control.  
**0:44:42-0:44:50:**  So whereas on another farm, if thistles aren't so much of a problem, then possibly the mowing  
**0:44:50-0:44:54:**  regime, cutting regime could be relaxed a bit more.  
**0:44:54-0:44:57:**  So it really needs to be guided by site conditions.  
**0:44:57-0:45:06:**  I mean, I'd love to delve into how we can manage this, practically manage this understory.  
**0:45:06-0:45:08:**  I mean, it's so important for biodiversity.  
**0:45:08-0:45:16:**  And so we want to manage it carefully to balance it with the other objectives of the farm.  
**0:45:16-0:45:21:**  So yeah, and I think there are other options for that.  
**0:45:21-0:45:27:**  And I've mentioned these wildflower understories.  
**0:45:27-0:45:34:**  Another option is to have a clover-based understory, particularly if that can be regularly managed.  
**0:45:34-0:45:41:**  Clovers are obviously quite, don't really mind being cut often, so they can be managed  
**0:45:41-0:45:42:**  quite intensively.  
**0:45:42-0:45:49:**  And that also helps with nitrogen fixation, of course.  
**0:45:49-0:45:56:**  So yeah, having a clover or some kind of legume understory is an option.  
**0:45:56-0:46:01:**  Some farmers have experimented with growing horticultural crops in their understories.  
**0:46:01-0:46:07:**  And I think you had Ian Tolhurst on one of your earlier episodes, he was talking about  
**0:46:07-0:46:08:**  that.  
**0:46:08-0:46:16:**  But that's another way of receiving another income stream from that understory.  
**0:46:16-0:46:22:**  But again, that's quite obviously quite a labor-intensive option.  
**0:46:22-0:46:25:**  It would work in certain contexts.  
**0:46:25-0:46:27:**  Yeah, exactly.  
**0:46:27-0:46:30:**  But I'm very glad that you listened to at least some of our episodes.  
**0:46:30-0:46:33:**  That's very positive.  
**0:46:33-0:46:38:**  So yeah, I like what you're saying also about the clovers, because that's actually a technique  
**0:46:38-0:46:42:**  that they use in tree culture, in fruit tree culture.  
**0:46:42-0:46:49:**  It's called living mulches and being able to find crops that can tolerate mowing, even  
**0:46:49-0:46:54:**  maybe tolerate some mulching from time to time and go through, but also that do not  
**0:46:54-0:46:59:**  compete too much with the tree by having shadow root systems, by being more efficient with  
**0:46:59-0:47:07:**  water, maybe less dense roots, yeah, root mats like we would find with perennial grasses,  
**0:47:07-0:47:14:**  which would be some of the most competitive, and managing them by mowing to keep them there.  
**0:47:14-0:47:17:**  That's actually a technique that they're using in fruit culture.  
**0:47:17-0:47:22:**  So if it can also benefit the insects, that would be beneficial.  
**0:47:22-0:47:27:**  But I would expect though, that wild flowers, perennial flowers that would install themselves  
**0:47:27-0:47:30:**  there would be the most beneficial for insects.  
**0:47:30-0:47:31:**  Is that right?  
**0:47:31-0:47:34:**  Yeah, yeah, I would expect that would be right.  
**0:47:34-0:47:39:**  Because what you really want for insects is a good diversity in terms of different flower  
**0:47:39-0:47:40:**  structures.  
**0:47:40-0:47:48:**  So you want more open flowers, things like daisies, as well as the more kind of tubular  
**0:47:48-0:47:52:**  flowers like the clovers and legumes.  
**0:47:52-0:47:58:**  So clovers tend to be really good for bumblebees, because bumblebees have got long tongues,  
**0:47:58-0:48:04:**  and the nectar in the clover is quite inaccessible, unless the bee has a long tongue in order  
**0:48:04-0:48:05:**  to reach it.  
**0:48:05-0:48:09:**  So they're great for bumblebees, but not great for things like hoverflies, which have really  
**0:48:09-0:48:11:**  short tongues.  
**0:48:11-0:48:18:**  So yeah, I mean clover and stories would certainly benefit bumblebees and some insects, but I  
**0:48:18-0:48:23:**  think generally the best is to have a good diversity.  
**0:48:23-0:48:30:**  I mean the risk of having, of sowing a wild flower mix, and a big problem with that is  
**0:48:30-0:48:35:**  that you end up with a really nice diverse flower mix within two or three years.  
**0:48:35-0:48:41:**  But then after that you see the competitive grasses, the coarse grasses starting to take  
**0:48:41-0:48:47:**  over, particularly on the more fertile soils.  
**0:48:47-0:48:58:**  So that can be a challenge to keep it at that stage where you've got the nice diverse mix.  
**0:48:58-0:49:01:**  And again, management is important for that.  
**0:49:01-0:49:06:**  But that's a shared problem, if I can add just a little something else.  
**0:49:06-0:49:10:**  That's a problem that you would see with mechanical weeding, and that would also be a problem  
**0:49:10-0:49:12:**  that you would see with chemical weeding.  
**0:49:12-0:49:18:**  Some weeds would just, some resistant weeds, for example with the chemical one, and even  
**0:49:18-0:49:23:**  with the mechanical one, not weeds, sorry, grasses in this case, they would start settling  
**0:49:23-0:49:24:**  in.  
**0:49:24-0:49:28:**  So that would also be a problem that would need to be managed with other understory management  
**0:49:28-0:49:29:**  regimes.  
**0:49:29-0:49:32:**  Yes, yeah, yeah, that's true.  
**0:49:32-0:49:40:**  Nice, so in this case, for me it's interesting to understand why would you mow it regularly  
**0:49:40-0:49:41:**  like you did?  
**0:49:41-0:49:46:**  And you did the experiment to see that the benefits in terms of insects with letting  
**0:49:46-0:49:50:**  it grow are clear from your research.  
**0:49:50-0:49:53:**  But what about mowing it regularly?  
**0:49:53-0:49:55:**  What kind of aspects did that benefit?  
**0:49:55-0:49:57:**  Was it the competition with the trees?  
**0:49:57-0:49:58:**  What was it?  
**0:49:58-0:50:04:**  Yeah, I suppose competition with the trees, also perhaps weed suppression.  
**0:50:04-0:50:10:**  So if, yeah, if, you know, mowing for certain weeds could be helpful.  
**0:50:10-0:50:16:**  But we also wanted to kind of have a bit of a proxy for completely bare ground.  
**0:50:16-0:50:24:**  So in some agro-touristry systems, I think it is more common really in continental Europe,  
**0:50:24-0:50:31:**  they just have a bare strip below the trees, which is sometimes just herbicide and kept  
**0:50:31-0:50:33:**  as bare ground.  
**0:50:33-0:50:43:**  So having the mown understory isn't the same as that, but it's more similar to having a  
**0:50:43-0:50:46:**  bare strip below the trees.  
**0:50:46-0:50:53:**  So we wanted to kind of be able to generalize our results a bit more to that really.  
**0:50:53-0:50:57:**  So there aren't necessarily a huge amount of benefits to having it mowed regularly.  
**0:50:57-0:51:03:**  It's probably best to just let it, to mow it maybe once or twice a year, but to let  
**0:51:03-0:51:08:**  it go to flower, let it benefit the system, especially in the spring, and then during  
**0:51:08-0:51:11:**  the summer, mow it, let it go off.  
**0:51:11-0:51:17:**  Am I kind of understanding correctly some of the recommendations you would give to manage  
**0:51:17-0:51:18:**  the understory?  
**0:51:18-0:51:19:**  Yes, yeah, absolutely.  
**0:51:19-0:51:27:**  Yeah, I mean, in terms of benefits of the mown understory, we didn't really find any.  
**0:51:27-0:51:34:**  There could be benefits in certain contexts if there were certain weed problems, but we  
**0:51:34-0:51:40:**  didn't find any biodiversity benefits at all of having mown understories.  
**0:51:40-0:51:45:**  So yeah, what you said, I would agree with.  
**0:51:45-0:51:54:**  Relaxed management, some management is needed, but really keep it as low intensity as possible  
**0:51:54-0:51:55:**  is best really.  
**0:51:55-0:52:02:**  And also an important factor is not just having the flower cover, but having the vegetation  
**0:52:02-0:52:04:**  structure over the winter.  
**0:52:04-0:52:13:**  So it's ideally having some taller, tusky vegetation left over winter, because that  
**0:52:13-0:52:18:**  overwintering resource is really important for beneficial insects.  
**0:52:18-0:52:22:**  So try not to mow it too late in the year.  
**0:52:22-0:52:23:**  Okay, very interesting.  
**0:52:23-0:52:28:**  And then it would be left over winter with this kind of more 3D structure.  
**0:52:28-0:52:33:**  And then it would be mowed just before when spring kicks in, or would it just be left  
**0:52:33-0:52:39:**  and then the plants would come up in spring and then be mowed before it goes to seed?  
**0:52:39-0:52:42:**  That would be the best option?  
**0:52:42-0:52:50:**  Yeah, I suppose ideally it would be left over winter and then left through spring to come  
**0:52:50-0:52:57:**  into flower and then mown later in the summer, once or twice would be best.  
**0:52:57-0:53:10:**  That said, if it was mown early in the spring, well, really it's best to leave some refuge  
**0:53:10-0:53:11:**  really.  
**0:53:11-0:53:18:**  So something that some farmers do is to cut the outer parts of the understory and leave  
**0:53:18-0:53:19:**  the central bit.  
**0:53:19-0:53:24:**  So immediately between the tree trunks, leave that a bit taller.  
**0:53:24-0:53:29:**  Because of course, if you cut it all at the same time, then you completely obliterate  
**0:53:29-0:53:30:**  this resource for insects.  
**0:53:30-0:53:33:**  And then that has quite a big impact.  
**0:53:33-0:53:39:**  So if some refuge can be left when you do cut it, or another way is to rotationally  
**0:53:39-0:53:40:**  cut it.  
**0:53:40-0:53:46:**  So you could cut one row at one time and another row at another time like that.  
**0:53:46-0:53:55:**  So leaving some kind of refuge at all times is the ideal way to do it.  
**0:53:55-0:54:02:**  What I find quite reassuring with this is that we're not talking about some very complex  
**0:54:02-0:54:05:**  systems to implement in order to favor biodiversity.  
**0:54:05-0:54:12:**  I mean, here we're just talking about managing a tree understory.  
**0:54:12-0:54:14:**  And it's not necessarily super complex.  
**0:54:14-0:54:21:**  There is the need to establish a certain crop, I mean, to establish a certain flower mix,  
**0:54:21-0:54:26:**  or certain clover mix, or whatever the farmer decides, and then to mow it a few times possibly.  
**0:54:26-0:54:31:**  And then eventually after a few years, if it turns too much to grasses, to burn your  
**0:54:31-0:54:35:**  grasses to be tilled in and started again.  
**0:54:35-0:54:42:**  But it's something that farmers would have the experience to manage quite well.  
**0:54:42-0:54:52:**  And so my question is, is now, to what extent can a farmer reliably expect to have the same  
**0:54:52-0:54:56:**  results as you have observed in these farms that you followed?  
**0:54:56-0:55:00:**  I mean, how confident can we be that, you know, from my context in France, for example,  
**0:55:00-0:55:07:**  or in Switzerland, or somebody else in, I mean, let's try to stay in the kind of oceanic  
**0:55:07-0:55:12:**  VAS, I mean, continental Europe, let's not go to Mediterranean now, but in this kind  
**0:55:12-0:55:17:**  of area of Europe, can a farmer expect to just have the similar results?  
**0:55:17-0:55:19:**  Does the literature show certain consistency?  
**0:55:19-0:55:24:**  Yeah, so I think there's two elements here.  
**0:55:24-0:55:28:**  Firstly, there's the biodiversity element, and then there's the pests and weeds, more  
**0:55:28-0:55:31:**  specific element.  
**0:55:31-0:55:36:**  So I mean, if we start with the biodiversity, yeah, there's good evidence that Agroforestry  
**0:55:36-0:55:43:**  does quite consistently improve biodiversity compared to monoculture.  
**0:55:43-0:55:47:**  The strength of that effect will depend on the system design.  
**0:55:47-0:55:53:**  So like we've said, understory management, particularly, also what trees you're planting,  
**0:55:53-0:56:00:**  diversity of trees, the width of your crop alleys, whether it's organic or conventional.  
**0:56:00-0:56:06:**  Interesting is there's a recent study in France that found that Agroforestry systems that  
**0:56:06-0:56:13:**  were conventionally managed with pesticides, the tree rows actually acted as a sink of  
**0:56:13-0:56:17:**  beneficial insects, rather than a source.  
**0:56:17-0:56:28:**  So the organic Agroforestry systems improved predators' diversity, but it actually had  
**0:56:28-0:56:37:**  a negative effect on in the conventional systems because you're basically spraying it all with  
**0:56:37-0:56:42:**  pesticides and so that the predators are all staying in the tree rows and not really moving  
**0:56:42-0:56:44:**  out into the alleys.  
**0:56:44-0:56:45:**  Interesting.  
**0:56:45-0:56:51:**  So that does have a big impact.  
**0:56:51-0:56:53:**  And also, landscape context is very important.  
**0:56:53-0:56:59:**  So we found the strongest effects of biodiversity at Stephen Briggs' farm.  
**0:56:59-0:57:04:**  And his farm is in a very intensive agricultural landscape.  
**0:57:04-0:57:11:**  So there's very few hedgerows and trees in a wider landscape.  
**0:57:11-0:57:16:**  So we think the reason for that is because the baseline situation is much lower.  
**0:57:16-0:57:22:**  So with these arable fields, the biodiversity is quite poor because it's in such an intensive,  
**0:57:22-0:57:29:**  even though his farm is organic, the surrounding landscape has very little semi-natural habitat.  
**0:57:29-0:57:35:**  So by planting Agroforestry, there's then a bigger difference between the Agroforestry  
**0:57:35-0:57:37:**  and the arable.  
**0:57:37-0:57:40:**  Whereas in a more diverse landscape where there's already good amounts of semi-natural  
**0:57:40-0:57:49:**  habitats, like hedgerows, patches of woodland, then by planting Agroforestry, if you've already  
**0:57:49-0:57:55:**  got quite good diversity on the farm, then Agroforestry isn't going to improve it as  
**0:57:55-0:57:56:**  much, if that makes sense.  
**0:57:56-0:57:58:**  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  
**0:57:58-0:57:59:**  Very interesting.  
**0:57:59-0:58:00:**  Yeah.  
**0:58:00-0:58:06:**  Again, it helps to nuance a bit the conversation, to look at, you know, sometimes this may work,  
**0:58:06-0:58:11:**  sometimes it may be opposite, as you've just mentioned right now, which is interesting.  
**0:58:11-0:58:12:**  Yeah, yeah.  
**0:58:12-0:58:18:**  Yeah, I mean, yeah, the other thing I would say on that is the effect on, more specifically  
**0:58:18-0:58:20:**  on pests and weeds.  
**0:58:20-0:58:27:**  I've mentioned the results on that are quite nuanced, which is why we've tried to generalise  
**0:58:27-0:58:35:**  the findings and we're trying to say, well, pests which are less mobile and more generalist  
**0:58:35-0:58:40:**  and less attracted to a specific arable resource, like slugs, are probably more of a problem  
**0:58:40-0:58:44:**  in Agroforestry, as are perennial creeping weeds.  
**0:58:44-0:58:50:**  Those much more mobile pests, which are really attracted on max to arable resource, like  
**0:58:50-0:58:59:**  a pollen beetle or a cabbage stem-free beetle, are likely to be more of a problem in monoculture  
**0:58:59-0:59:01:**  arable.  
**0:59:01-0:59:08:**  So the effect that a farm will see on pests and weeds will really depend on what pest  
**0:59:08-0:59:11:**  and weed problems they have.  
**0:59:11-0:59:18:**  And if their concern is things like black grass and cabbage stem-free beetle, then Agroforestry  
**0:59:18-0:59:25:**  is likely to be beneficial for helping to control that.  
**0:59:25-0:59:32:**  Whereas if it's slugs and thistles are the main problem, then Agroforestry will provide  
**0:59:32-0:59:34:**  some challenges.  
**0:59:34-0:59:44:**  Have you found some significant, significant effect of the, on one hand, the proximity  
**0:59:44-0:59:51:**  of the Agroforestry line, so between 20 to 50 metres, for example, as well as the width  
**0:59:51-0:59:55:**  of the Agroforestry tree line, such as, you know, it's Stephen Briggs, it's three metres  
**0:59:55-1:00:01:**  wide, some other forest systems, it can be as small as one metre wide.  
**1:00:01-1:00:07:**  Are these also significant in looking at biodiversity and predator populations?  
**1:00:07-1:00:15:**  Yeah, so it's a tricky one because nobody's really tested it specifically.  
**1:00:15-1:00:21:**  But we have looked at spatial patterns of biodiversity across the alley.  
**1:00:21-1:00:28:**  And actually there's very few strong patterns, which is quite surprising.  
**1:00:28-1:00:33:**  So in other words, the species that we're finding and the abundance of those species  
**1:00:33-1:00:39:**  in the centre of the crop alleys is quite similar to the edge of the alleys.  
**1:00:39-1:00:42:**  So there's quite a big spinner over effect.  
**1:00:42-1:00:49:**  It does, the diversity of species does decline slightly into the centre of the alley, but  
**1:00:49-1:00:52:**  it's quite small effect.  
**1:00:52-1:00:55:**  And this is in 24 metre wide alleys.  
**1:00:55-1:01:02:**  So the tree varies do seem to have a big spillover.  
**1:01:02-1:01:08:**  So I mean, my expectation on that would be that if we say a 50 metre alley, which is  
**1:01:08-1:01:15:**  twice as wide as the width that we studied, that the diversity probably wouldn't be radically  
**1:01:15-1:01:21:**  different to what we find in the 24 metre wide alley based on the patterns that we've  
**1:01:21-1:01:22:**  observed.  
**1:01:22-1:01:32:**  And yeah, ultimately, I very strongly expect a 50 metre wide alley to be much more similar  
**1:01:32-1:01:37:**  to a 24 metre wide alley than it would be to a pure arable field.  
**1:01:37-1:01:45:**  So in other words, introducing diversity into your arable field will be a good thing.  
**1:01:45-1:01:53:**  Obviously the more the better, but it doesn't seem that the spacing of the tree rows is  
**1:01:53-1:01:55:**  having a huge effect.  
**1:01:55-1:01:58:**  And probably other things like the management of the understory that we've been talking  
**1:01:58-1:02:03:**  about is a more important factor I would expect anyway.  
**1:02:03-1:02:09:**  I mean, it'd be amazing if you could give us a sense of where's the research at looking  
**1:02:09-1:02:11:**  at biodiversity and agroforestry.  
**1:02:11-1:02:24:**  Are we at a place where we can be very confident about making models and making strong principles  
**1:02:24-1:02:28:**  based on the research we've managed to do?  
**1:02:28-1:02:32:**  Are we still at a kind of an immature stage?  
**1:02:32-1:02:38:**  Could you give us, maybe us and our listeners, a sense of where research is at and what are  
**1:02:38-1:02:40:**  some of the biggest problems in research?  
**1:02:40-1:02:43:**  And by problems, I just want to elaborate quickly on this.  
**1:02:43-1:02:48:**  For me, when I look at some of the research out there in agroecology or in agriculture,  
**1:02:48-1:02:53:**  many times it's on very small plots and it can be quite difficult to look at the bigger  
**1:02:53-1:02:55:**  patterns happening around.  
**1:02:55-1:03:00:**  And actually I was studying a French agronomist that was showing that when they started doing  
**1:03:00-1:03:04:**  similar studies but on a much bigger plots, and by bigger plots they were looking at two  
**1:03:04-1:03:09:**  passages with a sprayer for the whole length of the field.  
**1:03:09-1:03:13:**  So they were looking at sometimes one hectare at a time, BS one hectare next to that.  
**1:03:13-1:03:16:**  And they started to see completely different patterns.  
**1:03:16-1:03:22:**  And that's, for reference, that's Francis Bouquet, who's just taken out a book that's  
**1:03:22-1:03:24:**  really, really interesting.  
**1:03:24-1:03:31:**  It's in French though, but he's got some interesting thoughts and he's done some interesting research  
**1:03:31-1:03:32:**  on that.  
**1:03:32-1:03:39:**  And looking at being critical and self-critical as well of research, it would be great to  
**1:03:39-1:03:41:**  delve a bit into that.  
**1:03:41-1:03:45:**  Yeah, it's a really important point actually.  
**1:03:45-1:03:54:**  And yeah, I mean, the challenge with agroforestry is we want to study it at realistic scales,  
**1:03:54-1:03:58:**  but we also want enough replication that we can be confident in the results.  
**1:03:58-1:04:01:**  And it's very difficult to achieve both.  
**1:04:01-1:04:06:**  So some studies of agroforestry have looked at plot scale agroforestry and then have had  
**1:04:06-1:04:07:**  lots of replicates.  
**1:04:07-1:04:14:**  So the results are then quite robust, but they're also perhaps not necessarily realistic  
**1:04:14-1:04:17:**  of field conditions.  
**1:04:17-1:04:25:**  Whereas something like my study, I've been looking at working farms, field scale farms.  
**1:04:25-1:04:30:**  And so it's realistic of field scale working farm conditions, but I've only got three sites  
**1:04:30-1:04:38:**  and really to have a really high degree of confidence in the results, most ecology studies  
**1:04:38-1:04:43:**  try to use kind of 15 or 20 sites at least.  
**1:04:43-1:04:48:**  If we were looking at something like flammable strips, for example.  
**1:04:48-1:04:54:**  But the sites just aren't available at the moment in terms of looking at agroforestry.  
**1:04:54-1:04:57:**  So it does need to be tested more.  
**1:04:57-1:05:06:**  But there are also where we're finding consistent results among sites, then we can be reasonably  
**1:05:06-1:05:07:**  confident.  
**1:05:07-1:05:13:**  And also if there's a mechanism to explain that result, then we can be reasonably confident  
**1:05:13-1:05:19:**  that that's a reliable result.  
**1:05:19-1:05:28:**  So I think in terms of future research, something that I think is important is to look at things  
**1:05:28-1:05:37:**  like predation rates of pests and crop damage by pests, which I mentioned a little bit about  
**1:05:37-1:05:40:**  in terms of the apples above the flower strips.  
**1:05:40-1:05:45:**  It would be interesting to look at agroforestry and to look at whether predation rates of  
**1:05:45-1:05:54:**  pests are higher in agroforestry than monocultures and whether crop damage can be reduced in  
**1:05:54-1:05:56:**  agroforestry.  
**1:05:56-1:05:57:**  Very interesting.  
**1:05:57-1:06:08:**  Okay, well, thank you so much, Tom, for the first introduction to biodiversity and agroforest

**1:06:19-1:06:24:**  This was definitely a very interesting interview delving into the details of agroforestry,  
**1:06:24-1:06:28:**  which we hope we'll be doing more in the future with other researchers.  
**1:06:28-1:06:32:**  Let us know if there's some specific topics or researchers that you want us to get into,  
**1:06:32-1:06:38:**  and we can find out more about it and we can try to organize an interview.

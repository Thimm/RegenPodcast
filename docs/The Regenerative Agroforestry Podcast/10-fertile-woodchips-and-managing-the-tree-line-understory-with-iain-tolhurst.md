### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 23 Nov 2020 20:13:31)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:47:**  Hi everyone and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:49:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:49-0:00:52:**  Today we have the pleasure of interviewing Ian Tolhurst.  
**0:00:52-0:00:56:**  He's a vegetable grower and he decided to integrate trees into his operation five years  
**0:00:56-0:00:57:**  ago.  
**0:00:57-0:01:02:**  This episode will be interesting to everyone that wants to do the same and to vegetable  
**0:01:02-0:01:08:**  growers in general, but there are a few themes that will interest anyone interested in agroforestry.  
**0:01:08-0:01:10:**  Those are for example, woodchips.  
**0:01:10-0:01:16:**  Ian uses woodchips as the sole source of fertility for his vegetables.  
**0:01:16-0:01:22:**  And of course, biomass and woodchips are huge outputs of mature agroforestry systems and  
**0:01:22-0:01:28:**  understanding the potential that lies with them and how to use them in our different  
**0:01:28-0:01:31:**  productions is absolutely crucial.  
**0:01:31-0:01:34:**  And Ian gives us really interesting information in that respect.  
**0:01:34-0:01:39:**  The other element is that they've been running trials on planting the understory.  
**0:01:39-0:01:44:**  By that I mean the space in the tree lines and trying to utilize that space as better  
**0:01:44-0:01:45:**  as possible.  
**0:01:45-0:01:49:**  That's a big opportunity and a recurring theme in agroforestry, but it does come with some  
**0:01:49-0:01:54:**  challenges and considerations and Ian does a great job at talking about that and really  
**0:01:54-0:02:00:**  giving us a nuanced view on that opportunity and the conditions that must be present for  
**0:02:00-0:02:02:**  us to be planting these plants there.  
**0:02:02-0:02:03:**  Enjoy the interview.  
**0:02:03-0:02:05:**  Hi, Ian, and welcome to the podcast.  
**0:02:05-0:02:06:**  Hello, Etienne.  
**0:02:06-0:02:10:**  Yes, and thank you very much for your invitation.  
**0:02:10-0:02:11:**  You're welcome.  
**0:02:11-0:02:14:**  It's a pleasure and we have so many interesting things to discuss with you.  
**0:02:14-0:02:19:**  Maybe we could just kick things off by having a bit of a history of the farm and an overview  
**0:02:19-0:02:21:**  of your different productions.  
**0:02:21-0:02:22:**  Yes.  
**0:02:22-0:02:28:**  I've been an organic farmer now for more than 40 years, in fact, since 1976.  
**0:02:28-0:02:32:**  I've been on this particular farm for 33 years.  
**0:02:32-0:02:37:**  It's quite a small farm with just over 8 hectares in total.  
**0:02:37-0:02:42:**  We're situated in the south of the UK, not terribly far from Oxford, just to the south  
**0:02:42-0:02:43:**  of Oxford.  
**0:02:43-0:02:44:**  In fact, we're very close.  
**0:02:44-0:02:46:**  In fact, we can actually see the River Thames.  
**0:02:46-0:02:54:**  We grow a very wide range of organic vegetables and we are growing probably around more than  
**0:02:54-0:02:57:**  100 different types of vegetable in total.  
**0:02:57-0:03:00:**  That is not varieties, but that's types of vegetable.  
**0:03:00-0:03:05:**  Over the course of a year, we do around 300 separate zones and plantings.  
**0:03:05-0:03:06:**  We're very diverse.  
**0:03:06-0:03:11:**  We have field vegetables, we have garden vegetables, and we have tunnel and greenhouse production.  
**0:03:11-0:03:14:**  We produce all our own plants.  
**0:03:14-0:03:16:**  We are a stock-free organic farm.  
**0:03:16-0:03:18:**  That means that we are, for want of a better word, we are a vegan farm.  
**0:03:18-0:03:20:**  We don't use any animal inputs at all.  
**0:03:20-0:03:25:**  We don't use any manure or any product from livestock at all on the farm.  
**0:03:25-0:03:32:**  The farm is run predominantly on a rotational system with green manures, with supplementation  
**0:03:32-0:03:38:**  from ram yield chip wood, which we've been experimenting with in the last five, six years,  
**0:03:38-0:03:41:**  and also composted wood chip, which comes from local sources.  
**0:03:41-0:03:45:**  The farm is very much a self-contained unit.  
**0:03:45-0:03:51:**  We're not dependent on very much at all coming into the farm from outside in order to support  
**0:03:51-0:03:52:**  long-term fertility.  
**0:03:52-0:03:54:**  And we're cropping the whole year round.  
**0:03:54-0:03:55:**  We don't stop at all.  
**0:03:55-0:03:57:**  We crop every week of the year.  
**0:03:57-0:04:02:**  In fact, we're harvesting four days out of every week during the year.  
**0:04:02-0:04:05:**  Most of what we sell is sold very locally.  
**0:04:05-0:04:13:**  In fact, around 90% of our entire output is sold within a 10, 15-kilometer radius of the  
**0:04:13-0:04:14:**  farm.  
**0:04:14-0:04:19:**  In fact, half of that total is sold direct from the farm through our farm shop, which  
**0:04:19-0:04:24:**  has become very busy since the pandemic started.  
**0:04:24-0:04:27:**  So that's sort of general overview of the farm.  
**0:04:27-0:04:29:**  The farm is very much geared towards biodiversity.  
**0:04:29-0:04:35:**  And everything we do on the farm is really about promoting, encouraging, and working  
**0:04:35-0:04:36:**  with biodiversity.  
**0:04:36-0:04:42:**  So we like to think of the farm really as producing biodiversity as its main output.  
**0:04:42-0:04:47:**  But as a byproduct of that biodiversity, we are growing vegetables and fruit.  
**0:04:47-0:04:50:**  And we produce very good yields.  
**0:04:50-0:04:55:**  We have over 120, 140 tons of vegetables each year.  
**0:04:55-0:04:59:**  So we're quite confident this is a system which does work in the real world.  
**0:04:59-0:05:01:**  We are a fully commercial farm.  
**0:05:01-0:05:03:**  We have no support outside of the farm at all.  
**0:05:03-0:05:08:**  We rely totally on the farm income to support the farm and all the people that work on the  
**0:05:08-0:05:09:**  farm.  
**0:05:09-0:05:13:**  So agroforestry is something we've really only introduced relatively recently in the  
**0:05:13-0:05:15:**  last five or six years.  
**0:05:15-0:05:17:**  Although we've always been planting trees.  
**0:05:17-0:05:22:**  But we've only really made a concerted effort to establish agroforestry in the last five  
**0:05:22-0:05:23:**  years.  
**0:05:23-0:05:24:**  Yeah.  
**0:05:24-0:05:30:**  And before we go into agroforestry specifically, could you give us a bit more information on  
**0:05:30-0:05:33:**  what soil you have and your climate?  
**0:05:33-0:05:34:**  Right.  
**0:05:34-0:05:36:**  So our climate is maritime.  
**0:05:36-0:05:38:**  So we get quite a lot of rain.  
**0:05:38-0:05:41:**  Although actually it's a fairly dry part of the country.  
**0:05:41-0:05:45:**  Our annual rainfall is around 520 millimetres a year.  
**0:05:45-0:05:50:**  The temperature ranges from sort of in the depths of winter.  
**0:05:50-0:05:53:**  We may get down as low as minus 10 for a week or two.  
**0:05:53-0:05:57:**  In the summer, we rarely get above plus 30.  
**0:05:57-0:06:00:**  The last three or four winters have been very mild.  
**0:06:00-0:06:02:**  We haven't really had very much frost at all.  
**0:06:02-0:06:05:**  So it's become a very mild climate.  
**0:06:05-0:06:08:**  And we don't really get very much in the way of snow.  
**0:06:08-0:06:11:**  So in England means that we do get damp conditions.  
**0:06:11-0:06:14:**  Although it's not particularly wet, it is damp.  
**0:06:14-0:06:20:**  And we are subject to some pretty strong winds as well, which can be quite a problem at times.  
**0:06:20-0:06:23:**  The soil type is a clay loam.  
**0:06:23-0:06:25:**  It's not considered ideal for horticulture.  
**0:06:25-0:06:33:**  It's really, its suitability really would be more towards grassland and tree cover.  
**0:06:33-0:06:38:**  It's grade three bee land, which puts it as fairly low quality.  
**0:06:38-0:06:39:**  It's quite thin.  
**0:06:39-0:06:41:**  It's over chalk and stone.  
**0:06:41-0:06:47:**  Our total topsoil depth is in the range of up to around 200 millimetres.  
**0:06:47-0:06:49:**  So it's pretty shallow.  
**0:06:49-0:06:54:**  It tends to get quite dry in the summer because of our rainfall is usually quite low.  
**0:06:54-0:06:55:**  It's very stony.  
**0:06:55-0:06:59:**  We have more than 40% stone over 10 millimetres.  
**0:06:59-0:07:01:**  So it does tend to dry very quickly.  
**0:07:01-0:07:07:**  So it's not considered ideal for horticulture, although we have made it very fertile.  
**0:07:07-0:07:10:**  It was quite poor when we came here, but it's now producing really well.  
**0:07:10-0:07:15:**  And it, I think, goes to show that even poor quality land could be made fertile.  
**0:07:15-0:07:17:**  Yeah, that's fascinating.  
**0:07:17-0:07:22:**  And I'm sure we'll get an understanding of how you did that through the episode.  
**0:07:22-0:07:28:**  Maybe you want to explain to us how you came to agroforestry, why you felt the need to  
**0:07:28-0:07:31:**  experiment with that and how that occurred.  
**0:07:31-0:07:32:**  Yes, that's an interesting question.  
**0:07:32-0:07:38:**  It's something I've been thinking about for quite some time and planting trees, particularly  
**0:07:38-0:07:42:**  in the middle of a field where you're growing vegetables is something you do need to think  
**0:07:42-0:07:46:**  about because there are various implications, of course.  
**0:07:46-0:07:48:**  I've always been a great lover of trees.  
**0:07:48-0:07:49:**  I've always planted trees.  
**0:07:49-0:07:53:**  You know, we've won the few farms anywhere in the area that's actually put new hedges  
**0:07:53-0:07:54:**  in.  
**0:07:54-0:07:57:**  So we've actually created hedges and shelter belts way back in the past.  
**0:07:57-0:08:02:**  We've got some hedges and shelter belts now, which are over 33 years old and very productive.  
**0:08:02-0:08:08:**  But to actually divide the field up into smaller units was something which did take quite a  
**0:08:08-0:08:10:**  lot of thinking.  
**0:08:10-0:08:16:**  I wanted to, because I've always been passionate about trees, I wanted to try and see where  
**0:08:16-0:08:25:**  we could improve the biodiversity of the field as one reason, but also to improve the shelter  
**0:08:25-0:08:26:**  of the field.  
**0:08:26-0:08:31:**  Trees really don't like growing in windy places and we are in a fairly windy part of the country  
**0:08:31-0:08:35:**  and we have had quite a bit of damage from the past as a result of wind.  
**0:08:35-0:08:41:**  So one of the trying reasons, I suppose, really was to try and see if we could improve the  
**0:08:41-0:08:44:**  shelter of the field in order to create a microclimate.  
**0:08:44-0:08:48:**  You know, we can see how well it works by hedges, but once you get away from the haze,  
**0:08:48-0:08:51:**  the field becomes increasingly more open.  
**0:08:51-0:08:55:**  And some crops, particularly things like squash, are very sensitive to wind.  
**0:08:55-0:08:59:**  So it was really about trying to improve the shelter of the field.  
**0:08:59-0:09:03:**  But the biodiversity aspects were very important too.  
**0:09:03-0:09:10:**  And I just felt there had to be a unison between trees and crops.  
**0:09:10-0:09:16:**  In this country we've had, agriculture has been split up into sort of sections.  
**0:09:16-0:09:21:**  You've got somebody doing livestock somewhere, somebody else doing arable somewhere, somebody  
**0:09:21-0:09:24:**  else doing vegetable crops, someone else doing trees.  
**0:09:24-0:09:26:**  They don't seem to mix up.  
**0:09:26-0:09:30:**  They're all kept separate and not part and parcel of the whole system.  
**0:09:30-0:09:36:**  So we really wanted to bring trees in and make them integral to the whole farming system.  
**0:09:36-0:09:39:**  And that's really where we sort of got to.  
**0:09:39-0:09:45:**  And it took some while really to decide, A, how far apart we're going to plant the trees,  
**0:09:45-0:09:51:**  B, what species we're going to use, and C, how we were going to manage them long term.  
**0:09:51-0:09:55:**  Because at the back of my mind there's sort of slightly nagging fear that we're taking  
**0:09:55-0:09:59:**  land out of vegetable production, putting it into trees, which are not going to be as  
**0:09:59-0:10:05:**  economically viable as the land upon which they have been growing in the past where we've  
**0:10:05-0:10:08:**  had quite high value vegetables.  
**0:10:08-0:10:14:**  So we had to think about the economic implications of what we do.  
**0:10:14-0:10:20:**  The fact that we got a very well supported grant from the Woodland Trust in order to  
**0:10:20-0:10:26:**  pay for trees and also the guards and the stakes that went with the trees, I think was  
**0:10:26-0:10:27:**  the deciding factor.  
**0:10:27-0:10:31:**  If we'd had to pay for that out of the farm income, I think there's a possibility we may  
**0:10:31-0:10:32:**  not have done it.  
**0:10:32-0:10:38:**  I think it was the support from the Woodland Trust which probably really drove the things  
**0:10:38-0:10:45:**  forward and was the final sort of decision maker for us as a commercial farm.  
**0:10:45-0:10:49:**  Did you receive any technical support as well beyond the financial aspect?  
**0:10:49-0:10:50:**  Yes.  
**0:10:50-0:10:52:**  The Woodland Trust were very helpful in that sense.  
**0:10:52-0:10:57:**  I didn't feel we needed huge amounts of technical support because I've had a history of planting  
**0:10:57-0:11:01:**  trees over many decades so we're quite used to growing trees.  
**0:11:01-0:11:06:**  But nevertheless it was helpful, it was useful to have their support.  
**0:11:06-0:11:11:**  And I think for many farms this would be absolutely essential because a lot of people have no  
**0:11:11-0:11:13:**  experience at all of growing trees.  
**0:11:13-0:11:15:**  It's often something they've never ever done.  
**0:11:15-0:11:19:**  So I think having technical support is really critical.  
**0:11:19-0:11:25:**  So if it's something that's going to encourage more farmers then financial support, particularly  
**0:11:25-0:11:31:**  in the cost of the trees and technical support, I think is absolutely essential in order to  
**0:11:31-0:11:36:**  make it work properly and also in order to guarantee the success of what's being done.  
**0:11:36-0:11:42:**  But you had that experience and so which tree species for example did you choose and for  
**0:11:42-0:11:43:**  what reasons?  
**0:11:43-0:11:44:**  Right.  
**0:11:44-0:11:47:**  What we actually wanted was indigenous trees.  
**0:11:47-0:11:52:**  We didn't want to introduce non-indigenous species for various reasons but primarily  
**0:11:52-0:11:57:**  because there's a feeling that indigenous species will benefit biodiversity more.  
**0:11:57-0:12:00:**  That's not always true but it tends to be the case.  
**0:12:00-0:12:09:**  And also we didn't want to radically change the landscape with non-native material.  
**0:12:09-0:12:14:**  So we went for Cherry which has grown very widely around here.  
**0:12:14-0:12:16:**  It's one of the common trees.  
**0:12:16-0:12:25:**  It's older, Birch, Oak, White Bean and what else, there's one or two others.  
**0:12:25-0:12:27:**  I'm just trying to think now what else we have.  
**0:12:27-0:12:29:**  Oh, Maple, Field Maple.  
**0:12:29-0:12:37:**  So they are trees which we would see in this environment and also trees which we do understand  
**0:12:37-0:12:38:**  and know quite well.  
**0:12:38-0:12:42:**  And they have a range of diverse habitats which they create.  
**0:12:42-0:12:44:**  So the idea was to mix these up.  
**0:12:44-0:12:46:**  In that mix of trees we also planted apples.  
**0:12:46-0:12:52:**  So we have what we refer to as a low density apple plantation.  
**0:12:52-0:13:00:**  So we have apples every 15 metres and in between the apples we have these range of trees.  
**0:13:00-0:13:06:**  The Oak trees are primarily going to be managed for wood, for timber in the long term.  
**0:13:06-0:13:10:**  So it's a very long term view so it won't be in my life, it won't be beyond my lifetime.  
**0:13:10-0:13:15:**  And they'll be managed primarily as individual trees.  
**0:13:15-0:13:18:**  And the other trees we're going to manage in a variety of different ways.  
**0:13:18-0:13:22:**  So we were very keen to have purely just indigenous species.  
**0:13:22-0:13:29:**  In fact Woodland Trust I don't think would actually grant aid any trees unless they were  
**0:13:29-0:13:30:**  indigenous.  
**0:13:30-0:13:32:**  I think they have a policy of only supporting indigenous trees.  
**0:13:32-0:13:36:**  So perhaps that was a deciding factor as well.  
**0:13:36-0:13:40:**  But they were willing to fund some productive trees such as apples as well.  
**0:13:40-0:13:42:**  Or is that something that you just added on top?  
**0:13:42-0:13:47:**  They were quite happy to fund the apples and I think they have done in one or two other  
**0:13:47-0:13:48:**  situations as well.  
**0:13:48-0:13:55:**  I think partly because they saw our farm as being a good example and they want to be able  
**0:13:55-0:13:56:**  to take people too.  
**0:13:56-0:13:59:**  Because we are a well known farm we get widely visited by people from all over the world.  
**0:13:59-0:14:05:**  So I think from their point of view it was probably a promotional possibility for them.  
**0:14:05-0:14:06:**  Which is why they allowed us to plant apples.  
**0:14:06-0:14:09:**  But I think they have also done it on other farms.  
**0:14:09-0:14:12:**  Because the density is quite low I think it was acceptable.  
**0:14:12-0:14:16:**  I think if we decided to plant only apples I think, well I'm pretty sure they would have  
**0:14:16-0:14:18:**  said no we can't support that.  
**0:14:18-0:14:20:**  Which I think is probably fair enough.  
**0:14:20-0:14:23:**  So they did put a lot of money into this.  
**0:14:23-0:14:28:**  I think the total budget over a couple of years because we had to put additional guards  
**0:14:28-0:14:30:**  around the apple trees because of deer problems.  
**0:14:30-0:14:36:**  I think the total budget came to probably in excess of 3,000 euros.  
**0:14:36-0:14:40:**  So it was a pretty significant amount of money they put in.  
**0:14:40-0:14:47:**  But the 3,000 euros is the cost of the trees and then you add your labour on top of that?  
**0:14:47-0:14:49:**  The labour we had to supply ourselves.  
**0:14:49-0:14:51:**  They weren't going to pay labour and that was ok with us.  
**0:14:51-0:14:54:**  I think we accepted that right from the start.  
**0:14:54-0:14:56:**  We didn't really expect to get the labour.  
**0:14:56-0:14:59:**  And then we paid for them and something we did ourselves.  
**0:14:59-0:15:02:**  We had a few volunteers for a few days they also helped.  
**0:15:02-0:15:04:**  So it wasn't too much of a problem.  
**0:15:04-0:15:11:**  Although the ongoing maintenance cost is considerably higher than perhaps I'd thought about initially  
**0:15:11-0:15:15:**  and that's something we still got to deal with.  
**0:15:15-0:15:19:**  But the actual investment cost for us, if it's just labour, was quite deceptible.  
**0:15:19-0:15:22:**  We were happy to do that.  
**0:15:22-0:15:29:**  And then everything to do with tree guards or potential staking for some trees, mulch,  
**0:15:29-0:15:33:**  is that something that you brought or was there funding for that?  
**0:15:33-0:15:36:**  No they funded the tree guards and the stakes.  
**0:15:36-0:15:40:**  The mulch which we put down for weed control, we did that ourselves.  
**0:15:40-0:15:45:**  The material is virtually free but the labour we had to pay for and the transport obviously.  
**0:15:45-0:15:50:**  But they supplied all the fixed parts of the project.  
**0:15:50-0:15:53:**  There's a lot of things I want to come back to in what you said but just to get this kind  
**0:15:53-0:15:57:**  of clear image of your tree systems.  
**0:15:57-0:16:02:**  So we have an apple tree every 15 meters with some wild trees in between.  
**0:16:02-0:16:06:**  And then how much space do you have between each tree line for your vegetable production?  
**0:16:06-0:16:11:**  Right, ok so the apple trees are at 15, that's one five meters apart.  
**0:16:11-0:16:16:**  Then there's additional trees between those which are at 1.5 meters apart.  
**0:16:16-0:16:20:**  And then the actual row, the tree line, we refer to it as a tree line, the various tree  
**0:16:20-0:16:23:**  lines, there's actually six in the whole field.  
**0:16:23-0:16:29:**  The field is 7 hectares, no beg your pardon, the field is 2.5 hectares.  
**0:16:29-0:16:35:**  So we've divided that up into six blocks and between the tree lines, from the centre to  
**0:16:35-0:16:37:**  the centre we have 23 meters.  
**0:16:37-0:16:42:**  And the reason I came up with 23 meters, it sounds like an odd figure, why not 20, why  
**0:16:42-0:16:50:**  not 25, 23 meters happens to fit my irrigation system which is a large broom sprinkler.  
**0:16:50-0:16:54:**  So for us it was quite an important consideration.  
**0:16:54-0:16:59:**  We do use irrigation quite extensively in the summer because we are in a fairly dry  
**0:16:59-0:17:01:**  part of the country on the dry soil.  
**0:17:01-0:17:08:**  So this was the main criteria really for tree line spacing was really to do with the access  
**0:17:08-0:17:10:**  for irrigation.  
**0:17:10-0:17:16:**  And then between the trees we have vegetables growing as normally and we can fit 28 rows  
**0:17:16-0:17:17:**  in there.  
**0:17:17-0:17:22:**  And 28 rows also is quite a convenient figure for us because we tend to do things in multiples  
**0:17:22-0:17:27:**  of four or eight so that kind of works quite well too.  
**0:17:27-0:17:33:**  So we wouldn't want to go really much closer because I think the risk of losing too much  
**0:17:33-0:17:36:**  land is too great.  
**0:17:36-0:17:40:**  And we wouldn't want to go too much further apart given that we are looking at trees in  
**0:17:40-0:17:46:**  terms of improving biodiversity and shelter for winds.  
**0:17:46-0:17:47:**  I'm quite happy with the spacing.  
**0:17:47-0:17:50:**  We've had five years of trials with it now.  
**0:17:50-0:17:51:**  It seems to work ok.  
**0:17:51-0:17:56:**  It's looking very nice now because the trees are quite well established.  
**0:17:56-0:18:00:**  We've got autumn colours there this year which is beautiful.  
**0:18:00-0:18:02:**  Cherry are fantastic in the autumn.  
**0:18:02-0:18:05:**  So it kind of looks right for the size of the field.  
**0:18:05-0:18:11:**  The field is almost a perfect square which is very convenient.  
**0:18:11-0:18:15:**  It has a very slight gradual slope to the south which is also incredibly convenient  
**0:18:15-0:18:17:**  for vegetable growing.  
**0:18:17-0:18:23:**  So we have the trees running north south which I think for us is pretty essential.  
**0:18:23-0:18:26:**  I would probably not have done this if it had been east west because the shading effect  
**0:18:26-0:18:27:**  would be too great.  
**0:18:27-0:18:31:**  It's quite convenient and the rows are long enough to be sensible.  
**0:18:31-0:18:33:**  They are 150 metres long.  
**0:18:33-0:18:37:**  We would have liked them longer but that's the size of the field.  
**0:18:37-0:18:44:**  So the idea of having very long narrow cropping areas is actually quite conducive to use of  
**0:18:44-0:18:45:**  machinery.  
**0:18:45-0:18:48:**  Do the trees get in the way of the sprinklers?  
**0:18:48-0:18:52:**  I was just wondering how the trees grow if they might bother you in some way with that  
**0:18:52-0:18:53:**  aspect.  
**0:18:53-0:18:58:**  No, the irrigation system is mobile so it's a boom sprayer which pulls itself along.  
**0:18:58-0:19:03:**  The boom sprayer which is 20 metres wide fits in the middle between the trees.  
**0:19:03-0:19:09:**  If you've got trees at 23 metres the boom sprayer is 12 metres in the middle and covers  
**0:19:09-0:19:10:**  the whole plot.  
**0:19:10-0:19:13:**  And the trees get a little bit of watering on the edge.  
**0:19:13-0:19:17:**  They don't get full irrigation but they get some irrigation.  
**0:19:17-0:19:18:**  What are the outcomes?  
**0:19:18-0:19:25:**  Because you said that mainly you were doing this for wind and biodiversity.  
**0:19:25-0:19:29:**  Five years on, are trees big enough that you're starting to see some outcomes?  
**0:19:29-0:19:31:**  Or how do you feel about that?  
**0:19:31-0:19:34:**  Are you a bit disappointed or are they growing nicely?  
**0:19:34-0:19:35:**  Very well.  
**0:19:35-0:19:37:**  This is classic tree country.  
**0:19:37-0:19:39:**  It's not difficult growing trees here.  
**0:19:39-0:19:43:**  If you turn your back on land within 10 years it's growing trees.  
**0:19:43-0:19:45:**  It's that sort of thing.  
**0:19:45-0:19:48:**  And given our climate, trees grow remarkably well in this climate.  
**0:19:48-0:19:49:**  They really do.  
**0:19:49-0:19:51:**  It's the right soil type for trees.  
**0:19:51-0:19:53:**  So in terms of being good for trees it's perfect.  
**0:19:53-0:19:55:**  For trees it couldn't be better.  
**0:19:55-0:19:59:**  In fact, the irrigation also helps.  
**0:19:59-0:20:01:**  In terms of outputs, we are getting some outputs.  
**0:20:01-0:20:04:**  This year we had the first proper apple crop.  
**0:20:04-0:20:05:**  It wasn't huge.  
**0:20:05-0:20:07:**  It was quite modest.  
**0:20:07-0:20:12:**  It only took me half a day to pick it.  
**0:20:12-0:20:16:**  In total we have 60 apple trees.  
**0:20:16-0:20:21:**  I harvested around 120 kilograms of apples.  
**0:20:21-0:20:24:**  So it's actually really quite a small amount.  
**0:20:24-0:20:27:**  Some trees didn't produce hardly at all because we had quite a late frost.  
**0:20:27-0:20:28:**  We did some damage.  
**0:20:28-0:20:30:**  So we lost some due to weather.  
**0:20:30-0:20:31:**  That's normal.  
**0:20:31-0:20:32:**  We expect that.  
**0:20:32-0:20:37:**  Because there's a range of varieties it does give us some resilience to extreme weather.  
**0:20:37-0:20:43:**  So the ones that flowered early escaped the late frost and produced fruit.  
**0:20:43-0:20:46:**  This may happen from time to time when we are subject to late frost here.  
**0:20:46-0:20:49:**  It's quite a frosty part of the country.  
**0:20:49-0:20:51:**  But we did have an output.  
**0:20:51-0:20:54:**  Next year it would be much better, probably.  
**0:20:54-0:21:00:**  We're also getting a little bit of leaf fall now onto the soil, which is also beneficial.  
**0:21:00-0:21:01:**  Leaves are incredibly useful.  
**0:21:01-0:21:02:**  They've improved the tirth.  
**0:21:02-0:21:05:**  So we've got a little bit of that along the edges.  
**0:21:05-0:21:11:**  We also have, under the tree lines, we've also experimented with trying to integrate  
**0:21:11-0:21:13:**  other perennial crops.  
**0:21:13-0:21:17:**  So within two of the tree lines we have daffodil bulbs we've planted.  
**0:21:17-0:21:23:**  We planted 10,000 mixed daffodils when we did the trees some five or six years ago.  
**0:21:23-0:21:24:**  So we are getting a crop for those.  
**0:21:24-0:21:26:**  We picked those in the spring.  
**0:21:26-0:21:27:**  They come quite early.  
**0:21:27-0:21:29:**  They're between February and April.  
**0:21:29-0:21:30:**  They're a range of varieties.  
**0:21:30-0:21:31:**  So we get some daffodils.  
**0:21:31-0:21:35:**  Daffodils are not particularly high value crops.  
**0:21:35-0:21:36:**  In fact, they're quite low value crops.  
**0:21:36-0:21:40:**  But it does mean that we've got something nice to put into our farm shop so it helps  
**0:21:40-0:21:42:**  to sell other things.  
**0:21:42-0:21:46:**  It's difficult to put a direct value on it, but it does have a value.  
**0:21:46-0:21:49:**  We've also had rhubarb under one of the tree lines.  
**0:21:49-0:21:54:**  And that sort of worked OK for two or three years, but it's not working so well now, primarily  
**0:21:54-0:21:59:**  because we have an inherent disease in the field, which we took on when we took the field,  
**0:21:59-0:22:04:**  which is versosilnium wilt, which I didn't realize at the time, but rhubarb suffers quite  
**0:22:04-0:22:05:**  badly from wilt.  
**0:22:05-0:22:08:**  So that is gradually dying out.  
**0:22:08-0:22:14:**  Another crop we tried also not successful was globe artichokes, which also happened  
**0:22:14-0:22:18:**  to suffer from versosilnium wilt, which is something else I didn't realize.  
**0:22:18-0:22:21:**  You learn these things as you go along.  
**0:22:21-0:22:26:**  Knowing what I know now, it would have been a different scenario.  
**0:22:26-0:22:32:**  And we have another tree line where we have perennial flowers, which are herbaceous flowers,  
**0:22:32-0:22:39:**  which we raised specially with the idea to allow them to be picked for decoration and  
**0:22:39-0:22:42:**  for sales in the shop.  
**0:22:42-0:22:43:**  Some of those have worked quite well.  
**0:22:43-0:22:47:**  In fact, we have only just finished picking some of those a few weeks ago.  
**0:22:47-0:22:52:**  So our attempts at additional crops between the tree lines, some have been quite successful,  
**0:22:52-0:22:54:**  others not at all.  
**0:22:54-0:22:57:**  And I think with the experience we got, we would have perhaps done things differently  
**0:22:57-0:22:58:**  in that sense.  
**0:22:58-0:23:00:**  What would you have done differently?  
**0:23:00-0:23:06:**  Well, we wouldn't have planted the rhubarb, we wouldn't have planted the artichokes.  
**0:23:06-0:23:11:**  Or if we had, we would have perhaps done some biofumigation because we can use a green manure  
**0:23:11-0:23:13:**  for reducing the problem of this disease.  
**0:23:13-0:23:15:**  However, that would only work for a few years.  
**0:23:15-0:23:18:**  Eventually, the disease would gradually spread in from surrounding areas.  
**0:23:18-0:23:20:**  So it wouldn't be a long term solution.  
**0:23:20-0:23:24:**  So I think knowing what I know now, we would not have done rhubarb, we would not have done  
**0:23:24-0:23:25:**  artichokes.  
**0:23:25-0:23:28:**  We would have saved ourselves a lot of work and quite a bit of money as well.  
**0:23:28-0:23:32:**  So that's something we've learnt as part of the experience.  
**0:23:32-0:23:37:**  Growing crops underneath the trees is potentially problematical.  
**0:23:37-0:23:39:**  There are things which will work.  
**0:23:39-0:23:43:**  I mean, if we hadn't had a verticillium, the rhubarb and the artichokes would have worked  
**0:23:43-0:23:47:**  quite well for quite some years because they don't mind partial shade.  
**0:23:47-0:23:52:**  I do know people trying things like blackcurrants and raspberries, gooseberries, and yes, they  
**0:23:52-0:23:57:**  can be made to work, but it really increases the maintenance value.  
**0:23:57-0:24:01:**  And also these crops are not popular crops to be grown in UK.  
**0:24:01-0:24:03:**  They're very expensive to pick.  
**0:24:03-0:24:06:**  We have serious labour shortages in agriculture in UK.  
**0:24:06-0:24:09:**  It's even worse now because of the Brexit situation.  
**0:24:09-0:24:13:**  So to find people to pick these crops would be really difficult and they often really  
**0:24:13-0:24:18:**  don't pay at all because things like blackcurrants, people just do not buy blackcurrants.  
**0:24:18-0:24:21:**  They buy frozen blackcurrants and that's the only time they buy them.  
**0:24:21-0:24:24:**  Well, we're not really in the business of doing that sort of product.  
**0:24:24-0:24:30:**  So there are difficulties with finding alternative crops to grow underneath trees.  
**0:24:30-0:24:34:**  Crops which will grow, but whether they're economically viable, whether they're suitable  
**0:24:34-0:24:36:**  for marketing is another question.  
**0:24:36-0:24:42:**  So I think we're now at a stage where within the six tree lines, we have two which are  
**0:24:42-0:24:46:**  still producing the flowers and will do for probably quite some time, but the others have  
**0:24:46-0:24:49:**  more or less died out apart from the odd flowers.  
**0:24:49-0:24:54:**  We've kind of let them go back to nature and they're just growing a mixed vegetation.  
**0:24:54-0:24:56:**  Which in itself is incredibly valuable.  
**0:24:56-0:25:02:**  It contains a huge biodiversity resource and we've had surveys done of flora and fauna  
**0:25:02-0:25:07:**  in the field and we've got something like over 60 different wildflowers growing there.  
**0:25:07-0:25:10:**  So it's been very successful in that sense.  
**0:25:10-0:25:15:**  So one of the outputs really is the biodiversity and this is something we have been measuring.  
**0:25:15-0:25:20:**  There's been quite extensive measuring done on our biodiversity and at the end of the  
**0:25:20-0:25:26:**  day that was one of the original motivations for doing the agroforestry was to increase  
**0:25:26-0:25:31:**  biodiversity and that we are seeing quite obvious signs of that happening.  
**0:25:31-0:25:35:**  Bird life has increased quite dramatically because there's more places for birds to hang  
**0:25:35-0:25:39:**  out and that's helping to control things like voles.  
**0:25:39-0:25:44:**  We have a very high population, potentially high population of voles in the ground, but  
**0:25:44-0:25:48:**  we also have a very high population of predator birds, raptors.  
**0:25:48-0:25:50:**  We have red kites, goshawks.  
**0:25:50-0:25:54:**  The goshawks in particular have started to use the trees for perching so that's helped  
**0:25:54-0:25:56:**  the problem evolve.  
**0:25:56-0:26:01:**  So we're not looking really purely at the commercial output of the agroforestry but  
**0:26:01-0:26:08:**  looking as much as in being as important with the biodiversity aspect of the project.  
**0:26:08-0:26:12:**  And in that respect you said you saw some outcomes.  
**0:26:12-0:26:17:**  Do you really think it's a significant impact on your vegetable production or is it also  
**0:26:17-0:26:22:**  that you wanted biodiversity out of an ethical stance on your production methods?  
**0:26:22-0:26:24:**  Yes, it's more the latter.  
**0:26:24-0:26:29:**  We haven't seen any big increase in yields from vegetables as yet but it's still rare  
**0:26:29-0:26:30:**  to the early days.  
**0:26:30-0:26:37:**  If we do see an increase in yields it would be primarily due to a better microclimate  
**0:26:37-0:26:42:**  and possibly less wind damage but then against that we have the possibility of reduced light  
**0:26:42-0:26:45:**  levels in certain points of the rotation.  
**0:26:45-0:26:48:**  So it swings and roundabouts.  
**0:26:48-0:26:53:**  I don't think we went into this with the expectation that we were going to make a dramatic improvement  
**0:26:53-0:26:59:**  on yields but what we are seeing, we have seen a considerable improvement in our soils  
**0:26:59-0:27:03:**  in the last few years and that's not really just down to the agroforestry.  
**0:27:03-0:27:08:**  It's down to the fact that we've been using round-milled chip wood and composted wood.  
**0:27:08-0:27:14:**  That's made a much bigger dramatic difference to our output than the trees have.  
**0:27:14-0:27:19:**  Trees will become part of that round-milled chip system as well because some of these  
**0:27:19-0:27:21:**  trees we will be using for wood chips.  
**0:27:21-0:27:25:**  That's one of the reasons we plant them so we will have some raw material to use for  
**0:27:25-0:27:27:**  round-milled chip wood and for composting.  
**0:27:27-0:27:34:**  So in time they will be increasingly used for fertility building and that's something  
**0:27:34-0:27:38:**  which is still going to take some years but probably at least four or five years away  
**0:27:38-0:27:42:**  from any timber production in that sense.  
**0:27:42-0:27:46:**  So it's a long-term view really.  
**0:27:46-0:27:50:**  Before we go into the wood chips because that's something absolutely fascinating, I really  
**0:27:50-0:27:57:**  want to go into some detail on how do these trees change your operations with the vegetables.  
**0:27:57-0:28:02:**  The first angle is, is it easy for you knowing that you have vegetables growing with different  
**0:28:02-0:28:08:**  rotations to then come and pick your apples or prune your trees and I'd really like to  
**0:28:08-0:28:13:**  understand how the cycles of the trees and the vegetables kind of intersect.  
**0:28:13-0:28:19:**  Okay, well that's something we're still learning about.  
**0:28:19-0:28:24:**  I mean the pruning of the trees up to now it's mostly been the apple trees.  
**0:28:24-0:28:28:**  It's been relatively easy because they've been quite small trees.  
**0:28:28-0:28:33:**  We've got trees now which have a good shape and they're looking pretty productive for  
**0:28:33-0:28:34:**  the future.  
**0:28:34-0:28:38:**  The pruning is, because it's all done by hand anyway, we don't need machinery access for  
**0:28:38-0:28:44:**  that so it doesn't have any impact on where we grow vegetables.  
**0:28:44-0:28:48:**  If we have vegetables growing and they're quite close to the tree lines then yes there  
**0:28:48-0:28:54:**  is a potential problem there with access with machinery and that's something we've yet to  
**0:28:54-0:28:56:**  sort of deal with in the future.  
**0:28:56-0:29:01:**  We may end up losing a couple of rows either side of the vegetable growing plot in order  
**0:29:01-0:29:04:**  to allow the trees to spread but the intention, the longer term intention is to try and keep  
**0:29:04-0:29:05:**  the trees relatively narrow.  
**0:29:05-0:29:10:**  So we're not going to let them spread out too much so there will be an ongoing pruning  
**0:29:10-0:29:11:**  going on.  
**0:29:11-0:29:12:**  It won't be every year.  
**0:29:12-0:29:17:**  Because of the way our vegetable rotation works we have a seven year rotation.  
**0:29:17-0:29:23:**  Two of those years are in a green manure crop which we can use as a really convenient point  
**0:29:23-0:29:28:**  of access so we can get into the trees quite easily with machinery should we need to without  
**0:29:28-0:29:33:**  doing any damage or not much damage at all to the soil and not jeopardising the growing  
**0:29:33-0:29:34:**  crops.  
**0:29:34-0:29:39:**  So we have this long term fertility building part of the rotation is very beneficial for  
**0:29:39-0:29:41:**  tree management.  
**0:29:41-0:29:47:**  So we don't see a major problem in that sense in terms of access.  
**0:29:47-0:29:52:**  There's been some odd complications which we hadn't thought about previously and it's  
**0:29:52-0:29:54:**  really to do with crop covers.  
**0:29:54-0:29:58:**  We use crop covers sometimes primarily for keeping pigeons off.  
**0:29:58-0:30:01:**  We have a huge pigeon population in the area.  
**0:30:01-0:30:05:**  So we tend to use crop covers which were quite easy to move around the field because we could  
**0:30:05-0:30:06:**  just slide them sideways.  
**0:30:06-0:30:11:**  Now we've got a row of trees in the way we have to roll them up and take them off and  
**0:30:11-0:30:12:**  take them somewhere else.  
**0:30:12-0:30:14:**  It's not as easy as it used to be.  
**0:30:14-0:30:20:**  It's the only major disadvantage I've come up against and we've found a way of dealing  
**0:30:20-0:30:25:**  with that as one does and it's not particularly, it doesn't really take us that much longer  
**0:30:25-0:30:31:**  than it used to but it's a slight annoyance if you like and a hindrance.  
**0:30:31-0:30:33:**  Apart from that, the machinery is not a problem.  
**0:30:33-0:30:38:**  We're not a huge farm so we haven't got huge great big machines and we have nothing more  
**0:30:38-0:30:42:**  than three metres wide so everything fits quite well.  
**0:30:42-0:30:49:**  I did have to modify one of our hoeing machines because it was a bit too wide and tended to  
**0:30:49-0:30:53:**  be too close to trees so we had to leave a row out so I've modified that.  
**0:30:53-0:30:59:**  So we've made some minor modifications in order to allow for trees but nothing too major.  
**0:30:59-0:31:03:**  Once the trees grow then obviously we're going to have to do more work on them.  
**0:31:03-0:31:08:**  We're going to be cutting some, some will be coppiced and as I said earlier that fits  
**0:31:08-0:31:11:**  in quite well with our rotation because we'll do that during the two years when the land  
**0:31:11-0:31:18:**  is back into fertility bed and when we've got good possibilities of access.  
**0:31:18-0:31:19:**  That sounds good.  
**0:31:19-0:31:26:**  The fact that you work the soil and I assume you till the soil for your vegetable production,  
**0:31:26-0:31:30:**  is that enough to keep the roots of the trees kind of out of the vegetables way?  
**0:31:30-0:31:33:**  Is that something that's a concern for you or not at all?  
**0:31:33-0:31:36:**  It hasn't been a concern up to now because trees have been relatively small.  
**0:31:36-0:31:42:**  It's going to be more of an issue going forward from now on and what we intend to do on a,  
**0:31:42-0:31:47:**  I wouldn't say yearly annual basis but sort of within a rotational basis we will be running  
**0:31:47-0:31:53:**  a deep, a single deep time along the edge of the tree line in order to prevent any trees  
**0:31:53-0:31:55:**  spreading roots too far across the field.  
**0:31:55-0:31:59:**  We don't want tree roots across the field because that will impact quite seriously on  
**0:31:59-0:32:02:**  crop production.  
**0:32:02-0:32:06:**  There's one tree there which I think I'm going to remove and that's birch because they're  
**0:32:06-0:32:07:**  very shallow rooted.  
**0:32:07-0:32:10:**  It wasn't a good choice.  
**0:32:10-0:32:12:**  Knowing what I know now we wouldn't have used them.  
**0:32:12-0:32:16:**  The alder which are really deep and the oak which are quite deep, they're fine.  
**0:32:16-0:32:20:**  But yes some, some species tend to have shallow roots and I think you know knowing what we  
**0:32:20-0:32:25:**  know now we would have left those out and gone for a more deeper tap rooting type tree.  
**0:32:25-0:32:30:**  We will have to, you know these trees are going to be subject to a lot of management  
**0:32:30-0:32:31:**  in the future.  
**0:32:31-0:32:34:**  It's not as if we're just going to let them grow wild.  
**0:32:34-0:32:39:**  We do have to maintain and manage them because we need to continue with the vegetable production.  
**0:32:39-0:32:45:**  So yes we will have to do some, some root pruning down one side of the trees.  
**0:32:45-0:32:51:**  And earlier you mentioned when we were talking about the initial investments into establishing  
**0:32:51-0:32:56:**  the tree systems that actually what surprised you was that the maintenance was higher than  
**0:32:56-0:32:58:**  you expected.  
**0:32:58-0:32:59:**  What is taking so much time?  
**0:32:59-0:33:00:**  Is it the pruning?  
**0:33:00-0:33:04:**  Is it mowing the spaces between the trees?  
**0:33:04-0:33:05:**  Yes it's all those things.  
**0:33:05-0:33:07:**  We don't actually mow very often at all.  
**0:33:07-0:33:11:**  We tend to leave it for several years before we mow it.  
**0:33:11-0:33:15:**  It's really more to do with the shaping of the trees.  
**0:33:15-0:33:18:**  You know we had quite a bit of pruning to do on the trees.  
**0:33:18-0:33:24:**  So the apple trees have taken more effort per tree than the other trees but even so  
**0:33:24-0:33:27:**  it's still quite a bit of work going into the other trees.  
**0:33:27-0:33:31:**  Staking some of the stakes rotted before the tree was properly established so we had to  
**0:33:31-0:33:34:**  redo some stakes.  
**0:33:34-0:33:36:**  It's a lot of sort of fiddling around.  
**0:33:36-0:33:40:**  You know we had a problem in one tree line with brambles creeping in which we had to  
**0:33:40-0:33:43:**  manage by digging by hand.  
**0:33:43-0:33:46:**  That was quite a big job.  
**0:33:46-0:33:51:**  It's lots of bits and pieces really which if you add it up over the year comes to quite  
**0:33:51-0:33:52:**  a bit of labour.  
**0:33:52-0:33:54:**  I wouldn't say it's particularly onerous.  
**0:33:54-0:34:01:**  It's mostly winter work but it does add to the sort of the work load on the farm and  
**0:34:01-0:34:03:**  we are a very busy farm.  
**0:34:03-0:34:07:**  We don't really get a time in the winter when we're slack.  
**0:34:07-0:34:09:**  We're working right the way through.  
**0:34:09-0:34:13:**  We still have almost as many people working here in the winter as we do in the summer.  
**0:34:13-0:34:18:**  So we've had to sort of reorganise staff a little bit and what we're looking for really  
**0:34:18-0:34:23:**  is a person who will come in on a sort of fairly regular but perhaps you know half a  
**0:34:23-0:34:29:**  day a week during the winter to manage the trees, look after the trees and that may well  
**0:34:29-0:34:33:**  increase in the future as we start to coppice the trees or pollard the trees.  
**0:34:33-0:34:37:**  There will of course be a lot more work going into that but then you know we are producing  
**0:34:37-0:34:43:**  a product which for us will be the ram your chip wood or chip wood for composting.  
**0:34:43-0:34:46:**  So in that sense we can justify putting more labour in.  
**0:34:46-0:34:52:**  At the moment we're still at the maintenance establishment stage.  
**0:34:52-0:34:56:**  I must say the last 12 months has been less work because we did quite a lot two years  
**0:34:56-0:34:57:**  ago.  
**0:34:57-0:34:58:**  We have less this year.  
**0:34:58-0:35:05:**  So it goes in cycles really and I think we've yet to see longer term how much effort will  
**0:35:05-0:35:06:**  go into this.  
**0:35:06-0:35:14:**  We have 600 trees in total so it's quite a few trees there to be managed.  
**0:35:14-0:35:18:**  Some will be left to grow full size but quite a lot will be coppiced and pollarded so it  
**0:35:18-0:35:23:**  would be regular every sort of six, seven, eight years we'll be going in and doing work  
**0:35:23-0:35:26:**  on those trees.  
**0:35:26-0:35:33:**  And for the oaks that you're trying to give a timber shape let's say, how is that going  
**0:35:33-0:35:37:**  and are you having someone from the outside do this or are you able to do it on your own?  
**0:35:37-0:35:41:**  Well I've been doing that part of it myself because I quite enjoy it.  
**0:35:41-0:35:46:**  So the oak trees have been managed primarily to grow a tall straight trunk which is what  
**0:35:46-0:35:49:**  people will need in the future.  
**0:35:49-0:35:51:**  It's pretty simple, they grow really well.  
**0:35:51-0:35:55:**  The oak have established beautifully, in fact they've established better than the birch.  
**0:35:55-0:35:59:**  The birch are quite difficult to establish actually, birch do not like being moved.  
**0:35:59-0:36:04:**  Whereas the oak have established really well and they're looking very strong, we haven't  
**0:36:04-0:36:06:**  lost a single tree, they're all there.  
**0:36:06-0:36:08:**  So that part of it is quite simple.  
**0:36:08-0:36:12:**  I think managing the oaks is probably the least of our problems because we're only going  
**0:36:12-0:36:16:**  to be trimming the trunk to ensure a straight tree.  
**0:36:16-0:36:20:**  Once the other trees get well established it will encourage the oaks to grow straight  
**0:36:20-0:36:25:**  anyway so we think, well we don't know for sure but we think that's going to probably  
**0:36:25-0:36:27:**  work quite well.  
**0:36:27-0:36:32:**  The other trees, because they're going to be coppiced and pollarded, we'll be doing  
**0:36:32-0:36:34:**  that on a rotational basis.  
**0:36:34-0:36:37:**  Well it will be interesting to see how the trees evolve.  
**0:36:37-0:36:42:**  I mean I visited a farm not so long ago and he had planted a lot of timber trees and clearly  
**0:36:42-0:36:47:**  he didn't have the expertise himself or didn't benefit from enough technical support but  
**0:36:47-0:36:52:**  he was having a really hard time getting nice timber out of his aquaforestry trees because  
**0:36:52-0:36:57:**  obviously the tree wants to create branches further down and it's not growing in a forest  
**0:36:57-0:37:00:**  so you have to be really proactive in shaping it.  
**0:37:00-0:37:02:**  But it's great to hear that you're successful in that domain.  
**0:37:02-0:37:05:**  Yes, it certainly takes more effort.  
**0:37:05-0:37:10:**  I mean if you had oaks within a plantation you wouldn't have to probably spend as much  
**0:37:10-0:37:14:**  time on individual trees so there's definitely a higher input there.  
**0:37:14-0:37:19:**  But for us on this scale, which is relatively small, it's manageable, we can do it and as  
**0:37:19-0:37:25:**  I said earlier it's part of one of the costs that we have to endure in the way of we are  
**0:37:25-0:37:30:**  going to be producing a product at some point in the future which is going to give us a  
**0:37:30-0:37:35:**  good fertility maintenance factor for the farm.  
**0:37:35-0:37:41:**  I wanted to come back to something on this idea of your tree line and leaving kind of  
**0:37:41-0:37:46:**  natural biodiversity and grass has come back.  
**0:37:46-0:37:50:**  Are you concerned that this kind of acts as a seed reserve for weeds to come and colonise  
**0:37:50-0:37:55:**  or brambles because that's a concern we often hear and I'm wondering how that's affecting  
**0:37:55-0:37:56:**  the vegetables.  
**0:37:56-0:37:57:**  Yes, it's definitely a concern.  
**0:37:57-0:38:01:**  It was one of my concerns right from the start before we even planted.  
**0:38:01-0:38:05:**  There was always this sort of fear in the back of mind that you're going to end up with  
**0:38:05-0:38:06:**  horrendous weed problems.  
**0:38:06-0:38:11:**  So far we haven't because we're doing a fair bit of cultivation.  
**0:38:11-0:38:14:**  We are mint till rather than no till.  
**0:38:14-0:38:16:**  We've reduced tillage, we haven't stopped tillage.  
**0:38:16-0:38:20:**  It's difficult in basically to do no till.  
**0:38:20-0:38:23:**  We can control weeds quite easily with mechanical means.  
**0:38:23-0:38:26:**  We have steerage hoes, we've got inter-row equipment.  
**0:38:26-0:38:31:**  So weeds have not really been a problem and if there's anything at all, it's very close  
**0:38:31-0:38:32:**  to the tree line.  
**0:38:32-0:38:39:**  It's the very last row where we maybe see some weed pressure and definitely in one or  
**0:38:39-0:38:43:**  two crops there has been a slight yield reduction because of weed pressure but I don't see it  
**0:38:43-0:38:45:**  as being a major problem.  
**0:38:45-0:38:51:**  We're quite keen to encourage greater diversity of flora in the field so we have actually  
**0:38:51-0:38:55:**  sown a whole range of different species.  
**0:38:55-0:38:59:**  As part of our green manure we've actually sown what many people refer to as weeds but  
**0:38:59-0:39:03:**  we call them wildflowers within that to encourage greater diversity.  
**0:39:03-0:39:07:**  So we're not, we don't object to weeds.  
**0:39:07-0:39:12:**  We manage them in a specific way and we look at them in a much more positive way than perhaps  
**0:39:12-0:39:13:**  some growers would.  
**0:39:13-0:39:17:**  We do control them up to certain points within the cropping cycle.  
**0:39:17-0:39:22:**  We don't want weeds when plants are very small and we've got pretty good systems of dealing  
**0:39:22-0:39:23:**  with that.  
**0:39:23-0:39:29:**  So at the moment, maybe it's been 10 years time, but at the moment I don't see these  
**0:39:29-0:39:32:**  weeds as being a major problem.  
**0:39:32-0:39:36:**  Perennial weeds are perhaps more of an issue.  
**0:39:36-0:39:40:**  If we were to get problems with perennial weeds then we may have to have a strip either  
**0:39:40-0:39:45:**  side of the trees that we continually cultivate in order to keep that back and that may perhaps  
**0:39:45-0:39:48:**  reduce some cropping area but it's still doable.  
**0:39:48-0:39:50:**  We're quite confident we can control those weeds.  
**0:39:50-0:39:55:**  It's really about having a system of weed control.  
**0:39:55-0:39:58:**  We've always had field perimeters, we've got hessiers there already.  
**0:39:58-0:40:02:**  We're used to dealing with nature encroaching upon what we do.  
**0:40:02-0:40:04:**  That's what we're up against.  
**0:40:04-0:40:08:**  We're working with nature and we accept that nature does want to encroach so we have systems  
**0:40:08-0:40:11:**  whereby we can kind of keep that in check.  
**0:40:11-0:40:17:**  So I don't have a huge paranoia about that in the future because anything could change.  
**0:40:17-0:40:22:**  If we ran into a serious weed problem then we would just have to fire that piece of the  
**0:40:22-0:40:28:**  field which is doable but it could have an impact on yields for a year or two.  
**0:40:28-0:40:32:**  How wide is that strip, the strip on the ground where the trees are growing?  
**0:40:32-0:40:35:**  Well it started off not much more than a meter.  
**0:40:35-0:40:39:**  It's now got to sort of two and a half meters which is what I was expecting and we'll probably  
**0:40:39-0:40:44:**  end up with about three meters and we don't really want to go much beyond that.  
**0:40:44-0:40:47:**  So the tree line will be kept more or less within that space.  
**0:40:47-0:40:50:**  The apple trees are on a fairly tall rootstock.  
**0:40:50-0:40:55:**  They won't grow much wider than about four or five meters anyway.  
**0:40:55-0:41:04:**  So they'll be pruned really to try and maintain a relatively narrow band across the width  
**0:41:04-0:41:07:**  of the plot so we're not taking up vegetable space.  
**0:41:07-0:41:12:**  So it's going to be quite a heavily managed environment these trees so we are going to  
**0:41:12-0:41:15:**  keep them relatively narrow.  
**0:41:15-0:41:22:**  Time will tell as to how successful we are with that and we will inevitably be trimming  
**0:41:22-0:41:28:**  trees back and the moving branches at certain times of the year as well in order to give  
**0:41:28-0:41:34:**  us access but we're looking more for height rather than width so it's going to be relatively  
**0:41:34-0:41:40:**  tall and we expect, apart from the oak trees which would be allowed to go full height,  
**0:41:40-0:41:47:**  we are expecting a height of around five maybe six meters and we will probably not go much  
**0:41:47-0:41:50:**  beyond that apart from the oak trees.  
**0:41:50-0:41:56:**  Because thanks to your north-south direction in the lines you're not too worried about  
**0:41:56-0:41:57:**  competition for light for example?  
**0:41:57-0:42:03:**  No not at all because in the summer when things are growing that shade effect is actually  
**0:42:03-0:42:06:**  quite modest it doesn't really have much.  
**0:42:06-0:42:11:**  We're used to having this effect because we have quite a few hedges already so we know  
**0:42:11-0:42:16:**  the effect of hedges and we know that when they run north-south we don't have a problem  
**0:42:16-0:42:21:**  we can crop right up to the hedge whereas where the hedges run east to west we have  
**0:42:21-0:42:26:**  particularly on the southern side of the field we have quite a large area which is shady  
**0:42:26-0:42:31:**  for quite a long part in the winter it's shady as well as the old day.  
**0:42:31-0:42:36:**  So we're used to that and we don't see the shade as being a huge factor.  
**0:42:36-0:42:41:**  Some crops are quite tolerant of shade, not every vegetable wants full sun anyway.  
**0:42:41-0:42:46:**  A lot of vegetable battery will grow in a partial shady environment so we don't see  
**0:42:46-0:42:48:**  that as a major problem.  
**0:42:48-0:42:53:**  And just going back to the tree line because I do think it's an important part, you said  
**0:42:53-0:42:58:**  that you don't mow much but does that mean that you will not mow at all during the growing  
**0:42:58-0:43:01:**  season or you'll still come once and cut that grass?  
**0:43:01-0:43:04:**  We don't mow at all during the growing season.  
**0:43:04-0:43:09:**  We may mow early in the spring but we don't do every tree line every year, we do them  
**0:43:09-0:43:13:**  perhaps every two to three years.  
**0:43:13-0:43:18:**  The mowing primarily would be to control things like brambles, it won't be for any other reason,  
**0:43:18-0:43:22:**  we have quite a diverse species of plants growing there so we're quite happy to let  
**0:43:22-0:43:25:**  them look after themselves really.  
**0:43:25-0:43:29:**  If we get things like nettles growing there that's fine because nettles are an incredibly  
**0:43:29-0:43:35:**  useful way of improving biodiversity and they harbour a huge range of beneficial insects  
**0:43:35-0:43:38:**  so we're quite happy for things like that to establish.  
**0:43:38-0:43:45:**  We would only mow primarily to control aggressive perennial shrubs if you like, things which  
**0:43:45-0:43:49:**  may start creeping in, brambles are the main worry really.  
**0:43:49-0:43:54:**  And you go around with a brush cutter or are you able to mechanise that with some other  
**0:43:54-0:43:55:**  machinery?  
**0:43:55-0:44:01:**  Yeah, we have a mower, a tractor mower, a flower mower which we can use, it's got offset  
**0:44:01-0:44:07:**  arrangement so we can offset it between trees, it's a bit slow but it's only now and again.  
**0:44:07-0:44:13:**  A brush cutter, a strimmer, it is possible but it's quite slow.  
**0:44:13-0:44:18:**  We wouldn't want to do too much like that but we may use occasional brush cutting.  
**0:44:18-0:44:24:**  Very interesting and it's fascinating that you've actually, you're able to share an experience  
**0:44:24-0:44:30:**  about the understory and utilising that space because it's an incredibly appealing idea  
**0:44:30-0:44:36:**  both in terms of using space and this idea of intensifying production but clearly it  
**0:44:36-0:44:41:**  comes with some challenges and it's interesting to see that it seems now that having tested  
**0:44:41-0:44:47:**  these different options you're actually better off just leaving that strip going to natural  
**0:44:47-0:44:52:**  vegetation rather than trying to find a market and labour to actually increase production.  
**0:44:52-0:44:55:**  Yeah, certainly that's true in our case.  
**0:44:55-0:45:01:**  It may not be true for everybody on every farm but given that labour is our single one  
**0:45:01-0:45:08:**  biggest expense and getting skilled labour because even picking blackcurrants and gooseberries  
**0:45:08-0:45:12:**  takes an element of skill is a difficult factor for us in the UK.  
**0:45:12-0:45:16:**  We are very short of labour to deal with such things.  
**0:45:16-0:45:22:**  This year we picked over 2000kg of strawberries and that took quite an effort and we had some  
**0:45:22-0:45:28:**  problems at one point of getting people to do that because of the lockdown situation  
**0:45:28-0:45:32:**  and the person that was going to come from abroad was not able to come and been relying  
**0:45:32-0:45:34:**  on this person for some time.  
**0:45:34-0:45:38:**  So we had to find local labour and to be perfectly honest local labour is not used to dealing  
**0:45:38-0:45:41:**  with these sorts of crops and they found it very very hard work.  
**0:45:41-0:45:44:**  Even after two hours they've had enough.  
**0:45:44-0:45:49:**  So it's actually really difficult finding people to do these things and that is the  
**0:45:49-0:45:53:**  main consideration, it's not really an agronomic problem.  
**0:45:53-0:45:58:**  I think these crops can be managed to grow quite well but it is the labour input and  
**0:45:58-0:46:04:**  also on a relatively small area it takes a huge amount of effort to grow a crop on a  
**0:46:04-0:46:10:**  small scale and market it and package it and all the things you have to do.  
**0:46:10-0:46:15:**  We're very busy with vegetables pretty much the whole year and perennial fruit is actually  
**0:46:15-0:46:17:**  quite difficult to manage.  
**0:46:17-0:46:21:**  We do strawberries but we've had 40 years experience of doing it.  
**0:46:21-0:46:25:**  Very few people are able to manage perennial crops and vegetable crops at the same time.  
**0:46:25-0:46:29:**  If they're only growing perennial crops it may well work much better for them because  
**0:46:29-0:46:34:**  they haven't got the pressure of vegetables but vegetables for us a huge amount of work  
**0:46:34-0:46:42:**  from April right through till September, massive input effort needed which clashes very much  
**0:46:42-0:46:43:**  with fruit as well.  
**0:46:43-0:46:50:**  So on some farms I'm sure it could be made to work economically but on others less so.  
**0:46:50-0:46:54:**  But it's always a challenge to, especially if you're doing direct selling which is the  
**0:46:54-0:46:58:**  case of a lot of the farms we're talking to, it's always a challenge to find something  
**0:46:58-0:47:04:**  that both makes ecological sense, I mean by that being able to grow in shade for example,  
**0:47:04-0:47:06:**  and then that you can actually sell locally and that's exactly what you said with the  
**0:47:06-0:47:08:**  blackcurrants.  
**0:47:08-0:47:12:**  Even if you had the labour and everything it's a bit useless to have six lines of blackcurrants  
**0:47:12-0:47:17:**  if no one's eating them fresh and that's a huge part of the challenge.  
**0:47:17-0:47:24:**  I mean I'll come back to blackcurrants because it's an interesting example but 99.8% of all  
**0:47:24-0:47:30:**  blackcurrants grown in this country go for one source and that's blackcurrant drink.  
**0:47:30-0:47:35:**  And that's the outlet and it's all done by huge machines on vast scale.  
**0:47:35-0:47:40:**  You never see blackcurrants in the shops ever, they just don't exist, people don't use them.  
**0:47:40-0:47:45:**  So yes they'll grow and it's often used as a good example of what you can have within  
**0:47:45-0:47:50:**  tree lives but actually the marketing is incredibly difficult.  
**0:47:50-0:47:55:**  And if the labour wasn't an issue are there any other berries that could be interesting,  
**0:47:55-0:47:58:**  at least in the initial years where there's a lot of sunshine?  
**0:47:58-0:48:04:**  Yeah raspberries would be very well suited to this, certainly for the first sort of,  
**0:48:04-0:48:06:**  well probably up to ten years.  
**0:48:06-0:48:11:**  Once the tree carry got really dense you wouldn't be able to do it but yeah possibly up to ten  
**0:48:11-0:48:14:**  years you could grow raspberries which is about their lifespan anyway, they don't usually  
**0:48:14-0:48:16:**  produce much beyond that.  
**0:48:16-0:48:19:**  So they would be quite a useful crop to have.  
**0:48:19-0:48:23:**  Again it's down to the labour but I think you have a better chance for raspberries than  
**0:48:23-0:48:24:**  you have for blackcurrants.  
**0:48:24-0:48:29:**  But then you still have the issues of doing that in a kind of functional, practical way  
**0:48:29-0:48:34:**  where you can trellis them efficiently and all these considerations but it is an interesting  
**0:48:34-0:48:35:**  one.  
**0:48:35-0:48:39:**  There are some raspberry varieties, the autumn fruiting ones which you don't have to train,  
**0:48:39-0:48:42:**  you just cut them down every year which is far easier.  
**0:48:42-0:48:48:**  And you can also do biennial cropping on the other early fruiting raspberries as well and  
**0:48:48-0:48:51:**  crop them every other year so you cut one half one year and one half the next.  
**0:48:51-0:48:56:**  And that reproduces or completely eliminates the need to do much training.  
**0:48:56-0:49:02:**  So there are ways of doing it and I think it would be a really useful trial for somebody  
**0:49:02-0:49:07:**  to really take forward because I think raspberries probably amongst all the fruits have probably  
**0:49:07-0:49:08:**  got the best possibilities.  
**0:49:08-0:49:12:**  Because they naturally grow in that environment, like it's a natural environment under trees  
**0:49:12-0:49:13:**  and part shade.  
**0:49:13-0:49:20:**  Ian, you mentioned that you also wanted to use these trees to produce woodchips and biomass  
**0:49:20-0:49:26:**  for your fertility and I think this is such an interesting and important aspect because  
**0:49:26-0:49:31:**  woodchips are a huge potential output of agroforestry systems and it's so important for us to understand  
**0:49:31-0:49:34:**  the potential that they have.  
**0:49:34-0:49:39:**  Could you tell us a bit about how you've been using woodchips in the past and how you're  
**0:49:39-0:49:45:**  hoping to use your trees then to supplement that source of woodchips?  
**0:49:45-0:49:49:**  Ok well we started experimenting with woodchips about 15 years ago.  
**0:49:49-0:49:53:**  We were taking chipped wood from local tree sources.  
**0:49:53-0:49:59:**  This was a mixture of different species, mostly from gardens, all from very close by.  
**0:49:59-0:50:05:**  It all comes within literally a 4-5km radius of the farm so it's very local.  
**0:50:05-0:50:11:**  It's mostly material that would have gone to either landfill or to a central composting  
**0:50:11-0:50:12:**  site.  
**0:50:12-0:50:17:**  So it's very useful for us because it's local and very useful for tree sources because they  
**0:50:17-0:50:21:**  don't have to drive too far with it and take it to some huge site somewhere.  
**0:50:21-0:50:24:**  So we started composting that which has been very successful.  
**0:50:24-0:50:29:**  We've got a very good system of composting so we're producing around, well we're taking  
**0:50:29-0:50:36:**  around 400-500 cubic metres a year, composting that down to around 250 cubic metres.  
**0:50:36-0:50:39:**  It takes 12 months to do the whole composting process.  
**0:50:39-0:50:46:**  We're simply just putting it into windrows, about 4 metres wide, 2 metres high and as  
**0:50:46-0:50:47:**  long as we can.  
**0:50:47-0:50:50:**  Some of them are 30-40 metres long.  
**0:50:50-0:50:57:**  And we turn it every 3-4 months to produce a more evenly mixed and homogenous material.  
**0:50:57-0:51:04:**  And at the end of the 12 months it comes out as very beautiful dark black organic material,  
**0:51:04-0:51:05:**  I mean humus almost.  
**0:51:05-0:51:10:**  So it's a very useful product and we've been putting that onto green manure part of the  
**0:51:10-0:51:11:**  rotation.  
**0:51:11-0:51:12:**  We don't put it on bare soil.  
**0:51:12-0:51:16:**  Putting any organic material on bare soil is incredibly wasteful.  
**0:51:16-0:51:21:**  So it goes onto a long term green manure crop.  
**0:51:21-0:51:27:**  The reason for that primarily is that the soil at that point is able to accept this  
**0:51:27-0:51:31:**  material without running into any problems with denitrification because there is still  
**0:51:31-0:51:35:**  some wood which is not completely broken down.  
**0:51:35-0:51:42:**  And there's very high earthworm populations, very high micro fauna, lots of bacteria, fungi,  
**0:51:42-0:51:47:**  all these things which you need for the final processing of the composted wood happen on  
**0:51:47-0:51:48:**  the soil.  
**0:51:48-0:51:53:**  So it's a very modest amount, we're putting down around between 50-70 cubic metres per  
**0:51:53-0:51:54:**  hectare.  
**0:51:54-0:51:58:**  So it's sort of 5mm thick, a very small amount.  
**0:51:58-0:52:01:**  We do that twice during the 7 year rotation.  
**0:52:01-0:52:06:**  So it goes on 2 consecutive years when we have green manure crops.  
**0:52:06-0:52:07:**  And that's the only time we apply it.  
**0:52:07-0:52:12:**  So it's a very modest amount during the course of the whole rotation.  
**0:52:12-0:52:14:**  We've now been around the farm.  
**0:52:14-0:52:25:**  We're on the third, we've just almost completed the second rotation so we've done 12-14 years.  
**0:52:25-0:52:32:**  And we're seeing some enormous benefits in terms of soil biology, crop yields, pest disease  
**0:52:32-0:52:35:**  resistance, water holding capacity.  
**0:52:35-0:52:38:**  The soil has changed out of all recognition.  
**0:52:38-0:52:43:**  Prior to doing this we were using green years only which was fine, we've managed to maintain  
**0:52:43-0:52:47:**  fertility but we weren't getting fantastically high yields.  
**0:52:47-0:52:50:**  This has made a huge difference to the yield potential.  
**0:52:50-0:52:58:**  As well as the composted wood chip for soil applications, we're also using it for making  
**0:52:58-0:53:00:**  a propagation substrate.  
**0:53:00-0:53:04:**  So we're using it as a mix for plant raising.  
**0:53:04-0:53:10:**  It's not a huge amount, we use probably 5-7 cubic metres a year.  
**0:53:10-0:53:14:**  Really successful, we have the most amazing plant propagation from this material.  
**0:53:14-0:53:17:**  We don't add any fertilizer to it at all.  
**0:53:17-0:53:22:**  We do use a little bit of vermiculite to dilute it because it's very high in nitrogen so we  
**0:53:22-0:53:28:**  need to dilute it and also it improves the drainage and the water holding capacity.  
**0:53:28-0:53:34:**  And that's completely eliminated any brought in compost we may have had to use for plant  
**0:53:34-0:53:35:**  raising.  
**0:53:35-0:53:41:**  Most growers in the UK are buying in plant substrates which in most cases are based on  
**0:53:41-0:53:42:**  peat.  
**0:53:42-0:53:44:**  They may have reduced peat but they all contain some peat.  
**0:53:44-0:53:50:**  This is a serious issue in terms of climate change and damage to ecosystems.  
**0:53:50-0:53:54:**  Peat is a product which has to be banned and it is going to be banned in the future but  
**0:53:54-0:53:55:**  it hasn't been yet.  
**0:53:55-0:53:59:**  So we've been able to replace any element of peat completely by using wood chips.  
**0:53:59-0:54:05:**  So this has been perhaps one of the most successful parts of the composting process.  
**0:54:05-0:54:07:**  As well as composting wood chips.  
**0:54:07-0:54:10:**  This is, as I said earlier, a range of different species.  
**0:54:10-0:54:16:**  It may contain, a lot of it is actually ornamental trees because this is often what happens in  
**0:54:16-0:54:17:**  people's gardens.  
**0:54:17-0:54:21:**  They have ornamental trees, they get too big, they have to cut them down, they have to prune  
**0:54:21-0:54:22:**  them.  
**0:54:22-0:54:28:**  There's also quite a lot of cupressus leylandii which are evergreen conifers which were planted  
**0:54:28-0:54:33:**  for hedges, they get enormous invasive space and time and they cause all sorts of disputes  
**0:54:33-0:54:34:**  between neighbours.  
**0:54:34-0:54:36:**  So we get quite a bit of that.  
**0:54:36-0:54:41:**  Around about 25% of the material we get is from conifers.  
**0:54:41-0:54:47:**  This can be difficult to compost so we need a range of other timbers to enable us to compost  
**0:54:47-0:54:48:**  that successfully.  
**0:54:48-0:54:53:**  On its own it's very difficult because of the high level of resin and terpenes.  
**0:54:53-0:54:59:**  So as well as composted wood chip we also have a different product which is ramil chip  
**0:54:59-0:55:00:**  wood.  
**0:55:00-0:55:04:**  So ramil chip wood, I think you have more experience of it in France than we have in  
**0:55:04-0:55:09:**  UK because I think it's been done quite a bit in the past.  
**0:55:09-0:55:14:**  Ramil chip wood is fresh wood harvested direct from trees.  
**0:55:14-0:55:16:**  It's harvested during the winter.  
**0:55:16-0:55:23:**  It's wood which is generally less than 75 mm in diameter so it's fairly young wood because  
**0:55:23-0:55:30:**  it's higher in proteins and elements that we need for the process and it's spread direct  
**0:55:30-0:55:31:**  onto land.  
**0:55:31-0:55:33:**  So we don't compost it, we spread it fresh.  
**0:55:33-0:55:37:**  It's spread literally the day we chip it.  
**0:55:37-0:55:39:**  For that purpose we're using our own wood.  
**0:55:39-0:55:46:**  We have an area of coppice which I planted 15 or so years ago which is willow.  
**0:55:46-0:55:50:**  White willow we're using that and we're coppicing that on a rotational basis.  
**0:55:50-0:55:53:**  We're using that for ramil chip wood.  
**0:55:53-0:55:59:**  We've also been doing trials with this ramil chip wood comparing it with the composted  
**0:55:59-0:56:03:**  wood to see what the differences are and that's been an extensive trial done over the last  
**0:56:03-0:56:05:**  4 or 5 years which you can read up.  
**0:56:05-0:56:07:**  It's about to be published soon by the Organic Research Centre.  
**0:56:07-0:56:09:**  It's been a very interesting trial.  
**0:56:09-0:56:14:**  We've taken it from right away through the rotation almost from the green manures to  
**0:56:14-0:56:19:**  the application of the ramil chip wood right through to following crops and measured to  
**0:56:19-0:56:20:**  crop yield.  
**0:56:20-0:56:26:**  We're looking at earthworm populations, soil biology, we're looking at P and K levels,  
**0:56:26-0:56:32:**  phosphate to potassium are quite important to us obviously and also pH levels.  
**0:56:32-0:56:39:**  So we're looking at a whole range of parameters of soil analysis to see what's happening during  
**0:56:39-0:56:45:**  this process of applying ramil chip wood and comparing that with where we're applying composted  
**0:56:45-0:56:47:**  chip wood and where we're applying nothing.  
**0:56:47-0:56:53:**  So it's a pretty extensive trial and there's been some useful information coming from that.  
**0:56:53-0:57:02:**  I think probably the most useful information for us as farmers in terms of soil measurement  
**0:57:02-0:57:04:**  is the earthworm counts.  
**0:57:04-0:57:10:**  The earthworm counts have been really interesting in that we've seen huge populations of earthworms.  
**0:57:10-0:57:18:**  We have something in the region of 13 million earthworms per hectare where we've been now  
**0:57:18-0:57:19:**  doing this in its fourth year.  
**0:57:19-0:57:26:**  So we're seeing some big improvements in soil health due to primarily due to the earthworm  
**0:57:26-0:57:33:**  population which is really enjoying the application of both the composted wood and also the ramil  
**0:57:33-0:57:34:**  chip wood.  
**0:57:34-0:57:40:**  Really what we're looking at in terms of comparing the ramil chip wood compared with the composted  
**0:57:40-0:57:44:**  chip wood is do we need to compost the wood because there's a feeling that perhaps we  
**0:57:44-0:57:48:**  don't need to compost it we can just apply it direct.  
**0:57:48-0:57:53:**  And I think that is the case where we've got our own material but because we are bringing  
**0:57:53-0:58:02:**  in material from outside and because the use of the conifer wood we would have to compost  
**0:58:02-0:58:03:**  that.  
**0:58:03-0:58:07:**  We couldn't use conifer wood as ramil chip wood so it would mean that we can use that  
**0:58:07-0:58:09:**  material which normally go to waste.  
**0:58:09-0:58:16:**  It also means we can make a much more reliable plant raising substrate which we wouldn't  
**0:58:16-0:58:18:**  be able to do with just ramil chip wood.  
**0:58:18-0:58:20:**  It has to be composted in order to do that.  
**0:58:20-0:58:27:**  So it's been an interesting trial and certainly what we're looking at longer term is how much  
**0:58:27-0:58:34:**  of our farm would we have to be growing trees on in order to support fertility 100%.  
**0:58:34-0:58:38:**  Assuming that maybe at some point we may not have access to this material coming in from  
**0:58:38-0:58:39:**  outside.  
**0:58:39-0:58:45:**  And just to understand the ramil chip wood do you just apply it on the surface and what  
**0:58:45-0:58:48:**  quantities and at what moment in the year?  
**0:58:48-0:58:51:**  Yeah it goes onto the surface.  
**0:58:51-0:58:54:**  It should never be buried because that will cause problems.  
**0:58:54-0:58:55:**  It goes onto a green manure crop.  
**0:58:55-0:58:56:**  This is really important.  
**0:58:56-0:58:59:**  It's not going to work very well if it goes onto bare soil.  
**0:58:59-0:59:02:**  In fact we avoid bare soil on the farm as much as possible.  
**0:59:02-0:59:04:**  We always maintain cover crops.  
**0:59:04-0:59:09:**  And within crops we have green manure grown within crops to maintain soil cover.  
**0:59:09-0:59:12:**  So it only goes onto a cover crop.  
**0:59:12-0:59:17:**  And we apply, I think I've made some noise, we apply around 50 to 60 cubic metres per  
**0:59:17-0:59:18:**  hectare.  
**0:59:18-0:59:20:**  This is about 5 or 6 millimetres thick.  
**0:59:20-0:59:22:**  It's a very small amount.  
**0:59:22-0:59:28:**  And it goes on usually during the autumn or early spring.  
**0:59:28-0:59:32:**  We avoid going on during the winter because the land can be quite wet because it's a play  
**0:59:32-0:59:37:**  source so we don't want people running around with machinery when it's wet.  
**0:59:37-0:59:41:**  Autumn is the ideal but sometimes we have to pull it off till spring.  
**0:59:41-0:59:45:**  And how long does it take for the wood chips to decompose then?  
**0:59:45-0:59:46:**  Decomposes very quickly.  
**0:59:46-0:59:52:**  The ramil chip wood, if it's willow, I mean we've used a range of different species but  
**0:59:52-0:59:54:**  if it's willow it's gone within 6 months.  
**0:59:54-0:59:56:**  We don't see any sign of it.  
**0:59:56-1:00:00:**  And that's an indication really of the high levels of biological activity we have in our  
**1:00:00-1:00:01:**  soil.  
**1:00:01-1:00:06:**  So if you put that onto a soil which is very bad in terms of biological diversity it may  
**1:00:06-1:00:12:**  take much longer because it doesn't have the necessary fungi and bacteria to process it.  
**1:00:12-1:00:15:**  Other species of wood may take a little longer.  
**1:00:15-1:00:19:**  We've also, we're coppicing some hazes here on the farm, our own hazes which we planted  
**1:00:19-1:00:20:**  30 years ago.  
**1:00:20-1:00:23:**  We're coppicing some of those for ramil chip wood.  
**1:00:23-1:00:30:**  That's a mixture of blackthorn, hawthorn, hazel, spindle and one or two other things.  
**1:00:30-1:00:35:**  And that's taking a little bit longer to break down but still not much longer.  
**1:00:35-1:00:37:**  I mean it's gone within a year.  
**1:00:37-1:00:41:**  You may get the odd bit of wood lying around because sometimes you get a big chunk coming  
**1:00:41-1:00:44:**  out and it doesn't get completely chipped up.  
**1:00:44-1:00:49:**  And that may stay around but that hasn't caused any problems with denodification.  
**1:00:49-1:00:55:**  The fear really with using wood on soil is to lock up nitrogen for a long period of time.  
**1:00:55-1:00:59:**  Which is why we've only applied it to green manure crops where we already have very high  
**1:00:59-1:01:03:**  levels of nitrogen because we have a mixed species of green manure which contains some  
**1:01:03-1:01:08:**  legumes and also we have a lot of bacteria and fungi in the soil at that point in the  
**1:01:08-1:01:10:**  rotation to process the wood.  
**1:01:10-1:01:14:**  Let's say you were able to plant enough trees to be self-sufficient in inputs.  
**1:01:14-1:01:20:**  You think economically it would be worth it to be planting, managing and pruning these  
**1:01:20-1:01:23:**  trees to produce your own inputs.  
**1:01:23-1:01:29:**  The total price of the input produced yourself would be competitive compared to buying anything  
**1:01:29-1:01:30:**  else.  
**1:01:30-1:01:38:**  Yes, it's certainly I would say it's competitive to buying say fertilizers which we wouldn't  
**1:01:38-1:01:43:**  do anyway because we're organic or even organic inputs.  
**1:01:43-1:01:46:**  I would say it is comparable to that.  
**1:01:46-1:01:47:**  We've been trying to put some cost in that.  
**1:01:47-1:01:52:**  It's quite difficult but you know we've costed out our wood chip compost.  
**1:01:52-1:01:55:**  We know what that cost us per ton and we've costed out around your chip wood.  
**1:01:55-1:01:56:**  We know what that cost is.  
**1:01:56-1:01:59:**  It's very favourable.  
**1:01:59-1:02:05:**  Given that the benefits are beyond things you can measure in an economic sense.  
**1:02:05-1:02:06:**  This is a difficulty.  
**1:02:06-1:02:12:**  How do you measure resistance to pests and diseases?  
**1:02:12-1:02:17:**  You can measure increased yields but you can't measure some of the factors that go into increasing  
**1:02:17-1:02:18:**  those yields.  
**1:02:18-1:02:24:**  We're looking at the farm really in terms of what percentage of land on the farm would  
**1:02:24-1:02:30:**  we have to put into trees in order to generate enough fertility to carry on cropping at vegetables  
**1:02:30-1:02:33:**  as we are now at pretty high yields.  
**1:02:33-1:02:35:**  We do get some incredible yields.  
**1:02:35-1:02:42:**  We've just done this last few weeks or a month ago now we've finished harvesting potatoes  
**1:02:42-1:02:47:**  and we're getting yields comparable with conventional farmers on better land.  
**1:02:47-1:02:53:**  So that to us has a real financial value in that we're getting very high levels of cropping.  
**1:02:53-1:02:59:**  So in order to maintain that in terms of carbon which is really what we're looking at in the  
**1:02:59-1:03:04:**  long term is how much carbon we can put back in our soil and with green mures we can maintain  
**1:03:04-1:03:06:**  carbon but we cannot increase it particularly.  
**1:03:06-1:03:12:**  It's very difficult to maintain carbon through green mures only when you're taking crop off.  
**1:03:12-1:03:13:**  We did manage it.  
**1:03:13-1:03:16:**  We have maintained carbon for many years but we haven't seen a big increase.  
**1:03:16-1:03:20:**  With the use of round-wheel chip wood and composted chip wood we are seeing an increase  
**1:03:20-1:03:24:**  in carbon in the soil which is much more significant than it was when we only used green mures.  
**1:03:24-1:03:29:**  So looking at the long term benefit which is really the carbon element of the soil in  
**1:03:29-1:03:36:**  terms of making the soil more resilient, looking at higher yields, better pest disease resistance,  
**1:03:36-1:03:40:**  more water holding capacity, all these things have quite a profound economic benefit to  
**1:03:40-1:03:41:**  the farm.  
**1:03:41-1:03:48:**  So we're looking at around 20% of the farm would need to be growing timber crops in order  
**1:03:48-1:03:51:**  to keep this, we think, to keep this system going.  
**1:03:51-1:03:56:**  There's a popularity that we could reduce how much carbon we put on in the future because  
**1:03:56-1:03:59:**  we don't want to be just adding carbon for the sake of adding carbon.  
**1:03:59-1:04:04:**  If it gets to a point where it's getting too high because it can get too high.  
**1:04:04-1:04:07:**  There's a misconception amongst particularly organic producers that you can never have  
**1:04:07-1:04:12:**  too much organic matter in the soil, you can, you can go too high with organic matter and  
**1:04:12-1:04:14:**  that can cause all sorts of problems.  
**1:04:14-1:04:18:**  So if we saw organic matter getting too high we would reduce how much goes in.  
**1:04:18-1:04:21:**  So the idea would be to maintain what we have.  
**1:04:21-1:04:25:**  We've managed to increase it from where it was which is quite low and we get to a point  
**1:04:25-1:04:29:**  where we might suddenly say right okay we have enough carbon we can reduce how much  
**1:04:29-1:04:30:**  we put down.  
**1:04:30-1:04:35:**  So 20-25% of the farm in trees is the sort of figure we've come up with.  
**1:04:35-1:04:40:**  I mean it will vary from farm to farm, it will depend on level of cropping.  
**1:04:40-1:04:45:**  You may not need as much of that if you're doing crops which are less demanding of soil  
**1:04:45-1:04:48:**  than, I mean, horticulture is very demanding of soil.  
**1:04:48-1:04:52:**  And I think 20-25% of farm is a good working figure.  
**1:04:52-1:04:59:**  It means that you know the country as a whole needs to double its timber production in order  
**1:04:59-1:05:01:**  to maintain carbon content of soil.  
**1:05:01-1:05:05:**  I mean that's kind of a very loose figure but that's the sort of area we would be perhaps  
**1:05:05-1:05:08:**  looking at in a national sense.  
**1:05:08-1:05:13:**  We need to increase our forest area by at least the area it is now which is quite significant.  
**1:05:13-1:05:17:**  It has to be 20% of the country rather than 10%.  
**1:05:17-1:05:24:**  To recap the numbers then, you'd have to cover 20-25% of about 8 hectares if that's correct?  
**1:05:24-1:05:26:**  We've already got quite a lot of that.  
**1:05:26-1:05:27:**  We've got hedges.  
**1:05:27-1:05:33:**  Within that 8 hectares we have nearly 2,000 kilometres of hedge, 2,000 metres of hedge  
**1:05:33-1:05:36:**  which we can manage for coppicing.  
**1:05:36-1:05:37:**  We have the tree lines.  
**1:05:37-1:05:44:**  We have 0.3 of a hectare of coppice which is on a piece of land which was too wet to  
**1:05:44-1:05:45:**  produce anything else on.  
**1:05:45-1:05:48:**  It's a boggy part of the field that floods in the winter.  
**1:05:48-1:05:54:**  So we're already producing quite a lot now which hasn't interfered with cropping.  
**1:05:54-1:05:59:**  I mean we don't see this as land out of production.  
**1:05:59-1:06:04:**  We see this very much as land in production but supplementing the vegetable production.  
**1:06:04-1:06:06:**  We have to have realistic expectations.  
**1:06:06-1:06:12:**  We cannot expect to have 8 hectares 100% cropping vegetables because we have this fertility  
**1:06:12-1:06:14:**  building component.  
**1:06:14-1:06:19:**  Where people do have 100% of their farm cropping it's dependent on a huge amount of resources  
**1:06:19-1:06:23:**  coming from somewhere else either through fertilizers and rock materials or through  
**1:06:23-1:06:29:**  organic matter from some other part of the country or even some other part of the world.  
**1:06:29-1:06:36:**  So it's really about future proofing agriculture in the sense that we need to look at how sustainable  
**1:06:36-1:06:41:**  it really is in terms of nutrient input and output and also particularly so in terms of  
**1:06:41-1:06:47:**  carbon retention and also carbon building because we need to get some of the carbon  
**1:06:47-1:06:52:**  out of the atmosphere and the best way, everybody knows the best way to do it is to plant trees.  
**1:06:52-1:06:55:**  Even if you do eventually cut them down and chip them up and return that carbon so it  
**1:06:55-1:06:57:**  gets lost somewhere.  
**1:06:57-1:07:00:**  But we have to maintain that long term.  
**1:07:00-1:07:03:**  Actually this is slightly off topic but I can't help myself.  
**1:07:03-1:07:07:**  Could you just tell me what are some of the effects of having too much organic matter?  
**1:07:07-1:07:12:**  Well it depends firstly what you mean by too much because it varies from soil type to soil  
**1:07:12-1:07:13:**  type.  
**1:07:13-1:07:18:**  One of the problems that we've seen in the UK and I think it's happening in other parts  
**1:07:18-1:07:26:**  particularly where we have what we call biointensive horticulture where we have often very small  
**1:07:26-1:07:32:**  areas of land, maybe one hectare or less with very intensive raised beds dependent primarily  
**1:07:32-1:07:38:**  on all this fertility coming from outside in the form of usually compost or manure or  
**1:07:38-1:07:41:**  some organic material.  
**1:07:41-1:07:46:**  Often this material is used not really just for supporting fertility but also for controlling  
**1:07:46-1:07:52:**  weeds and where we're seeing very high inputs of organic matter over periods of time and  
**1:07:52-1:07:56:**  given that this sort of agriculture hasn't really happened much for the last more than  
**1:07:56-1:07:58:**  the last 10 years anyway.  
**1:07:58-1:08:03:**  Where we are seeing units that have been going for more than five years we've seen very high  
**1:08:03-1:08:12:**  levels of organic matter where we may have gone from 5% up to 8 or 10% in 10 years and  
**1:08:12-1:08:15:**  what we see there is very very high levels of phosphate, incredibly high.  
**1:08:15-1:08:21:**  I mean we've never seen levels this high anywhere in normal agriculture and very high levels  
**1:08:21-1:08:22:**  of potash.  
**1:08:22-1:08:26:**  Now what happens when you get particularly phosphate, well there's two problems.  
**1:08:26-1:08:31:**  One is you get phosphate leaching so all this phosphate has to go somewhere, it's not being  
**1:08:31-1:08:35:**  taken up by crops because there's just not enough crop being grown there even though  
**1:08:35-1:08:39:**  yields may be, often yields are very high on these systems, very high indeed so you  
**1:08:39-1:08:43:**  get very high yields but the crop isn't taking off anything like the amount of phosphate  
**1:08:43-1:08:47:**  that's being put on and that goes to potash as well.  
**1:08:47-1:08:54:**  So there's a danger of phosphate loss through leaching into water, groundwater and surrounding  
**1:08:54-1:09:00:**  areas so there's a potential environmental pollution problem and then there's another  
**1:09:00-1:09:04:**  problem which is more of an agronomic problem in terms of crops growing and that's where  
**1:09:04-1:09:06:**  you have very high levels of phosphate.  
**1:09:06-1:09:12:**  You can get problems with uptake of macro elements, particularly things like magnesium,  
**1:09:12-1:09:21:**  boron, molybdenum, I mean it can vary depending on soil type and initial soil levels of these  
**1:09:21-1:09:26:**  nutrients but often it leads to huge imbalances.  
**1:09:26-1:09:29:**  So what we actually have is an imbalanced soil.  
**1:09:29-1:09:33:**  We have very high potash and phosphate levels which is leading to a lock up of nutrients.  
**1:09:33-1:09:37:**  The nutrients may be there but plants can no longer assess them.  
**1:09:37-1:09:42:**  I refer to this as soil obesity.  
**1:09:42-1:09:47:**  I don't need to explain what that means, it's pretty obvious what that is.  
**1:09:47-1:09:52:**  You can overfeed soil in the same way you can overfeed animals and people.  
**1:09:52-1:09:56:**  So it's very much about over application.  
**1:09:56-1:10:00:**  Now often these intensities, and it's not exclusive to these intensive systems, it also  
**1:10:00-1:10:08:**  happens on other systems as well, but one of the other areas of these intensive systems  
**1:10:08-1:10:11:**  is that there's no tillage or almost no tillage.  
**1:10:11-1:10:13:**  So you haven't got a breakdown of organic matter.  
**1:10:13-1:10:17:**  So organic matter levels are building up even faster which sounds great, I mean this is  
**1:10:17-1:10:18:**  what we want.  
**1:10:18-1:10:23:**  We want to increase organic matter but what's happening, the mantra of more organic matter  
**1:10:23-1:10:28:**  has become the normal and this is what everybody, not everybody, but often people in very small  
**1:10:28-1:10:33:**  intensive systems have this mantra, you need to put more and more organic matter on.  
**1:10:33-1:10:39:**  Now there's been some surveys done in US and mostly US looking at some of these systems  
**1:10:39-1:10:43:**  and they've come up with some quite worrying figures and we've also done some work here  
**1:10:43-1:10:47:**  in UK or I've done some work with a colleague of mine and we've been looking at some of  
**1:10:47-1:10:51:**  these systems where they've been in place for quite a long time and we're seeing a very  
**1:10:51-1:10:56:**  common trend in that we've got these very high organic matter levels, very high phosphates  
**1:10:56-1:11:02:**  and potash, I mean in one case we've never ever seen anything so high, it was crazy.  
**1:11:02-1:11:09:**  And the reason we're looking at these is because I've been asked by the producers to try and  
**1:11:09-1:11:15:**  help because they're having some crop failures, particularly with greenhouse crops where tomatoes  
**1:11:15-1:11:19:**  are performing quite badly, they're not getting the yields they used to get and they're wondering  
**1:11:19-1:11:23:**  why and we're finding very high levels of phosphate, very high levels of organic matter.  
**1:11:23-1:11:29:**  So there is a link here, we're not sure what to do about this at the moment because the  
**1:11:29-1:11:34:**  only thing really we've been able to come up with and it's against what many people  
**1:11:34-1:11:42:**  believe in is to go back to tillage and to reduce organic matter.  
**1:11:42-1:11:47:**  I mean I was looking at soil analysis a few weeks ago and the amount of phosphate and  
**1:11:47-1:11:52:**  potash they have, they have enough to last for 20-30 years with continuous cropping,  
**1:11:52-1:11:56:**  they don't have to worry about it at all.  
**1:11:56-1:11:58:**  In a way you think well okay we don't have to put anything on the ground for a long time,  
**1:11:58-1:12:02:**  we need to maintain the organic matter but we can actually let it fall off a bit because  
**1:12:02-1:12:05:**  it was 9% and that is high.  
**1:12:05-1:12:10:**  Now I've been aware of this for a long time because I inherited soil here, we have a part  
**1:12:10-1:12:17:**  of our farm which is a wall garden, it's been in intensive food production for in excess  
**1:12:17-1:12:21:**  of a thousand years and most of that production would have been almost predominantly based  
**1:12:21-1:12:28:**  on the use of manure, mostly from human sources in the past but perhaps less so in the last  
**1:12:28-1:12:33:**  50 years but partly from animal sources as well and they would have applied quite large  
**1:12:33-1:12:34:**  amounts.  
**1:12:34-1:12:39:**  So I inherited a situation which was already very high in phosphate and potash, not ridiculously  
**1:12:39-1:12:43:**  high but it was very high and it was something I'd never experienced before and I thought  
**1:12:43-1:12:47:**  this is wonderful, this is fantastic.  
**1:12:47-1:12:53:**  However what I've seen in the last 33 years I've been using this soil, even despite what  
**1:12:53-1:12:57:**  I consider to be very modest organic inputs, we're still seeing organic matter level going  
**1:12:57-1:13:03:**  up in tunnels, not outdoors but in tunnels where it's sheltered to the point where I  
**1:13:03-1:13:09:**  have now reduced my organic inputs to once every six or seven years whereas we were doing  
**1:13:09-1:13:16:**  it once every two years originally and looking very closely at the P and K levels because  
**1:13:16-1:13:23:**  the P level is still very very high and we also have no dig in this system or we have  
**1:13:23-1:13:30:**  one section no dig and one not so we are comparing the two and seeing some obvious differences.  
**1:13:30-1:13:38:**  So there is a problem which a lot of small scale growers are really reluctant to acknowledge  
**1:13:38-1:13:42:**  to the point where they will not even get a soil analysis, they don't even believe that  
**1:13:42-1:13:48:**  soil analysis is a useful component, this is what I call Trumpism, they don't even acknowledge  
**1:13:48-1:13:55:**  that soil analysis is a useful measurement of soil health but actually we don't base  
**1:13:55-1:13:58:**  all our information on soil analysis, a lot of it is based on what you see, what you feel  
**1:13:58-1:14:03:**  and what you see growing but soil analysis is a useful way of looking at soil particularly  
**1:14:03-1:14:07:**  if you're looking at nutrients such as phosphate long term.  
**1:14:07-1:14:15:**  So whether this is going to become a national problem I don't know but with that we're seeing  
**1:14:15-1:14:21:**  there is a general trend towards these very not exclusive but generally very small units  
**1:14:21-1:14:27:**  that are accumulating vast reserves of nutrients and not utilising it.  
**1:14:27-1:14:32:**  There's another issue around this quite apart from any possible soil problems that they  
**1:14:32-1:14:33:**  might be heading towards.  
**1:14:33-1:14:40:**  There's also the problem or moral dilemma if you like in terms of why would one hectare  
**1:14:40-1:14:47:**  be using resources which could actually be feeding 50 hectares because there's only so  
**1:14:47-1:14:50:**  much organic matter and if we were to share it around they wouldn't be allowed to put  
**1:14:50-1:14:53:**  it on at its depth because it's just not available.  
**1:14:53-1:14:56:**  The reason this is happening is because it is available, it's because of green waste  
**1:14:56-1:15:02:**  compost which is often locally available to many people, the price is quite low, the price  
**1:15:02-1:15:08:**  in the UK really is transport only and the material is almost free because there's a  
**1:15:08-1:15:15:**  lot of it because of the increase in composting sites by local councils, by local companies  
**1:15:15-1:15:21:**  who are processing increasingly more and more organic waste which we always thought was  
**1:15:21-1:15:26:**  fantastic but we were hoping was going to happen 40 years ago and finally it has.  
**1:15:26-1:15:32:**  So there is a moral issue around the use of very very heavy dressings of material which  
**1:15:32-1:15:38:**  could be doing the same amount of benefit to soils but spread over a much wider area.  
**1:15:38-1:15:45:**  Ian, I think we've moved away from trees but I'm so happy we did allow ourselves this because  
**1:15:45-1:15:48:**  it's fascinating what you're telling us and you're putting your finger exactly on what  
**1:15:48-1:15:56:**  Dimitri and I have been trying to fight against is that as soon as you have simple mantras  
**1:15:56-1:16:00:**  that are all encompassing and final you always discover that there's more complexity and  
**1:16:00-1:16:05:**  nuance and problems and I had no idea that it was the case with these problems with no  
**1:16:05-1:16:09:**  dig market gardening and it's really interesting that you're bringing this insight, I'm so  
**1:16:09-1:16:10:**  happy you are.  
**1:16:10-1:16:17:**  Well it is interesting and it's part of the evolution of what we do and if you told me  
**1:16:17-1:16:21:**  this 20 years ago I wouldn't have believed you because I also felt that more organic  
**1:16:21-1:16:25:**  matter was better and that you couldn't put too much on, that's what we've been led to  
**1:16:25-1:16:26:**  believe.  
**1:16:26-1:16:31:**  But there's been some really interesting trials studies done in the US looking at long term  
**1:16:31-1:16:33:**  situations where organic matter has been put on.  
**1:16:33-1:16:40:**  If you look at very small scale domestic gardens, people's backyards, which tend to get huge  
**1:16:40-1:16:45:**  amounts of organic matter because they are small and this is showing up some quite horrendous  
**1:16:45-1:16:49:**  levels of nutrients.  
**1:16:49-1:16:53:**  In a back garden it's not such a big problem but if you scale that up to several hectares  
**1:16:53-1:16:57:**  and it's next to a stream or it's near a public water supply then there's an issue around  
**1:16:57-1:16:58:**  that.  
**1:16:58-1:17:00:**  The nitrate problem is another issue.  
**1:17:00-1:17:07:**  Some of these very intensive small scale operations are putting on in excess of 500kg of nitrogen  
**1:17:07-1:17:11:**  per year and that has to go somewhere too.  
**1:17:11-1:17:14:**  It doesn't disappear, it has to go into the environment.  
**1:17:14-1:17:17:**  It's either going up as nitrous oxide into the atmosphere or it's going into the water  
**1:17:17-1:17:22:**  and causing nitrates and nitrites which is another issue in terms of water quality.  
**1:17:22-1:17:31:**  So there are several potentially contentious problems which are coming up as a result of  
**1:17:31-1:17:35:**  what people think is a very organic system.  
**1:17:35-1:17:38:**  The organic certification has largely ignored this.  
**1:17:38-1:17:42:**  I've had some meetings with them in the last year about this.  
**1:17:42-1:17:45:**  They weren't actually aware of the issues around this because they haven't been asking  
**1:17:45-1:17:47:**  the questions.  
**1:17:47-1:17:52:**  And also these systems actually almost never fall within organic standards.  
**1:17:52-1:17:55:**  They may be certified but actually if you look at organic standards they're not conforming  
**1:17:55-1:18:01:**  to standards at all because they're importing vast amounts of fertility from somewhere else.  
**1:18:01-1:18:07:**  So there is going to have to be a change and there is one or two people now acknowledging  
**1:18:07-1:18:14:**  that this is a problem for the future and the process of awareness I think has started.  
**1:18:14-1:18:20:**  I may have upset some people a year ago because I wrote an article in one of our organic magazines  
**1:18:20-1:18:27:**  which pissed a few people off but at least people are talking about it and they're looking  
**1:18:27-1:18:31:**  a bit more closely at their soil now than they used to and that's good.  
**1:18:31-1:18:33:**  I don't condemn people for what they do.  
**1:18:33-1:18:36:**  They thought they were doing the right thing.  
**1:18:36-1:18:42:**  We did lots of things in the past which were dodgy and we're still doing something which  
**1:18:42-1:18:43:**  is slightly dodgy.  
**1:18:43-1:18:47:**  We're aware of it and we want to change it and this is the important thing that if a  
**1:18:47-1:18:51:**  part of your system is not right you need to be looking at it and thinking how you're  
**1:18:51-1:18:52:**  going to change it.  
**1:18:52-1:18:57:**  In terms of composting do you add anything to the wood chips you compost or all the nutrition  
**1:18:57-1:18:59:**  is coming from the wood chips?  
**1:18:59-1:19:00:**  Yeah we have two heaps.  
**1:19:00-1:19:05:**  We have one which is pure 100% wood chip and we have another which has some other material  
**1:19:05-1:19:11:**  which is really waste vegetables from our production so where we're packing and distributing  
**1:19:11-1:19:13:**  there's always a bit of waste.  
**1:19:13-1:19:18:**  Where we're cleaning out greenhouses and tunnels from crop residues that goes on so all the  
**1:19:18-1:19:22:**  foliage from tomatoes and peppers that goes on there.  
**1:19:22-1:19:24:**  It's quite a small amount of other material.  
**1:19:24-1:19:28:**  I mean it's less than 10% by volume.  
**1:19:28-1:19:31:**  It's probably only 5% so it's still predominantly wood chip.  
**1:19:31-1:19:34:**  Oh we put a bit of cardboard on there as well.  
**1:19:34-1:19:40:**  Any packaging goes on there but no it's pretty much still just we don't add anything.  
**1:19:40-1:19:41:**  We don't need to add anything.  
**1:19:41-1:19:45:**  We only use it because it's a really useful way of getting rid of waste materials.  
**1:19:45-1:19:49:**  I know that you're currently using a diversity of species but let's say you were to continue  
**1:19:49-1:19:53:**  planting specifically for compost making or for ram your wood.  
**1:19:53-1:19:59:**  Are there certain species that you think are more appropriate and others that are to avoid?  
**1:19:59-1:20:00:**  Well that's interesting.  
**1:20:00-1:20:05:**  I mean the one which has been we've used the most of is the willow.  
**1:20:05-1:20:09:**  It's a common white willow so it's Salix alba.  
**1:20:09-1:20:13:**  I mean this has been really successful A because it grows really fast.  
**1:20:13-1:20:15:**  B it grows on really poor land.  
**1:20:15-1:20:20:**  You don't need good land and even on relatively dry land it still produces quite a high yield.  
**1:20:20-1:20:21:**  It's easy to manage.  
**1:20:21-1:20:24:**  You know we cut it on a seven year rotation.  
**1:20:24-1:20:26:**  We get quite large material from that.  
**1:20:26-1:20:28:**  It's very easy to mechanize.  
**1:20:28-1:20:33:**  You could mechanize this completely if you had enough area to do it and it appears to  
**1:20:33-1:20:35:**  produce a really good result.  
**1:20:35-1:20:37:**  I mean as ram your wood it breaks down quickly.  
**1:20:37-1:20:41:**  It has lots of fungal activity.  
**1:20:41-1:20:44:**  The willow when it's growing is also biodiverse rich.  
**1:20:44-1:20:47:**  It has huge numbers of insects living within it.  
**1:20:47-1:20:50:**  It attracts lots of birds.  
**1:20:50-1:20:51:**  It sort of ticks all the boxes.  
**1:20:51-1:20:52:**  It's indigenous.  
**1:20:52-1:20:55:**  There's so many right things about it.  
**1:20:55-1:21:02:**  However I'm always slightly wary of single species anything so I would want to add other  
**1:21:02-1:21:04:**  things to that.  
**1:21:04-1:21:07:**  Hazel we've used also because we're coppice and that for our haze.  
**1:21:07-1:21:10:**  That's also produced really good wood chip.  
**1:21:10-1:21:16:**  It's not as productive as willow but it's a harder wood so you may get as much carbon  
**1:21:16-1:21:17:**  over the same period of time.  
**1:21:17-1:21:21:**  I don't know how different species compare in terms of carbon production.  
**1:21:21-1:21:25:**  I mean if we were to look at the ultimate test it would be how much carbon can we produce  
**1:21:25-1:21:27:**  in one year from one hectare.  
**1:21:27-1:21:32:**  I mean that would be the ultimate but I still think a single species perhaps is not ideal.  
**1:21:32-1:21:36:**  I think to add species adds greater diversity to what we're doing.  
**1:21:36-1:21:41:**  It adds more in terms of potential fungi and different bacteria and all the things that  
**1:21:41-1:21:42:**  live on wood.  
**1:21:42-1:21:43:**  So I would add hazel.  
**1:21:43-1:21:45:**  I would also add ash.  
**1:21:45-1:21:47:**  I mean ash is a fantastic timber in UK.  
**1:21:47-1:21:48:**  It grows everywhere.  
**1:21:48-1:21:52:**  Unfortunately we now have this disease which is affecting the ash.  
**1:21:52-1:22:00:**  So there is going to be a vast amount of ash going into wood burners, into chipping.  
**1:22:00-1:22:01:**  It's going to be available.  
**1:22:01-1:22:04:**  Whether it's going to be available long term I don't know.  
**1:22:04-1:22:09:**  But ash would be if it's possible to grow it in the present conditions with disease  
**1:22:09-1:22:11:**  then I would go for ash as well.  
**1:22:11-1:22:13:**  So we're really looking at hardwoods.  
**1:22:13-1:22:14:**  It is hardwood.  
**1:22:14-1:22:15:**  It's indigenous hardwoods.  
**1:22:15-1:22:19:**  I'm sure there's hundreds of other species we could be looking at.  
**1:22:19-1:22:21:**  Some of them may not even be indigenous.  
**1:22:21-1:22:25:**  It could be non-indigenous species which are perfectly acceptable in every sense of the  
**1:22:25-1:22:26:**  word.  
**1:22:26-1:22:31:**  I think because we don't really have a lot of experience with it I think there's huge  
**1:22:31-1:22:37:**  room for experimentation in the future on this looking at different varieties both in  
**1:22:37-1:22:41:**  terms of their woodchipped potential but also in terms of their biological function on the  
**1:22:41-1:22:43:**  farm when they're not being chipped.  
**1:22:43-1:22:49:**  Just to understand the machinery involved, if you have a lot of trees to woodchip do  
**1:22:49-1:22:53:**  you rent a big chipper once a year or do you have your own machinery?  
**1:22:53-1:22:55:**  Yes we wouldn't want to own a machine.  
**1:22:55-1:22:58:**  It's not worth it for something which is only one or two days a year.  
**1:22:58-1:23:01:**  So we have a contractor, in fact it's the person that brings our woodchip.  
**1:23:01-1:23:06:**  He's a tree surgeon, he has a large machine which is self-propelled.  
**1:23:06-1:23:09:**  It's about 30 horsepower.  
**1:23:09-1:23:10:**  It's pretty cheap.  
**1:23:10-1:23:15:**  I mean we've looked at the cost of doing this per cubic meter and also we're also looking  
**1:23:15-1:23:19:**  at how much carbon we use in the process through the diesel.  
**1:23:19-1:23:23:**  It's incredibly efficient in that sense.  
**1:23:23-1:23:25:**  The cost to us is quite low.  
**1:23:25-1:23:30:**  He comes and spends maybe just two days chipping up vast amounts of material.  
**1:23:30-1:23:33:**  He can do 50 cubic meters in that time.  
**1:23:33-1:23:40:**  Yes, it wouldn't be worth buying this machine in or even hiring it in and doing it ourselves.  
**1:23:40-1:23:43:**  He does the whole job for us and that suits us very nicely.  
**1:23:43-1:23:48:**  And in terms of turning the compost when you're actually composting woodchips, do you just  
**1:23:48-1:23:50:**  do it with a front unloader or do you have a specialized machine?  
**1:23:50-1:23:56:**  No, I have a swing shovel which I hire in for a week every three months so it's a medium  
**1:23:56-1:23:58:**  sized digger.  
**1:23:58-1:23:59:**  A loader is not suitable.  
**1:23:59-1:24:01:**  You need a lot of space for loaders.  
**1:24:01-1:24:04:**  It's quite slow.  
**1:24:04-1:24:08:**  The excavator is much better because it can turn 360 degrees.  
**1:24:08-1:24:09:**  You get a much better mixing.  
**1:24:09-1:24:11:**  It's much quicker.  
**1:24:11-1:24:19:**  I can turn 200 cubic meters of that material in just a day.  
**1:24:19-1:24:21:**  It's pretty efficient actually.  
**1:24:21-1:24:24:**  In that machine I can hire in for 300 pence a week.  
**1:24:24-1:24:25:**  It's not a big cost.  
**1:24:25-1:24:31:**  And you've mentioned cost a few times and I know you might not have numbers in the top  
**1:24:31-1:24:35:**  of your head but is there anything you can share in terms of the cost of different methods  
**1:24:35-1:24:39:**  of woodchips or compost if you've done those calculations?  
**1:24:39-1:24:43:**  The only figures I've got in my head which I can remember are to do with our plant grazing  
**1:24:43-1:24:49:**  substrate which we compared with buying material in.  
**1:24:49-1:24:53:**  It even allows the fact that there's a fair bit of hand labour that goes into this process.  
**1:24:53-1:24:58:**  We're only doing about six or seven cubic meters a year so it gets picked up several  
**1:24:58-1:25:01:**  times by hand by shovel.  
**1:25:01-1:25:07:**  The cost is comparable with buying in and I think the figure I came up with was something  
**1:25:07-1:25:10:**  like 20 pence per litre finished.  
**1:25:10-1:25:12:**  So it's comparable in that sense.  
**1:25:12-1:25:17:**  We could cut the cost of that dramatically if we had some relatively simple mechanisation  
**1:25:17-1:25:21:**  which on our scale we probably ought to have.  
**1:25:21-1:25:27:**  Well we have recently invested in a sieve, a large sieve because we were sieving by hand.  
**1:25:27-1:25:28:**  Now we have a rotary sieve.  
**1:25:28-1:25:33:**  I haven't costed it now but that's cut the time of production by more than a third so  
**1:25:33-1:25:34:**  that's had a huge effect.  
**1:25:34-1:25:41:**  I mean for the sake of spending 300, 400 euros we saved that back in just the first couple  
**1:25:41-1:25:42:**  of mixes really.  
**1:25:42-1:25:48:**  And as a final question, what kind of advice would you give to a vegetable grower wanting  
**1:25:48-1:25:54:**  to integrate trees both in terms of things not to do and maybe things to do as well?  
**1:25:54-1:25:58:**  Well the first thing to do is to think about it for quite a while and really do research  
**1:25:58-1:26:01:**  and more research than I did.  
**1:26:01-1:26:03:**  I don't think I did enough.  
**1:26:03-1:26:09:**  Looking and seeing and talking to other people that are doing it I think is absolutely essential  
**1:26:09-1:26:12:**  because you can only do research so much from a laptop.  
**1:26:12-1:26:14:**  You need to get out there and have a look.  
**1:26:14-1:26:17:**  I think that's probably the first thing I would say.  
**1:26:17-1:26:21:**  In terms of pitfalls I think choice of varieties is always difficult.  
**1:26:21-1:26:26:**  I made a mistake with birch again because I was probably somewhat lacking in knowledge  
**1:26:26-1:26:31:**  and because the people that were contributing towards advice would have no experience with  
**1:26:31-1:26:32:**  growing vegetables whatsoever.  
**1:26:32-1:26:38:**  They were really used to grassland and arable fields so they hadn't considered the possibility  
**1:26:38-1:26:42:**  of roots spreading across the field too far from that species either.  
**1:26:42-1:26:47:**  So choice of species I think is really important.  
**1:26:47-1:26:52:**  I think above all else is to take time in consideration.  
**1:26:52-1:26:54:**  This is not something to rush into.  
**1:26:54-1:26:59:**  I think you need to have a season or several seasons to think about it and certainly be  
**1:26:59-1:27:01:**  looking at what other people are doing.  
**1:27:01-1:27:02:**  Well thank you so much.  
**1:27:02-1:27:06:**  It's been really fascinating and we've learned a lot through this episode.  
**1:27:06-1:27:08:**  So thanks for taking the time in your busy schedule to talk to us.  
**1:27:08-1:27:09:**  That's good.  
**1:27:09-1:27:16:**  It's my pleasure and hope to meet up at some point in the future.  
**1:27:16-1:27:20:**  That's all for today and thank you for making it this far in the podcast.  
**1:27:20-1:27:24:**  I really would like to thank Tyrion for chipping in with some questions.

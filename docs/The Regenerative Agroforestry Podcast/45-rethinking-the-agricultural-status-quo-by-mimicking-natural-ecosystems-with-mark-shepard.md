### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Fri, 16 Sep 2022 16:56:36)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:46:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:46-0:00:50:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:50-0:00:55:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we have the immense pleasure of hosting Mark Shepherd  
**0:00:55-0:00:56:**  on the show.  
**0:00:56-0:01:01:**  For those that don't know Mark, he is the CEO of Forest Agriculture Enterprises, the  
**0:01:01-0:01:07:**  founder of Restoration Agriculture Development and the author of Restoration Agriculture  
**0:01:07-0:01:09:**  as well as Water for Any Farm.  
**0:01:09-0:01:16:**  He is also the founder and farmer of New Forest Farm, a 106 acre perennial agricultural savanna.  
**0:01:16-0:01:21:**  In this interview, we're going to talk a lot about Mark's radically different approach  
**0:01:21-0:01:28:**  to farming, one which is based on deep biomimicry, based in the context of his farm in Wisconsin,  
**0:01:28-0:01:31:**  USA, which is as I said, New Forest Farm.  
**0:01:31-0:01:37:**  So we had a fascinating talk here, delving into subjects that we don't usually delve  
**0:01:37-0:01:38:**  into into the show.  
**0:01:38-0:01:41:**  So I really, really hope you enjoy it.  
**0:01:41-0:01:44:**  Don't hesitate if you would like to complement some of the things we discussed with some  
**0:01:44-0:01:46:**  visual representations.  
**0:01:46-0:01:48:**  Mark has lots of content online.  
**0:01:48-0:01:49:**  Please check it out.  
**0:01:49-0:01:53:**  Maybe it gives you a bit of a more tangible idea of what we discussed today.  
**0:01:53-0:01:55:**  Thank you so much and I hope you enjoy.  
**0:01:55-0:01:58:**  Hello Mark and welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:58-0:01:59:**  Greetings Dimitri.  
**0:01:59-0:02:08:**  So we usually start with our guests by explaining a bit of your story and how you got to where  
**0:02:08-0:02:16:**  you are now in your path of agriculture and agroforestry.  
**0:02:16-0:02:18:**  You got 30 years.  
**0:02:18-0:02:27:**  I suppose it kind of all started right around the early 1970s.  
**0:02:27-0:02:31:**  I grew up in what became an industrial wasteland.  
**0:02:31-0:02:36:**  It was all mostly manufacturing, both light and heavy manufacturing and it was when the  
**0:02:36-0:02:43:**  US adopted tax policies to deliberately encourage companies to leave the US and set up camp  
**0:02:43-0:02:47:**  in other countries around the world because it was lower cost and good for the economy  
**0:02:47-0:02:49:**  and all that kind of stuff.  
**0:02:49-0:02:52:**  The manufacturing sector collapsed.  
**0:02:52-0:02:57:**  My dad went from having one good manufacturing job to having four jobs that sucked and not  
**0:02:57-0:02:59:**  being enough.  
**0:02:59-0:03:04:**  We ended up having a really large garden in order to supposedly feed ourselves and yet  
**0:03:04-0:03:07:**  we had to constantly go to the store to buy food.  
**0:03:07-0:03:11:**  Why was it that we had an acre garden and we couldn't even feed ourselves?  
**0:03:11-0:03:16:**  We had to buy our staple foods, meat, bread, milk and that sort of thing.  
**0:03:16-0:03:25:**  It also coincided with the oil embargo when crude supplies to the US were cut off by the  
**0:03:25-0:03:30:**  OPEC nations and there were gas lines, miles and miles longs.  
**0:03:30-0:03:33:**  I decided that I didn't want to live that way.  
**0:03:33-0:03:38:**  I wanted to escape somehow.  
**0:03:38-0:03:42:**  Because I had the experience of gardening, my dad went to a lot of gardening groups.  
**0:03:42-0:03:50:**  We hung out with a lot of the people who were like some of the pioneers in the organic movement.  
**0:03:50-0:03:57:**  Prior to the current or the most recent flourishing of organic, when I first remember my dad going  
**0:03:57-0:04:03:**  to organic growers meetings, there was a different name over the door of the library of where  
**0:04:03-0:04:04:**  we were supposed to go meeting.  
**0:04:04-0:04:10:**  I said, but dad, it was like eight or 10 or whatever, aren't we supposed to go to the  
**0:04:10-0:04:14:**  library, he puts his hand over my mouth because back then if you said the word organic, you  
**0:04:14-0:04:18:**  could get arrested for being a socialist and lose your job.  
**0:04:18-0:04:22:**  And then boy how things have changed.  
**0:04:22-0:04:26:**  So it was like Heinz Grotzky was a greenhouse grower.  
**0:04:26-0:04:33:**  John and Helen Philbrick ran the Biodynamic Association near us and they were big mentors  
**0:04:33-0:04:37:**  of my dad's.  
**0:04:37-0:04:42:**  Robert Rodale, my dad knew Robert Rodale, we went to meetings with them.  
**0:04:42-0:04:47:**  Scott and Helen Nearing, homesteaders extraordinaire that wrote all kinds of books about homesteading.  
**0:04:47-0:04:50:**  So those are some of my early, early influences.  
**0:04:50-0:04:56:**  And then I just naturally gravitated toward that when I finally managed to escape the  
**0:04:56-0:04:58:**  industrial wasteland.  
**0:04:58-0:05:10:**  And part of my whole perspective on the agroforestry take is that there's somewhat of a myth out  
**0:05:10-0:05:14:**  there that there's all these young people that want to get into farming.  
**0:05:14-0:05:22:**  That's not true for one, but for two is if you get into farming for the cash flows from  
**0:05:22-0:05:25:**  farming, you'll probably fail.  
**0:05:25-0:05:31:**  If you get into farming as a way to manage your real estate asset of which you are an  
**0:05:31-0:05:34:**  investor, that's a different story.  
**0:05:34-0:05:42:**  And so in order for me to escape the industrial suburbs, I started taking a bunch of get rich  
**0:05:42-0:05:48:**  quick real estate seminars and became a real estate finder for somebody where I would find  
**0:05:48-0:05:54:**  a property, get an accepted offer and then hand it over to them and I'd just get a check  
**0:05:54-0:05:57:**  for finding them a piece of property that they would take over.  
**0:05:57-0:06:04:**  So I learned about how to purchase real estate when I was still like 17 or 18 maybe at the  
**0:06:04-0:06:05:**  earliest.  
**0:06:05-0:06:15:**  It was about that time that J. Russell Smith's book Tree Crops was reissued with the introduction  
**0:06:15-0:06:20:**  by Wendell Berry who was also one of my big inspirations back then.  
**0:06:20-0:06:22:**  And it just dawned on me.  
**0:06:22-0:06:25:**  Here I'd been living at home with my parents.  
**0:06:25-0:06:28:**  We had one of the biggest gardens of anybody I knew and it still didn't produce all of  
**0:06:28-0:06:29:**  our food.  
**0:06:29-0:06:33:**  And anybody who's ever had a garden knows that you got to go out, either till the soil  
**0:06:33-0:06:35:**  or mulch it deeply.  
**0:06:35-0:06:38:**  And there was this lady who lived up the road from us called Ruth Stout.  
**0:06:38-0:06:42:**  She started writing all these books about deep mulch and stuff like that.  
**0:06:42-0:06:44:**  Even that was a ridiculous amount of work.  
**0:06:44-0:06:46:**  Tilling the ground was a lot of work.  
**0:06:46-0:06:48:**  Gathering mulch was a lot of work.  
**0:06:48-0:06:51:**  And your garden has to be out in full sun.  
**0:06:51-0:06:52:**  So it's hot.  
**0:06:52-0:06:53:**  It's wet.  
**0:06:53-0:06:57:**  And you're trying to hoe weeds and all this kind of stuff and getting covered with dirt  
**0:06:57-0:06:59:**  and mud that's running down you.  
**0:06:59-0:07:00:**  There's tests and diseases to deal with.  
**0:07:00-0:07:05:**  It was just a real lot of work for a bunch of carrots that you throw in the soup.  
**0:07:05-0:07:07:**  It doesn't really feed the family.  
**0:07:07-0:07:14:**  And so whenever I'd be done with my responsibilities as a kid, I'd go run off into the woods and  
**0:07:14-0:07:16:**  just explore and play.  
**0:07:16-0:07:25:**  And there were hazelnuts, chestnuts, but hickory nuts, and grapes and blueberries and winter  
**0:07:25-0:07:30:**  green berries and all kinds of stuff out in the woods to eat for free.  
**0:07:30-0:07:32:**  And nobody took care of it at all.  
**0:07:32-0:07:39:**  And I was sitting on the edge of the woods where I was the primary forest manager.  
**0:07:39-0:07:44:**  By the time I was a teenager, the oil embargo kind of stimulated my parents to get a wood  
**0:07:44-0:07:45:**  stove.  
**0:07:45-0:07:49:**  They were burning wood as a supplemental heat for the house.  
**0:07:49-0:07:53:**  I was sitting on a rock reading tree crops by J. Russell Smith.  
**0:07:53-0:08:00:**  He's talking about planting trees to produce seed for livestock feed.  
**0:08:00-0:08:04:**  And then we would grow our own human food underneath in this two-story agriculture.  
**0:08:04-0:08:05:**  And I could easily see it.  
**0:08:05-0:08:07:**  There's the garden right over there out in the open.  
**0:08:07-0:08:09:**  And here's the forest over here.  
**0:08:09-0:08:13:**  Why not reach over here, grab the garden, pull it in under the forest, and let's reach  
**0:08:13-0:08:17:**  over there and grab the forest and put it on top of the garden.  
**0:08:17-0:08:22:**  We now have twice as much going on over all of our land base instead of this is here and  
**0:08:22-0:08:24:**  that's here and this is here and that's here.  
**0:08:24-0:08:30:**  And that kind of just dawned on me that, oh my gosh, this is brilliant to have both trees  
**0:08:30-0:08:34:**  and, you know, farm crops, garden crops, livestock grazing.  
**0:08:34-0:08:41:**  We had goats and pigs as a kid for livestock just for supplemental food and all that kind  
**0:08:41-0:08:44:**  of stuff and the goats for brush clearing.  
**0:08:44-0:08:53:**  And it was in part because I was exposed to agroforestry within a somewhat natural forest  
**0:08:53-0:09:01:**  context and not necessarily an orchard context that to me, why would I just plant an orchard  
**0:09:01-0:09:04:**  because there were orchards, apple orchards near us.  
**0:09:04-0:09:08:**  Why would I plant an orchard with only apples when they have to go out and they got to spray  
**0:09:08-0:09:10:**  75,000 times a week.  
**0:09:10-0:09:13:**  They got to do this and that and the other thing and then they whine about the fact that  
**0:09:13-0:09:17:**  at the end of the day, they don't have enough money to cover all their costs.  
**0:09:17-0:09:22:**  It's like, well, wait a minute, I get perfectly good apples out here and nobody did anything  
**0:09:22-0:09:24:**  to them.  
**0:09:24-0:09:28:**  And so those two things kind of combined, it's like, well, if I'm going to do it, I'm  
**0:09:28-0:09:35:**  going to mimic natural ecosystems and manage natural ecosystems to produce food fuels medicines,  
**0:09:35-0:09:42:**  fiber, not just carrots or celery, but a full complete diet by managing an ecosystem.  
**0:09:42-0:09:46:**  And that's really the foundation of restoration agriculture, right?  
**0:09:46-0:09:53:**  Which is the, let's say the type of agriculture which you have created throughout these years.  
**0:09:53-0:10:00:**  Correct me if I'm wrong in the way that I'm explaining it, but maybe you could then explain  
**0:10:00-0:10:05:**  to us or refine the definition for our listeners of what is restoration agriculture, which  
**0:10:05-0:10:09:**  I would also advise our listeners to check out your book, which I have read.  
**0:10:09-0:10:14:**  And as a disclaimer, also say that I've done a course with you to our listeners when I  
**0:10:14-0:10:19:**  started off in this whole path five years ago.  
**0:10:19-0:10:23:**  And so I have a bit of an idea of a better idea of what it is.  
**0:10:23-0:10:27:**  And I really look forward to delving into some of the details with you and some of the  
**0:10:27-0:10:30:**  questions that I've been wanting to ask you for many years, I guess.  
**0:10:30-0:10:31:**  Good.  
**0:10:31-0:10:38:**  But maybe, yeah, for our listeners then, could you just give a bit of a summary as to what  
**0:10:38-0:10:43:**  is restoration agriculture based on, of course, the last sentences that you've said, which  
**0:10:43-0:10:44:**  are fundamental.  
**0:10:44-0:10:54:**  So I deliberately chose the name restoration and agriculture to address two different parts  
**0:10:54-0:10:58:**  of a polarity that really doesn't and shouldn't exist.  
**0:10:58-0:11:04:**  There's ecological restorationists that, you know, because I went on to college, went back  
**0:11:04-0:11:09:**  for ecology and got into doing some ecological restoration.  
**0:11:09-0:11:16:**  Ecological restoration meant and still does to a large extent, trying to replicate an  
**0:11:16-0:11:21:**  ecological form that was existing at one point in time that somebody wrote down a long time  
**0:11:21-0:11:23:**  ago and then arrest it there.  
**0:11:23-0:11:28:**  And if those plants didn't exist there back then, we got to get rid of them now with herbicide.  
**0:11:28-0:11:33:**  And if they don't, plants don't exist there now, we go plant them at another expense.  
**0:11:33-0:11:40:**  So ecological restoration is 100% all expense, unless you're playing conservation easements  
**0:11:40-0:11:44:**  game and selling development rights, which we won't get into, that the act of ecological  
**0:11:44-0:11:46:**  restoration is all expense.  
**0:11:46-0:11:51:**  Well, then agriculture was like, oh, we got to get rid of nature, get rid of everything  
**0:11:51-0:11:58:**  that was here to plant our crop, which is a limited number of species that we put in  
**0:11:58-0:11:59:**  the ground.  
**0:11:59-0:12:05:**  Well, when you eliminate nature, you eliminate all of the ecosystem services that nature  
**0:12:05-0:12:07:**  provides for itself.  
**0:12:07-0:12:12:**  And you as a farmer or an orchardist, you now have to supply those inputs.  
**0:12:12-0:12:16:**  You have to manage fertility, which nature takes care of on its own.  
**0:12:16-0:12:21:**  You have to manage pest control, which nature takes care of on its own, disease control.  
**0:12:21-0:12:25:**  You have to manage the breeding and the genetic selection.  
**0:12:25-0:12:28:**  You have to manage the whole entire thing.  
**0:12:28-0:12:31:**  And then you wonder why it's expensive.  
**0:12:31-0:12:42:**  Both of those forms, I think, are bastardizations of something that actually is amazingly powerful,  
**0:12:42-0:12:44:**  which is nature itself.  
**0:12:44-0:12:51:**  As far as we know, nature itself has been operating just fine since the beginning of  
**0:12:51-0:12:57:**  when it actually started, whether it was 6,000 years ago or 4 billion years ago, depending  
**0:12:57-0:12:59:**  on what reference material you're looking at.  
**0:12:59-0:13:05:**  It's been operating just fine, thank you very much, without us having to manage it and add  
**0:13:05-0:13:08:**  inputs to it.  
**0:13:08-0:13:15:**  It's managed during volcanic cataclysms, ice ages, slammed by asteroids.  
**0:13:15-0:13:17:**  There's been huge massive extinctions.  
**0:13:17-0:13:20:**  Think about the last massive extinction before this prior one.  
**0:13:20-0:13:27:**  They said like 75, 80% or something like that of all life on Earth disappeared.  
**0:13:27-0:13:34:**  And when that asteroid hit the Yucatan, probably a wall of heat, some 8,000 degrees, roars  
**0:13:34-0:13:35:**  around the planet.  
**0:13:35-0:13:37:**  Stuff burns to a crisp.  
**0:13:37-0:13:38:**  And yet look what came out of it.  
**0:13:38-0:13:41:**  The most amazingly fertile soils that we've ever experienced.  
**0:13:41-0:13:48:**  A huge diversity of animals all over the place and plant life, rain forests and arctic tundra  
**0:13:48-0:13:50:**  and boreal forests.  
**0:13:50-0:13:52:**  And it did it all.  
**0:13:52-0:13:58:**  It increased the fertility of soils and had this amazing proliferation of life with zero  
**0:13:58-0:14:01:**  help from us, period.  
**0:14:01-0:14:05:**  That is an unstoppable force of nature.  
**0:14:05-0:14:13:**  And I happen to invest in that and I trust that 100,000 times more than I trust something  
**0:14:13-0:14:16:**  from a bottle that you put with water and spray all over everything.  
**0:14:16-0:14:20:**  So back to the definition.  
**0:14:20-0:14:27:**  Restoration agriculture is ecological restoration of a particular kind.  
**0:14:27-0:14:28:**  We do ecological restoration.  
**0:14:28-0:14:34:**  We mimic the regionally adapted plant community types.  
**0:14:34-0:14:39:**  And then we cherry pick out of that a selection of species that provide food, fuels, medicines  
**0:14:39-0:14:41:**  or fibers.  
**0:14:41-0:14:48:**  Then we strive to manage that ecosystem with the same types of disturbance regime that  
**0:14:48-0:14:55:**  it would have been managed naturally during its whole entire life cycle.  
**0:14:55-0:15:04:**  And so what I have found is the fact that my input costs have almost disappeared.  
**0:15:04-0:15:11:**  Yields per individual crop have gone down below what the chemical people are getting.  
**0:15:11-0:15:17:**  But it doesn't matter because the input costs have gone so far down that the spread between  
**0:15:17-0:15:22:**  inputs and actual yields is bigger.  
**0:15:22-0:15:26:**  And it may not pay me $85 million a year salary.  
**0:15:26-0:15:31:**  But what it does, and this is key to the whole thing, is there is enough of a cash flow coming  
**0:15:31-0:15:36:**  off of that system, one, to feed the family that is there, to supply a surplus of food  
**0:15:36-0:15:38:**  going out into the market.  
**0:15:38-0:15:42:**  And I have sold all of the produce that we have grown here wholesale and I have done  
**0:15:42-0:15:43:**  it on purpose.  
**0:15:43-0:15:48:**  Because this is not a niche specialty market that only wealthy people can afford.  
**0:15:48-0:15:52:**  This is wholesale quantities and wholesale price for the products that have come off  
**0:15:52-0:15:54:**  this farm.  
**0:15:54-0:16:01:**  It will supply wholesale markets, feed the family or families that are managing the property,  
**0:16:01-0:16:06:**  and most importantly actually is it's paying for all of the different investments that  
**0:16:06-0:16:09:**  we are doing on the property.  
**0:16:09-0:16:21:**  This land right here was maybe 30% abandoned corn fields when we got here, 50% or so percent,  
**0:16:21-0:16:28:**  60% pasture that was overgrazed, like small, short as a golf course green, and a little  
**0:16:28-0:16:33:**  patch of woods that they had totally logged over so it was like stump sprouts and trees  
**0:16:33-0:16:36:**  that were about 3 inch diameter when we took over.  
**0:16:36-0:16:40:**  No buildings, no well, no nothing, all of the infrastructure that you see, the building  
**0:16:40-0:16:48:**  that we are in, notice those boards back there, those are milled from trees that I planted.  
**0:16:48-0:16:54:**  So restoration agriculture goes to a site and if you buy a degraded site, it's below  
**0:16:54-0:16:58:**  market value as far as real estate is concerned.  
**0:16:58-0:17:03:**  Then we use the agriculture, we use restoration agriculture to develop the asset, to plant  
**0:17:03-0:17:09:**  all these trees, to build all the buildings, drill the wells, etc. etc.  
**0:17:09-0:17:13:**  So the gain that we get is disproportionately greater than somebody else.  
**0:17:13-0:17:19:**  If you buy a beautiful farm, fertile soils and well watered and all this kind of beautiful  
**0:17:19-0:17:21:**  stuff about this farm, you are paying top dollar for it.  
**0:17:21-0:17:26:**  And if you expect to go ahead and cash flow with your agriculture to pay for all of that,  
**0:17:26-0:17:28:**  you are hallucinating.  
**0:17:28-0:17:30:**  That's very interesting.  
**0:17:30-0:17:36:**  Just to get a sense of the economics and the cash flow that you are able to generate, let's  
**0:17:36-0:17:37:**  just start with one detail.  
**0:17:37-0:17:38:**  What's the size of your farm?  
**0:17:38-0:17:44:**  The farm is 106 acres US, so what's that, 45 hectare plus.  
**0:17:44-0:17:45:**  Yeah, approximately.  
**0:17:45-0:17:55:**  Okay, so we've got on about 45 hectares and that is able, that amount of land and the  
**0:17:55-0:18:01:**  way that you've planted it, which we're going to go into in a bit, that's able to supply  
**0:18:01-0:18:06:**  the cash flow needs, the cash needs of a family.  
**0:18:06-0:18:07:**  Correct.  
**0:18:07-0:18:08:**  Or more.  
**0:18:08-0:18:09:**  Correct.  
**0:18:09-0:18:10:**  Right?  
**0:18:10-0:18:11:**  So that would be enough for one family.  
**0:18:11-0:18:12:**  It's enough for more.  
**0:18:12-0:18:16:**  And the reason why I know it's enough for more is because I only do what I need.  
**0:18:16-0:18:19:**  And there's plenty of other stuff going on here.  
**0:18:19-0:18:24:**  And through the years we've had couples and individuals that have come on, this is part  
**0:18:24-0:18:29:**  of our training program, you come here, we work together side by side, you learn how  
**0:18:29-0:18:32:**  the system works, but you have your own revenue stream.  
**0:18:32-0:18:34:**  You're doing something different than I'm doing.  
**0:18:34-0:18:38:**  And I don't know how many total human niches there would be available because we've never  
**0:18:38-0:18:39:**  really pushed it.  
**0:18:39-0:18:48:**  Okay, but there's a lot of potential to just keep adding layers of complexity and of biodiversity  
**0:18:48-0:18:49:**  and of income.  
**0:18:49-0:18:52:**  I haven't commercially harvested berries in years.  
**0:18:52-0:18:53:**  I haven't.  
**0:18:53-0:18:56:**  I haven't sold any apple cider in years.  
**0:18:56-0:18:59:**  There's lots of things that I don't do.  
**0:18:59-0:19:03:**  Not because I can't, it's just that I don't need to anymore.  
**0:19:03-0:19:07:**  I do things that I don't, I don't want to pick cucumbers anymore.  
**0:19:07-0:19:09:**  Okay.  
**0:19:09-0:19:12:**  And so one of the other things that's making me think about is, you know, you're talking  
**0:19:12-0:19:14:**  about a low input system.  
**0:19:14-0:19:20:**  And so I'm imagining that that's also means, you know, high inputs, high fertilizer, a  
**0:19:20-0:19:25:**  lot of fertilizers means trees grow very fast and income is generated sooner.  
**0:19:25-0:19:29:**  So on your system with low inputs, you are generating income a bit later.  
**0:19:29-0:19:30:**  Is that correct?  
**0:19:30-0:19:32:**  So when would you start to pay for...  
**0:19:32-0:19:37:**  So there's a whole bunch of stuff in there I just want to shoot right out of the water.  
**0:19:37-0:19:45:**  So all of this, you know, the high input and the fertility stuff, nature has never put  
**0:19:45-0:19:46:**  in an external input.  
**0:19:46-0:19:50:**  It's all internally recycled and recirculated.  
**0:19:50-0:19:54:**  One of the keys to the fertility management here is animals.  
**0:19:54-0:19:55:**  They're a part of the system.  
**0:19:55-0:19:58:**  They're amazing that the fertility inputs that they are.  
**0:19:58-0:20:00:**  I don't consider that an input.  
**0:20:00-0:20:02:**  I consider that that's a yield.  
**0:20:02-0:20:06:**  I harvest whatever I'm selling, whether it's pork or beef or whatever.  
**0:20:06-0:20:11:**  Well then to say that, oh, if you go ahead and you use fertilizers, your yields, you  
**0:20:11-0:20:12:**  know, you'll get your yields sooner.  
**0:20:12-0:20:17:**  It's like, show me, show me and show me the numbers and show me that it works.  
**0:20:17-0:20:22:**  And who says that these aren't producing early because one of the key things that we do,  
**0:20:22-0:20:26:**  this is where the human element is critical in a system like this.  
**0:20:26-0:20:29:**  I'm not talking about pure nature run wild.  
**0:20:29-0:20:36:**  I'm talking about an ecosystem that the human inhabitants have a direct personal relationship  
**0:20:36-0:20:41:**  with and we apply all of our intellectual and our labor knowledge that we possibly can  
**0:20:41-0:20:49:**  to it, which includes a knowledge of how nature has selected for the species that are the  
**0:20:49-0:20:52:**  most adapted to a particular site.  
**0:20:52-0:20:57:**  So plant breeding, animal breeding is a critical component of this.  
**0:20:57-0:21:03:**  And with the trees and shrubs that we're using, when I first purchased trees, brought them  
**0:21:03-0:21:10:**  to the property, first criteria was you will produce, you know, nuts or fruit within three  
**0:21:10-0:21:13:**  years of me planting you or you're out the door.  
**0:21:13-0:21:20:**  And the ones that I did plant on the site, I take apples for example, I originally brought  
**0:21:20-0:21:23:**  in 249 different varieties of apples.  
**0:21:23-0:21:27:**  You will now survive all by yourself with zero inputs period.  
**0:21:27-0:21:32:**  And if you disappear, good riddance because I don't want to waste time babying a tree  
**0:21:32-0:21:37:**  that can't take care of itself in a semi-natural environment.  
**0:21:37-0:21:42:**  So the varieties get whittled away, well then how many of you people have actually saved  
**0:21:42-0:21:45:**  your apple seeds from the ones that went through that process?  
**0:21:45-0:21:49:**  Go ahead and let 90% of the plants that you put in the ground die.  
**0:21:49-0:21:53:**  That's a victory if you're looking at the genetics of an ecological system.  
**0:21:53-0:21:57:**  They are not adapted to this place, they don't belong here.  
**0:21:57-0:22:01:**  Then of the ones that do survive, they reproduce really early.  
**0:22:01-0:22:03:**  Now I'm looking for the ones that reproduce the most.  
**0:22:03-0:22:06:**  Then I, you know, they have the most fruit and the most nuts.  
**0:22:06-0:22:08:**  Then I save those seeds and put them in the ground.  
**0:22:08-0:22:15:**  And if you just keep continuing that process through the years, you end up with a population  
**0:22:15-0:22:21:**  of plants and animals that just keeps getting better and better and better as we interact  
**0:22:21-0:22:24:**  with it with that goal in mind.  
**0:22:24-0:22:28:**  And as far as hazelnuts are concerned, you can go to the Upper Midwest Hazelnut Development  
**0:22:28-0:22:31:**  Initiative to their websites.  
**0:22:31-0:22:35:**  They have all, they've been researching yields off of a number of different hazelnut growers  
**0:22:35-0:22:36:**  at sites.  
**0:22:36-0:22:43:**  And I actually have at least a 10 year track record that they have kept track of continually  
**0:22:43-0:22:48:**  increasing the yields from our hazelnuts and the diameter of the nuts from the hazelnuts.  
**0:22:48-0:22:56:**  I believe the nut diameter of the kernel itself increase has been 4 millimeters in like 15  
**0:22:56-0:22:57:**  years.  
**0:22:57-0:23:01:**  And if you do 4 millimeters, the volume is cubed.  
**0:23:01-0:23:05:**  It's a dramatic increase of yield just by doing this process.  
**0:23:05-0:23:11:**  Now what will happen is eventually you'll find one plant that's like super incredible.  
**0:23:11-0:23:13:**  Well then you can go ahead and clone that.  
**0:23:13-0:23:19:**  And so a cultivar is part of our program, but it's not the backbone of it.  
**0:23:19-0:23:22:**  We're taking care of the whole entire herd.  
**0:23:22-0:23:26:**  And then what we are doing is we're bringing in superior genetics from outside, letting  
**0:23:26-0:23:29:**  them join the gene pool.  
**0:23:29-0:23:36:**  But you've reached a 4 millimeter increase in size of the nuts plus the increases in  
**0:23:36-0:23:37:**  yield.  
**0:23:37-0:23:43:**  You've reached that not by adding in extra genetics, by selecting the best producing,  
**0:23:43-0:23:47:**  in this case, let's talk about hazelnuts, the best producing hazelnuts that you had.  
**0:23:47-0:23:51:**  You've taken out all the ones that weren't producing a lot and that weren't producing  
**0:23:51-0:23:52:**  beautiful nuts.  
**0:23:52-0:23:53:**  And this is just through selection.  
**0:23:53-0:23:54:**  Correct.  
**0:23:54-0:23:55:**  Correct.  
**0:23:55-0:24:00:**  And how is the word the regeneration taking place through your management?  
**0:24:00-0:24:05:**  That's one of the things I love how you used that word because the word regeneration or  
**0:24:05-0:24:10:**  regenerative has been used by natural resource managers starting in Germany like 400 years  
**0:24:10-0:24:11:**  ago.  
**0:24:11-0:24:17:**  It has had a very specific meaning until it was stolen by people who want to certify farmers  
**0:24:17-0:24:21:**  and charge them for it and by people who want to market products.  
**0:24:21-0:24:28:**  And what regenerative means in the ecological natural context is that an individual or a  
**0:24:28-0:24:35:**  population or a system has the ability to regenerate and expand its population without  
**0:24:35-0:24:40:**  any external input period and it can survive anything that that place throws at it.  
**0:24:40-0:24:41:**  That's regenerative.  
**0:24:41-0:24:46:**  So I stand by the ecological definition of what regenerative is.  
**0:24:46-0:24:48:**  This is a regenerative system.  
**0:24:48-0:24:57:**  In part we know this is true because, embarrassment moment here, my systems are expanding onto  
**0:24:57-0:25:01:**  neighboring properties all by themselves.  
**0:25:01-0:25:02:**  All by themselves.  
**0:25:02-0:25:04:**  I've got one neighbor.  
**0:25:04-0:25:06:**  There's nothing he can do about it.  
**0:25:06-0:25:11:**  But he just he has to put extra spray down on his property line next to me because my  
**0:25:11-0:25:13:**  trees keep taking over.  
**0:25:13-0:25:19:**  And it makes sense because you've selected trees that are adapted to that area.  
**0:25:19-0:25:20:**  You're imitating the local biome.  
**0:25:20-0:25:26:**  So they're just adapted to the fields next door if they're pioneers, right?  
**0:25:26-0:25:27:**  Right exactly.  
**0:25:27-0:25:31:**  In this one particular fence he keeps putting fertilizer on and in those trees there's a  
**0:25:31-0:25:34:**  row of hickories with chestnuts and hazelnuts in there.  
**0:25:34-0:25:36:**  But these hickories are just like sucking it up.  
**0:25:36-0:25:40:**  I've never seen hickories that have had so many nuts in the world before.  
**0:25:40-0:25:49:**  So if I'm adding fertilizer to get those increased yields, what is the cost benefit of that?  
**0:25:49-0:25:54:**  How much can I afford to spend at what price of what analysis in order to get what yield  
**0:25:54-0:25:57:**  and will that give me an extra benefit in the marketplace?  
**0:25:57-0:25:59:**  If I did that, that's a big unknown.  
**0:25:59-0:26:00:**  I don't know.  
**0:26:00-0:26:04:**  If, however, my plants are sitting next to my neighbor and he's just pumping them full  
**0:26:04-0:26:07:**  of fertilizer, I get the benefit from his expense.  
**0:26:07-0:26:09:**  That's interesting.  
**0:26:09-0:26:15:**  I wanted to just go back a bit to the precocity of yields, which is something that's, and  
**0:26:15-0:26:18:**  I'm coming from the perspective, I mean I've just spent the last four months going around  
**0:26:18-0:26:22:**  and talking to basically consultants and a lot of farmers that went conventional agriculture.  
**0:26:22-0:26:26:**  And I really enjoyed that because I can really bring that perspective in a way to the conversation  
**0:26:26-0:26:32:**  because I have an understanding, I've gained an understanding of how they're thinking.  
**0:26:32-0:26:36:**  And this precocity of yield is something that is extremely important for them.  
**0:26:36-0:26:40:**  So I just want you to confirm something in case some farmers that are listening to us  
**0:26:40-0:26:45:**  are really concerned about this and I would actually include myself in there.  
**0:26:45-0:26:52:**  So you're saying that with your, through your system of planting high density, many crops  
**0:26:52-0:26:58:**  and then selecting them, you're managing to have the same precocity of yields than other,  
**0:26:58-0:27:02:**  let's use the hazelnut example, hazelnut growers inside this association that you mentioned,  
**0:27:02-0:27:07:**  or are you reaching precocity of yields through other crops because you also mentioned animals.  
**0:27:07-0:27:10:**  So maybe you're using, for example, in the first year, lots of pigs and you're harvesting  
**0:27:10-0:27:15:**  them obviously after a year, you know, talk to me a bit about your precocity of yields,  
**0:27:15-0:27:18:**  but also the precocity of cashflow maybe.  
**0:27:18-0:27:24:**  Precocity of yields, if you want to compare like hazelnuts to hazelnuts with somebody  
**0:27:24-0:27:31:**  else, for one, nobody has bothered, no third party disinterested, you know, university,  
**0:27:31-0:27:37:**  nonprofit, whatever has bothered to measure yields here with that in mind.  
**0:27:37-0:27:45:**  I'm willing to bet though that plant comparison to plant comparison, my yields are much lower.  
**0:27:45-0:27:50:**  One of the things on the precocity of yields with hazelnut, the forest ag nursery, which,  
**0:27:50-0:27:57:**  you know, I run that nursery forestag.com, the controlled cross plants that we have in  
**0:27:57-0:28:04:**  that for sale, about 80-85% of those produce nuts the very second year.  
**0:28:04-0:28:10:**  Now, if you've got a hundred foot row of these plants that have nuts the second year, if  
**0:28:10-0:28:16:**  you go harvest that row, you might get a cup, cup and a half for how much work to actually  
**0:28:16-0:28:17:**  go get those nuts.  
**0:28:17-0:28:23:**  It's not necessarily economic worth it, economically worth it, if you looked at that as an individual  
**0:28:23-0:28:26:**  standalone crop all by itself.  
**0:28:26-0:28:34:**  However, it's critical to the overall functioning of the system because I want to increase the  
**0:28:34-0:28:39:**  frequency of early reproduction and heavy reproduction and that's how I do it.  
**0:28:39-0:28:44:**  I can get the generational turnover because I have this amazing hyper precocity.  
**0:28:44-0:28:51:**  I've got three different family lines of chestnut that right out of the seed they go to flower.  
**0:28:51-0:28:55:**  Well, think about what happens for this little tree if it comes up and it puts so many of  
**0:28:55-0:29:00:**  its resources, it partitions so many of its resources into flowering, it may make really  
**0:29:00-0:29:04:**  weak wood or it might not store enough to survive the winter.  
**0:29:04-0:29:09:**  So I have to pay attention to those really hyper precocious ones, grab that seed and  
**0:29:09-0:29:16:**  make sure that that plant stays alive somehow because that's my surrogate uterus.  
**0:29:16-0:29:21:**  I've got to have that for the fast turnover of the generations.  
**0:29:21-0:29:30:**  So back to yield, the yield in this system, I don't look at individual crops from the  
**0:29:30-0:29:32:**  perspective that an orchard is wood.  
**0:29:32-0:29:35:**  I'm not growing hazelnuts to make money from hazelnuts.  
**0:29:35-0:29:42:**  I'm growing hazelnuts as part of an ecological system that includes them in it and instead  
**0:29:42-0:29:48:**  of managing the hazelnuts with expenses, I'm managing an ecosystem and a part of how I  
**0:29:48-0:29:54:**  manage that ecosystem is with yields and I'll use cattle as one example is those cattle  
**0:29:54-0:29:56:**  are my lawn mowers.  
**0:29:56-0:29:58:**  So now I don't have to do weed control.  
**0:29:58-0:30:03:**  They are my fertility inputs, 35 gallons a year in a day and I don't know how many dozen  
**0:30:03-0:30:08:**  cow patties a day on every single acre of ground.  
**0:30:08-0:30:13:**  And then they also do a lot of disease control.  
**0:30:13-0:30:17:**  A lot of people don't really realize how useful cattle can be.  
**0:30:17-0:30:22:**  Those are especially helpful in the apples because they'll prune all the branches away  
**0:30:22-0:30:23:**  from down low.  
**0:30:23-0:30:28:**  So now I've got like apple trees that have no branches below five feet and you want to  
**0:30:28-0:30:33:**  see apple scab disappear as a problem, have no branches in the lower five feet.  
**0:30:33-0:30:38:**  Most fungal diseases in my apples just go away once those trees are stripped from five  
**0:30:38-0:30:39:**  foot on down.  
**0:30:39-0:30:45:**  So these super high density mini dwarf plantings, you're creating the perfect conditions for  
**0:30:45-0:30:46:**  apple scab to proliferate.  
**0:30:46-0:30:49:**  Well no wonder you have to spray X times a week.  
**0:30:49-0:30:56:**  So the benefits of managing it as a system instead of thinking of it as individual crops,  
**0:30:56-0:30:57:**  that's where the magic is.  
**0:30:57-0:30:58:**  That's really, really interesting.  
**0:30:58-0:31:04:**  So okay, we've talked for half an hour and haven't actually described the system, which  
**0:31:04-0:31:08:**  I mean some people will probably be really annoyed about and maybe in the intro I'll  
**0:31:08-0:31:15:**  tell people go to minute 30 to listen to how the system works and then go back 20 minutes.  
**0:31:15-0:31:19:**  But maybe it's time for us to give a quick intro, a quick description of what the system  
**0:31:19-0:31:25:**  looks like, the tree lines, a minimum of idea of how you've mixed it all up and the spacing  
**0:31:25-0:31:29:**  and then I'll guide you step by step into the next descriptions of your farm.  
**0:31:29-0:31:34:**  Okay so the first order of business was to do a little research and find out what this  
**0:31:34-0:31:37:**  place has been for the previous 95 million years.  
**0:31:37-0:31:44:**  And for the most part, this part of Wisconsin was oak savannah but we're just at the southern  
**0:31:44-0:31:51:**  fringe of the northern hardwoods then where it goes off into boreal forest.  
**0:31:51-0:31:57:**  So we're at a nice little intersection but this was pretty much the semi-open oak savannah.  
**0:31:57-0:32:00:**  Much of Europe has been that way as well.  
**0:32:00-0:32:07:**  It's one of the more widespread plant community types that's around.  
**0:32:07-0:32:13:**  And in that plant community, the tall trees were oak, chestnut or beech.  
**0:32:13-0:32:19:**  Now beech is a shade tolerant so it would be a late successional 300 plus years down  
**0:32:19-0:32:21:**  the line before beech was able to come in.  
**0:32:21-0:32:26:**  So an overstory of oak, chestnut or beech, all those produce nuts.  
**0:32:26-0:32:30:**  Chestnut conveniently produces them every single year.  
**0:32:30-0:32:36:**  Medium-sized trees, they can be up in the upper story with the taller trees but there's  
**0:32:36-0:32:44:**  also a diversity of species that goes downward and that's the prunuses from tall cherries  
**0:32:44-0:32:51:**  to medium cherries to wild plum which are more shrubby to things like beech plum that  
**0:32:51-0:32:53:**  kind of crawl along the ground.  
**0:32:53-0:32:58:**  So we have all these different layers represented by prunus but want to stop here and start  
**0:32:58-0:33:00:**  counting the crops.  
**0:33:00-0:33:07:**  We've got chestnuts, oaks, beech nuts, cherries, plums, two different kinds of plums, bush  
**0:33:07-0:33:08:**  cherries.  
**0:33:08-0:33:11:**  So there's seven different crops right there already.  
**0:33:11-0:33:21:**  One of the understory trees were malice, apples, and their cousins, the pears and the haws  
**0:33:21-0:33:27:**  and what's slow, sladorn.  
**0:33:27-0:33:29:**  Those are all cousins of the apples.  
**0:33:29-0:33:32:**  So there's, I'll just stick apple and forget about the other ones for this but I've got  
**0:33:32-0:33:34:**  pears.  
**0:33:34-0:33:40:**  And then shrubs were hazelnut and then shade tolerant plants were things such as currant  
**0:33:40-0:33:45:**  and gooseberry, cane fruits such as raspberry and blackberry.  
**0:33:45-0:33:46:**  You're making me hungry.  
**0:33:46-0:33:51:**  There's grass all the way around the outside, grass and flowers and all that kind of stuff.  
**0:33:51-0:33:54:**  Then there's vines which here were grapes.  
**0:33:54-0:33:57:**  So I don't know how many different things I listed right there.  
**0:33:57-0:34:00:**  Yeah, some up to 15.  
**0:34:00-0:34:03:**  And then the animals because now the animal, oh, the animals.  
**0:34:03-0:34:11:**  So I've got cattle, hogs, poultry, and then what decomposes all this organic matter are  
**0:34:11-0:34:13:**  fungi.  
**0:34:13-0:34:17:**  Every single thing that I listed right there in that plant community type is edible by  
**0:34:17-0:34:22:**  me or you can feed it to an animal or you can sell it to somebody else.  
**0:34:22-0:34:28:**  A hundred percent of it is edible somehow and for sale.  
**0:34:28-0:34:37:**  And it exists naturally and it has done so for 95 million years without any cash flow  
**0:34:37-0:34:38:**  outlay.  
**0:34:38-0:34:44:**  I mean, you don't need to spend anything on pest control, disease control, et cetera,  
**0:34:44-0:34:45:**  et cetera.  
**0:34:45-0:34:46:**  And it goes through natural processes.  
**0:34:46-0:34:50:**  Will I get the same yields as 300 bushel an acre corn?  
**0:34:50-0:34:51:**  No.  
**0:34:51-0:34:58:**  So I get, and this is where the agroforester's land equivalent ratio comes in handy.  
**0:34:58-0:35:03:**  If I plant only corn, I'll get a hundred percent corn for a land equivalent ratio of one.  
**0:35:03-0:35:11:**  But if I plant say 80% of that is corn and then just 20% of it is walnuts because the  
**0:35:11-0:35:14:**  rows would be wider spaced, I can put them closer together.  
**0:35:14-0:35:17:**  I can get a 50% stocking density of walnut.  
**0:35:17-0:35:22:**  I've got a 0.8 yield out of my corn, a 0.5 yield out of my walnuts.  
**0:35:22-0:35:24:**  That's a 1.3 yield.  
**0:35:24-0:35:26:**  Now let's throw in animals.  
**0:35:26-0:35:29:**  Let's throw in all these different other kinds of things.  
**0:35:29-0:35:35:**  The opportunities of polyculture systems, we don't really know where they can go yet.  
**0:35:35-0:35:38:**  In part, in part because let's take it here.  
**0:35:38-0:35:44:**  One guy right here, I also didn't want to have swarms of volunteers or slaves working  
**0:35:44-0:35:45:**  for me.  
**0:35:45-0:35:49:**  I wanted this to be like the independent American farmer, which is the way we're supposed to  
**0:35:49-0:35:50:**  be, right?  
**0:35:50-0:35:52:**  Well, what can one guy do?  
**0:35:52-0:36:00:**  If I'm here full time and working in the system, the most I could really keep track of was  
**0:36:00-0:36:09:**  like three above ground plants and three species of animals and then four or five row crops.  
**0:36:09-0:36:10:**  That was about all I could handle.  
**0:36:10-0:36:11:**  It's just too crazy busy.  
**0:36:11-0:36:16:**  Well, then as time has gone on and my woody plants are producing more and more, I can  
**0:36:16-0:36:19:**  drop off some of the things that I didn't appreciate as much.  
**0:36:19-0:36:25:**  Now the succession kind of evolves and so does your business also goes through succession.  
**0:36:25-0:36:26:**  Correct.  
**0:36:26-0:36:30:**  That's another thing people like, yeah, but what are your yields?  
**0:36:30-0:36:31:**  Show me the economics.  
**0:36:31-0:36:34:**  They're different every year, absolutely different every year.  
**0:36:34-0:36:36:**  You've listed all these different species.  
**0:36:36-0:36:39:**  Do you plant them on the same rows?  
**0:36:39-0:36:42:**  In the sense, I'm thinking about how you're gaining certain types of efficiencies for  
**0:36:42-0:36:44:**  harvesting, et cetera.  
**0:36:44-0:36:46:**  How did you organize them together?  
**0:36:46-0:36:47:**  Is it single row species?  
**0:36:47-0:36:49:**  That's a great question.  
**0:36:49-0:36:53:**  You got to go back to 1995 when I got started on this property right here.  
**0:36:53-0:36:55:**  There was no such thing as an internet.  
**0:36:55-0:37:01:**  There was not even such thing as dial up internet back then and phone.  
**0:37:01-0:37:07:**  If you were to call somebody out of town, that would be a $5 phone call.  
**0:37:07-0:37:11:**  Who was writing books on this stuff back in the 80s and 90s?  
**0:37:11-0:37:12:**  Nobody.  
**0:37:12-0:37:17:**  I had zero real input on how can I go about doing this.  
**0:37:17-0:37:20:**  Very few examples of what would work.  
**0:37:20-0:37:27:**  I did a lot of experimenting with different layouts and configurations.  
**0:37:27-0:37:32:**  Starting with the basic simple formula of doing agroforestry systems, most specifically  
**0:37:32-0:37:37:**  alley cropping, silver wearable, where you have rows of trees in an alley with some sort  
**0:37:37-0:37:38:**  of crop.  
**0:37:38-0:37:43:**  Well, if your crop happens to be grass or hay, then you graze animals on it.  
**0:37:43-0:37:45:**  That's silver pasture.  
**0:37:45-0:37:52:**  So those two agroforestry practices were my most commonly done.  
**0:37:52-0:37:55:**  So I would start with fairly wide spaces.  
**0:37:55-0:37:57:**  Some I did single species.  
**0:37:57-0:38:02:**  Some I did multiple species with over under type configuration.  
**0:38:02-0:38:06:**  So I'd have this one row that I was just out there this morning.  
**0:38:06-0:38:14:**  I had pine nuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts, and currants all in the same row.  
**0:38:14-0:38:18:**  You plant them all at the same time and as they grow, they just grow to their different  
**0:38:18-0:38:19:**  heights.  
**0:38:19-0:38:21:**  That was one particular place.  
**0:38:21-0:38:25:**  There's other places that I did like a two story within the row.  
**0:38:25-0:38:29:**  I'm thinking right now after I left that place, I had to go buy this other one and it was  
**0:38:29-0:38:32:**  chestnuts over currants.  
**0:38:32-0:38:36:**  Then in the middles of the alley, after I was finished, once the trees got big enough  
**0:38:36-0:38:43:**  and it interfered with cropping in the alley, I then planted the quote unquote weeds that  
**0:38:43-0:38:47:**  showed up in my system, which were mulberry, elderberry, grapes, and raspberry.  
**0:38:47-0:38:50:**  So I'd plant them right down the middle.  
**0:38:50-0:38:56:**  That particular area happens to be home base for my pigs is that that is the main pasture  
**0:38:56-0:38:57:**  where they go.  
**0:38:57-0:39:04:**  From June until the end of October, they're 100% totally on wild food.  
**0:39:04-0:39:05:**  They feed themselves.  
**0:39:05-0:39:09:**  It takes them six months instead of five to grow up to market weight, but they can feed  
**0:39:09-0:39:10:**  themselves.  
**0:39:10-0:39:15:**  I never feed them any more than what would keep a 30 pound piglet alive.  
**0:39:15-0:39:19:**  So it's about a cup and a half of grain feed per day.  
**0:39:19-0:39:21:**  The reason why I do that is it's bait.  
**0:39:21-0:39:23:**  I go ahead and I whistle them in.  
**0:39:23-0:39:24:**  They hear the sound.  
**0:39:24-0:39:26:**  They come and they get a little snack.  
**0:39:26-0:39:32:**  Last 30 days, I feed them on a trailer and the morning that they go on a ride, all they  
**0:39:32-0:39:33:**  have to do is just shut the door.  
**0:39:33-0:39:37:**  There's no squeeze shoots and trauma.  
**0:39:37-0:39:43:**  So that configuration, the multiple species, that's probably my favorite area because I've  
**0:39:43-0:39:48:**  got fairly wide spaces on the chestnuts and then I get a separate system right down the  
**0:39:48-0:39:52:**  middle and that's what the mulberries and the elderberries, raspberries and grapes and  
**0:39:52-0:39:53:**  so on.  
**0:39:53-0:39:54:**  That's fascinating.  
**0:39:54-0:39:55:**  Okay, that's really interesting.  
**0:39:55-0:40:01:**  So you must have a big mix of layouts and etc.  
**0:40:01-0:40:06:**  But do you do any mechanical harvesting of your hazelnuts, for example?  
**0:40:06-0:40:09:**  How do you work with harvesting?  
**0:40:09-0:40:16:**  The later plantings are planted so that I can do mechanical harvesting, but because  
**0:40:16-0:40:22:**  this has become more of a seed production breeding operation as time has gone by, I'm  
**0:40:22-0:40:27:**  having fewer and fewer sales of nuts for people to eat and more sales of seedlings, which  
**0:40:27-0:40:31:**  are the offspring of these seeds.  
**0:40:31-0:40:36:**  So we're individually hand harvesting the majority of our hazelnuts, even though we  
**0:40:36-0:40:39:**  could use a machine if we wanted to.  
**0:40:39-0:40:44:**  The reason why the machine harvesting isn't as efficient here is because I've got so many  
**0:40:44-0:40:50:**  gaps in the row because as soon as I realize that this plant isn't going to meet my criteria,  
**0:40:50-0:40:52:**  I cut it down.  
**0:40:52-0:40:56:**  This is just what has just happened.  
**0:40:56-0:40:59:**  I got back from a working trip and all that kind of stuff.  
**0:40:59-0:41:01:**  I hit the ground running.  
**0:41:01-0:41:07:**  We immediately go out and this year the selection is nut diameter.  
**0:41:07-0:41:12:**  A year ago it was total overall per plant yield.  
**0:41:12-0:41:18:**  So this year we're doing a diameter increase and we're bumping things up 30%, which is  
**0:41:18-0:41:22:**  a really, really aggressive boost.  
**0:41:22-0:41:27:**  I don't know if we're going to have enough seed to satisfy our nursery demands.  
**0:41:27-0:41:29:**  I think we are.  
**0:41:29-0:41:32:**  So what's going to happen is now we've marked all the ones that we're going to harvest for  
**0:41:32-0:41:33:**  seed.  
**0:41:33-0:41:35:**  So we'll go through and pick those first.  
**0:41:35-0:41:38:**  Then we'll go ahead and pick the rest of the population.  
**0:41:38-0:41:45:**  And then after everything is harvested this fall, if I've got enough seed from the big  
**0:41:45-0:41:49:**  diameter jump trees, then I'll just chip everything else down.  
**0:41:49-0:41:55:**  Before I chip it all down, I grab a bag of wine cap, strafaria spawn, I spread it all  
**0:41:55-0:42:01:**  over the place, then I chip it and next year we'll have wine caps up the wazoo.  
**0:42:01-0:42:03:**  Growing wild.  
**0:42:03-0:42:04:**  Amazing.  
**0:42:04-0:42:10:**  To understand a bit more about some practical elements, when you implemented this system,  
**0:42:10-0:42:13:**  without going into the details of how you planted, etc, because I want to take this  
**0:42:13-0:42:18:**  conversation into another direction, but did you do any, you didn't fertilize at all.  
**0:42:18-0:42:27:**  So you started with a degraded corn and soy rotation field and you didn't put any, just  
**0:42:27-0:42:29:**  to confirm, you didn't put any fertilizer.  
**0:42:29-0:42:33:**  With asparagus, I did.  
**0:42:33-0:42:38:**  Asparagus isn't adapted to the native soil here.  
**0:42:38-0:42:41:**  It'll do okay, but it wouldn't do as well as I needed it to and that was going to be  
**0:42:41-0:42:43:**  a significant part of my cashflow.  
**0:42:43-0:42:46:**  So what I did is I didn't amend the whole field.  
**0:42:46-0:42:49:**  I have a band applied right in the row.  
**0:42:49-0:42:55:**  And so on the asparagus, probably every three years I did a little tweak to it and it was  
**0:42:55-0:42:57:**  all certified organic products.  
**0:42:57-0:43:03:**  Most of it was calcium and phosphorus, which around here, that's the big shortage we're  
**0:43:03-0:43:08:**  on dolomite limestone and years and years of cropping have taken away much of the calcium  
**0:43:08-0:43:13:**  and then they just keep applying regular limestone, which regular limestone around here means  
**0:43:13-0:43:15:**  dolomite.  
**0:43:15-0:43:20:**  So the magnesium stays behind, they keep shipping the calcium away and you end up having this  
**0:43:20-0:43:25:**  calcium magnesium ratio that's out of whack and it makes a really, really hard sticky  
**0:43:25-0:43:27:**  soil.  
**0:43:27-0:43:33:**  And so for the asparagus, I wanted to make sure that was amended because it's somewhat  
**0:43:33-0:43:34:**  of a sissy of a plant.  
**0:43:34-0:43:39:**  I didn't grow any really fancy produce crops.  
**0:43:39-0:43:45:**  I grew really rugged, tough things like cucumbers, green peppers, winter squash, pumpkins, those  
**0:43:45-0:43:47:**  are really rough and tough plants.  
**0:43:47-0:43:54:**  And then in most of the pastures and next to the rows of trees that I planted, I used  
**0:43:54-0:43:59:**  a single shank subsoiler for years and years to help break up compaction and get water  
**0:43:59-0:44:05:**  to infiltrate and then lots of seed to just reseed to establish the pasture plants that  
**0:44:05-0:44:06:**  I want to have.  
**0:44:06-0:44:13:**  So I think what's done the most has been the water management and the deep ripping in the  
**0:44:13-0:44:14:**  early years.  
**0:44:14-0:44:17:**  I haven't used the subsoiler in years now, I don't have to.  
**0:44:17-0:44:18:**  Interesting.  
**0:44:18-0:44:21:**  And so the tree rows didn't have any fertilizer.  
**0:44:21-0:44:22:**  Correct.  
**0:44:22-0:44:25:**  You didn't put, oh that's fascinating.  
**0:44:25-0:44:27:**  And so they started in some really tough conditions.  
**0:44:27-0:44:28:**  They did, yeah.  
**0:44:28-0:44:33:**  So you were selecting trees that were adapted to corn and soy toxic.  
**0:44:33-0:44:34:**  Correct.  
**0:44:34-0:44:37:**  And actually we grew squash.  
**0:44:37-0:44:44:**  I've been a part of the Organic Valley Cooperative and so that's where my produce will go.  
**0:44:44-0:44:50:**  And every grower who grew squash had to get their soil tested for, I forgot what the compound  
**0:44:50-0:44:57:**  was, but it's one of the bad, like the really persistent insecticides.  
**0:44:57-0:45:04:**  And my soil here tested hot for seven years and so I couldn't, my squash couldn't be included  
**0:45:04-0:45:08:**  in the lots that went for baby food.  
**0:45:08-0:45:12:**  But then after seven years went by, whatever, it's either it got metabolized or broken down  
**0:45:12-0:45:17:**  or shipped off to Whole Foods in a cucumber or something like that.  
**0:45:17-0:45:25:**  But then once seven years went by, the chemical contamination in the soil was gone.  
**0:45:25-0:45:27:**  That's crazy.  
**0:45:27-0:45:33:**  And in terms of your management of this system, based on what you're saying, I guess you're  
**0:45:33-0:45:35:**  not doing a lot of pruning to your trees.  
**0:45:35-0:45:42:**  You're definitely not fertilizing them nor irrigating them.  
**0:45:42-0:45:46:**  Grazing animals through the system and grazing animals are pooping and peeing.  
**0:45:46-0:45:47:**  That's called fertilizer.  
**0:45:47-0:45:49:**  So it's not that the system's going unfertilized.  
**0:45:49-0:45:54:**  I put clover seed down almost every single year, not over the whole property, but somewhere  
**0:45:54-0:45:58:**  is getting clover if that population is going down.  
**0:45:58-0:46:02:**  So if you're seeing clovers somewhere, that's nitrogen.  
**0:46:02-0:46:07:**  I was going to use a curse word, but yellow blossom sweet clover, that's putting down  
**0:46:07-0:46:10:**  90 plus pounds of nitrogen per acre.  
**0:46:10-0:46:12:**  That's fertilizer.  
**0:46:12-0:46:15:**  And then you add cows on top of that, that's fertilizer.  
**0:46:15-0:46:17:**  So don't give me this no fertilizer crap.  
**0:46:17-0:46:19:**  It's a fertilized system.  
**0:46:19-0:46:21:**  But what was I arguing about?  
**0:46:21-0:46:24:**  Yeah, I wanted to talk about pruning because that's significant.  
**0:46:24-0:46:28:**  If I'm driving by this young little tree and it's got a branch that now sticks out, because  
**0:46:28-0:46:37:**  say I'm cutting hay or I'm cultivating a squash field, and if the branch hits the tractor  
**0:46:37-0:46:41:**  or hits me and it bends and it goes by, I don't cut it.  
**0:46:41-0:46:44:**  Then if the branch is big enough that I can go like this and get it up and over the top  
**0:46:44-0:46:47:**  of the roll cage, I don't cut it.  
**0:46:47-0:46:51:**  If I go like this and it tries to poke me and lance me and push me off the back of the  
**0:46:51-0:46:53:**  horse, well then, boom, down it goes.  
**0:46:53-0:46:59:**  This time of year right now, and now that more of the trees are larger, I travel with  
**0:46:59-0:47:00:**  the chainsaw right between my feet.  
**0:47:00-0:47:02:**  I get to the head of a row.  
**0:47:02-0:47:07:**  I run down that row and I cut everything that sticks out into the row, you know, eight feet  
**0:47:07-0:47:08:**  and down.  
**0:47:08-0:47:10:**  It gets cut off.  
**0:47:10-0:47:15:**  I lay it crosswise to the path, spread the stapharia, and I chip it with a heavy duty  
**0:47:15-0:47:17:**  orchard mower.  
**0:47:17-0:47:22:**  And so now we're ready to harvest because we have a nice clean mowed place and we'll  
**0:47:22-0:47:26:**  have mushrooms next year.  
**0:47:26-0:47:34:**  So most of my management is mowing, chainsaw mowing, and that's mowing.  
**0:47:34-0:47:37:**  It really is.  
**0:47:37-0:47:45:**  It doesn't mimic fire perfectly because you don't have the heat and with fire you're losing  
**0:47:45-0:47:46:**  a lot of those calories.  
**0:47:46-0:47:54:**  I like the idea that I'm converting the 4800 BTU of energy in a thousand pounds of wood,  
**0:47:54-0:48:00:**  I'm converting that into biomass, which is now soil fertility and all that kind of stuff.  
**0:48:00-0:48:07:**  But one of the things I have toyed with, especially in the hazelnuts, is if I have a propane weed  
**0:48:07-0:48:13:**  burner pulled straight behind me and then a roller to immediately snuff the fire as  
**0:48:13-0:48:16:**  I go out, that is actually fire.  
**0:48:16-0:48:18:**  It's not mimicking fire, it is fire.  
**0:48:18-0:48:21:**  And so how would they perform differently?  
**0:48:21-0:48:25:**  That would now be an added cost for the propane and the roller and the equipment and all that  
**0:48:25-0:48:26:**  kind of stuff.  
**0:48:26-0:48:27:**  And I haven't done it yet.  
**0:48:27-0:48:34:**  A couple of times I've lit places on fire in part because what's really interesting,  
**0:48:34-0:48:38:**  we've got several different spots on the farm where all these different prairie plants started  
**0:48:38-0:48:40:**  to sprout and grow.  
**0:48:40-0:48:45:**  I've got this patch of big bluestem, it's like eight foot tall, it's just taken over  
**0:48:45-0:48:50:**  in this one area because I manage it like a savannah.  
**0:48:50-0:48:56:**  And we have all kinds of endangered species, rare and endangered species that are out here,  
**0:48:56-0:49:02:**  not because I've intentionally done something to help them, but because this is actually  
**0:49:02-0:49:05:**  providing ideal habitat for them.  
**0:49:05-0:49:09:**  One of them is the massasagua rattlesnake, which is a little problematic.  
**0:49:09-0:49:12:**  You know, I got rattlesnakes all over the place that never used to be here and they  
**0:49:12-0:49:14:**  aren't in a cornfield.  
**0:49:14-0:49:15:**  How did biodiversity get there?  
**0:49:15-0:49:17:**  How did they access your farm?  
**0:49:17-0:49:20:**  I've seen aerial pictures and it seems like...  
**0:49:20-0:49:25:**  That's mind-blowing to me and the one that really kind of really flips me out is snapping  
**0:49:25-0:49:26:**  turtles.  
**0:49:26-0:49:30:**  I've got like 40 little pocket ponds all over the place and it was like three years ago,  
**0:49:30-0:49:34:**  maybe four years ago, there was this little snapping turtle about this big in one of my  
**0:49:34-0:49:35:**  ponds.  
**0:49:35-0:49:42:**  Now we're at least a mile and a half, maybe two miles from the nearest surface water around.  
**0:49:42-0:49:47:**  So that thing had to come a long way or get dropped by a bird and snapping turtles have  
**0:49:47-0:49:51:**  one of the highest mortality rates of any terrestrial organism that's out there.  
**0:49:51-0:49:55:**  It's like one out of 300 young actually grows to adulthood.  
**0:49:55-0:49:57:**  So how on earth did this thing get here?  
**0:49:57-0:50:02:**  And then the frogs is at least seven species of frogs that are here.  
**0:50:02-0:50:04:**  They had to hop a long ways.  
**0:50:04-0:50:05:**  Now toads, I can understand.  
**0:50:05-0:50:06:**  Toads are a little bit more terrestrial.  
**0:50:06-0:50:09:**  They'll be in your yard and your garden.  
**0:50:09-0:50:15:**  But things like green frogs, green frogs require perennial water for at least two years.  
**0:50:15-0:50:18:**  It's like, where did they come from?  
**0:50:18-0:50:19:**  Good question.  
**0:50:19-0:50:20:**  I have no idea.  
**0:50:20-0:50:21:**  That's fascinating.  
**0:50:21-0:50:23:**  And we don't necessarily need to understand this.  
**0:50:23-0:50:29:**  What's beautiful about this is that you've created and you've mimicked a natural ecosystem.  
**0:50:29-0:50:35:**  You've created opportunities and habitats, niches available for biodiversity and it came.  
**0:50:35-0:50:41:**  I'm a niche guy instead of a niche guy, but that's okay.  
**0:50:41-0:50:47:**  And one of the things that it's a common question that I get from people will be walking by.  
**0:50:47-0:50:51:**  We do quite a bit of, quite a few farm tours right now, which the guy across the street  
**0:50:51-0:50:57:**  who has like 400 acres of corn, nobody wants to go walk around his place and pay to go  
**0:50:57-0:50:58:**  on a tour.  
**0:50:58-0:50:59:**  Well, people do want to come here.  
**0:50:59-0:51:02:**  They want to pay in camp out or stay in a cabin, that kind of stuff.  
**0:51:02-0:51:04:**  He can't do that because he's got this cornfield.  
**0:51:04-0:51:09:**  Well, we'll be walking along on a tour and somebody sees this tree that's just like riddled  
**0:51:09-0:51:13:**  with some kind of horrible disease and it looks like heck.  
**0:51:13-0:51:15:**  And they say, oh my gosh, what's wrong with this tree?  
**0:51:15-0:51:18:**  And I say, who cares?  
**0:51:18-0:51:19:**  Who cares?  
**0:51:19-0:51:23:**  I don't care what that disease is because my trees that don't get it are resistant to  
**0:51:23-0:51:24:**  it somehow.  
**0:51:24-0:51:26:**  Do I need to know how they're resistant?  
**0:51:26-0:51:27:**  Nope.  
**0:51:27-0:51:29:**  I just want yields.  
**0:51:29-0:51:33:**  Then there's also a thing that happens that I'll have these really hyper precocious.  
**0:51:33-0:51:37:**  I'm thinking of one particular individual chestnut that it will grow like two or three  
**0:51:37-0:51:46:**  years in it on a little plant that has a footprint of about one meter of green as it grows up.  
**0:51:46-0:51:49:**  It probably has close to a pound of chestnuts on it.  
**0:51:49-0:51:54:**  I think partly because it produces so much that it doesn't really have the resources  
**0:51:54-0:51:58:**  to keep going or to resist too many diseases.  
**0:51:58-0:52:02:**  And then partly because it's got to have American genetics in there somehow because it just  
**0:52:02-0:52:08:**  grows straight up and it gets the blight, but it keeps resprouting.  
**0:52:08-0:52:12:**  And every year I get a dog on anywhere between a half a pound and a pound of nuts.  
**0:52:12-0:52:15:**  And so if you were to say, oh, you can't have an orchard that way.  
**0:52:15-0:52:21:**  It looks like somebody bombed it out, but that's one of my most highly productive plants.  
**0:52:21-0:52:27:**  And if I had a whole acre of these things that look like heck, any orchardist would  
**0:52:27-0:52:32:**  probably throw up because it's so offensive to what they're taught, especially if they're  
**0:52:32-0:52:33:**  Dutch.  
**0:52:33-0:52:37:**  Oh my gosh, the Dutch would totally flip out if they saw that.  
**0:52:37-0:52:38:**  It's a mess.  
**0:52:38-0:52:40:**  I have another California walnut.  
**0:52:40-0:52:44:**  If you're familiar with California walnuts, USDA growing zone eight, they don't grow around  
**0:52:44-0:52:45:**  here.  
**0:52:45-0:52:50:**  Well, you plant about a thousand of them per year, year after year after year, not all  
**0:52:50-0:52:51:**  of them die.  
**0:52:51-0:52:55:**  I've got two that are about a hundred feet apart from one another in the same row and  
**0:52:55-0:53:01:**  I'll take tours by it and the first one has three stems laying on the ground that through  
**0:53:01-0:53:05:**  the years it's grown up to a certain height and blown over because the wood is so weak.  
**0:53:05-0:53:08:**  It just falls apart.  
**0:53:08-0:53:10:**  And right now it's going like, eh, it's trying to survive.  
**0:53:10-0:53:11:**  It's got a million little stems.  
**0:53:11-0:53:13:**  It just looks really ugly.  
**0:53:13-0:53:16:**  And I ask, do you like this plant?  
**0:53:16-0:53:19:**  Is this a good plant to have if you want to have a walnut orchard?  
**0:53:19-0:53:23:**  And most people say, no, look at all the different criteria of that being a good plant.  
**0:53:23-0:53:24:**  It fails.  
**0:53:24-0:53:26:**  They don't see the criteria that I see.  
**0:53:26-0:53:30:**  Well, then we go down to the one a hundred feet down below and there's this big beautiful  
**0:53:30-0:53:31:**  tree.  
**0:53:31-0:53:34:**  You know, it's like easily one foot in diameter.  
**0:53:34-0:53:39:**  I haven't seen any spot of any disease that affects that tree at all.  
**0:53:39-0:53:40:**  Hardly any insects.  
**0:53:40-0:53:42:**  There's maybe two or three holes in the foliage of it.  
**0:53:42-0:53:46:**  It's just a beautiful, spectacular tree.  
**0:53:46-0:53:47:**  Everybody agrees.  
**0:53:47-0:53:48:**  Oh yeah, that's the tree to have.  
**0:53:48-0:53:49:**  That's what you want.  
**0:53:49-0:53:51:**  That's a perfect, beautiful tree.  
**0:53:51-0:53:55:**  That tree, that big beautiful tree has never had a nut.  
**0:53:55-0:53:56:**  It's never flowered.  
**0:53:56-0:53:58:**  And it's like 18 years old.  
**0:53:58-0:53:59:**  That is a waste of space.  
**0:53:59-0:54:03:**  Where's that little one that falls over is the mother of nations.  
**0:54:03-0:54:07:**  It survives 40 below zero almost every single winter.  
**0:54:07-0:54:12:**  And the seed that I've gotten from that have populated the rest of the farm.  
**0:54:12-0:54:18:**  And so we have to, we have to like let go of our concepts of what we think should be  
**0:54:18-0:54:21:**  and learn how to work with what actually is.  
**0:54:21-0:54:26:**  And we find out that it's actually quite brilliant how it's all designed and how it works together.  
**0:54:26-0:54:29:**  Nature is amazingly successful.  
**0:54:29-0:54:33:**  You know, it's something that's coming to my mind is that, you know, as you're describing  
**0:54:33-0:54:40:**  your farm and the way that you manage it, it's actually pretty intensive.  
**0:54:40-0:54:45:**  You don't give a lot in the sense, non-intensive in the conventional way that we think of intensive  
**0:54:45-0:54:50:**  through lots of irrigation, lots of fertilization, but intensive in terms of, you know, you're  
**0:54:50-0:54:57:**  really selecting intensively for, you know, productivity yields and lots of different  
**0:54:57-0:55:01:**  parameters adapted to the sites, et cetera, you're selecting for.  
**0:55:01-0:55:05:**  You're also, you know, intensively mixing lots of species together, getting animals  
**0:55:05-0:55:06:**  involved.  
**0:55:06-0:55:09:**  This is quite an intensive, let's say space.  
**0:55:09-0:55:11:**  I think it's information intense.  
**0:55:11-0:55:12:**  Yes.  
**0:55:12-0:55:14:**  It's very intensive of the information.  
**0:55:14-0:55:18:**  If you look at a natural system, if you've got a hundred different species going on,  
**0:55:18-0:55:23:**  a hundred times a hundred is how many different possible permutations of this affecting that.  
**0:55:23-0:55:27:**  So yeah, that's massively intense, but I don't have to do it.  
**0:55:27-0:55:29:**  With the selecting, think about this.  
**0:55:29-0:55:32:**  Do I have to tell you to go to an apple orchard?  
**0:55:32-0:55:34:**  Here's an apple orchard that somebody's abandoned.  
**0:55:34-0:55:37:**  I want you to go pick an apple that you want to eat.  
**0:55:37-0:55:42:**  You'll naturally go get like this big juicy, you know, if you like red ones or whatever,  
**0:55:42-0:55:45:**  no bugs, no diseases, et cetera.  
**0:55:45-0:55:49:**  We know as human beings what it is that we actually want from a system.  
**0:55:49-0:55:52:**  So I just wander through and it's like, wow, I want that one, that one, that one, that  
**0:55:52-0:55:53:**  one.  
**0:55:53-0:55:54:**  So I harvest all those for my seed.  
**0:55:54-0:55:56:**  That's not really all that intense.  
**0:55:56-0:55:59:**  A four year old can go pick the apple that they want to eat.  
**0:55:59-0:56:05:**  They can do genetic selection as long as we save the seed and keep it going on.  
**0:56:05-0:56:09:**  And then as far as the intensive, it's not labor intensive.  
**0:56:09-0:56:12:**  Every farmer is going to have to harvest.  
**0:56:12-0:56:15:**  So we all share that.  
**0:56:15-0:56:20:**  I have more harvests at different periods of time because they have more crops that  
**0:56:20-0:56:21:**  are growing.  
**0:56:21-0:56:25:**  But I have large periods of time that I don't have to be here.  
**0:56:25-0:56:33:**  I was just on the road working and vacationing from July 12th until last week, not doing  
**0:56:33-0:56:34:**  anything.  
**0:56:34-0:56:35:**  So then I come back here.  
**0:56:35-0:56:37:**  Now I'm getting ready for hazelnut harvest.  
**0:56:37-0:56:41:**  Well, by getting ready for hazelnut harvest, it's getting me ready for apple harvest, which  
**0:56:41-0:56:46:**  is getting me ready for chestnut harvest, which gets it all set to send the livestock  
**0:56:46-0:56:49:**  to the slaughterhouse.  
**0:56:49-0:56:56:**  If you're doing like annual produce or row crops, if I'm doing a weed control in my corn  
**0:56:56-0:57:02:**  that's next to my walnuts, for example, it's taking care of the weed control for the walnuts.  
**0:57:02-0:57:07:**  But I'm focusing on this cash crop because this is my corn or my vegetables, but it's  
**0:57:07-0:57:08:**  taking care of that.  
**0:57:08-0:57:13:**  So by taking care of this, it naturally takes care of that, which takes care of that, which  
**0:57:13-0:57:14:**  takes care of that.  
**0:57:14-0:57:18:**  And if I just walk away, it does okay.  
**0:57:18-0:57:19:**  This is a natural system.  
**0:57:19-0:57:23:**  It's been here for 94 million years.  
**0:57:23-0:57:24:**  That's very interesting.  
**0:57:24-0:57:34:**  I wanted to go a bit into the one aspect that I find curious to understand is you started  
**0:57:34-0:57:41:**  planting a hundred species, let's say, or a hundred, not species, a hundred specimen  
**0:57:41-0:57:42:**  of one species.  
**0:57:42-0:57:49:**  And out of those 100, after your thinning, when you would consider the system to be more  
**0:57:49-0:57:55:**  mature, let's say at maybe 20, 25 years, how many of those 100, let's use hazelnuts again,  
**0:57:55-0:58:00:**  because we've been using this example, how many of those 100 would you have at the end  
**0:58:00-0:58:01:**  of it?  
**0:58:01-0:58:06:**  Because if they make it through all my criteria.  
**0:58:06-0:58:10:**  But typically in your system, what kind of have you seen this?  
**0:58:10-0:58:16:**  Now, how you phrase that question, this is not your fault, shows how most people are  
**0:58:16-0:58:18:**  trained.  
**0:58:18-0:58:20:**  Nature doesn't work that way.  
**0:58:20-0:58:21:**  It doesn't work that way.  
**0:58:21-0:58:25:**  This individual grows and it does really well for a period of time.  
**0:58:25-0:58:28:**  And then the climate is different.  
**0:58:28-0:58:30:**  The CO2 levels in the atmosphere are different.  
**0:58:30-0:58:32:**  A new pest comes through, a new disease comes through.  
**0:58:32-0:58:36:**  Now it's susceptible when it wasn't, it used to be the best variety in the world, but now  
**0:58:36-0:58:37:**  it's not.  
**0:58:37-0:58:38:**  And so now it drops out.  
**0:58:38-0:58:44:**  So when you ask nature, well, gee whiz nature, which one of your species was the best?  
**0:58:44-0:58:46:**  That's an irrelevant question.  
**0:58:46-0:58:47:**  It's a relevant question.  
**0:58:47-0:58:55:**  What's here is here and it changes and it adapts with reality as reality changes.  
**0:58:55-0:59:01:**  And if you're looking for an easy mathematical number to track that, there ain't one.  
**0:59:01-0:59:02:**  There's not one.  
**0:59:02-0:59:03:**  Of course.  
**0:59:03-0:59:06:**  Oh, it would be extremely dependent on, as you said, of course the years and it makes  
**0:59:06-0:59:11:**  sense, but also on the species, on the place where they're planted, on a variety of aspects.  
**0:59:11-0:59:16:**  But what I was trying to maybe understand and I'll elaborate a bit more is I'm trying  
**0:59:16-0:59:21:**  to understand if in order for a person to set up a system like this, to start a system  
**0:59:21-0:59:25:**  like this, they're going to need to have a pretty good deal with the nurseries.  
**0:59:25-0:59:29:**  Because if we're buying, for example, and that's what I would expect.  
**0:59:29-0:59:32:**  So please correct me and tell me how you go around that problem.  
**0:59:32-0:59:37:**  But let's say I'm planting here around here, the chestnuts would cost about 12 euros a  
**0:59:37-0:59:38:**  tree.  
**0:59:38-0:59:44:**  I'm trying to think about the trees that are similar to yours.  
**0:59:44-0:59:47:**  There's more olives and almonds, et cetera, but almonds would be three and a half years  
**0:59:47-0:59:48:**  a tree.  
**0:59:48-0:59:51:**  So if you're planting a hundred of them and at the end you're expecting to keep, you're  
**0:59:51-0:59:55:**  going to be thinning them gradually as they just don't perform.  
**0:59:55-0:59:57:**  How do you go about that?  
**0:59:57-1:00:01:**  How do you just kind of manage that huge cost, which is a very significant cost at the start  
**1:00:01-1:00:04:**  of an operation in terms of buying the genetics?  
**1:00:04-1:00:10:**  Now here is where I'm going to defer to the agroforesters that have all the Excel spreadsheets.  
**1:00:10-1:00:14:**  And if you go do the Excel spreadsheets and you look at the number of plants that you  
**1:00:14-1:00:18:**  put in or the price of the plants that you put in, and then you give it, they run it  
**1:00:18-1:00:21:**  and they amortize it over 24 years or whatever like that, it disappears.  
**1:00:21-1:00:23:**  It's a non-existent cost.  
**1:00:23-1:00:27:**  It really doesn't matter how many you put in per acre as far as the overall performance  
**1:00:27-1:00:29:**  of the system over 24 years.  
**1:00:29-1:00:30:**  However, that's not my point.  
**1:00:30-1:00:37:**  My point is, and see how you just said that, it's like, well, each plant costs 25 euros  
**1:00:37-1:00:41:**  or 10 euros because I can do tens, easy to do tens.  
**1:00:41-1:00:47:**  So if everything costs me 10 to put it in, you know what an equation is, right?  
**1:00:47-1:00:52:**  An equation is an equal sign, which means this side equals that side.  
**1:00:52-1:00:58:**  If you're looking at the equation of a thousand trees equals 10,000 euros, you're looking  
**1:00:58-1:01:01:**  at it from the wrong side.  
**1:01:01-1:01:06:**  It's still 10,000 trees, your thousand trees equals 10,000 euros, but you're on the expense  
**1:01:06-1:01:08:**  side instead of on the profit side.  
**1:01:08-1:01:14:**  A nursery grows these trees from seed, sells them and it marks them up at a profit.  
**1:01:14-1:01:17:**  So why not set up your own nursery?  
**1:01:17-1:01:21:**  You buy bulk wholesale, split them up and sell them to other people and the profits  
**1:01:21-1:01:26:**  from you marking them up and selling to other people pay for your plants to go on the ground.  
**1:01:26-1:01:30:**  Then once upon a time, you'll start to have your own seed coming in or you're buying seed  
**1:01:30-1:01:31:**  from somewhere else.  
**1:01:31-1:01:34:**  You grow those plants out and you sell some.  
**1:01:34-1:01:40:**  Planting trees on your farm is a profitable venture.  
**1:01:40-1:01:44:**  If it's not a profitable venture, you're doing it wrong.  
**1:01:44-1:01:46:**  Now wrong doesn't mean you're a bad person.  
**1:01:46-1:01:50:**  It just means that you're not doing it in a way that's profitable.  
**1:01:50-1:01:55:**  You do it in a way that's profitable by buying more than you need at wholesale bulk prices  
**1:01:55-1:02:00:**  and selling enough off to cover your expenses or you're growing your own and selling them  
**1:02:00-1:02:03:**  at a markup.  
**1:02:03-1:02:04:**  If you want...  
**1:02:04-1:02:08:**  That would require getting the nursery license, getting inspected by the state.  
**1:02:08-1:02:11:**  It's called running a successful business.  
**1:02:11-1:02:17:**  If you want to run a successful business, the way to not do it is to spend more money  
**1:02:17-1:02:19:**  than you earn.  
**1:02:19-1:02:21:**  I just showed you right there.  
**1:02:21-1:02:24:**  That is a huge secret to success right there.  
**1:02:24-1:02:28:**  Every tree goes in at a profit, period.  
**1:02:28-1:02:29:**  That's very interesting.  
**1:02:29-1:02:37:**  That would require the person to have knowledge about nursery, about growing trees and planting  
**1:02:37-1:02:40:**  seed and scarification of seeds, et cetera.  
**1:02:40-1:02:41:**  Not at all.  
**1:02:41-1:02:42:**  Not at all.  
**1:02:42-1:02:43:**  Not at all.  
**1:02:43-1:02:44:**  All right.  
**1:02:44-1:02:49:**  Go to whatever your favorite nursery is and look at their price per plant.  
**1:02:49-1:02:50:**  What if you buy 500?  
**1:02:50-1:02:51:**  What if you buy 1,000?  
**1:02:51-1:02:52:**  The price goes down.  
**1:02:52-1:02:56:**  You just do the math and say, oh, and this is what I did with apples at first.  
**1:02:56-1:02:57:**  That's when it dawned on me.  
**1:02:57-1:03:00:**  I wanted 100 apple trees.  
**1:03:00-1:03:02:**  I looked at the price catalogs back then.  
**1:03:02-1:03:04:**  You use paper and you read the catalog.  
**1:03:04-1:03:09:**  At that price, it was going to cost me, let's say, $5 a plant.  
**1:03:09-1:03:14:**  Well, if I got 500 of them, it would only cost me $4 a plant.  
**1:03:14-1:03:18:**  So I went to an orchardist down the road and said, hey, Mike, you want some plants?  
**1:03:18-1:03:20:**  You want 400 apple trees?  
**1:03:20-1:03:22:**  Well, did they have these?  
**1:03:22-1:03:23:**  I says, yeah.  
**1:03:23-1:03:24:**  He says, okay, then I'll buy them.  
**1:03:24-1:03:25:**  So he bought them.  
**1:03:25-1:03:32:**  He was expecting to pay his 100 rate because he was only getting 400.  
**1:03:32-1:03:36:**  Well, I was able to get them a little bit better rate, but I can mark it up enough to  
**1:03:36-1:03:38:**  pay for my trees.  
**1:03:38-1:03:40:**  So I go to the catalog and I'm about to call the company.  
**1:03:40-1:03:45:**  Then I noticed that if I bought 1,000 trees, it would only cost me an extra 100 bucks.  
**1:03:45-1:03:48:**  So I bought 1,000 trees.  
**1:03:48-1:03:50:**  Mike paid for 500 of them.  
**1:03:50-1:03:55:**  Now I got these 500 trees left over that only cost me like 10 cents apiece.  
**1:03:55-1:03:56:**  Now I got to sell them.  
**1:03:56-1:03:59:**  Well, I couldn't sell them all.  
**1:03:59-1:04:01:**  So I planted them here.  
**1:04:01-1:04:06:**  And so it required no knowledge of stratification processes of seeds, no knowledge about how  
**1:04:06-1:04:08:**  to run a nursery bed and this and that and the other thing.  
**1:04:08-1:04:11:**  I just bought stuff, broke it apart, resold it.  
**1:04:11-1:04:12:**  Interesting.  
**1:04:12-1:04:18:**  So then you need to have a good network and be able to sell those off.  
**1:04:18-1:04:20:**  But that's an interesting approach.  
**1:04:20-1:04:21:**  Not when you start.  
**1:04:21-1:04:23:**  When you start, you have nothing.  
**1:04:23-1:04:24:**  Get over it.  
**1:04:24-1:04:28:**  You start with where you are and you build that over time.  
**1:04:28-1:04:29:**  You develop the business.  
**1:04:29-1:04:31:**  You create this business.  
**1:04:31-1:04:36:**  And here's the easy way to do it is if we got all these different, let's say, 50-hectare  
**1:04:36-1:04:39:**  farms all over the place, you now buy this farm.  
**1:04:39-1:04:42:**  Okay, now the nursery license is under your name.  
**1:04:42-1:04:45:**  You go ahead and you do all this kind of stuff after you're fully planted five years from  
**1:04:45-1:04:46:**  now.  
**1:04:46-1:04:48:**  You pass it off to somebody else.  
**1:04:48-1:04:53:**  And how many acres of open ground are there on this planet?  
**1:04:53-1:04:54:**  We can do this.  
**1:04:54-1:04:55:**  It's not a Ponzi scheme at all.  
**1:04:55-1:05:00:**  We can do this for hundreds of years and never fill all the space that could use trees on  
**1:05:00-1:05:01:**  this planet.  
**1:05:01-1:05:07:**  We can revegetate the entire planet in 15 years at a profit if we actually get off our  
**1:05:07-1:05:09:**  asses and do it.  
**1:05:09-1:05:14:**  So now let's go back to economics and say, okay, now let's look at the economics of chestnut,  
**1:05:14-1:05:15:**  for example.  
**1:05:15-1:05:16:**  And you kind of pencil it all out.  
**1:05:16-1:05:19:**  It's a 24-year return on your investment, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
**1:05:19-1:05:20:**  And it takes all these different inputs.  
**1:05:20-1:05:23:**  Well, my inputs all go away.  
**1:05:23-1:05:27:**  And then the initial planting stock is put in at a profit.  
**1:05:27-1:05:30:**  So I now have a nursery business that's profitable.  
**1:05:30-1:05:33:**  I have a cattle business that's profitable.  
**1:05:33-1:05:37:**  You know, the hogs are profitable and the trees are profitable in part because I don't  
**1:05:37-1:05:38:**  do a darn thing to it.  
**1:05:38-1:05:41:**  Oh, but your pests and diseases go through the roof.  
**1:05:41-1:05:42:**  Yes, they do.  
**1:05:42-1:05:46:**  But I'm now doing genetic selection to select against the ones that are susceptible.  
**1:05:46-1:05:49:**  So now I have all this surplus wood that I've got to somehow get rid of.  
**1:05:49-1:05:54:**  So I either make it into boards behind me, burn it in a wood stove to keep me warm in  
**1:05:54-1:05:59:**  the wintertime, or turn it into mushrooms that I can eat, feed the pigs, or sell to  
**1:05:59-1:06:00:**  people.  
**1:06:00-1:06:04:**  It's like, and you wonder why somebody just can't make it pencil out when they're trying  
**1:06:04-1:06:09:**  to look at one crop and see that that one crop pays for absolutely everything and you  
**1:06:09-1:06:13:**  need the tractor, the sprayer, the this tool, that tool, and all that kind of stuff.  
**1:06:13-1:06:19:**  That is the wrong way to do it like an ecosystem.  
**1:06:19-1:06:26:**  The value in your business is really the interactions, the recycling, right?  
**1:06:26-1:06:31:**  In the sense that's what you were explaining earlier on, the fact that you can just make  
**1:06:31-1:06:35:**  a chestnut, for example, thin it, and you can create mushrooms with it, or you can feed  
**1:06:35-1:06:36:**  an animal with it.  
**1:06:36-1:06:39:**  And you do that on so many interactions on so many different levels.  
**1:06:39-1:06:45:**  This is what builds the resilience, the low costs, and therefore the high relative profitability.  
**1:06:45-1:06:49:**  Yeah, it's the whole system that is the most significant.  
**1:06:49-1:06:52:**  And there's a lot of people say, oh, show me somebody who's done your systems.  
**1:06:52-1:06:55:**  Like, well, there really aren't very many people who've done the whole system.  
**1:06:55-1:06:59:**  People go in and they'll cherry pick and then they'll look, oh, chestnut, look.  
**1:06:59-1:07:03:**  And they go get fixated on chestnuts and then they go extra heavy on chestnuts.  
**1:07:03-1:07:08:**  Well then they don't get all of the synergistic benefits of managing a system because they  
**1:07:08-1:07:09:**  don't have a system.  
**1:07:09-1:07:13:**  Or they do raspberries because your turnaround is like in three years, you're massively profitable  
**1:07:13-1:07:19:**  in three years, but you're a chemical or at least an organic spray oriented raspberry  
**1:07:19-1:07:21:**  business.  
**1:07:21-1:07:24:**  Why do you think that's the case that there's not many people that have applied the whole  
**1:07:24-1:07:26:**  system as one?  
**1:07:26-1:07:29:**  What's your opinion on that?  
**1:07:29-1:07:35:**  My current working opinion, which is subject to change once new information comes along,  
**1:07:35-1:07:40:**  is I think that what it is, and you've already demonstrated this several times, is you don't  
**1:07:40-1:07:41:**  believe it.  
**1:07:41-1:07:42:**  That can't be possible.  
**1:07:42-1:07:43:**  It can't be true.  
**1:07:43-1:07:44:**  No way.  
**1:07:44-1:07:48:**  And then you look at my place and it looks to most people would look like a mess.  
**1:07:48-1:07:50:**  There's no way that that thing can pay its bills.  
**1:07:50-1:07:52:**  It's like, yeah, it can.  
**1:07:52-1:07:53:**  Nature works.  
**1:07:53-1:07:55:**  It has always worked.  
**1:07:55-1:08:00:**  And all we have to do is figure out how to interact with it the way it works.  
**1:08:00-1:08:04:**  And then we just extract the actual yield from it.  
**1:08:04-1:08:07:**  The ecologically produced surplus.  
**1:08:07-1:08:09:**  And I'm going to cough a bit.  
**1:08:09-1:08:19:**  Let's just use in the US, Eastern US, white pine is a pretty common standard tree species.  
**1:08:19-1:08:23:**  And if you're doing a reforestation project, I'm going to buy a piece of real estate, plant  
**1:08:23-1:08:31:**  a white pine plantation and harvest it in 50 years, I'll make an approximate 7% return  
**1:08:31-1:08:36:**  on my investment without doing anything.  
**1:08:36-1:08:42:**  So we've got numbers for certain specific things that are useful and valuable numbers,  
**1:08:42-1:08:46:**  but it's way more than that, way better than that when we run a whole system.  
**1:08:46-1:08:51:**  But the only thing is we have to interact with it.  
**1:08:51-1:08:55:**  And I guess, as you said, like when you said, like, you know, I've expressed a few times  
**1:08:55-1:09:02:**  in the sense, not this belief at all, because I do believe and I do trust the things that  
**1:09:02-1:09:09:**  you're saying, but I guess that it requires quite a different take on how to fund and  
**1:09:09-1:09:15:**  very different to what we see, what we learn and what we study, what we do.  
**1:09:15-1:09:21:**  And so it does require quite a big change in mentality and an approach and also somehow  
**1:09:21-1:09:22:**  faith.  
**1:09:22-1:09:23:**  Because, I mean, you see what I mean?  
**1:09:23-1:09:27:**  If you're planting all these chestnuts, for example, and you're thinking, wow, but what  
**1:09:27-1:09:32:**  if something comes along and just decimates them and then, you know, can I really, will  
**1:09:32-1:09:34:**  I really manage to select the right ones?  
**1:09:34-1:09:36:**  I mean, there's lots of questions there.  
**1:09:36-1:09:40:**  And that's why most people don't believe it.  
**1:09:40-1:09:45:**  They say it's not, they just get to the end of all of their thinking, the way that they  
**1:09:45-1:09:46:**  were trained to think.  
**1:09:46-1:09:48:**  And it's like, I don't believe it.  
**1:09:48-1:09:49:**  It can't work.  
**1:09:49-1:09:51:**  It can't work.  
**1:09:51-1:09:55:**  And then the whole, our industry is set up this way.  
**1:09:55-1:10:00:**  Our universities is set up this way to get you thinking in nice little monocrop pigeon  
**1:10:00-1:10:02:**  holes that this is the only way to do it.  
**1:10:02-1:10:06:**  There's actually, I haven't done it yet, but I'm going to.  
**1:10:06-1:10:11:**  One of the local universities has done, and there's a nonprofit who's also done it, this  
**1:10:11-1:10:15:**  analysis on how to grow hazelnuts, and they've proven over and over and over again that if  
**1:10:15-1:10:20:**  you're growing hazelnuts in the upper Midwest, it's not profitable.  
**1:10:20-1:10:25:**  They conclude because we don't have the cultivars that will give us the yields that will make  
**1:10:25-1:10:26:**  it profitable.  
**1:10:26-1:10:34:**  They're looking for a cultivar or several cultivars of one species that will then produce  
**1:10:34-1:10:40:**  so many nuts that it will pay for all the expenses that you need to do.  
**1:10:40-1:10:41:**  And they have it outlined.  
**1:10:41-1:10:45:**  You need this equipment, this spray, this fertilizer, this weed control, that kind of  
**1:10:45-1:10:46:**  stuff.  
**1:10:46-1:10:48:**  I'm going to go through using their data.  
**1:10:48-1:10:50:**  Say, okay, here's your data.  
**1:10:50-1:10:52:**  This is why you say it's not profitable.  
**1:10:52-1:10:58:**  I'll show you that what you're doing and how you're doing it is the wrong way to grow that  
**1:10:58-1:11:00:**  crop profitably.  
**1:11:00-1:11:06:**  If you want to grow that crop profitably, that's not the way to do it.  
**1:11:06-1:11:12:**  And so there, I just dared myself in public to write that article.  
**1:11:12-1:11:13:**  I like that a lot.  
**1:11:13-1:11:16:**  That's very good.  
**1:11:16-1:11:23:**  It seems like one of the keys to a successful start is to find the right genetics.  
**1:11:23-1:11:29:**  So I guess, tell me a bit about the importance in the logic of restoration agriculture and  
**1:11:29-1:11:34:**  the system that you've described to us of bringing into your farm and doing the research  
**1:11:34-1:11:39:**  of finding the right genetics that are, nowadays we have cultivars of, I'm more familiar with  
**1:11:39-1:11:43:**  Mediterranean climate, but we have cultivars of almonds that have been really pushed to  
**1:11:43-1:11:48:**  and bred within a system of high intensive inputs.  
**1:11:48-1:11:54:**  And so if I take some of these cultivars, it may not necessarily be doing myself a favor  
**1:11:54-1:11:59:**  and I may be setting myself back as compared to if I was to find the rustic cultivars.  
**1:11:59-1:12:02:**  So how would you advise people on that?  
**1:12:02-1:12:08:**  The mass selection process has a very specific protocol and you do all the research that  
**1:12:08-1:12:15:**  you can to find all the characteristics in that almond that you're looking for.  
**1:12:15-1:12:19:**  Don't disregard the modern varieties because they have serious hardcore genetics that are  
**1:12:19-1:12:21:**  really, really useful.  
**1:12:21-1:12:24:**  They've just been bred in a context that isn't nature.  
**1:12:24-1:12:30:**  Well, mass selection starts with grabbing genetics from all over the place.  
**1:12:30-1:12:33:**  You bring it together and then you go ahead and you plant them together.  
**1:12:33-1:12:38:**  Well then what I've done and what natural planting would do if you're just going out  
**1:12:38-1:12:43:**  and reforesting something is you just put them in there and you ignore them.  
**1:12:43-1:12:47:**  That's what the strategic total utter neglect, STUN, that's what that means.  
**1:12:47-1:12:51:**  Get them established for a year or two and then ignore them and if they die, you're not  
**1:12:51-1:12:52:**  interested.  
**1:12:52-1:12:58:**  But if you're going, like say three years, I bet you if you planted 250 different almond  
**1:12:58-1:13:03:**  varieties you're going to have a handful that flower next year.  
**1:13:03-1:13:04:**  Those are the ones that you now focus on.  
**1:13:04-1:13:09:**  You get those cross pollinated and you start your own breeding program.  
**1:13:09-1:13:12:**  We don't know the ideal genetics.  
**1:13:12-1:13:17:**  Go to somebody who has already been doing mass selection breeding like the Forest Agriculture  
**1:13:17-1:13:19:**  Nursery.  
**1:13:19-1:13:24:**  You know that they have been mass selected breeding.  
**1:13:24-1:13:27:**  They have cultivars but that's not the point.  
**1:13:27-1:13:30:**  It's the population that matters, not the individual.  
**1:13:30-1:13:34:**  And so go to somebody who's already doing mass selection breeding, start there and then  
**1:13:34-1:13:37:**  bring in everything else from everywhere else.  
**1:13:37-1:13:41:**  There's actually two of my apple varieties are more modern apple varieties that were  
**1:13:41-1:13:46:**  bred at Purdue with one pollen grain and one flower and bagged and you pray for 10 years  
**1:13:46-1:13:49:**  and look at it and that's Priscilla and Liberty.  
**1:13:49-1:13:53:**  Those are incredible apple trees hardly anything bothers.  
**1:13:53-1:13:55:**  The other things, the other ones are ones that I've discovered.  
**1:13:55-1:14:02:**  Some are heritage, some are modern and four of them are varieties that I selected myself  
**1:14:02-1:14:04:**  from my own seedlings.  
**1:14:04-1:14:10:**  So if I were close to you, if I were let's say 50 miles from your place, could I just  
**1:14:10-1:14:11:**  rely on your genetics?  
**1:14:11-1:14:15:**  Could I just say, oh he's already selected them so I'm just going to use Mark's genetics  
**1:14:15-1:14:20:**  or should I go through the process of again of getting a wide variety because this is  
**1:14:20-1:14:26:**  also, I mean some people can be a bit overwhelmed by the amount of work that that would entail  
**1:14:26-1:14:31:**  and the amount of, again finding all these things and knowing where to look and etc.  
**1:14:31-1:14:33:**  This can be something quite challenging for somebody.  
**1:14:33-1:14:36:**  So could we just rely on you?  
**1:14:36-1:14:41:**  So what you just, the way you just asked that question, that's a classic landowner and that's  
**1:14:41-1:14:46:**  the reason why most of the people that I've worked with don't have a complete system planted  
**1:14:46-1:14:49:**  because they're like yeah but I'm not going to do the whole thing.  
**1:14:49-1:14:51:**  So you go do part of the thing.  
**1:14:51-1:14:58:**  Well nature itself as a whole complete system requires nothing from us whatsoever.  
**1:14:58-1:15:02:**  Once you start to make decisions and I'm not going to do the whole system, you will now  
**1:15:02-1:15:04:**  have inputs which is fine.  
**1:15:04-1:15:10:**  There's actually an organic apple grower up the road who started with this organic orchard,  
**1:15:10-1:15:15:**  orchard style and you know poo-pooed my work for years and years and years until he finally  
**1:15:15-1:15:17:**  said, well hang on a second.  
**1:15:17-1:15:18:**  You're onto something.  
**1:15:18-1:15:23:**  So we started experimenting with polycultures and now it's a certified organic polyculture  
**1:15:23-1:15:25:**  you know beautiful wild place.  
**1:15:25-1:15:31:**  He's got extra enterprises that have started on the farm and he has a regular spray regimen.  
**1:15:31-1:15:37:**  And so there's going to be all these different halfway between this and that.  
**1:15:37-1:15:44:**  So would I recommend you rely entirely on forest ag for your genetics?  
**1:15:44-1:15:45:**  For the genetics?  
**1:15:45-1:15:46:**  No.  
**1:15:46-1:15:47:**  For the plants?  
**1:15:47-1:15:48:**  Yes.  
**1:15:48-1:15:50:**  We'll give you a deal on that and we'll source the other plants for you.  
**1:15:50-1:15:55:**  You just say what you want because we buy bulk wholesale from other nurseries and we'll  
**1:15:55-1:15:57:**  split them up and send them your way.  
**1:15:57-1:16:02:**  So yeah come to forestag.com order your trees, except we can't ship to Europe.  
**1:16:02-1:16:04:**  We have actually so many listeners from the US.  
**1:16:04-1:16:08:**  Many people will be actually pretty close to you and that would be relevant.  
**1:16:08-1:16:12:**  But I'm going to do that idea that you said and do that genetic work.  
**1:16:12-1:16:13:**  There you go.  
**1:16:13-1:16:17:**  I think that with almonds because I love almonds and I think that would be really, really interesting.  
**1:16:17-1:16:22:**  You mentioned now something that I wanted to talk about and that is, let's say that  
**1:16:22-1:16:27:**  the compromise is between a full system but still using a polyculture.  
**1:16:27-1:16:33:**  And so maybe we could, you already explained that you would probably have more inputs.  
**1:16:33-1:16:35:**  Maybe we can just break that down a bit more.  
**1:16:35-1:16:38:**  If we have somebody coming here and says, yeah, okay, that's all great, but I only want  
**1:16:38-1:16:40:**  to use three species.  
**1:16:40-1:16:46:**  He'll still do, he or she, sorry, will still do the whole work of sourcing lots of genetics  
**1:16:46-1:16:50:**  and from many different places and putting them together and thinning, etc.  
**1:16:50-1:16:56:**  He or she still follows that process, but it's only three species.  
**1:16:56-1:16:58:**  What can we expect from that?  
**1:16:58-1:17:02:**  What kind of performance can we expect from a more simplified system like this?  
**1:17:02-1:17:07:**  That it'll do better over time as that selection process continues.  
**1:17:07-1:17:12:**  That's what you're doing is you're selecting for the ones that are doing well on your property  
**1:17:12-1:17:15:**  and you will continue to improve the yields from that system.  
**1:17:15-1:17:19:**  The fact that there's only, let's say two or three species doesn't really matter because  
**1:17:19-1:17:22:**  you've mentioned you have 15 species there.  
**1:17:22-1:17:26:**  Well, I won't say, yeah, I won't say it doesn't matter.  
**1:17:26-1:17:30:**  I'm just saying that once you start doing that breeding work within those particular  
**1:17:30-1:17:34:**  three species, that system's going to do better through time.  
**1:17:34-1:17:37:**  Will it have all of the things involved with it to help it to do everything?  
**1:17:37-1:17:38:**  We don't know.  
**1:17:38-1:17:42:**  One of the things also that does matter is scale.  
**1:17:42-1:17:48:**  We'll use it for pest control, for example, and it matters for breeding.  
**1:17:48-1:17:53:**  If I have cucumbers, for example, I'm growing cucumbers.  
**1:17:53-1:17:57:**  If I've got cucumber beetles that come into my population, this is what happened with  
**1:17:57-1:18:02:**  me at about year three or year four, finally cucumber beetles started to be really, really,  
**1:18:02-1:18:05:**  really an economic hassle and I'm not going to spray.  
**1:18:05-1:18:07:**  I'm not going to spray.  
**1:18:07-1:18:12:**  Then it was like year four to five, all of a sudden their populations dropped way, way,  
**1:18:12-1:18:14:**  way, way, way, way down.  
**1:18:14-1:18:16:**  Think about a pest population.  
**1:18:16-1:18:20:**  If you're planting only cucumbers, the cucumber beetles, squash beetles are going to just  
**1:18:20-1:18:21:**  do this.  
**1:18:21-1:18:25:**  Well, if you spray, they're back here again and then they're going to do this and then  
**1:18:25-1:18:28:**  you spray, whether you're using a chemical or organic.  
**1:18:28-1:18:34:**  Well, if you do this, now all of a sudden you're up here, way more cucumber beetles.  
**1:18:34-1:18:39:**  Now you have enough food to support the critters that eat them and you have enough conditions  
**1:18:39-1:18:44:**  that are such that they're overpopulated and they get diseases and then they fall away.  
**1:18:44-1:18:49:**  You won't get into the control phase until you go through the catastrophic loss phase.  
**1:18:49-1:18:54:**  That's simple population dynamics and there's math for just about everything.  
**1:18:54-1:19:03:**  If you do that in a suburban lot, you've got a 20-foot diameter patch of cucumbers, you'll  
**1:19:03-1:19:09:**  never be able to break through into that level where you have enough to feed the diseases  
**1:19:09-1:19:11:**  and the other things that come to eat it.  
**1:19:11-1:19:16:**  What you've created is a refuge for all these pests to come to because you're not spraying  
**1:19:16-1:19:17:**  anything.  
**1:19:17-1:19:24:**  There needs to be a certain scale for ecological processes to really kick in and they're different  
**1:19:24-1:19:26:**  from a fruit fly to a redwood.  
**1:19:26-1:19:30:**  There's different time scales involved with that.  
**1:19:30-1:19:35:**  Also with genetics, there's a couple of different seed companies in the US that have networked  
**1:19:35-1:19:38:**  growers that are growing vegetable seed and you're growing it here and there and here  
**1:19:38-1:19:39:**  and there.  
**1:19:39-1:19:42:**  They work with small growers and they pride themselves in the fact that they're working  
**1:19:42-1:19:43:**  with small growers.  
**1:19:43-1:19:46:**  Acorn squash is a crop that I'm really familiar with.  
**1:19:46-1:19:49:**  I grew it for 25 years commercially.  
**1:19:49-1:19:56:**  In order to get all of the genes to express in acorn squash, you need approximately 40  
**1:19:56-1:20:00:**  acres of acorn squash to get all those genes to express.  
**1:20:00-1:20:05:**  Then you go through and you select the ones that are the type that you want.  
**1:20:05-1:20:11:**  Then they also get many of these off types because that's a critical part of that whole  
**1:20:11-1:20:14:**  gene pool and then they bring that back in.  
**1:20:14-1:20:20:**  If you have a five acre plot and you're saving your seed for acorn squash, for example, and  
**1:20:20-1:20:22:**  then this person over here grew the same variety.  
**1:20:22-1:20:25:**  Let's use table ace was my favorite variety.  
**1:20:25-1:20:28:**  You're growing table ace on five acres and 20 other growers are growing table ace on  
**1:20:28-1:20:29:**  five acres.  
**1:20:29-1:20:33:**  Now, years down the line, your table ace looks different than mine.  
**1:20:33-1:20:34:**  How is that possible?  
**1:20:34-1:20:39:**  Because we didn't have enough in one area to express all of those genes and we lost  
**1:20:39-1:20:40:**  traits.  
**1:20:40-1:20:41:**  Very interesting.  
**1:20:41-1:20:46:**  What you're saying, it kind of reminds me of the importance for anybody that's going  
**1:20:46-1:20:50:**  to go into this system to have studied ecology.  
**1:20:50-1:20:52:**  Not studied, I'm not saying necessarily at university.  
**1:20:52-1:20:57:**  I'm just saying to have an understanding of ecology because you're basically really working  
**1:20:57-1:21:03:**  with ecological patterns and ecological knowledge instead of knowledge of how to spray, how  
**1:21:03-1:21:09:**  to fertilize, which is, I mean, I've got so many books up there about how to fertilize.  
**1:21:09-1:21:10:**  I've got some about ecology.  
**1:21:10-1:21:12:**  Dorian, I've got your book there as well.  
**1:21:12-1:21:16:**  They're always inspiring, but it seems like the basis of the knowledge that one would  
**1:21:16-1:21:21:**  need to get involved with this kind of agricultural approach.  
**1:21:21-1:21:27:**  A basic ecological understanding, if you're to do it and steer it successfully, is important.  
**1:21:27-1:21:34:**  One way to get it is to go to restoringagriculture.com and sign up for my beta course.  
**1:21:34-1:21:39:**  It was a series of 80 or so webinars that I did.  
**1:21:39-1:21:46:**  What it is, it's a college level ecology curriculum cherry picked to pick the things that a farmer  
**1:21:46-1:21:49:**  would need to know and want to know.  
**1:21:49-1:21:56:**  Going from how to get started to genetic selection to managing succession through time.  
**1:21:56-1:22:04:**  There's special things in there and how I've done asparagus and how to mulch 40 acres all  
**1:22:04-1:22:07:**  at once.  
**1:22:07-1:22:08:**  Restoringagriculture.com.  
**1:22:08-1:22:10:**  Restoringagriculture.com, perfect.  
**1:22:10-1:22:18:**  We're going to put that in the notes below for people to have easy access to.  
**1:22:18-1:22:19:**  That's interesting.  
**1:22:19-1:22:24:**  I want to just pull that logic of the polyculture one step further.  
**1:22:24-1:22:28:**  Imagine I'm very interested in walnuts and I'm going to follow your approach in terms  
**1:22:28-1:22:34:**  of the breeding and in terms of planting densely, selecting and thinning, but I just want walnuts.  
**1:22:34-1:22:38:**  Is that something that, what's the value in that?  
**1:22:38-1:22:42:**  What would you expect would happen if I just had an alley cropping system with my grains  
**1:22:42-1:22:43:**  in between or my animals?  
**1:22:43-1:22:48:**  Maybe it would be a silver partial system and I would just go full on with walnuts and  
**1:22:48-1:22:50:**  walnut selection.  
**1:22:50-1:22:51:**  Is that worth it?  
**1:22:51-1:22:55:**  Your walnuts will be different than somebody else's walnuts because you're putting them  
**1:22:55-1:23:03:**  in a very specific set of conditions to which the gene pool adapts and it changes through  
**1:23:03-1:23:04:**  time.  
**1:23:04-1:23:09:**  Actually, what's interesting is there are certain species that actually form pure stands  
**1:23:09-1:23:10:**  in nature.  
**1:23:10-1:23:11:**  Beech is one of them.  
**1:23:11-1:23:13:**  Beech will go in and it will exclude almost everything else.  
**1:23:13-1:23:15:**  It's used to pure stands.  
**1:23:15-1:23:20:**  Walnuts is another one, at least here in North America, it will form thickets that carpet  
**1:23:20-1:23:24:**  the ground for miles in certain places.  
**1:23:24-1:23:30:**  There are some species that are actually more appropriate to have those in more reduced  
**1:23:30-1:23:31:**  systems.  
**1:23:31-1:23:32:**  Sugar cane, believe it or not, is another one.  
**1:23:32-1:23:39:**  Sugar cane is like this grass with rhizomes that takes over your lawn.  
**1:23:39-1:23:43:**  Walnuts is one of these kind of 50-50 because it has the jugulones in the roots.  
**1:23:43-1:23:46:**  It excludes a lot of species.  
**1:23:46-1:23:53:**  It is a less biodiverse system to begin with, so it's not as bad doing just straight walnuts.  
**1:23:53-1:24:00:**  I was actually walking through my butternut and my heart nut planting today and I was  
**1:24:00-1:24:03:**  kind of thinking the same thought.  
**1:24:03-1:24:08:**  Is this diverse enough or can I go ahead and remove these things and make it less diverse?  
**1:24:08-1:24:10:**  Do I have the answers to that?  
**1:24:10-1:24:11:**  No, but you know how I learn those answers?  
**1:24:11-1:24:16:**  I go do something and I accept feedback.  
**1:24:16-1:24:21:**  If it knocks things back, it's like well, I'll re-increase the diversity.  
**1:24:21-1:24:25:**  Once you've got the system up and running, there's not one individual plant that I'm  
**1:24:25-1:24:27:**  depending on for my income.  
**1:24:27-1:24:28:**  It's the whole system that works.  
**1:24:28-1:24:34:**  If one all of a sudden drops way down because I screwed up, something else will compensate  
**1:24:34-1:24:38:**  or I can shift an emphasis to something I don't do anymore like cut flowers.  
**1:24:38-1:24:42:**  I don't harvest and sell cut flowers anymore because I don't have to.  
**1:24:42-1:24:43:**  Did the flowers go away?  
**1:24:43-1:24:44:**  No, they're all over the place.  
**1:24:44-1:24:46:**  I'm looking at like two or three acres of them.  
**1:24:46-1:24:47:**  They're beautiful.  
**1:24:47-1:24:51:**  So I can go back to doing something that I used to do.  
**1:24:51-1:24:57:**  I've got the ability to adapt and adjust just wired into the system.  
**1:24:57-1:25:03:**  A common scenario is a farmer that currently has a system set up, maybe an orchard set  
**1:25:03-1:25:11:**  up, and let's imagine a case of a walnut orchard planted eight by eight or nine by nine, and  
**1:25:11-1:25:16:**  is looking to start to incorporate alternative methods because this farmer is noticing that  
**1:25:16-1:25:20:**  there's some issues with the current system.  
**1:25:20-1:25:27:**  Have you had any cases or how would you advise a farmer going through a transition towards  
**1:25:27-1:25:32:**  the type of agriculture that we've been talking about now, restoration agriculture?  
**1:25:32-1:25:35:**  Would you advise to diversify that orchard, cut everything, start again?  
**1:25:35-1:25:37:**  How do we go about a transition?  
**1:25:37-1:25:41:**  That's actually most of the work that I do as restoration agriculture development is  
**1:25:41-1:25:47:**  helping farmers to transition from where they are now to where they want to go with it.  
**1:25:47-1:25:51:**  It ends up being fairly custom designed per operator.  
**1:25:51-1:25:55:**  It depends on a lot of things that we don't even have time to get into, but if it's walnut,  
**1:25:55-1:26:00:**  first thing to know is, well, what's the plant community type?  
**1:26:00-1:26:05:**  What are the different species that like to be with walnuts?  
**1:26:05-1:26:11:**  Just offhand, all your prunuses, your cherries and plums, raspberries and grapes.  
**1:26:11-1:26:17:**  Actually how I got started doing my walnuts this way is I was at this tri-state forestry  
**1:26:17-1:26:19:**  workshop is what it was.  
**1:26:19-1:26:22:**  I went to this one workshop on how to get rid of raspberries in your walnuts.  
**1:26:22-1:26:25:**  Another workshop, how to get rid of grapes in your walnuts.  
**1:26:25-1:26:28:**  Another one, how to get rid of wild cherry in your walnuts, how to get rid of elderberries  
**1:26:28-1:26:29:**  in your walnuts.  
**1:26:29-1:26:35:**  So, well, if you have a certain way of managing your system, if you've got rows or you're  
**1:26:35-1:26:39:**  treating them like individual trees, if they're like individual trees, you can plant right  
**1:26:39-1:26:44:**  at the base of the tree with something that's adapted to that plant community type and it'll  
**1:26:44-1:26:46:**  do okay.  
**1:26:46-1:26:47:**  What do you have invested in it?  
**1:26:47-1:26:52:**  Say you've got 100 walnut trees, maybe I'm going to get 200 plants.  
**1:26:52-1:26:54:**  That means I'll buy 500 plants and sell 300 of them.  
**1:26:54-1:26:56:**  These plants go into their profit.  
**1:26:56-1:26:57:**  I put them in the ground.  
**1:26:57-1:26:59:**  I don't have anything to lose.  
**1:26:59-1:27:00:**  They're going to grow with walnut.  
**1:27:00-1:27:06:**  Some will do better than others and I start my genetic selection from there.  
**1:27:06-1:27:15:**  But cherries and grapes, any prunus, cherries, grapes, elderberries, raspberries, currants,  
**1:27:15-1:27:21:**  gooseberries will all do well with walnut.  
**1:27:21-1:27:24:**  Planting them online so you could continue to harvest mechanically.  
**1:27:24-1:27:28:**  Either in the row, around the base of the tree, whatever fits into your system, around  
**1:27:28-1:27:33:**  the edges, people have center pivot irrigation doing the corners.  
**1:27:33-1:27:37:**  It's going to be custom designed to what your operation is like.  
**1:27:37-1:27:38:**  Very interesting.  
**1:27:38-1:27:42:**  There's something else that I was, as we were talking about genetics and about looking at  
**1:27:42-1:27:51:**  the past and plant communities that have been there for, you suggested 94, was it a million  
**1:27:51-1:27:52:**  that you were saying those communities have been there?  
**1:27:52-1:27:55:**  The oaks here in North America, they say 95 million years.  
**1:27:55-1:27:57:**  95 million, okay.  
**1:27:57-1:28:04:**  And so now we're seeing a situation of rapid climate change and how do we apply this logic  
**1:28:04-1:28:11:**  of, you know, bio mimicking but taking into account a climate that's going to be, that's  
**1:28:11-1:28:15:**  changing and that's providing new disturbance regimes.  
**1:28:15-1:28:21:**  So how do we adapt to that and how do we model this system around the big issue of climate  
**1:28:21-1:28:22:**  change?  
**1:28:22-1:28:29:**  Well, the first thing of course is to go right into the active live onsite breeding of all  
**1:28:29-1:28:31:**  of the different perennial species that got on the farm.  
**1:28:31-1:28:33:**  That's first and foremost.  
**1:28:33-1:28:39:**  Well then another one is to look at analogs of systems that this might be projected to  
**1:28:39-1:28:40:**  be.  
**1:28:40-1:28:43:**  This farm right here, we didn't have all this climate research out there but I decided to  
**1:28:43-1:28:45:**  plan for it anyways.  
**1:28:45-1:28:50:**  On the northeastern part of the property, I've got a number of different Arctic and  
**1:28:50-1:28:56:**  high elevation species and on the southwestern side of it, I have all kinds of American desert  
**1:28:56-1:28:58:**  southwest species that are there.  
**1:28:58-1:29:04:**  And so as things shift and change through time, I've got genetic experiments that are  
**1:29:04-1:29:08:**  ongoing with those particular plants.  
**1:29:08-1:29:13:**  And one of the things that I keep looking at is when I get concerned about drought,  
**1:29:13-1:29:18:**  I just look at you guys in the Mediterranean, it's like how the heck have these trees survived  
**1:29:18-1:29:20:**  as long as they have in the Mediterranean?  
**1:29:20-1:29:24:**  Then as soon as I get scared that oh my gosh, the Mediterranean is going to run into trouble.  
**1:29:24-1:29:29:**  Well then you go to just, wow, how about like monsoon season type African species?  
**1:29:29-1:29:34:**  It's like you're just going to have to do some assisted migration ahead of time and  
**1:29:34-1:29:37:**  what happens when you do the assisted migration ahead of time, you're going to have higher  
**1:29:37-1:29:40:**  losses because the plants aren't adapted to now.  
**1:29:40-1:29:44:**  They might be adapted to 20 years from now, 30 years from now but start the process right  
**1:29:44-1:29:45:**  now.  
**1:29:45-1:29:53:**  So this is the process that I've started on and believe it or not, here I am in a part  
**1:29:53-1:29:56:**  of North America where we regularly get to minus 40.  
**1:29:56-1:30:01:**  Minus 40 is the same whether it's Fahrenheit or Celsius.  
**1:30:01-1:30:07:**  My two favorite breeding projects right now, coffee and chocolate.  
**1:30:07-1:30:09:**  You planted those on your farm?  
**1:30:09-1:30:14:**  I have planted them in areas where I'm rapidly accelerating the selection process to get  
**1:30:14-1:30:16:**  them to be more cold hardy.  
**1:30:16-1:30:19:**  Am I doing it with one pollen grain and one flower?  
**1:30:19-1:30:20:**  No, it's mass selection.  
**1:30:20-1:30:24:**  You're planting seeds or you're planting seeds I guess?  
**1:30:24-1:30:25:**  Correct.  
**1:30:25-1:30:26:**  Seeds and seedlings.  
**1:30:26-1:30:27:**  Phenomenal.  
**1:30:27-1:30:32:**  I mean this conversation has been so based around breeding and planting and selection  
**1:30:32-1:30:38:**  but I guess that's like the main knowledge necessary to make this work is around this,  
**1:30:38-1:30:43:**  it's around ecology of course we've discussed that but it's around breeding.  
**1:30:43-1:30:47:**  And here you go back to the simplified view of reality whereas there's got to be one pillar,  
**1:30:47-1:30:50:**  there's a pillar, there's a central pillar.  
**1:30:50-1:30:55:**  Nature is a system of cyclical interacting cycles.  
**1:30:55-1:30:59:**  There is no one thing that's going to make it work.  
**1:30:59-1:31:02:**  If there is one thing that's going to make it work is water and we haven't even touched  
**1:31:02-1:31:03:**  on water.  
**1:31:03-1:31:08:**  If you aren't managing the water that comes out of the sky and lands on your property,  
**1:31:08-1:31:11:**  that's the fundamental thing because that's the one thing that we know that plants on  
**1:31:11-1:31:15:**  planet earth can't live without water.  
**1:31:15-1:31:17:**  So there is no one central pillar.  
**1:31:17-1:31:18:**  There isn't.  
**1:31:18-1:31:21:**  Breeding is very important.  
**1:31:21-1:31:25:**  I have to take that back but basically when I think about this I don't think about one  
**1:31:25-1:31:30:**  pillar holding onto everything, I'm just thinking about the difference between the conventional  
**1:31:30-1:31:38:**  approach and the approach that you are demonstrating in your farm and the breeding work is one  
**1:31:38-1:31:46:**  of the fundamentals where as a conventional farmer you export that to universities and  
**1:31:46-1:31:48:**  you export that to somebody else but you are actually practicing that.  
**1:31:48-1:31:51:**  So that's the way I would rephrase it and I would say it.  
**1:31:51-1:31:58:**  I'm not saying that it's obviously this conversation has demonstrated the ability to use the complexity  
**1:31:58-1:32:02:**  of nature to create resilience in different ways and I hope that listeners have understood  
**1:32:02-1:32:04:**  that correctly and I'm sure that they have.  
**1:32:04-1:32:10:**  And like I said with the genetic selection, it's as difficult that a four year old can  
**1:32:10-1:32:11:**  figure it out.  
**1:32:11-1:32:16:**  It's just how human beings have interacted with their plants since the dawn of time.  
**1:32:16-1:32:21:**  The time has come that we have to stop exporting our knowledge and our skill and our expertise  
**1:32:21-1:32:26:**  as farmers and giving that power to experts.  
**1:32:26-1:32:27:**  It's not theirs.  
**1:32:27-1:32:28:**  They have no idea.  
**1:32:28-1:32:32:**  Their math, and this is what drives me nuts about a lot of these people doing all these  
**1:32:32-1:32:36:**  equations, look see the math works right and as long as you go ahead and say oh yeah the  
**1:32:36-1:32:39:**  math works right, see we're right and we have PhDs and you don't.  
**1:32:39-1:32:41:**  It's like yeah but you know what?  
**1:32:41-1:32:43:**  Your math is so incredibly accurate.  
**1:32:43-1:32:47:**  You're exactly right and you have no f***ing idea what you're doing.  
**1:32:47-1:32:51:**  You have no idea how to grow this plant, to live with this plant, to manage this ecosystem  
**1:32:51-1:32:52:**  through time.  
**1:32:52-1:32:54:**  You're too busy doing math.  
**1:32:54-1:33:03:**  I'm not saying that that's wrong or we shouldn't do it, it's that that is not the answer.  
**1:33:03-1:33:10:**  Nature is a compounded system of systems within systems and it is a, there are so many variables  
**1:33:10-1:33:14:**  involved that you won't be able to do the math that's so complex.  
**1:33:14-1:33:20:**  Yet a four year old can do the genetic work of all these universities and researches just  
**1:33:20-1:33:41:**  by picking the fruit that he wants to eat or she wants to eat or they want to eat.

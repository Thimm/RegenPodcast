### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 18:09:07)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:48:**  Hello and welcome again to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:54:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we had a deep dive with a farmer.  
**0:00:54-0:01:00:**  His name is Tom Wall and he has Red Fern Farm in Iowa, USA.  
**0:01:00-0:01:06:**  We wanted to interview Tom because of his very special farm where he has been integrating  
**0:01:06-0:01:13:**  a variety of crops such as chestnuts, pau paus and different other nuts together in  
**0:01:13-0:01:19:**  a commercial way in a farm where he is letting his customers pick the fruit themselves in  
**0:01:19-0:01:27:**  something that we call U-pick and therefore getting the full economic benefit of direct  
**0:01:27-0:01:28:**  selling.  
**0:01:28-0:01:34:**  So we delve into the technical aspects of agroforestry and how he plants his trees,  
**0:01:34-0:01:41:**  how he integrates them, some of his experience in the past 25 years and the tree interactions,  
**0:01:41-0:01:42:**  etc.  
**0:01:42-0:01:47:**  And we also delve into the more business and commercial side because it's a really interesting  
**0:01:47-0:01:54:**  model and as he says that enables him his main cost to be mowing his land which is something  
**0:01:54-0:02:02:**  that a lot of farmers aspire, a level of input costs that a lot of farmers aspire to.  
**0:02:02-0:02:05:**  So it was a really interesting interview.  
**0:02:05-0:02:09:**  Again his experience really comes out and you can see somebody that's been working in  
**0:02:09-0:02:11:**  his context for 25 plus years.  
**0:02:11-0:02:17:**  So it's something we always learn a lot from and we hope that you will as much as we did.  
**0:02:17-0:02:21:**  Hi Tom and welcome on the podcast.  
**0:02:21-0:02:24:**  Thank you.  
**0:02:24-0:02:29:**  I thought we could maybe get started by you know with a quick introduction of your farm,  
**0:02:29-0:02:35:**  what you produce, where you're located, on what scale you work.  
**0:02:35-0:02:41:**  Okay the number of things we produce is make a list so long that we really don't have time  
**0:02:41-0:02:51:**  to cover it all, somewhere around 75 species of fruit, nut and berry plants.  
**0:02:51-0:03:01:**  But our main ones, the ones that are commercial are chestnut, heartnut, persimmon, pawpaw,  
**0:03:01-0:03:08:**  Asian pear and hopefully soon to be honey berry.  
**0:03:08-0:03:17:**  The whole farm is 86 acres but a large majority of that is steep, rugged, wild forest.  
**0:03:17-0:03:28:**  And there's only about 12 or 13 acres that are being managed for tree crops right now.  
**0:03:28-0:03:39:**  And the rest is suited to firewood and hunting and hiking and bird watching but not for crop  
**0:03:39-0:03:43:**  production or even livestock really.  
**0:03:43-0:03:48:**  Okay maybe you could tell us a bit as well about where you're located, what's your climate  
**0:03:48-0:03:55:**  like, so we can understand a bit of the context you're in, also what's your soil like.  
**0:03:55-0:04:03:**  Okay we're located in southeast Iowa in the central United States.  
**0:04:03-0:04:14:**  Our USDA climate zone is 5B which means in average winter the temperature gets down to  
**0:04:14-0:04:23:**  around minus 15 Fahrenheit and I can't recall what that is in Celsius.  
**0:04:23-0:04:33:**  But we have seen it get as cold as minus 37 Fahrenheit which is almost equal to minus  
**0:04:33-0:04:35:**  40 Celsius.  
**0:04:35-0:04:40:**  So it can get very cold here, can also get very hot.  
**0:04:40-0:04:48:**  I've seen many days over 105 degrees Fahrenheit.  
**0:04:48-0:04:56:**  Our soils are some of the very best in the world for growing temperate hardwood trees.  
**0:04:56-0:05:08:**  Deep, fertile, moist but well-drained soils with a good balance of sand, silt and clay  
**0:05:08-0:05:12:**  particles.  
**0:05:12-0:05:17:**  Very high site index for upland oaks.  
**0:05:17-0:05:24:**  In fact white oak trees grow fast here whereas everywhere else in the world they're a slow  
**0:05:24-0:05:26:**  growing tree.  
**0:05:26-0:05:36:**  We are not certified organic and we do use herbicide when we're getting trees first established  
**0:05:36-0:05:44:**  but once the trees are established we don't use any chemicals at all.  
**0:05:44-0:05:53:**  I like to grow crops that don't require any kind of care whatsoever once they're established.  
**0:05:53-0:06:00:**  Now that said we do grow things that are hard to grow that way including apples.  
**0:06:00-0:06:08:**  I like apples and I grow them not commercially but I grow them just because I like them and  
**0:06:08-0:06:12:**  those are hard to grow without chemicals.  
**0:06:12-0:06:17:**  But everything else including all of our commercial crops, the chestnut, heartnut, persimmon,  
**0:06:17-0:06:29:**  pawpaw, Asian pears and honey berries require virtually no care whatsoever in order to grow  
**0:06:29-0:06:30:**  them at least at our own.  
**0:06:30-0:06:33:**  Not even some pruning for example?  
**0:06:33-0:06:40:**  No the chestnut trees require pruning up high enough so that we can get under the trees  
**0:06:40-0:06:47:**  with a mower but we actually don't need to do any pruning to do that.  
**0:06:47-0:06:55:**  We grow them in 5 foot tall tree shelters or grow tubes and that prevents side branches  
**0:06:55-0:07:01:**  from growing up to 5 feet and that's high enough that we don't need to do any pruning  
**0:07:01-0:07:04:**  afterwards.  
**0:07:04-0:07:11:**  There are a few trees like pawpaws and persimmons that we will do a little bit of pruning just  
**0:07:11-0:07:13:**  to keep the trees from getting too tall.  
**0:07:13-0:07:16:**  We'll cut the tops out of the trees.  
**0:07:16-0:07:23:**  With the pawpaws I might have to do that once or twice during the tree's lifetime just to  
**0:07:23-0:07:28:**  keep the fruit within reach of the ground because I don't like spraying and I don't  
**0:07:28-0:07:29:**  like climbing ladders.  
**0:07:29-0:07:36:**  So I want to be able to just go out and harvest when the time comes and not have to worry  
**0:07:36-0:07:40:**  about the trees otherwise.  
**0:07:40-0:07:45:**  So that seems like quite an ideal to reach in terms of having trees that need little  
**0:07:45-0:07:49:**  care and just harvesting and selling.  
**0:07:49-0:07:53:**  So I think in this interview we'll delve a bit into that at some point to understand  
**0:07:53-0:07:59:**  how you make that work in practice and I know you've got a really interesting commercial  
**0:07:59-0:08:00:**  strategy as well, right?  
**0:08:00-0:08:01:**  You do U-pick.  
**0:08:01-0:08:02:**  Correct.  
**0:08:02-0:08:09:**  So that eliminates almost all the work for me because the customers do the harvesting.  
**0:08:09-0:08:18:**  I do have to mow the vegetation short under nut trees before harvest but that's really  
**0:08:18-0:08:24:**  the only thing that I absolutely have to do in order to make this work besides manage  
**0:08:24-0:08:27:**  the customers.  
**0:08:27-0:08:29:**  Hmm, okay.  
**0:08:29-0:08:36:**  Do you choose special varieties of your different commercial crops in order to not have to spray  
**0:08:36-0:08:44:**  them or is your area so adapted that you can kind of plant whichever variety you want and  
**0:08:44-0:08:48:**  you can bet that they won't need too much work?  
**0:08:48-0:08:51:**  It varies from one species to another.  
**0:08:51-0:09:01:**  In the case of the chestnuts, the issue is that there are two serious insect pests of  
**0:09:01-0:09:05:**  chestnuts in North America and we don't have any of them.  
**0:09:05-0:09:14:**  In the entire state of Iowa has no chestnut weevils or chestnut gall wasps so we don't  
**0:09:14-0:09:18:**  need to do anything about them.  
**0:09:18-0:09:25:**  In the case of some of the fruit trees like Asian pear and European pear for example,  
**0:09:25-0:09:37:**  we do have to select varieties that are highly resistant to fire blight because we have enough  
**0:09:37-0:09:44:**  fire blight in the area that it would make those impossible to grow or even survive for  
**0:09:44-0:09:49:**  fire blight susceptible varieties.  
**0:09:49-0:09:56:**  In the case of persimmon and pawpaw, there just aren't any serious disease or pest problems  
**0:09:56-0:10:06:**  for those plants so they can just make it on their own for decades or centuries with  
**0:10:06-0:10:10:**  no help from me or anyone else.  
**0:10:10-0:10:11:**  Very interesting.  
**0:10:11-0:10:19:**  I actually wanted to do a little parenthesis here to mention a talk that I listened to  
**0:10:19-0:10:24:**  one of your talks on YouTube from the Practical Farmers of Iowa.  
**0:10:24-0:10:28:**  I don't know if you know which one I'm talking about and it's a fantastic one hour and a  
**0:10:28-0:10:33:**  bit talk on the practicalities of chestnut production and chestnut establishment.  
**0:10:33-0:10:39:**  I'm going to put the link in our notes for our listeners but it was an absolutely fantastic  
**0:10:39-0:10:47:**  and very technical conversation and that inspired me quite a lot to prepare this interview.  
**0:10:47-0:10:50:**  Again I advise our listeners to check it out but one of the things that I was curious about  
**0:10:50-0:10:55:**  is you talk about zero input but how do you manage fertility for example?  
**0:10:55-0:10:58:**  How do you fertilize the trees?  
**0:10:58-0:11:04:**  Well up until just recently I've never done any fertilization.  
**0:11:04-0:11:13:**  Our soil is already naturally so fertile that as far as the chestnuts go the soil may be  
**0:11:13-0:11:20:**  actually too fertile for chestnuts because in some years the crop load gets so heavy  
**0:11:20-0:11:29:**  that branches and sometimes even the whole top out of trees will break from the load.  
**0:11:29-0:11:35:**  About two years ago we added sheep to the mix so we're actually grazing sheep under  
**0:11:35-0:11:36:**  the chestnuts.  
**0:11:36-0:11:44:**  So the only fertilization they've ever gotten is from the grazing animals rotating through  
**0:11:44-0:11:47:**  the trees.  
**0:11:47-0:11:52:**  And for the other crops as well they don't need any fertilization you just plant them  
**0:11:52-0:11:55:**  and off they go?  
**0:11:55-0:11:57:**  That's correct.  
**0:11:57-0:12:05:**  Like I said our soil is very deep and fertile, moist and well drained.  
**0:12:05-0:12:14:**  I have not added any fertilizer except for just having animals underneath the trees.  
**0:12:14-0:12:20:**  So you must also be practicing a type of agriculture that doesn't degrade your land.  
**0:12:20-0:12:22:**  If you've been doing this for so many years...  
**0:12:22-0:12:37:**  Yes, well we try and mimic what would be happening in a savanna type biome with scattered trees  
**0:12:37-0:12:40:**  and animals grazing under them.  
**0:12:40-0:12:46:**  So the only thing I'm controlling is what species are present.  
**0:12:46-0:12:57:**  So yes it's regenerative, the ground is covered all the time year round with perennial plants.  
**0:12:57-0:13:05:**  Perennial plants are in the roots or in the soil year round feeding the soil microbes.  
**0:13:05-0:13:08:**  It takes care of itself.  
**0:13:08-0:13:11:**  That's very interesting.  
**0:13:11-0:13:17:**  And so maybe it's the right time to go a bit more into that aspect because we often hear  
**0:13:17-0:13:20:**  of your farm that's talked about an agroforestry farm.  
**0:13:20-0:13:26:**  I wanted to know a bit about what's your take on agroforestry.  
**0:13:26-0:13:33:**  For you what is agroforestry and how are you practicing it on the Redfern farm?  
**0:13:33-0:13:44:**  Well, academics and foresters have a long and detailed complicated definition of agroforestry  
**0:13:44-0:13:48:**  that usually runs into multiple paragraphs.  
**0:13:48-0:13:52:**  My definition of agroforestry is very simple.  
**0:13:52-0:14:01:**  It's simply the deliberate management of woody plants for agricultural purposes.  
**0:14:01-0:14:11:**  And by that definition it actually puts traditional forestry underneath the umbrella of agroforestry.  
**0:14:11-0:14:21:**  And in my opinion the ultimate agroforestry practice is growing food for humans and animals  
**0:14:21-0:14:34:**  on trees using woody plants to produce all kinds of agricultural products including food  
**0:14:34-0:14:45:**  for humans, feed for animals, fiber, building materials, fuel, medicine and all that all  
**0:14:45-0:14:49:**  together on the same acres at the same time.  
**0:14:49-0:14:55:**  On your farm, if I've understood correctly, you've mixed your species, so you're producing  
**0:14:55-0:15:03:**  a mixture of perennial crops, sometimes integrating animals underneath and you've planted them  
**0:15:03-0:15:05:**  in a mixed way, right?  
**0:15:05-0:15:09:**  You've just mixed them all together, is that correct?  
**0:15:09-0:15:17:**  Yes, like I said we're kind of mimicking a savannah biome which means there are large  
**0:15:17-0:15:26:**  overstory trees and then smaller understory trees under them, a shrub layer under that  
**0:15:26-0:15:32:**  and then ground cover on the soil surface.  
**0:15:32-0:15:45:**  So there's four levels, vertically four levels of different kinds of plants, trees, shrubs,  
**0:15:45-0:15:54:**  vines, herbaceous ground cover and I try and make as many of them as possible be something  
**0:15:54-0:15:58:**  that's harvestable.  
**0:15:58-0:16:04:**  And it is important to match the species with the soil, especially in terms of soil drainage  
**0:16:04-0:16:08:**  and soil pH.  
**0:16:08-0:16:15:**  Some trees like chestnuts for example will not grow on a lot of soils, any soil that  
**0:16:15-0:16:20:**  isn't very well drained will not work for chestnuts.  
**0:16:20-0:16:26:**  It's also important to put trees together that are compatible with each other, like  
**0:16:26-0:16:31:**  it's important not to plant a pear tree next to a black walnut tree because black walnuts  
**0:16:31-0:16:41:**  produce a hormone in their roots that can stunt or even kill certain trees like pear  
**0:16:41-0:16:44:**  trees and apple trees.  
**0:16:44-0:16:51:**  So you have to have some knowledge about what trees work well together and which ones won't  
**0:16:51-0:16:57:**  work with each other as well as what kind of sites they take.  
**0:16:57-0:17:04:**  Another thing to consider is you don't want to have two different crops that drop their  
**0:17:04-0:17:09:**  crop to the ground in the same spot.  
**0:17:09-0:17:16:**  Like for example, I wouldn't want chestnuts with pecans or walnuts because then I'd have  
**0:17:16-0:17:22:**  to sort out the different nuts from each other from the ground at harvest time.  
**0:17:22-0:17:30:**  It's perfectly okay to have any kind of fruit that's picked from the tree growing in among  
**0:17:30-0:17:35:**  other trees that are dropping their crop to the ground such as nut trees.  
**0:17:35-0:17:36:**  That makes a lot of sense.  
**0:17:36-0:17:42:**  I mean, it seems like there's quite a lot of practical implications here that again,  
**0:17:42-0:17:44:**  we'll get into them little by little.  
**0:17:44-0:17:50:**  But the first question for me again to paint the picture of your farm a bit clearer is  
**0:17:50-0:17:53:**  what's the spacing between your different crops?  
**0:17:53-0:17:58:**  And I'm sure the farm has got very different spacings all over the place, but as a general  
**0:17:58-0:18:02:**  or maybe one of your favorites, your ideal spacing that's your challenge, the one that's  
**0:18:02-0:18:05:**  worked the best for you.  
**0:18:05-0:18:12:**  Well, in the case of the chestnuts, I start them out at 20 feet by 20 feet spacing, 20  
**0:18:12-0:18:18:**  feet within the row, 20 feet between rows with the understanding that by the time they  
**0:18:18-0:18:24:**  reach 20 years of age, they will need to be thinned to 40 by 40 and then probably thinned  
**0:18:24-0:18:32:**  again 50 or 60 years down the road to 80 by 80 and then a final thinning probably somewhere  
**0:18:32-0:18:33:**  around year 500.  
**0:18:33-0:18:37:**  I'll have to leave a note for that one.  
**0:18:37-0:18:38:**  Nice.  
**0:18:38-0:18:44:**  Then I like to put pawpaws in between the chestnuts and this is North American pawpaw,  
**0:18:44-0:18:51:**  not what the British call pawpaw or what they call pawpaw in India and Australia and New  
**0:18:51-0:18:52:**  Zealand.  
**0:18:52-0:18:59:**  When the pawpaw is an understory tree, it will grow and thrive and produce fruit even  
**0:18:59-0:19:01:**  in the shade of chestnut trees.  
**0:19:01-0:19:05:**  And I'll put one pawpaw in between the chestnuts.  
**0:19:05-0:19:13:**  So along the chestnut row, there's a pawpaw every 20 feet and a chestnut every 20 feet,  
**0:19:13-0:19:18:**  but a tree every 10 feet just alternating between chestnut and pawpaw.  
**0:19:18-0:19:28:**  And then I like to put a shrub row in between the chestnut-pawpaw rows such as honeyberry  
**0:19:28-0:19:32:**  or linusris rulian.  
**0:19:32-0:19:41:**  In the case of persimmons, persimmons seemed like to grow around walnuts.  
**0:19:41-0:19:51:**  So I put persimmons and the heartnuts together, but both of those require full sun so they  
**0:19:51-0:19:54:**  all have to have their own space.  
**0:19:54-0:20:01:**  I can't put persimmons underneath the heartnuts.  
**0:20:01-0:20:05:**  Also have to be careful if the heartnut is grafted on a black walnut rootstock, then  
**0:20:05-0:20:11:**  that limits what can be planted close by, again, because of that hormone produced by  
**0:20:11-0:20:15:**  the black walnut.  
**0:20:15-0:20:18:**  But the heartnuts take up a lot of space.  
**0:20:18-0:20:24:**  When they're matured, they may be 40 feet wide or wider.  
**0:20:24-0:20:31:**  So yes, I have a lot of different spaces and it just depends on the species.  
**0:20:31-0:20:35:**  Honeyberries I put five feet apart within the row.  
**0:20:35-0:20:40:**  Honeyberry produces a little, it's kind of like a blackberry but it's kind of orange-yellow  
**0:20:40-0:20:42:**  color right?  
**0:20:42-0:20:49:**  No, honeyberry is a deep dark purple similar to blueberries if you're familiar with those.  
**0:20:49-0:20:53:**  Ah, okay, so I'm completely off.  
**0:20:53-0:20:58:**  Yeah, it's a linusris rulian is the species.  
**0:20:58-0:21:05:**  It produces, like I said, a dark purple berry but the shape can be very different from one  
**0:21:05-0:21:06:**  variety to another.  
**0:21:06-0:21:19:**  They can be banana shaped or round or cigar shaped or they can be shaped very bizarrely.  
**0:21:19-0:21:29:**  In fact, I saw some that were shaped like the mouth of a baleen whale opening its mouth.  
**0:21:29-0:21:38:**  Nice, and so going back a bit to the spacing, have you experimented with different spacings  
**0:21:38-0:21:45:**  and seen that at some point they can be too close and there's too much competition between  
**0:21:45-0:21:46:**  them?  
**0:21:46-0:21:49:**  Yeah, I have done some experimenting.  
**0:21:49-0:21:56:**  I used to put two pawpaw trees in between each pair of chestnuts at 20 by 20 spacing  
**0:21:56-0:21:59:**  and I found that was too close.  
**0:21:59-0:22:06:**  I couldn't get in between the trees with a mower and with chestnuts it's absolutely essential  
**0:22:06-0:22:10:**  to mow under the trees before the nuts start to fall.  
**0:22:10-0:22:15:**  Otherwise they can't be harvested commercially.  
**0:22:15-0:22:22:**  So now I only put one pawpaw in between each pair of chestnuts instead of two.  
**0:22:22-0:22:28:**  For the most part I researched the plants ahead of time and figured out what their spacing  
**0:22:28-0:22:31:**  should be before I planted.  
**0:22:31-0:22:35:**  I was just wrong about the pawpaws.  
**0:22:35-0:22:41:**  The first thing that somebody listening to your system may think, somebody who's more  
**0:22:41-0:22:46:**  familiar with the conventional way of planting these different crops would be that there  
**0:22:46-0:22:55:**  is some form of competition for light and for water most noticeably between these crops.  
**0:22:55-0:22:59:**  Is this something that you have observed?  
**0:22:59-0:23:06:**  In the case of the trees, the trees can compete with each other for sunlight but not really  
**0:23:06-0:23:11:**  so much for moisture or nutrients.  
**0:23:11-0:23:18:**  And that's why it's important to be careful in selecting what trees are put underneath  
**0:23:18-0:23:22:**  larger trees.  
**0:23:22-0:23:28:**  Trees that are tolerant of shade have to go under larger trees.  
**0:23:28-0:23:33:**  So they're competing mainly for sunlight not for moisture and nutrients at least at our  
**0:23:33-0:23:34:**  location.  
**0:23:34-0:23:40:**  In a place with a much drier soil, a drier climate, they might be competing for moisture  
**0:23:40-0:23:44:**  also but that's really not the case here.  
**0:23:44-0:23:49:**  You haven't noticed that the pawpaw fruit has suffered from competition with light with  
**0:23:49-0:23:51:**  the chestnut.  
**0:23:51-0:23:56:**  As the chestnuts grow, is this something that you've started seeing the trees leaning out  
**0:23:56-0:23:58:**  and trying to fetch light?  
**0:23:58-0:24:02:**  No, the pawpaws don't lean out.  
**0:24:02-0:24:11:**  In fact, the pawpaws actually prefer to grow in partial shade versus full sun.  
**0:24:11-0:24:16:**  But that said, pawpaws will produce more fruit and larger sized fruit if they're growing  
**0:24:16-0:24:19:**  in full sun versus in the shade.  
**0:24:19-0:24:21:**  But that's okay.  
**0:24:21-0:24:28:**  As I tell people, I get 100% of a chestnut crop and then 50-75% of a pawpaw crop from  
**0:24:28-0:24:31:**  the same acre at the same time.  
**0:24:31-0:24:36:**  That adds up to 175%.  
**0:24:36-0:24:44:**  Normally it's really hard to make 100% but I exceed 100% with this method.  
**0:24:44-0:24:46:**  What about the honey berries?  
**0:24:46-0:24:51:**  Do they do better in the full sun usually?  
**0:24:51-0:24:53:**  They're experimental for me right now.  
**0:24:53-0:25:03:**  I have noticed that they grow very well under shade but it seems to affect their fruit production.  
**0:25:03-0:25:08:**  In fact, they seem to produce not very much when they're in full shade even though the  
**0:25:08-0:25:11:**  plants seem to grow and thrive there.  
**0:25:11-0:25:18:**  So I think it's probably going to turn out that the honey berries will need full sun  
**0:25:18-0:25:26:**  or at least they're not going to be an understory shrub.  
**0:25:26-0:25:32:**  Maybe it would be a case of them producing in the establishment years and then little  
**0:25:32-0:25:34:**  by little needing to be removed from the system, right?  
**0:25:34-0:25:36:**  Is that an option for you?  
**0:25:36-0:25:42:**  Yes, except I probably wouldn't go to the trouble of removing them.  
**0:25:42-0:25:46:**  They'd probably just remove themselves once it gets too shady for them.  
**0:25:46-0:25:56:**  But yes, it may be that they only work when the chestnut trees are still fairly young  
**0:25:56-0:25:58:**  and small.  
**0:25:58-0:26:05:**  Looking at the chestnuts, you talked about 100% production now but what does that compare  
**0:26:05-0:26:08:**  to other chestnut growers in the region?  
**0:26:08-0:26:11:**  Because I'm relating this more to the no input strategy.  
**0:26:11-0:26:16:**  Does that mean you have less inputs but less productivity than if you were spreading some  
**0:26:16-0:26:21:**  NPK regularly every year for example?  
**0:26:21-0:26:24:**  No.  
**0:26:24-0:26:33:**  Like I said, our soil is some of the very best in the whole world for growing trees.  
**0:26:33-0:26:40:**  It's kind of hard to measure and compare the production because I have younger trees mixed  
**0:26:40-0:26:47:**  in with older trees but I'm estimating that on our mature trees, the ones that are over  
**0:26:47-0:26:54:**  20 years old, we're producing around 5,000 pounds per acre.  
**0:26:54-0:27:04:**  Compare this with other chestnut growers in other parts of the Midwest with poor soil,  
**0:27:04-0:27:10:**  they're producing much less even though they're using lots of fertilizer and I'm producing  
**0:27:10-0:27:12:**  much more without fertilizer.  
**0:27:12-0:27:20:**  In fact, for example, there are chestnuts planted on reclaimed strip mine areas that  
**0:27:20-0:27:28:**  are only producing around 500 pounds per acre with fertilizer while mine are producing 5,000  
**0:27:28-0:27:30:**  pounds per acre without fertilizer.  
**0:27:30-0:27:34:**  So it depends on the quality of the soil where they're growing.  
**0:27:34-0:27:36:**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**0:27:36-0:27:37:**  That makes a lot of sense.  
**0:27:37-0:27:43:**  It's interesting to notice that even though they do have the inputs on their side and  
**0:27:43-0:27:50:**  irrigation and etc., nothing can really compensate for a good soil base to start off with.  
**0:27:50-0:27:52:**  Yeah, exactly.  
**0:27:52-0:28:00:**  In fact, research done at the University of Missouri found that fertilizer cannot compensate  
**0:28:00-0:28:02:**  for poor soil.  
**0:28:02-0:28:08:**  The fertilizer only allows the soil to reach its potential but it cannot increase that  
**0:28:08-0:28:11:**  soil's potential.  
**0:28:11-0:28:16:**  So a poor soil, even with fertilizer, will not produce as much as a good soil without  
**0:28:16-0:28:18:**  fertilizer.  
**0:28:18-0:28:20:**  How has your soil evolved?  
**0:28:20-0:28:25:**  Have you done soil tests since, I mean you started 25 years ago, right?  
**0:28:25-0:28:29:**  Yes we have.  
**0:28:29-0:28:31:**  We haven't really perfected the tests.  
**0:28:31-0:28:41:**  We tried a test for soil microbe activity called the tea bag test developed by a professor  
**0:28:41-0:28:45:**  Marshall McDaniel at Iowa State University.  
**0:28:45-0:28:53:**  But the results are somewhat inconclusive so far and I think the test needs to be fine-tuned  
**0:28:53-0:28:57:**  to make it work better.  
**0:28:57-0:29:08:**  Aside from that, the University of Illinois has been doing tests on our soil and comparing  
**0:29:08-0:29:14:**  it to conventional cropland in adjacent areas.  
**0:29:14-0:29:21:**  Someone just gave a presentation on the results of that study but I missed it.  
**0:29:21-0:29:27:**  I was away doing something else.  
**0:29:27-0:29:29:**  I'm not sure what they found.  
**0:29:29-0:29:33:**  We'll need to try to get our hands on that to see.  
**0:29:33-0:29:38:**  Is it a presentation that's on YouTube that's available for everybody or was it more of  
**0:29:38-0:29:43:**  a private event?  
**0:29:43-0:29:51:**  It was a presentation at the annual meeting of the Savannah Institute.  
**0:29:51-0:29:58:**  I suspect it was recorded and will be available but I'm not certain of that.  
**0:29:58-0:30:03:**  I think if it was the 2021 conference for agroforestry and carbon drawdown I was listening  
**0:30:03-0:30:05:**  to it.  
**0:30:05-0:30:07:**  Not all of it though so I must have missed that part.  
**0:30:07-0:30:13:**  And there should be the recordings available.  
**0:30:13-0:30:18:**  I also advise our listeners to check out that amazing conference.  
**0:30:18-0:30:22:**  It will be the report done by Will Eddy.  
**0:30:22-0:30:26:**  Okay, perfect, nice.  
**0:30:26-0:30:29:**  Thanks for the reference.  
**0:30:29-0:30:34:**  So I wanted to delve a bit into some of the decisions that you made, some of the design  
**0:30:34-0:30:40:**  decisions that you made on your farm in terms of agroforestry because as you're very familiar  
**0:30:40-0:30:44:**  in agroforestry there's a lot of integrations of animals but there's also integration of  
**0:30:44-0:30:49:**  timber species into crops and etc.  
**0:30:49-0:30:53:**  And I wanted to understand a bit better your decisions around that.  
**0:30:53-0:30:59:**  For example, have you considered using animals in between your crops for example poultry  
**0:30:59-0:31:04:**  or maybe sheep?  
**0:31:04-0:31:10:**  Was that a consideration for you?  
**0:31:10-0:31:19:**  We actually started with goats about nearly 30 years ago and I tried for about 25 years  
**0:31:19-0:31:25:**  to integrate goats with trees and I finally had to give up on it.  
**0:31:25-0:31:31:**  But now we are grazing sheep under our trees.  
**0:31:31-0:31:36:**  They're under the trees constantly moving from one paddock to another.  
**0:31:36-0:31:42:**  And we also have chickens under the trees and we've had chickens and turkeys under the  
**0:31:42-0:31:44:**  trees in the past.  
**0:31:44-0:31:49:**  So yes, we've had livestock integrated right from the start.  
**0:31:49-0:31:57:**  It was a period of several years where we didn't have anything except chickens.  
**0:31:57-0:32:02:**  We had to give up on the goats because they're too hard to fence and they love to eat tree  
**0:32:02-0:32:05:**  leaves.  
**0:32:05-0:32:09:**  The sheep are working out very well under the trees.  
**0:32:09-0:32:11:**  Is that at a commercial scale?  
**0:32:11-0:32:15:**  You sell the sheep or is it more... how does it work?  
**0:32:15-0:32:20:**  Yes, the excess lambs are sold commercially.  
**0:32:20-0:32:24:**  How many lambs do you have?  
**0:32:24-0:32:26:**  I don't have good track of it.  
**0:32:26-0:32:36:**  I think we have around 20 ewes right now and there's still several lambs that haven't been  
**0:32:36-0:32:37:**  sold yet.  
**0:32:37-0:32:40:**  We're waiting to get them up to size.  
**0:32:40-0:32:49:**  But I would say probably we're going to be selling just around 10 to 20 lambs per year.  
**0:32:49-0:32:52:**  So it's a small scale.  
**0:32:52-0:32:58:**  And the main purpose of having the sheep is to improve the soil under the chestnuts.  
**0:32:58-0:33:02:**  Okay, you've just opened a whole other chapter because I wasn't expecting us to delve into  
**0:33:02-0:33:04:**  this specific subject.  
**0:33:04-0:33:12:**  But I've been looking actually recently for somebody who can talk to me about... talk  
**0:33:12-0:33:16:**  to us on the podcast about integrating animals with fruit and nut crops.  
**0:33:16-0:33:22:**  So maybe it's time to open this chapter with you and to discuss your experience with the  
**0:33:22-0:33:23:**  sheep.  
**0:33:23-0:33:27:**  And I'd love to know a bit more about how, for example, do you protect the tree trunks  
**0:33:27-0:33:29:**  from damage?  
**0:33:29-0:33:32:**  That's something that we're experiencing quite a lot where I'm working right now and we have  
**0:33:32-0:33:39:**  to invest quite heavily on fencing out the trees actually.  
**0:33:39-0:33:51:**  Well for young trees that are not yet established, we use what are called tree shelters or grow  
**0:33:51-0:33:52:**  tubes.  
**0:33:52-0:34:01:**  It's a translucent plastic tube ventilated, five feet tall and supported with a stake.  
**0:34:01-0:34:08:**  And those did not work to keep goats off the trees, but the sheep don't bother the trees  
**0:34:08-0:34:13:**  when they are protected by these grow tubes or tree shelters.  
**0:34:13-0:34:21:**  For multi-stem shrubs that aren't suited to those tubes, we do have to keep the sheep  
**0:34:21-0:34:25:**  away from shrubs until they get established.  
**0:34:25-0:34:33:**  But once the trees and shrubs are established, then the sheep are no longer a problem.  
**0:34:33-0:34:40:**  They might browse some very low leaves on the shrubs, but they don't really do any damage  
**0:34:40-0:34:46:**  to the shrubs once they're established and can grow up out of reach of the sheep.  
**0:34:46-0:34:56:**  But in some cases you might have to keep the sheep away from the trees until they're established.  
**0:34:56-0:35:05:**  Do they ever try to rub themselves and scratch themselves on the grow tubes that you're using?  
**0:35:05-0:35:14:**  No, the tubes are smooth enough that they really aren't attractive for rubbing.  
**0:35:14-0:35:22:**  With the pawpaw trees, which we don't need to put tall tubes on because deer and sheep  
**0:35:22-0:35:28:**  don't like browsing on them, but the sheep do rub on them a little bit and they sometimes  
**0:35:28-0:35:35:**  break branches, but it's not enough damage to worry about once the trees are...  
**0:35:35-0:35:41:**  They don't even have to be fully established in the case of the pawpaws.  
**0:35:41-0:35:47:**  They do get rubbed on, but it doesn't hurt them enough to slow them down.  
**0:35:47-0:35:52:**  And so the chestnuts, once you remove the tube, for example, do the sheep ever have  
**0:35:52-0:35:53:**  a go at the bark?  
**0:35:53-0:35:58:**  Do you ever get bark damage?  
**0:35:58-0:36:00:**  Not so far.  
**0:36:00-0:36:08:**  We rotate the sheep every day or every other day to a new paddock, so they always have  
**0:36:08-0:36:13:**  access to high quality forage that they like better than tree bark.  
**0:36:13-0:36:21:**  So no, we've never had any damage to the bark of trees from sheep.  
**0:36:21-0:36:22:**  That's fantastic.  
**0:36:22-0:36:25:**  What sheep breed do you have?  
**0:36:25-0:36:28:**  To talk in animal terms.  
**0:36:28-0:36:33:**  We have Katahdin sheep, which is a hair type sheep.  
**0:36:33-0:36:35:**  They don't produce wool.  
**0:36:35-0:36:42:**  They shed their hair in spring at the end of winter, so they don't have to be sheared.  
**0:36:42-0:36:53:**  And they're also highly resistant to parasites, so we've never had to treat them for internal  
**0:36:53-0:37:00:**  parasites at all, whereas other breeds of sheep are difficult to keep alive even with  
**0:37:00-0:37:04:**  twice weekly treatments for parasites.  
**0:37:04-0:37:08:**  What kind of nets do you use or what kind of fencing do you use?  
**0:37:08-0:37:10:**  How do you move them around?  
**0:37:10-0:37:18:**  We use electric net fencing from a company called Premier One, which is located just  
**0:37:18-0:37:27:**  about a half an hour away from our farm, but they're actually a pretty large company that  
**0:37:27-0:37:31:**  supplies fencing all over the world.  
**0:37:31-0:37:33:**  But their fencing works very well.  
**0:37:33-0:37:39:**  We've only had the sheep escape one time, and I think it was when either a coyote or  
**0:37:39-0:37:45:**  dog spooked the flock and got them to stampede through the net.  
**0:37:45-0:37:49:**  That's happened once in two years.  
**0:37:49-0:37:52:**  The goats, on the other hand, would get out every day.  
**0:37:52-0:37:53:**  Really?  
**0:37:53-0:37:57:**  That must have been chaotic.  
**0:37:57-0:38:05:**  Yeah, I have photos of our goats 15 feet up in trees eating leaves.  
**0:38:05-0:38:10:**  Yeah, it's quite typical in a way, right?  
**0:38:10-0:38:14:**  In Greece we have them as well climbing onto whatever tree they can, all the olive trees  
**0:38:14-0:38:15:**  and etc.  
**0:38:15-0:38:19:**  Sometimes you don't see them on the floor, you have to look up at the trees to find where  
**0:38:19-0:38:22:**  the goats are at.  
**0:38:22-0:38:28:**  So I wanted to understand as well that you have it connected to an electric box that's  
**0:38:28-0:38:31:**  powered by, that's solar powered, right?  
**0:38:31-0:38:33:**  That's correct.  
**0:38:33-0:38:38:**  And they're usually moved either every day or at the most every other day.  
**0:38:38-0:38:43:**  When you have sheep, I mean, you're using the sheep to manage the grass, to keep it  
**0:38:43-0:38:44:**  low.  
**0:38:44-0:38:45:**  Are you happy with that?  
**0:38:45-0:38:49:**  Because sheep can be quite selective at grazing.  
**0:38:49-0:38:57:**  And so do they kind of replace your need to have to pass with a mower or is it still something  
**0:38:57-0:39:04:**  you have to complement on top of the sheep grazing?  
**0:39:04-0:39:10:**  We still have to mow and we have to get the sheep away from the trees well before the  
**0:39:10-0:39:15:**  nuts drop, but it's just a side benefit.  
**0:39:15-0:39:21:**  Our main purpose for having the sheep is to improve the soil, but as a side benefit, besides  
**0:39:21-0:39:27:**  having excess lambs for sale, they have also dramatically reduced the amount of mowing  
**0:39:27-0:39:33:**  and the cost of mowing.  
**0:39:33-0:39:38:**  Before we got the sheep we would have to spend several weeks trying to get the vegetation  
**0:39:38-0:39:42:**  mowed down in preparation for the nuts to fall.  
**0:39:42-0:39:50:**  Now just a single pass with the mower very quickly accomplishes the same thing.  
**0:39:50-0:39:51:**  That's very interesting.  
**0:39:51-0:39:58:**  I mean, there's so many things to delve into here to understand this better.  
**0:39:58-0:40:00:**  Do you let the grasses grow to a certain height?  
**0:40:00-0:40:04:**  Do you let the grasses develop themselves physiologically before you graze them, for  
**0:40:04-0:40:10:**  example, in spring before fruits are ready, or do you constantly keep your grass mowed?  
**0:40:10-0:40:13:**  I understand your question.  
**0:40:13-0:40:21:**  No, our grass gets really tall before the sheep move on to it and graze because we have  
**0:40:21-0:40:29:**  enough acres and the sheep are few enough that they might only pass through an area  
**0:40:29-0:40:37:**  two or three times a year, and so the grass gets pretty tall in between grazing events.  
**0:40:37-0:40:44:**  Okay, but just before harvest it's everything super clean, super mowed, super tidy, right?  
**0:40:44-0:40:54:**  Yeah, we actually evaluate each tree one at a time and decide when it needs to be mowed.  
**0:40:54-0:40:59:**  So when we see a chestnut tree is just about ready to start dropping nuts, then we'll go  
**0:40:59-0:41:06:**  under that particular tree and mow really short with a mower to be ready for those nuts  
**0:41:06-0:41:10:**  to fall, to make it easy for the customers to harvest.  
**0:41:10-0:41:15:**  I mean, I'd really like to see some pictures of your soil.  
**0:41:15-0:41:21:**  This is the frustrating part of the podcast is that we're just talking by voice, and also  
**0:41:21-0:41:26:**  I'm not, we're not together on your field interviewing, but maybe it's something you  
**0:41:26-0:41:27:**  can send us, right?  
**0:41:27-0:41:32:**  Do you have some nice pictures of your soil just to understand how, I mean, animals plus  
**0:41:32-0:41:36:**  the perennial system plus the grass is growing and getting mowed regularly and must have  
**0:41:36-0:41:41:**  created a thick layer of black soil on the surface?  
**0:41:41-0:41:47:**  Yeah, our soil is dark brown.  
**0:41:47-0:41:55:**  In places where it didn't suffer any erosion, it's around 14 inches thick, which would be  
**0:41:55-0:42:01:**  probably maybe around 35 centimeters or so.  
**0:42:01-0:42:02:**  40 centimeters?  
**0:42:02-0:42:07:**  Yeah, 35 or 40 centimeters thick.  
**0:42:07-0:42:18:**  And then under that is a much lighter layer of soil with a high clay content, but around  
**0:42:18-0:42:26:**  14 inches or so of very dark soil with a fairly high organic matter.  
**0:42:26-0:42:32:**  And like I said, it is, there's no soil in the world that's better at growing temperate  
**0:42:32-0:42:33:**  hardwood trees.  
**0:42:33-0:42:38:**  There are several soils that are equal to it, but none are better than what we have.  
**0:42:38-0:42:45:**  I mean, it makes me wonder, have you thought about producing more hardwood trees?  
**0:42:45-0:42:50:**  Have you thought about producing wood for timber or for, you know, have you thought  
**0:42:50-0:42:52:**  about entering that business?  
**0:42:52-0:43:00:**  Well, like I said, we have about 60 acres of our farm is already a wild forest that  
**0:43:00-0:43:05:**  is producing wood.  
**0:43:05-0:43:11:**  And we did, I do manage that for wood production.  
**0:43:11-0:43:13:**  Okay.  
**0:43:13-0:43:15:**  So what kind of wood do you harvest?  
**0:43:15-0:43:23:**  Well, our most valuable tree is black walnut in terms of wood value.  
**0:43:23-0:43:33:**  A single black walnut tree can be worth 20 to $40,000 at harvest time.  
**0:43:33-0:43:40:**  And we are growing black walnut, but we haven't had any harvest of those yet.  
**0:43:40-0:43:46:**  We also have white oak and red oak, and those would be the three main valuable hardwood  
**0:43:46-0:43:48:**  trees.  
**0:43:48-0:43:57:**  But we also have hickory and wild cherry and lots of other species.  
**0:43:57-0:44:01:**  But the main commercial ones that would be valuable would be black walnut, white oak  
**0:44:01-0:44:03:**  and red oak.  
**0:44:03-0:44:08:**  What's the life cycle of your black walnut before harvest?  
**0:44:08-0:44:21:**  Normally it takes between 50 to 100 years for a black walnut to be big enough to harvest.  
**0:44:21-0:44:25:**  And the number of years depends on what it is you want to harvest.  
**0:44:25-0:44:34:**  There's saw timber, which only needs to be 14 to 18 inch diameter, but for the highest  
**0:44:34-0:44:41:**  quality veneer, which is what brings the best price, the trunk diameter needs to be a minimum  
**0:44:41-0:44:46:**  of 28 inches at breast height.  
**0:44:46-0:44:49:**  And that could take 100 years.  
**0:44:49-0:44:51:**  Okay, very interesting.  
**0:44:51-0:44:56:**  And I just wanted to shift back a bit to the sheep.  
**0:44:56-0:44:59:**  Where do you put the sheep when you need to get them out of the orchard?  
**0:44:59-0:45:01:**  I guess you have lots of prairie fields around.  
**0:45:01-0:45:03:**  I mean, you've got a big land.  
**0:45:03-0:45:08:**  And you just move them out and keep them somewhere, keep them out of the orchard, of the nut production  
**0:45:08-0:45:09:**  zones.  
**0:45:09-0:45:10:**  Is that right?  
**0:45:10-0:45:17:**  Well, yeah, we do have some areas that don't have trees we harvest for human food and that  
**0:45:17-0:45:22:**  we can keep them grazing during the harvest period.  
**0:45:22-0:45:28:**  And the harvest period is about one month long, so that's not very long that we have  
**0:45:28-0:45:31:**  to keep them out away from the trees.  
**0:45:31-0:45:35:**  So that's a very short harvest period.  
**0:45:35-0:45:39:**  It means that you have high intense activity during that one month, but the rest of the  
**0:45:39-0:45:42:**  time it's rather low intensity.  
**0:45:42-0:45:44:**  Yes, that's true.  
**0:45:44-0:45:52:**  Between mid-September and mid-October, there's a lot of harvesting going on.  
**0:45:52-0:45:57:**  Fortunately, we have customers to do that work for us.  
**0:45:57-0:45:59:**  So that's definitely something we need to go into.  
**0:45:59-0:46:03:**  But still got a few questions about the way the system is working.  
**0:46:03-0:46:07:**  And then we'll go into the more business side of things, which is one of the very interesting  
**0:46:07-0:46:11:**  aspects, one of the many very interesting aspects of your farm.  
**0:46:11-0:46:14:**  And I'm discovering more and more as we go.  
**0:46:14-0:46:19:**  Going back to the sheep, would you be interested in increasing the size of your herd?  
**0:46:19-0:46:25:**  Well, first I need to say the sheep are actually my son's project.  
**0:46:25-0:46:27:**  So he manages them.  
**0:46:27-0:46:31:**  He gets the money from the sale of the lambs.  
**0:46:31-0:46:36:**  So he's the one who decides the size of the flock.  
**0:46:36-0:46:38:**  And right now we're still kind of learning.  
**0:46:38-0:46:44:**  We've only had them for two years, right around two years now.  
**0:46:44-0:46:49:**  So we're still learning how to do it.  
**0:46:49-0:46:54:**  But yeah, I do believe there is potential for increasing the herd size.  
**0:46:54-0:47:02:**  We obviously have a whole lot more grass than what the sheep we have are able to utilize  
**0:47:02-0:47:03:**  fully.  
**0:47:03-0:47:11:**  So we could probably double or even triple the size of the herd.  
**0:47:11-0:47:13:**  I'm sure.  
**0:47:13-0:47:18:**  There's also all the trees that you could use for fodder, especially if you've got lots  
**0:47:18-0:47:20:**  of forest, wild trees.  
**0:47:20-0:47:24:**  Is this something that you do in times of drought?  
**0:47:24-0:47:30:**  We actually haven't had a drought since we've had the sheep, so that's something we haven't  
**0:47:30-0:47:32:**  had to resort to yet.  
**0:47:32-0:47:42:**  But that would definitely be a possibility if we needed to go that route.  
**0:47:42-0:47:47:**  And legally there's no problem for you guys in terms of integrating the sheep there and  
**0:47:47-0:47:50:**  harvesting the nuts, especially from the floor?  
**0:47:50-0:47:51:**  Not for us.  
**0:47:51-0:47:58:**  There is a thing called the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2012, which normally would prohibit  
**0:47:58-0:48:02:**  having livestock under the trees.  
**0:48:02-0:48:11:**  In our situation for the chestnuts between mid-May to mid-October, which would be 90%  
**0:48:11-0:48:12:**  of the grazing season.  
**0:48:12-0:48:20:**  But we are actually what they call qualified exempt from those regulations because more  
**0:48:20-0:48:27:**  than 50% of our customers are what they call qualified customers, meaning either end users,  
**0:48:27-0:48:29:**  restaurants or grocery stores.  
**0:48:29-0:48:32:**  In our case it's all end users.  
**0:48:32-0:48:35:**  Virtually 100% of our customers are end users.  
**0:48:35-0:48:42:**  So we are exempt from those regulations that would force us to get the animals away from  
**0:48:42-0:48:47:**  the trees for that five month period.  
**0:48:47-0:48:53:**  And we still have to follow some of the regulations.  
**0:48:53-0:48:58:**  We have to post our complete address at the point of sale and we have to maintain records  
**0:48:58-0:49:06:**  showing who our customers are and that they are qualified customers.  
**0:49:06-0:49:10:**  But we're exempt from almost all the other regulations.  
**0:49:10-0:49:15:**  That would not be the case for somebody who's selling chestnuts to a broker, for example,  
**0:49:15-0:49:18:**  or to a co-op.  
**0:49:18-0:49:20:**  Then they just couldn't do it.  
**0:49:20-0:49:25:**  They couldn't do the grazing between mid-May and mid-October.  
**0:49:25-0:49:30:**  Which kills their grazing, any grazing plans they may have.  
**0:49:30-0:49:37:**  Which is another argument for doing U-pick because 100% of the U-pick customers are qualified  
**0:49:37-0:49:40:**  customers.  
**0:49:40-0:49:50:**  Do you agree with the health and safety logic behind this law?  
**0:49:50-0:49:54:**  From a person that's coming from the ground, that's experiencing it?  
**0:49:54-0:49:56:**  The law has no science behind it.  
**0:49:56-0:50:01:**  In fact, recent studies have shown that all of the benefits from moving animals off of  
**0:50:01-0:50:11:**  the land occur in the first five days and after that period the population of the pathogenic  
**0:50:11-0:50:19:**  microbes crashes in the first five days and then remains steady after that.  
**0:50:19-0:50:25:**  There is a good argument, a good scientific argument for moving the livestock off at least  
**0:50:25-0:50:31:**  five days before harvesting, but not beyond that period.  
**0:50:31-0:50:35:**  What about parasites?  
**0:50:35-0:50:38:**  Parasites are usually very species specific.  
**0:50:38-0:50:44:**  The parasites that would affect the sheep, for example, aren't even able to survive in  
**0:50:44-0:50:48:**  cattle, let alone humans.  
**0:50:48-0:50:53:**  No, that's not a concern.  
**0:50:53-0:50:54:**  Very interesting.  
**0:50:54-0:51:01:**  We do move the sheep off well ahead of the harvest season, we just don't move them off  
**0:51:01-0:51:05:**  120 days ahead of time.  
**0:51:05-0:51:13:**  So integrating timber trees in your fruit and nut production or around close to them,  
**0:51:13-0:51:18:**  is that something that you do?  
**0:51:18-0:51:24:**  The timber production is nearby but not in the same area as the fruit and nut and berry  
**0:51:24-0:51:27:**  production.  
**0:51:27-0:51:33:**  The whole farm is 86 acres and about 60 of those acres are just wild forest.  
**0:51:33-0:51:40:**  So you don't really have the need to mix them together, you don't see any real purpose for  
**0:51:40-0:51:41:**  that?  
**0:51:41-0:51:42:**  No.  
**0:51:42-0:51:50:**  Actually, we do have black walnuts mixed in among our crop producing trees, but they're  
**0:51:50-0:51:56:**  grafted varieties of black walnut that produce a larger, thinner-shelled, more easily cracked  
**0:51:56-0:51:57:**  nut.  
**0:51:57-0:52:03:**  But because they are black walnuts, they also produce valuable wood, but it's going to be  
**0:52:03-0:52:11:**  many decades before those are large enough to be harvestable.  
**0:52:11-0:52:16:**  Even though they are grafted and even though they are variety selected for nuts, they are  
**0:52:16-0:52:20:**  still valuable for wood, that's right, huh?  
**0:52:20-0:52:27:**  Some grafted varieties of black walnut don't have a growth form conducive to harvesting  
**0:52:27-0:52:35:**  for wood, but the ones that we have can serve both wood and nut production.  
**0:52:35-0:52:39:**  Maybe we can move on now to looking more at the economics and the business side, which  
**0:52:39-0:52:45:**  is something we focus a lot on the podcast because naturally, if agroforestry doesn't  
**0:52:45-0:52:49:**  work for the bottom line of the farmer, it's not something they should be even considering.  
**0:52:49-0:52:53:**  That's something we talked about together in the short call that we had before this  
**0:52:53-0:52:54:**  one.  
**0:52:54-0:53:01:**  Again, looking at your presentation, I really enjoyed your approach, the other presentation  
**0:53:01-0:53:02:**  I mean.  
**0:53:02-0:53:07:**  I really enjoyed the way that you were addressing this economic aspect and that you were communicating  
**0:53:07-0:53:08:**  it with the farmers.  
**0:53:08-0:53:14:**  One of the things that you did say in this presentation was that chestnut is a really  
**0:53:14-0:53:17:**  interesting crop economically.  
**0:53:17-0:53:21:**  You've maybe touched upon this a bit until now, but it might be worth repeating or building  
**0:53:21-0:53:23:**  on to what you've already said.  
**0:53:23-0:53:24:**  Why is that the case?  
**0:53:24-0:53:26:**  Why do you say that?  
**0:53:26-0:53:37:**  Well, compared to other nut crops, like in the US, the main nut crops are pecan, hazel,  
**0:53:37-0:53:44:**  almond and walnut, Persian walnut compared to chestnuts.  
**0:53:44-0:53:51:**  Chestnuts are much more productive in terms of pounds per acre.  
**0:53:51-0:53:53:**  They're more reliably productive.  
**0:53:53-0:54:00:**  They tend to produce a full crop every year, whereas these other nut crops tend to be biennially  
**0:54:00-0:54:01:**  productive.  
**0:54:01-0:54:06:**  They'll produce a good crop one year and then a poor crop or no crop at all the next year  
**0:54:06-0:54:10:**  and sometimes a couple of years before having another good crop.  
**0:54:10-0:54:14:**  They're also much more valuable per pound.  
**0:54:14-0:54:21:**  We're getting as much as $3 a pound for chestnuts without having to pick them up.  
**0:54:21-0:54:32:**  Our customers do the harvesting for us, whereas the other nut crops are often maybe somewhere  
**0:54:32-0:54:37:**  around $1, $1.50 a pound, sometimes less than $1 per pound.  
**0:54:37-0:54:44:**  So chestnuts produce twice as much as the other crops and sell for two to four times  
**0:54:44-0:54:46:**  more than the other crops.  
**0:54:46-0:54:49:**  And they do it every year.  
**0:54:49-0:54:57:**  So chestnuts in Iowa are approximately 10 times more profitable than pecans in Georgia  
**0:54:57-0:55:05:**  or almonds or walnuts in California or hazels in Oregon.  
**0:55:05-0:55:10:**  And that's what makes our system work because the chestnuts are just so valuable and the  
**0:55:10-0:55:12:**  demand is so high.  
**0:55:12-0:55:17:**  The gap between supply and demand is so large.  
**0:55:17-0:55:27:**  And then they're easy to harvest and they're ready to be sold the moment they hit the ground.  
**0:55:27-0:55:34:**  Because some of the other crops have to be processed in some way before they're marketable.  
**0:55:34-0:55:38:**  So why are people not doing more chestnuts?  
**0:55:38-0:55:46:**  Well, in the case of North America, we lost our native chestnut species about 100 years  
**0:55:46-0:55:51:**  ago to a fungal disease that came from Asia.  
**0:55:51-0:56:02:**  And today there are practically no Americans left who even remember chestnuts, except for  
**0:56:02-0:56:07:**  people who are around 100 years old or even older are the only people who can remember  
**0:56:07-0:56:09:**  American chestnuts.  
**0:56:09-0:56:14:**  And so the only thing Americans know about chestnuts is you roast them on open fire at  
**0:56:14-0:56:17:**  Christmas time.  
**0:56:17-0:56:23:**  There's a Christmas song, in fact the title of the song is the Christmas song, that talks  
**0:56:23-0:56:24:**  about chestnuts enough.  
**0:56:24-0:56:26:**  All Americans know about chestnuts.  
**0:56:26-0:56:31:**  Most Americans have never seen one, let alone tasted one.  
**0:56:31-0:56:37:**  And our market is mostly to people who were born and raised in other parts of the world  
**0:56:37-0:56:40:**  where chestnuts are known and loved.  
**0:56:40-0:56:43:**  Americans just don't know anything about chestnuts.  
**0:56:43-0:56:45:**  So there's quite a small market for chestnuts?  
**0:56:45-0:56:49:**  No, it's a very large market.  
**0:56:49-0:56:53:**  There are enough people in this country who were born and raised in other parts of the  
**0:56:53-0:57:01:**  world that there is a huge market for chestnuts, it just isn't to Americans.  
**0:57:01-0:57:08:**  The Americans want one pound of chestnuts at Christmas time, whereas our typical Bosnian  
**0:57:08-0:57:15:**  customers for example want 300 to 800 pounds in September.  
**0:57:15-0:57:23:**  Much rather sell 800 pounds of chestnuts to one Bosnian in September than make 800 one-pound  
**0:57:23-0:57:30:**  sales to Anglo-Americans in December.  
**0:57:30-0:57:39:**  I did some calculations a few years ago based on the average number of acres of chestnuts  
**0:57:39-0:57:46:**  being planted in the US per year and based on the market for those.  
**0:57:46-0:57:52:**  I came up with a figure that it would take 285 years before we have enough chestnut trees  
**0:57:52-0:58:00:**  in the ground to meet the demand we had back in the year 2000.  
**0:58:00-0:58:05:**  So if demand remained flat for 285 years, that's how long it would take for us to grow  
**0:58:05-0:58:06:**  enough to meet demand.  
**0:58:06-0:58:13:**  But demand doesn't remain flat, it's growing much faster than the acreage of chestnuts.  
**0:58:13-0:58:19:**  That's fantastic statistics, amazing that we're able to hear these calculations on the  
**0:58:19-0:58:20:**  show.  
**0:58:20-0:58:23:**  Does anybody produce chestnut wholesale?  
**0:58:23-0:58:30:**  And I mean on a large scale and that sell it wholesale in the US, at what price do they  
**0:58:30-0:58:34:**  sell their chestnuts?  
**0:58:34-0:58:39:**  I'm sure there are a few.  
**0:58:39-0:58:46:**  Even the largest growers aren't really large on a scale like almond and walnut growers  
**0:58:46-0:58:54:**  in California or hazel growers in Oregon.  
**0:58:54-0:59:01:**  But I know there are some wholesalers and I think they're getting somewhere in the range  
**0:59:01-0:59:13:**  of $3 to $8 a pound or so, which is much higher than any other nut crop in the US.  
**0:59:13-0:59:15:**  But is it easy to mechanize?  
**0:59:15-0:59:20:**  The harvest, just trying to understand, and how do you do it actually on your farm?  
**0:59:20-0:59:22:**  How do you harvest the chestnuts?  
**0:59:22-0:59:28:**  So how do your clients harvest the chestnuts?  
**0:59:28-0:59:35:**  We use a machine called a nut wizard, which is a wire basket about the size and shape  
**0:59:35-0:59:39:**  of a football that rolls on the end of a pole.  
**0:59:39-0:59:44:**  And when it rolls over the nuts, the wires squeeze apart and the nuts pop inside the  
**0:59:44-0:59:45:**  basket.  
**0:59:45-0:59:48:**  And then they're easily dumped into a bucket or other container.  
**0:59:48-0:59:54:**  And we have a fleet of those, we have 20-some of those, and we loan those out to our customers  
**0:59:54-0:59:58:**  and they use them to harvest and then they give them back at the end of the day when  
**0:59:58-1:00:03:**  they're ready to check out.  
**1:00:03-1:00:06:**  And those work really well for us in our situation.  
**1:00:06-1:00:11:**  There are machines that harvest chestnuts also.  
**1:00:11-1:00:16:**  There's a machine made in Italy called a FACMA.  
**1:00:16-1:00:22:**  I've seen work, but I'm not tempted to swap out my nut wizards for a FACMA machine at  
**1:00:22-1:00:25:**  all.  
**1:00:25-1:00:26:**  Why is that?  
**1:00:26-1:00:37:**  Well, the machines I use don't require any fuel or oil and they don't make noise and  
**1:00:37-1:00:41:**  at the end of the day they go home after they pay me.  
**1:00:41-1:00:44:**  Very interesting.  
**1:00:44-1:00:46:**  Okay.  
**1:00:46-1:00:47:**  Nice.  
**1:00:47-1:00:55:**  Yeah, well, they're much more adapted, the nut wizards are much more adapted to your  
**1:00:55-1:00:58:**  system because you've got clients coming in and picking them themselves.  
**1:00:58-1:01:00:**  You're not going to give them a machine.  
**1:01:00-1:01:07:**  But I mean, another way to do it would be for you to use the FACMA, for example, harvest  
**1:01:07-1:01:13:**  the nuts relatively efficiently, I expect, and then to have them on boxes for your customers  
**1:01:13-1:01:15:**  to come in to just pick them from the box.  
**1:01:15-1:01:19:**  Is that an alternative that is worth considering?  
**1:01:19-1:01:28:**  Yes, we used to do it that way, but we don't need to do that now.  
**1:01:28-1:01:32:**  All I have to do now is mow the grass and collect the money.  
**1:01:32-1:01:38:**  Why would I want to go to all that extra work of harvesting and boxing the nuts when I have  
**1:01:38-1:01:42:**  customers who are willing to do that for me?  
**1:01:42-1:01:46:**  That argument is difficult to argue with.  
**1:01:46-1:01:49:**  I would not consider going back to the old way.  
**1:01:49-1:01:51:**  Not at all.  
**1:01:51-1:01:53:**  Is the FACMA efficient at all?  
**1:01:53-1:01:58:**  I remember somewhere you may have mentioned, you did some calculations again looking at  
**1:01:58-1:02:05:**  the efficiency of the FACMA VS a team picking up with the nut wizard.  
**1:02:05-1:02:07:**  Is that correct?  
**1:02:07-1:02:08:**  Yes.  
**1:02:08-1:02:14:**  I got to the sales rep for the machine and I can't remember exactly what he said.  
**1:02:14-1:02:20:**  I asked him about the acres per hour or hours per acre or whatever.  
**1:02:20-1:02:25:**  I figured that five people with nut wizards could stay ahead of that machine.  
**1:02:25-1:02:28:**  Okay, nice.  
**1:02:28-1:02:41:**  Maybe on the same topic of the economics of your system, how do you define if the crops  
**1:02:41-1:02:46:**  that you do sell commercially at the moment, you've got 70 different species, but three  
**1:02:46-1:02:50:**  or four of them are your main commercial species.  
**1:02:50-1:02:55:**  You've talked about chestnut now, but what characteristics in the crops are you looking  
**1:02:55-1:02:59:**  for or have made you choose these species as your commercial ones?  
**1:02:59-1:03:00:**  Was it more a demand side thing?  
**1:03:00-1:03:02:**  Was it more a production side thing?  
**1:03:02-1:03:09:**  How did you decide these are my commercial species and that's what I'm focusing on?  
**1:03:09-1:03:15:**  It's a combination of supply and production and demand.  
**1:03:15-1:03:21:**  The species has to be productive, has to produce enough, and then I have to be able to sell  
**1:03:21-1:03:27:**  it for a high enough price to make it worthwhile.  
**1:03:27-1:03:38:**  Also the need for post-harvest handling and processing is another important consideration.  
**1:03:38-1:03:46:**  For example, in the case of hazelnuts, which I do not consider to be a commercially viable  
**1:03:46-1:03:53:**  plant, it's not because there isn't demand, you can sell hazelnuts, but the kind of hazels  
**1:03:53-1:03:58:**  we are able to grow here are a bush type hazel that do not drop the nuts to the ground.  
**1:03:58-1:04:02:**  So the nuts have to be picked from the bush and to do it commercially has to be done by  
**1:04:02-1:04:03:**  a machine.  
**1:04:03-1:04:09:**  Then you have to have another machine to remove the husk and then you have to have another  
**1:04:09-1:04:14:**  machine to size the nuts before they go into a cracking machine.  
**1:04:14-1:04:18:**  Then they have to be cracked and then you have to have another machine to separate the  
**1:04:18-1:04:23:**  shell and kernel before you have a product ready to sell.  
**1:04:23-1:04:28:**  With the chestnuts, as soon as they hit the ground, I can have a customer come and pick  
**1:04:28-1:04:36:**  them up and they're sold without the machines, without the processing, and they sell for  
**1:04:36-1:04:42:**  a much higher price and they produce more pounds per acre.  
**1:04:42-1:04:50:**  In the case of the hazels, it costs $4 a pound to harvest and get something ready to sell  
**1:04:50-1:04:53:**  and then you can sell it for less than a dollar a pound.  
**1:04:53-1:04:58:**  So with hazels you lose money on every pound you grow.  
**1:04:58-1:05:03:**  And you're competing with highly mechanized systems that can produce it very cheap.  
**1:05:03-1:05:04:**  Right.  
**1:05:04-1:05:05:**  Yeah.  
**1:05:05-1:05:08:**  It's a no brainer really.  
**1:05:08-1:05:09:**  Yes.  
**1:05:09-1:05:16:**  Although you'd be surprised at how many people with PhDs after their name are trying to figure  
**1:05:16-1:05:27:**  out how to grow hazels profitably and totally ignoring chestnuts.  
**1:05:27-1:05:28:**  I'm quite excited.  
**1:05:28-1:05:31:**  Do you know Russell Smith?  
**1:05:31-1:05:32:**  I'm sure you do.  
**1:05:32-1:05:36:**  The book that he wrote, which the title escapes me now.  
**1:05:36-1:05:37:**  Tree Crops.  
**1:05:37-1:05:38:**  Jay Russell Smith.  
**1:05:38-1:05:39:**  Tree Crops.  
**1:05:39-1:05:40:**  There we go.  
**1:05:40-1:05:41:**  Tree Crops.  
**1:05:41-1:05:47:**  It's quite exciting to consider the idea of chestnuts as a carbohydrate source for our  
**1:05:47-1:05:54:**  society, a perennial one that doesn't need fantastic soil conditions to thrive.  
**1:05:54-1:05:59:**  It needs actually, sometimes as you said, the soil can be too fertile for chestnuts.  
**1:05:59-1:06:03:**  It does well on slopes that are well drained, but not too well drained.  
**1:06:03-1:06:15:**  So it's opening a whole vast area of a potential area of production to feed a source of carbohydrates  
**1:06:15-1:06:18:**  to the population.  
**1:06:18-1:06:24:**  Something which, for example, hazelnuts or almonds, they're not so rich in carbohydrates.  
**1:06:24-1:06:27:**  So it's more protein and fat.  
**1:06:27-1:06:29:**  So what do you think about this?  
**1:06:29-1:06:37:**  What do you think about the potential of scaling chestnuts in order for it to be a staple?  
**1:06:37-1:06:43:**  Well, chestnuts, as you say, don't require really good soil.  
**1:06:43-1:06:48:**  In fact, they can thrive on fairly poor soil, although they are more productive on better  
**1:06:48-1:06:49:**  soils.  
**1:06:49-1:06:51:**  But they are picky.  
**1:06:51-1:06:53:**  They do have to have well drained soil.  
**1:06:53-1:06:56:**  They will not tolerate poor drainage at all.  
**1:06:56-1:07:03:**  We found that out in 2018, where we had some planted on less than very well drained soils,  
**1:07:03-1:07:07:**  and those died from too much rain.  
**1:07:07-1:07:14:**  But yes, there are millions of acres in the US that could be growing chestnuts and producing  
**1:07:14-1:07:17:**  high income for the farmer.  
**1:07:17-1:07:26:**  And instead, they're planted with corn and soybeans and wheat when they could be producing  
**1:07:26-1:07:34:**  a very high value crop that does not degrade the soil.  
**1:07:34-1:07:35:**  Then the limit is demand.  
**1:07:35-1:07:36:**  No, but that's not the limit.  
**1:07:36-1:07:41:**  I apologize because you've just explained to me the calculation that there is a huge  
**1:07:41-1:07:43:**  demand.  
**1:07:43-1:07:45:**  Yes.  
**1:07:45-1:07:50:**  I've been told that chestnut is the number three nut in the world in terms of demand  
**1:07:50-1:07:53:**  behind coconuts and peanuts.  
**1:07:53-1:07:56:**  And neither coconuts or peanuts are true nuts.  
**1:07:56-1:08:05:**  The peanuts are a legume, and coconut isn't even an angiosperm.  
**1:08:05-1:08:07:**  It's a gymnosperm.  
**1:08:07-1:08:12:**  So that makes chestnuts the number one nut in the world in terms of demand.  
**1:08:12-1:08:15:**  The number one true nut.  
**1:08:15-1:08:22:**  The demand for chestnuts is absolutely huge, both in the US and all over the world.  
**1:08:22-1:08:24:**  And there aren't near enough of them being grown.  
**1:08:24-1:08:26:**  That's very exciting potential.  
**1:08:26-1:08:32:**  Just maybe to convince some of our farmer listeners that may be getting a bit excited  
**1:08:32-1:08:37:**  about this, how long does it take for a chestnut to start producing?  
**1:08:37-1:08:45:**  Yeah, I've had chestnut seedlings that were still in pots trying to produce nuts, although  
**1:08:45-1:08:49:**  that's not normal.  
**1:08:49-1:08:57:**  In our conditions, with a tree shelter and on a good site, you start seeing chestnut  
**1:08:57-1:09:04:**  production on average in three to four years, sometimes as early as two years.  
**1:09:04-1:09:13:**  You can start seeing commercial-sized harvests in year six, usually around six, seven, eight,  
**1:09:13-1:09:19:**  before measuring your harvest in hundreds of pounds per acre.  
**1:09:19-1:09:28:**  And they can reach, on the best soils again, 5,000 pounds per acre by the time they're  
**1:09:28-1:09:29:**  20 years old.  
**1:09:29-1:09:30:**  Very interesting.  
**1:09:30-1:09:31:**  Okay, thanks for that.  
**1:09:31-1:09:36:**  I wanted to talk a bit about the U-pick.  
**1:09:36-1:09:41:**  That means that you're selling directly to the customer, but the challenge of that is  
**1:09:41-1:09:43:**  often to find enough customers.  
**1:09:43-1:09:50:**  So how did you manage to get enough customers to distribute your production?  
**1:09:50-1:09:54:**  And maybe before that, we need to understand, if you're willing to share this information,  
**1:09:54-1:09:59:**  how much chestnuts do you produce on an average year?  
**1:09:59-1:10:05:**  We really don't have enough years to save for certain in terms of production per year,  
**1:10:05-1:10:08:**  and most of our trees are still young.  
**1:10:08-1:10:18:**  We only have an equivalent of about one acre of really mature trees and about nine acres  
**1:10:18-1:10:24:**  of trees that are just coming into high production, and then a few more acres that aren't in production  
**1:10:24-1:10:25:**  yet.  
**1:10:25-1:10:31:**  But in terms of how we got our customers, it was totally by accident.  
**1:10:31-1:10:42:**  In 2013, we had some customers who begged us to let them come and pick their own, and  
**1:10:42-1:10:44:**  I did not want to do it.  
**1:10:44-1:10:50:**  I was afraid of liability, but they were good customers, and the dad was dying of cancer,  
**1:10:50-1:10:54:**  and he wanted to pick chestnuts one more time before he died, because he's from a country  
**1:10:54-1:10:58:**  where he picked chestnuts from the time he was a toddler.  
**1:10:58-1:11:05:**  I couldn't say no, so I told him, okay, but don't tell anybody that we let you do this.  
**1:11:05-1:11:10:**  And within three days, we had a list of 20-some people who wanted to come and do U-Pick.  
**1:11:10-1:11:19:**  A year later, it was 70-some, and today we have a list of 360 names, each one representing  
**1:11:19-1:11:24:**  usually an extended family of people who want to come and do U-Pick, and we have the ability  
**1:11:24-1:11:29:**  to serve maybe 40 of them a year.  
**1:11:29-1:11:35:**  So we have way more customers than we can serve, and our list gets longer every year.  
**1:11:35-1:11:45:**  It gets longer and longer, and we have actually been referring customers to other farms with  
**1:11:45-1:11:48:**  chestnuts.  
**1:11:48-1:11:56:**  So there's actually four farms around us that are doing U-Pick now, taking over our overflow,  
**1:11:56-1:11:57:**  and it's still not enough.  
**1:11:57-1:12:03:**  So there's huge unmet demand for U-Pick chestnuts.  
**1:12:03-1:12:07:**  And is it a bit challenging to have people walking around your farm?  
**1:12:07-1:12:11:**  Is that something that you ever have like damage, or animals get scared, or get fed  
**1:12:11-1:12:14:**  things they shouldn't get fed, or I don't know.  
**1:12:14-1:12:19:**  It seems to be a potential concern with this system.  
**1:12:19-1:12:25:**  There are certainly problems, some problems, but none of them are insurmountable.  
**1:12:25-1:12:31:**  There's some amount of littering going on.  
**1:12:31-1:12:38:**  Because it's a nut farm, I set squirrel traps, and I thought, as long as I kept them up out  
**1:12:38-1:12:43:**  of reach of small children, that I wouldn't need to tell adults not to stick their hand  
**1:12:43-1:12:51:**  into a squirrel trap, but it turned out I was wrong about that.  
**1:12:51-1:12:57:**  So we had a customer get injured by a squirrel trap once.  
**1:12:57-1:13:03:**  But the biggest problem is just scheduling customers and making sure they show up for  
**1:13:03-1:13:07:**  their picking appointments.  
**1:13:07-1:13:14:**  But it's a lot easier than what we used to do, which was do all our own harvesting and  
**1:13:14-1:13:16:**  then haul them to the co-op.  
**1:13:16-1:13:18:**  Yeah, naturally.  
**1:13:18-1:13:23:**  So you're scaling up your system now to try and meet the demand, right?  
**1:13:23-1:13:25:**  Or have you stopped planting chestnuts?  
**1:13:25-1:13:27:**  Let's see.  
**1:13:27-1:13:33:**  I haven't completely stopped planting more, but I'm running out of acres where I could  
**1:13:33-1:13:35:**  plant them.  
**1:13:35-1:13:41:**  Most of the farm is too steep and rugged to manage for harvesting chestnuts.  
**1:13:41-1:13:46:**  If you can't mow under a tree, if it's too steep to mow, you can't harvest there, and  
**1:13:46-1:13:50:**  any chestnuts there would be for wildlife only.  
**1:13:50-1:13:55:**  But I am not trying to meet demand because there is absolutely no hope.  
**1:13:55-1:14:04:**  If I owned 10,000 acres of land, I still would not be able to meet demand for chestnuts.  
**1:14:04-1:14:08:**  I'm not trying to meet demand.  
**1:14:08-1:14:12:**  I'm pretty close to where I want to be.  
**1:14:12-1:14:17:**  I don't want to really grow much beyond where we are right now.  
**1:14:17-1:14:18:**  That's interesting.  
**1:14:18-1:14:23:**  But what's really crazy about it is that there's so much demand for you pick.  
**1:14:23-1:14:31:**  One thing is demand for people going to grocery stores and supermarkets and getting hold of  
**1:14:31-1:14:36:**  chestnuts there, where they usually go shopping, but demand for going on the farm and spending  
**1:14:36-1:14:46:**  their time to pick the nuts and on top of that paying for it.  
**1:14:46-1:14:52:**  It's clearly tapping into some need of the customers that goes beyond just the chestnut  
**1:14:52-1:14:55:**  as well.  
**1:14:55-1:14:58:**  Yes.  
**1:14:58-1:15:02:**  Our customers seem to be much more excited about picking their own than they are about  
**1:15:02-1:15:06:**  buying them already picked.  
**1:15:06-1:15:13:**  Part of that is the fact that the chestnut harvest is occurring at a time of year when  
**1:15:13-1:15:16:**  it's very pleasant to be outside.  
**1:15:16-1:15:22:**  The weather is usually absolutely beautiful.  
**1:15:22-1:15:33:**  Plenty of shade under the trees and people just have a very good time picking chestnuts.  
**1:15:33-1:15:41:**  Also I think in the case of a lot of our customers it's reminding them of being back in the old  
**1:15:41-1:15:46:**  country because most of our customers are coming from other parts of the world.  
**1:15:46-1:15:48:**  Okay, nice.  
**1:15:48-1:15:51:**  For me I'm just trying to think a bit looking at my notes.  
**1:15:51-1:15:53:**  I wanted to look a bit at pawpaw in your other crops.  
**1:15:53-1:15:56:**  So that's also you pick, right?  
**1:15:56-1:15:59:**  You're selling everything on your farm you pick.  
**1:15:59-1:16:01:**  Correct.  
**1:16:01-1:16:08:**  Pawpaws are the second most popular crop.  
**1:16:08-1:16:16:**  Last year we only had around 100 trees that were producing fruit, but from those 100 trees  
**1:16:16-1:16:25:**  the customers picked 2,500 pounds of fruit which would be just under a metric ton.  
**1:16:25-1:16:39:**  And we sold them for $3 a pound or it was over $7,000 from what was equivalent of one  
**1:16:39-1:16:45:**  acre of trees.  
**1:16:45-1:16:50:**  And these were growing mostly underneath chestnut trees.  
**1:16:50-1:16:57:**  So it's additional income from the same acre that's producing income from chestnut trees.  
**1:16:57-1:17:03:**  And again last year we had way more customers than we were able to serve.  
**1:17:03-1:17:14:**  We had to turn lots of people away because we did not have enough pawpaw trees for everybody.  
**1:17:14-1:17:19:**  We have a lot more pawpaw trees coming into production this year, but we're still not  
**1:17:19-1:17:21:**  going to be able to meet demand.  
**1:17:21-1:17:24:**  You're choosing your crops well.  
**1:17:24-1:17:29:**  Yes, but it's all by accident.  
**1:17:29-1:17:34:**  Because it's quite a big coincidence that they are on one hand trees that don't need  
**1:17:34-1:17:40:**  a lot of inputs, trees that have a good selling price, trees that have a lot of demand, trees  
**1:17:40-1:17:44:**  that don't need minimal pruning.  
**1:17:44-1:17:49:**  This is all nearly too beautiful to be true in a way when you're listening to this from  
**1:17:49-1:17:50:**  the outside.  
**1:17:50-1:17:53:**  I'm sure some of the listeners are listening to this and saying, I can't make that work  
**1:17:53-1:17:56:**  in my context.  
**1:17:56-1:17:58:**  That might be true in some contexts.  
**1:17:58-1:18:05:**  In other parts of the country they have insect pests of chestnuts that have to be managed  
**1:18:05-1:18:08:**  or you can't sell nuts.  
**1:18:08-1:18:12:**  We don't have those pests here, not yet anyway.  
**1:18:12-1:18:16:**  It does almost sound too good to be true.  
**1:18:16-1:18:20:**  Even if you have a bit more spraying to do in the year because of climate change and  
**1:18:20-1:18:24:**  et cetera and the shifting, everything that's happening at the moment, it wouldn't break  
**1:18:24-1:18:26:**  the bank either.  
**1:18:26-1:18:34:**  No, but like I said, I really don't like spraying or pruning, so I like to grow crops that don't  
**1:18:34-1:18:35:**  need either one.  
**1:18:35-1:18:39:**  No, of course, naturally.  
**1:18:39-1:18:41:**  Great.  
**1:18:41-1:18:43:**  What went behind the choice of the honey berries?  
**1:18:43-1:18:46:**  It's a new crop you're experimenting with.  
**1:18:46-1:18:49:**  Is there a big market for those as well?  
**1:18:49-1:18:58:**  They're experimental right now, but I actually acquired honey berries about 25 years ago.  
**1:18:58-1:18:59:**  I really liked the taste of them.  
**1:18:59-1:19:03:**  I thought they were absolutely delicious.  
**1:19:03-1:19:10:**  The trouble was these were wild type bushes that produced berries that were about the  
**1:19:10-1:19:13:**  size and shape of a grain of rice.  
**1:19:13-1:19:19:**  It took about a half an hour of picking to get a teaspoon full.  
**1:19:19-1:19:27:**  Even though they tasted really good, they weren't good enough to justify that much work  
**1:19:27-1:19:29:**  for such a small reward.  
**1:19:29-1:19:37:**  So I gave up on them and neglected them and they eventually died out from neglect because  
**1:19:37-1:19:43:**  they were growing in a dense brome grass sod, which is very competitive against trees and  
**1:19:43-1:19:46:**  shrubs.  
**1:19:46-1:19:56:**  But some big advances in honey berry breeding were done by Dr. Maxine Thompson from Oregon  
**1:19:56-1:20:01:**  State and Bob Borsch from the University of Saskatchewan.  
**1:20:01-1:20:12:**  Now there are honey berry berries that are about the size of the end joint on your thumb  
**1:20:12-1:20:16:**  instead of the size of a grain of rice.  
**1:20:16-1:20:20:**  They taste even better than the old ones.  
**1:20:20-1:20:26:**  In fact, there are varieties available now that produce berries that are twice the size  
**1:20:26-1:20:31:**  of what was considered a large size berry five years ago.  
**1:20:31-1:20:38:**  They're absolutely game-changing varieties.  
**1:20:38-1:20:39:**  I like the taste of them.  
**1:20:39-1:20:43:**  They taste like a cross between a blueberry and a black raspberry.  
**1:20:43-1:20:50:**  Now that they're productive enough to be worth it, I'm experimenting with them.  
**1:20:50-1:20:58:**  I'm not ready to definitively say these are going to be a good crop, but when customers  
**1:20:58-1:21:05:** ... I've let some customers do some U-pick on them and they preferred them over blueberries,  
**1:21:05-1:21:16:**  roseberries, redcurrants... They were very excited about them anyway.  
**1:21:16-1:21:24:**  So I think they will be very popular, but it remains to be seen.  
**1:21:24-1:21:25:**  Very interesting.  
**1:21:25-1:21:29:**  We'll have to follow that and to see how that evolves.  
**1:21:29-1:21:33:**  I wanted to ask you maybe just to finish off on something quite technical and agronomical  
**1:21:33-1:21:40:**  because I know that you have a lot of experience with this and you're very knowledgeable about  
**1:21:40-1:21:41:**  this subject.  
**1:21:41-1:21:48:**  That's what I perceived from the talk that I saw that I mentioned earlier.  
**1:21:48-1:21:50:**  How do you manage the grass?  
**1:21:50-1:21:55:**  Not how do you manage it, but more like what grass do you choose to grow in between your  
**1:21:55-1:22:01:**  trees and for what reason?  
**1:22:01-1:22:08:**  That's actually a very good question because some grasses are very incompatible with trees.  
**1:22:08-1:22:15:**  For example, a smooth brome grass is extremely competitive against trees.  
**1:22:15-1:22:23:**  When I'm giving people recommendations, I tell them don't allow brome grass to grow  
**1:22:23-1:22:29:**  within 100 feet of where you want to grow trees because the root system of brome grass  
**1:22:29-1:22:38:**  can go underneath a highway and come up on the other side and they will kill trees.  
**1:22:38-1:22:43:**  But brome grass is not tolerant of close, frequent mowing.  
**1:22:43-1:22:49:**  So in a case where trees are planted in brome grass, you can get rid of the brome just by  
**1:22:49-1:22:55:**  mowing it very close and very frequently and it will eventually be replaced by another  
**1:22:55-1:23:03:**  species of grass that's tolerant of close, frequent mowing, such as bluegrass.  
**1:23:03-1:23:07:**  And bluegrass is compatible with trees.  
**1:23:07-1:23:14:**  But if I'm starting with a bare field, I have a very specific recommendation for a ground  
**1:23:14-1:23:21:**  cover but it's very local and it might not work a few hundred miles away.  
**1:23:21-1:23:29:**  But I recommend a mix of turf type perennial ryegrass, a creeping red fescue or some other  
**1:23:29-1:23:35:**  fine leaf fescue and then Dutch white clover, which makes a very low ground cover that doesn't  
**1:23:35-1:23:41:**  need much mowing and is very compatible with trees.  
**1:23:41-1:23:45:**  It works very well in the upper Midwest but it might not work elsewhere.  
**1:23:45-1:23:51:**  Naturally, yeah, it needs to be adapted.  
**1:23:51-1:23:56:**  I can't make recommendations for other parts of the world as far as ground cover except  
**1:23:56-1:24:01:**  you want something that's very low and not competitive against tree roots.  
**1:24:01-1:24:07:**  So they need to have a lighter root system and also the mowing right, the mowing will  
**1:24:07-1:24:14:**  reduce the density and the length of the root system of the different grasses and legumes,  
**1:24:14-1:24:15:**  right?  
**1:24:15-1:24:16:**  Yes.  
**1:24:16-1:24:17:**  Yes.  
**1:24:17-1:24:21:**  And it will also cause a shift in the species present.  
**1:24:21-1:24:29:**  If you mow close and frequently then the taller species with a deeper root system will be  
**1:24:29-1:24:36:**  forced out and replaced by things with a shallower, less competitive root system.  
**1:24:36-1:24:41:**  When you say a close mow, could you give us some specifications?  
**1:24:41-1:24:49:**  How many inches are we talking about?  
**1:24:49-1:24:55:**  If you can not let it get much over five or six inches tall and when you mow it, mow it  
**1:24:55-1:25:06:**  down to three inches or so, kind of like what you see in lawns, that would be ideal for  
**1:25:06-1:25:08:**  the trees.  
**1:25:08-1:25:12:**  And then you just leave the clippings, the grass clippings on the floor.  
**1:25:12-1:25:16:**  You don't rake them out, you just leave them there.  
**1:25:16-1:25:17:**  That's correct.  
**1:25:17-1:25:22:**  They're adding to the soil carbon if they're just left.  
**1:25:22-1:25:30:**  But now we prefer to have sheep to do that because they're not only leaving fertilizer  
**1:25:30-1:25:34:**  behind in addition to just organic matter.  
**1:25:34-1:25:43:**  Some people would say that a three species mix for a ground cover is quite light and  
**1:25:43-1:25:45:**  actually for a variety of reasons.  
**1:25:45-1:25:49:**  There's actually interesting science about this that says that the higher diversity,  
**1:25:49-1:25:55:**  we're completing more functions in the soil in terms of feeding specific microbiology.  
**1:25:55-1:26:01:**  We're gaining more resilience as well in the grass or in the ground cover.  
**1:26:01-1:26:05:**  I'm curious to know your experience and your opinion about this.  
**1:26:05-1:26:08:**  One thing is what you read in studies, what people talk about.  
**1:26:08-1:26:14:**  Another thing is what somebody in their context has been observing for 25 years.  
**1:26:14-1:26:20:**  When I recommend a three species ground cover, I'm talking about getting trees established.  
**1:26:20-1:26:29:**  Once they're established, then I bring in more species and also just naturally more  
**1:26:29-1:26:36:**  species will come in like if I plant the two grasses and the clover, almost immediately  
**1:26:36-1:26:45:**  there are dandelions coming in and other species.  
**1:26:45-1:26:51:**  But during the tree's establishment period, which is going to be a minimum of three years  
**1:26:51-1:26:57:**  and probably more like five to seven years, I want to minimize competition from other  
**1:26:57-1:26:58:**  species.  
**1:26:58-1:27:04:**  But once the trees are established, they don't need my help anymore, at least the species  
**1:27:04-1:27:05:**  that I pick.  
**1:27:05-1:27:11:**  I can let as many species as want to come in and I can bring in species.  
**1:27:11-1:27:18:**  In addition to the 75 species of fruit, nut and berry plants, we also have somewhere around  
**1:27:18-1:27:27:**  two dozen or so perennial vegetables planted among and beneath the trees.  
**1:27:27-1:27:32:**  We usually don't bring those in until the trees are established.  
**1:27:32-1:27:37:**  Getting the trees established is the top priority and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to  
**1:27:37-1:27:44:**  get the trees established and then let nature take its course after that.  
**1:27:44-1:27:53:**  I quite like how you are, on one side you're managing an extremely diverse agroecological  
**1:27:53-1:28:00:**  system but before that you are using a herbicide, oust herbicide, which is a forestry herbicide,  
**1:28:00-1:28:05:**  you're using that to get the trees established.  
**1:28:05-1:28:07:**  The first years.  
**1:28:07-1:28:13:**  It's like a bit of a compromise that you're ready to make in order for proper tree establishment,  
**1:28:13-1:28:18:**  getting your economic model running and then letting, as you said, nature take its course  
**1:28:18-1:28:23:**  and clearly with that diversity and that management plus the animal integration, you must be,  
**1:28:23-1:28:29:**  you know, you're taking a lot of the boxes of what we consider to be regenerative agriculture.  
**1:28:29-1:28:37:**  Yes, and there are alternatives to oust herbicide, for example, for people who are absolutely  
**1:28:37-1:28:40:**  rabidly opposed to any kind of chemical usage.  
**1:28:40-1:28:49:**  They can use a combination of landscape fabric topped with coarse wood chip mulch and that's  
**1:28:49-1:28:57:**  at least as effective as oust, near 100% effective at weed control but it also adds $1,000 an  
**1:28:57-1:29:03:**  acre to the cost of the tree planting and I can plant a lot of extra trees for that  
**1:29:03-1:29:11:**  $1,000 and I would rather do that than stay chemical free and then I only need the oust  
**1:29:11-1:29:13:**  until the trees are established.  
**1:29:13-1:29:17:**  After that I don't need any more chemicals.  
**1:29:17-1:29:25:**  So how long do you need to have your trees clean at the base?  
**1:29:25-1:29:34:**  It depends on the species but three to seven years, minimum of three years, maximum of  
**1:29:34-1:29:36:**  seven years.  
**1:29:36-1:29:42:**  Chestnuts have higher needs than pow-pows, for example, of a clean base.  
**1:29:42-1:29:44:**  Just understand.  
**1:29:44-1:29:47:**  It depends on where they're being grown.  
**1:29:47-1:29:53:**  Pow-pows planted under the shade of chestnut trees, for example, can get by without any  
**1:29:53-1:30:01:**  weed control at all because the shade limits the other competition without limiting the  
**1:30:01-1:30:12:**  pow-pows but species that do require full sun do have to have some kind of weed control.  
**1:30:12-1:30:19:**  You're just wasting your time trying to grow these trees without weed control.  
**1:30:19-1:30:22:**  Wasting time and wasting money, wasting labor.  
**1:30:22-1:30:31:**  We just talked to a person that was advocating, and we've heard this many times in our podcast  
**1:30:31-1:30:38:**  actually, advocating for using woodchips because they do add an extra cost but they also add  
**1:30:38-1:30:46:**  an extra growth to the tree which compensates for the cost because you have earlier production,  
**1:30:46-1:30:48:**  higher growth, etc.  
**1:30:48-1:30:52:**  I do suspect that it depends on your soil conditions as well.  
**1:30:52-1:30:58:**  If you have more difficult soil, you may need to give it more organic matter amendments  
**1:30:58-1:31:04:**  and organic matter to initially transform the soil whereas if you have a very good soil,  
**1:31:04-1:31:10:**  you may be able to put it off with, for example, less investment in fertility.  
**1:31:10-1:31:14:**  I'm interested, have you used woodchips as mulch?  
**1:31:14-1:31:22:**  Solely woodchips, not tarp, not any fabric in which it's on top, just woodchips?  
**1:31:22-1:31:29:**  Whenever I have used mountains of woodchips, before I started using oust, I used woodchips  
**1:31:29-1:31:33:**  but always with landscape fabric.  
**1:31:33-1:31:37:**  The woodchips by themselves are not effective weed control.  
**1:31:37-1:31:42:**  The weeds will grow right through the woodchips.  
**1:31:42-1:31:44:**  I always use landscape fabric.  
**1:31:44-1:31:52:**  Also, the woodchips will rob nitrogen from the soil and actually slow the tree's growth.  
**1:31:52-1:31:57:**  Providing that barrier in between the woodchips and the soil surface will prevent the woodchips  
**1:31:57-1:32:03:**  from robbing the nitrogen from the soil and slowing the tree's growth.  
**1:32:03-1:32:08:**  The answer to your question is no, I never use woodchips alone.  
**1:32:08-1:32:10:**  I would not consider doing that.  
**1:32:10-1:32:14:**  Okay, fantastic.  
**1:32:14-1:32:23:**  Tom, we're going to stop here because I want to be not too disrespectful of your time.  
**1:32:23-1:32:29:**  We've gone on for a good hour and 40 minutes now, so I think it's...  
**1:32:29-1:32:36:**  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us and for a fantastic interview.  
**1:32:36-1:32:38:**  It was really interesting.

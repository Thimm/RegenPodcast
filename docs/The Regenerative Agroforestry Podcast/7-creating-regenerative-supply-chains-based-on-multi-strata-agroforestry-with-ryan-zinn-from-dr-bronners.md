### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:10:23)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:46:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:46-0:00:49:**  Hi everyone and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:49-0:00:52:**  We're your hosts Etienne and Dimitri.  
**0:00:52-0:00:58:**  Today we're super happy to share with you an interview with Ryan Zinn from Dr Bronner.  
**0:00:58-0:01:04:**  Dr Bronner is actually one of the first companies to implement the regenerative organic certification  
**0:01:04-0:01:09:**  and they're really pioneers in transitioning agricultural systems towards more regenerative  
**0:01:09-0:01:12:**  practices through their supply chains.  
**0:01:12-0:01:16:**  And it's great because we're able to talk about this aspect with Ryan on a more like  
**0:01:16-0:01:23:**  global supply chain business level but we're also able to really get an insight on his  
**0:01:23-0:01:27:**  work on the field with smallholders and it's a really great way of understanding how agroforestry  
**0:01:27-0:01:32:**  works out in a totally different context across the world.  
**0:01:32-0:01:36:**  I think that Ryan shares with us some really important tips that we can also use in our  
**0:01:36-0:01:42:**  context in terms of how to manage diversity on the farms and this is you know a big topic  
**0:01:42-0:01:45:**  that we've already touched upon with many of the farmers and practitioners that we've  
**0:01:45-0:01:51:**  interviewed and so he shows to us how he's using infrastructure and the importance of  
**0:01:51-0:01:57:**  infrastructure that enables the farmers that they're working with to provide their supply  
**0:01:57-0:02:00:**  chains to diversify their farms.  
**0:02:00-0:02:04:**  And so again this links you know diversity with infrastructure and he's giving us some  
**0:02:04-0:02:08:**  practical info as to how they're making that work in their fields with the smallholder  
**0:02:08-0:02:14:**  farmers so it was really exciting to talk to Ryan and we hope that you enjoy the interview.  
**0:02:14-0:02:16:**  Hi Ryan, welcome to the podcast.  
**0:02:16-0:02:19:**  Thank you so much for having me, this is great.  
**0:02:19-0:02:25:**  Could we start maybe with an introduction of who you are and how you got into agroforestry?  
**0:02:25-0:02:31:**  Absolutely my name is Ryan Zinn and I work for an organic and fair trade soap company  
**0:02:31-0:02:37:**  based in the United States, Dr. Bronner's and Dr. Bronner's is really I would say a  
**0:02:37-0:02:44:**  pioneer in the space in that we've developed vertically integrated supply chains all over  
**0:02:44-0:02:49:**  the world to supply our raw materials and really our goal was to establish organic and  
**0:02:49-0:02:54:**  fair trade raw raw material supply chains and as luck would have it the vast majority  
**0:02:54-0:02:58:**  of our raw materials come from perennial or agroforestry systems.  
**0:02:58-0:03:05:**  I actually got started in agroforestry in the late 1990s when I worked in southern Mexico  
**0:03:05-0:03:10:**  at the time of one of the heights of the the Chiapas conflict where I would work with coffee  
**0:03:10-0:03:14:**  farmers and I was exposed to agroforestry in all of its different forms and there I  
**0:03:14-0:03:20:**  really became quite a big fan I would say of agroforestry as a technique and really  
**0:03:20-0:03:26:**  as an organizing concept for rural communities and it was there in working with coffee farmers  
**0:03:26-0:03:31:**  that I really began to learn and understand more of agroforestry systems as an organizing  
**0:03:31-0:03:32:**  concept.  
**0:03:32-0:03:37:**  And to set the scene could you tell us a bit why Dr. Bronner would you know why such a  
**0:03:37-0:03:43:**  company would get involved with regenerative agriculture in general and with agroforestry  
**0:03:43-0:03:45:**  as well?  
**0:03:45-0:03:49:**  Well that's a great question you know one of the things that happened with Dr. Bronner's  
**0:03:49-0:03:55:**  as a you know really kind of a small in what we call in the US like a counterculture company  
**0:03:55-0:04:02:**  in that it was vegan it was primarily you know the Castile soap and it had a very small  
**0:04:02-0:04:08:**  niche consumer base but about 15 to 20 years ago the family decided to make the decision  
**0:04:08-0:04:14:**  to transition all raw materials and we're talking about you know coconut oil primarily  
**0:04:14-0:04:19:**  but also palm oil, olive oil and some essential oils like mint oil and lavender oil all too  
**0:04:19-0:04:24:**  organic and this is at the time when the national organic standard here in the United States  
**0:04:24-0:04:29:**  was really beginning to take off and so as do many companies you know particularly in  
**0:04:29-0:04:35:**  the US and some in Europe you end up by you know most of your raw materials from brokers  
**0:04:35-0:04:40:**  or intermediaries and this is a good way to start your business because it allows you  
**0:04:40-0:04:45:**  to not invest so much capital in developing supply chains but what the the Bronner family  
**0:04:45-0:04:50:**  quickly realized was that despite the fact that you will have like this organic certificate  
**0:04:50-0:04:56:**  to accompany these raw materials you really have no idea about the integrity of the product  
**0:04:56-0:05:02:**  there's always risk of fraud and adulteration and then similarly you have really no idea  
**0:05:02-0:05:08:**  about the you know the livelihood of the farmers and the farm workers on the ground and so  
**0:05:08-0:05:13:**  our goal was to then find organic and fair trade supply chains but what we quickly found  
**0:05:13-0:05:19:**  was that there was in fact no certified fair trade palm oil for example or no certified  
**0:05:19-0:05:25:**  fair trade coconut oil and so as a result the Bronner family made this wild decision  
**0:05:25-0:05:31:**  to actually set up and invest in vertically integrated supply chains and so our first  
**0:05:31-0:05:35:**  organic and fair trade coconut oil project was in Sri Lanka and that was set up about  
**0:05:35-0:05:42:**  15 years ago and since coconut oil really is the backbone of the vast majority of our  
**0:05:42-0:05:48:**  products from there we really began to expand out you know our product line as well as our  
**0:05:48-0:05:53:**  supply chains and so since then we've expanded out on a number of agroforestry projects that  
**0:05:53-0:05:58:**  we've either set up ourselves in partnership with smallholder farmers or we work really  
**0:05:58-0:06:04:**  closely with third-party suppliers that have the same values and ethics that we do so right  
**0:06:04-0:06:09:**  now we've got a number of vertically integrated supply chains that we basically own and operate  
**0:06:09-0:06:16:**  in partnership with small farmers all around the world in Sri Lanka, Ghana, Samoa and in  
**0:06:16-0:06:20:**  India and then we work really closely with other third-party suppliers in places like  
**0:06:20-0:06:26:**  Palestine, Brazil, Paraguay and Ecuador.  
**0:06:26-0:06:31:**  And what's your role exactly in this whole organization then and all these events?  
**0:06:31-0:06:36:**  Yeah that's a good question you know one of the things you realize very quickly when you  
**0:06:36-0:06:41:**  work on the ground all over the world is that what you have in your job title doesn't always  
**0:06:41-0:06:47:**  necessarily you know go along with what the reality is on the ground so you know primarily  
**0:06:47-0:06:53:**  my focus is on designing systems, regenerative systems whether that's perennial and agroforestry  
**0:06:53-0:06:57:**  systems or that's more annual systems for essential oils like in the places like India  
**0:06:57-0:07:03:**  and the idea is that we want to support and accompany small farmers and you know really  
**0:07:03-0:07:07:**  one of the biggest challenges for small farmers all around the world is in many cases not  
**0:07:07-0:07:11:**  so much the practices themselves a lot of small farmers are pretty regenerative in their  
**0:07:11-0:07:16:**  practices out of necessity but they face a lot of challenges in getting their products  
**0:07:16-0:07:20:**  to market and actually being compensated fairly for what they produce.  
**0:07:20-0:07:25:**  So from our perspective that is to support or actually set up the infrastructure and  
**0:07:25-0:07:30:**  facilities to get their raw materials to market so that might be setting up like oil mills  
**0:07:30-0:07:35:**  for example in Ghana and Sri Lanka and in Samoa or it might be figuring out other ways  
**0:07:35-0:07:41:**  for farmers to diversify their production so that they can have a stable livelihood.  
**0:07:41-0:07:44:**  You know one of the things that we've noticed you know over the course of our journey the  
**0:07:44-0:07:50:**  last 15 years is you know our progression generally is to get farmers as we say in the  
**0:07:50-0:07:55:**  door in English you know we want to be able to give them an organic premium that reflects  
**0:07:55-0:07:58:**  all of the sort of investment that the farmers are doing.  
**0:07:58-0:08:02:**  We want to make sure that the payments are you know categorized and certified as fair  
**0:08:02-0:08:06:**  trade so that gets the farmers kind of on that first step but really you know despite  
**0:08:06-0:08:11:**  the fact that they're receiving a fair payment for let's say palm you know their palm fruit  
**0:08:11-0:08:18:**  in Ghana the reality is that farmers need to really diversify not only to create climate  
**0:08:18-0:08:22:**  resilient systems on the farm but also to be really economically resilient.  
**0:08:22-0:08:27:**  So what we want to do is make sure that we have pathways for farmers to market other  
**0:08:27-0:08:33:**  crops that quite frankly you know Dr. Bronner's will actually never use things like cassava  
**0:08:33-0:08:40:**  or taro or turmeric or cocoa for example and so our goal is to utilize sort of the framework  
**0:08:40-0:08:45:**  and the infrastructure that we have set up in these communities to be able to develop  
**0:08:45-0:08:51:**  markets and opportunities for farmers to be able to sell their products either at a premium  
**0:08:51-0:08:56:**  to importing countries in Europe and the United States or to actually distribute locally so  
**0:08:56-0:09:01:**  that way local communities can actually have access to really organic regenerative and  
**0:09:01-0:09:02:**  healthy food.  
**0:09:02-0:09:07:**  We'll definitely come back to a lot of these things you just introduced to us but first  
**0:09:07-0:09:12:**  we wanted to really have a clear idea of what your projects look on the ground and this  
**0:09:12-0:09:14:**  is where Dimitri is going to take over from me.  
**0:09:14-0:09:21:**  Yeah we were very curious as to what the designs look like on the ground when you're working  
**0:09:21-0:09:23:**  with these farmers.  
**0:09:23-0:09:28:**  Really so I should say you know the designs really vary by kind of country by country  
**0:09:28-0:09:35:**  community by community whereas in the South Pacific and the Polynesian indigenous culture  
**0:09:35-0:09:41:**  really has this deep history in agroforestry that you know is very vibrant to this day.  
**0:09:41-0:09:45:**  Other countries have different experiences so I'll talk a little bit about Ghana because  
**0:09:45-0:09:49:**  that's a good example of you know what we see as maybe a composite experience and so  
**0:09:49-0:09:56:**  you know a lot of countries and smallholders particularly have gotten a lot of bad information  
**0:09:56-0:10:01:**  and education from let's say government extension agents or in many cases even agrochemical  
**0:10:01-0:10:06:**  companies that really focus on building these you know monoculture systems.  
**0:10:06-0:10:09:**  They say you know even though you've got three to four hectares you should just plant oil  
**0:10:09-0:10:11:**  palm and that's it.  
**0:10:11-0:10:16:**  And so there's a lot of like you know bad history and bad experiences really over the  
**0:10:16-0:10:21:**  last you know couple of decades and so part of our goal is to be able to provide a pathway  
**0:10:21-0:10:23:**  for farmers to convert.  
**0:10:23-0:10:29:**  So you know when you look at your sort of average farmer in the eastern region of Ghana  
**0:10:29-0:10:34:**  you know in general what they have are sort of like a mosaic approach to production.  
**0:10:34-0:10:39:**  So they may dedicate you know one or two you know one to five hectares to oil palm for  
**0:10:39-0:10:45:**  example one to five hectares to really densely planted cocoa and then maybe a hectare or  
**0:10:45-0:10:49:**  two for home production you know some type of maize and pumpkin system.  
**0:10:49-0:10:55:**  And you know as farmers begin to replant over the course of you know the lifetime of their  
**0:10:55-0:11:01:**  cocoa or palm plantations our goal is to then jump in with opportunities both with training  
**0:11:01-0:11:06:**  but also capital and resources to be able to create a diversified system.  
**0:11:06-0:11:11:**  So in this particular case our goal really is to in cooperation with farmers is to figure  
**0:11:11-0:11:15:**  out hey look what is it that you want to produce for a cash crop.  
**0:11:15-0:11:20:**  You know as Dr. Bronner's and our project in Ghana will buy you know all of the oil  
**0:11:20-0:11:22:**  palm that they can produce.  
**0:11:22-0:11:26:**  But similarly it's important for them to have a diversified income for other opportunities  
**0:11:26-0:11:31:**  things like cocoa for example which is another important cash crop for West Africa.  
**0:11:31-0:11:37:**  So our goal is to look at a given farm will place it basically on a grid and a consultation  
**0:11:37-0:11:41:**  with the farmers will come up with a plan and generally this includes a combination  
**0:11:41-0:11:44:**  of multi strata species right.  
**0:11:44-0:11:48:**  So first of all we want to make sure that there is enough both biomass species whether  
**0:11:48-0:11:55:**  those are perennial ground covers like praeria which provides enough ground cover biomass  
**0:11:55-0:11:57:**  and nitrogen fixing elements.  
**0:11:57-0:12:02:**  We also want to make sure that there are you know tall timber trees that can be used either  
**0:12:02-0:12:05:**  as fuel wood or also just basically you know as shade.  
**0:12:05-0:12:09:**  You know one of the challenges in West Africa particularly with cocoa is that you know much  
**0:12:09-0:12:15:**  of it is really densely planted and there's actually no shade in many cases.  
**0:12:15-0:12:20:**  And farmers have been sort of taught by you know agrochemical and extension agents that  
**0:12:20-0:12:24:**  you know if you plant shade in a cocoa plantation you're going to lose production which is quite  
**0:12:24-0:12:25:**  the opposite.  
**0:12:25-0:12:29:**  And they actually deal with quite a bit more pest pressure if they don't have any shade.  
**0:12:29-0:12:33:**  So what we want to do is make sure that there's a combination of cash crops.  
**0:12:33-0:12:39:**  So in this particular case it's cocoa and oil palm that there is enough fruit trees  
**0:12:39-0:12:44:**  that are able to sort of round out their local food basket in the economy.  
**0:12:44-0:12:47:**  And then we also look at a number of other sort of opportunistic crops and whether that  
**0:12:47-0:12:54:**  might be in succession things like beans and maize and pumpkins for example or some what  
**0:12:54-0:12:59:**  we call maybe more midterm crops which would include things like cassava taro or what they  
**0:12:59-0:13:02:**  call cocoa yam in Ghana and other species.  
**0:13:02-0:13:08:**  And so our goal really is to create a system that reflects nature but is organized and  
**0:13:08-0:13:15:**  I would say optimized in a certain way that after establishment really takes farmer you  
**0:13:15-0:13:19:**  know labor down to the most minimal other than for pruning and harvesting.  
**0:13:19-0:13:23:**  But then actually it sort of creates the sort of it sort of maximizes their production in  
**0:13:23-0:13:28:**  a way that I think is really important because right now you know truthfully you know there's  
**0:13:28-0:13:31:**  just not enough production for farmers to actually make a living.  
**0:13:31-0:13:35:**  So it's really quite shocking that farmers continue to farm despite the fact that it's  
**0:13:35-0:13:39:**  quite difficult to say nothing of sort of the climatic challenges that they're facing  
**0:13:39-0:13:40:**  as well.  
**0:13:40-0:13:44:**  So really our goal is to come up with a system that both reflects their own abilities you  
**0:13:44-0:13:48:**  know what they have in terms of labor for example what they want to do in terms of their  
**0:13:48-0:13:55:**  production of cash crops whether that's you know a cocoa dominated system or a oil palm  
**0:13:55-0:14:00:**  dominated system but make sure that there's the right balance of shade trees for example  
**0:14:00-0:14:06:**  enough biomass species to actually keep the fertility in the system is going and enough  
**0:14:06-0:14:09:**  income and food during the succession period.  
**0:14:09-0:14:15:**  So in most cases you know cocoa and oil palm really won't begin to mature and produce efficiently  
**0:14:15-0:14:20:**  for a decent income till about you know depending on the species or the varieties I should say  
**0:14:20-0:14:23:**  you know about five years since we want to make sure that there's enough income in the  
**0:14:23-0:14:30:**  system for farmers and as a result that means that we would maybe lean focus and focus primarily  
**0:14:30-0:14:36:**  on things like cassava sort of in that lower strata you know early cycle crops to be able  
**0:14:36-0:14:40:**  to actually make sure that there's income and you know I think one thing that's important  
**0:14:40-0:14:45:**  to realize is that you know I've seen all of these amazing you know designs for centropic  
**0:14:45-0:14:49:**  agriculture and you know diversified agroforestry systems and I think they're all fantastic  
**0:14:49-0:14:54:**  because you know conceptually you know they're an amazing approach to try to replicate nature  
**0:14:54-0:14:58:**  they can sequester carbon they can do all these things but without really the infrastructure  
**0:14:58-0:15:03:**  in place to be able to accommodate the system it becomes really difficult for farmers so  
**0:15:03-0:15:07:**  there's no sense in you know growing you know cassava and turmeric and ginger and all these  
**0:15:07-0:15:11:**  other crops in the early cycles if you have no place to sell them.  
**0:15:11-0:15:16:**  So really our goal is to find opportunities either to process them locally and distribute  
**0:15:16-0:15:21:**  nationally in Ghana or to process and then export so that farmers can actually receive  
**0:15:21-0:15:28:**  a premium and I should just say you know one of our experiences in Samoa has been really  
**0:15:28-0:15:33:**  interesting you know we planted a fair amount of papaya in some of their early trials and  
**0:15:33-0:15:38:**  what we ended up with was just too much papaya I mean it was just like you know pretty wildly  
**0:15:38-0:15:43:**  everybody was sick of eating papaya by the end of the by the end of the year so we want  
**0:15:43-0:15:48:**  to do is to be dynamic and flexible enough to meet the needs of farmers and then to be  
**0:15:48-0:15:54:**  able to accommodate any surplus or other crops that can actually generate income for farmers  
**0:15:54-0:15:58:**  so I apologize if that was a little bit long-winded but that's that's kind of a rougher approach  
**0:15:58-0:16:02:**  to do how we think about the systems.  
**0:16:02-0:16:08:**  That's um no it's been a very elaborate and interesting description but in all of this  
**0:16:08-0:16:13:**  description you haven't really mentioned or you haven't talked about what the farmers  
**0:16:13-0:16:18:**  produce for Dr. Bronner right it really seems that you're helping the farmers before you're  
**0:16:18-0:16:21:**  trying to make sure they produce for Dr. Bronner where does where does Dr. Bronner come into  
**0:16:21-0:16:28:**  here are you making sure that their cash crop is is as part of your supply chain?  
**0:16:28-0:16:34:**  Absolutely so in in Ghana particular case you know our we have a mill in the eastern  
**0:16:34-0:16:40:**  region that processes palm fruit oil palm and so all of that palm oil is really critical  
**0:16:40-0:16:47:**  for like bar soap right because of the the fatty acid composition and so our focus there  
**0:16:47-0:16:52:**  as farmers begin to replant is to make sure that there is sufficient palm oil in the system  
**0:16:52-0:16:58:**  that they can continue to supply us but also that there's enough other crops that are will  
**0:16:58-0:17:02:**  kind of reduce the overhead of farmers as well so we basically take on all of their  
**0:17:02-0:17:06:**  palm oil that we can and right now what we're trying to figure out is where do we prioritize  
**0:17:06-0:17:13:**  next in terms of facilitating you know post-harvest you know manufacturing or processing and so  
**0:17:13-0:17:17:**  right now I think where we're landing on is primarily things like cocoa because that's  
**0:17:17-0:17:22:**  a big challenge for farmers to fetch a fair price there and especially to convert to organic  
**0:17:22-0:17:27:**  is a big challenge in West Africa and then also finding other opportunities but you know  
**0:17:27-0:17:32:**  to be honest at the end end Dimitri this is important you know in a way because we could  
**0:17:32-0:17:38:**  probably continue on and you know buy you know monocultured organic and fair trade oil  
**0:17:38-0:17:43:**  palm really long term there's two things that really worry me from just a strictly business  
**0:17:43-0:17:50:**  perspective one you know the economics of smallholder agriculture is just not so favorable  
**0:17:50-0:17:55:**  that that young generations are actually looking to go farm in most cases they look at their  
**0:17:55-0:17:58:**  experience of their parents and they're saying hey look this doesn't make sense for me to  
**0:17:58-0:18:04:**  continue on if it's going to be hard work and very little return so we want to create  
**0:18:04-0:18:09:**  a system where it is rewarding for young farmers and is attractive enough for them to continue  
**0:18:09-0:18:14:**  to farm because if they don't farm then we don't have a business and then similarly you  
**0:18:14-0:18:18:**  know as we're seeing you know at virtually all of our projects there is some type of  
**0:18:18-0:18:26:**  climate impact whether it is you know various fluctuations in degrees it could be extended  
**0:18:26-0:18:31:**  droughts or rains or it could be things like you know typhoons and tornadoes and hurricanes  
**0:18:31-0:18:36:**  that you know really impact the farm's production and so what we want to do is to make sure  
**0:18:36-0:18:42:**  that we have a climate resilient system built in that actually safeguards not only the farmer's  
**0:18:42-0:18:48:**  livelihood but you know quite frankly ours as well. And at the moment these plots or  
**0:18:48-0:18:52:**  these tests and these different designs to what scale are you able to deploy them are  
**0:18:52-0:18:57:**  you just testing them out on test sites or are you already deploying that through the  
**0:18:57-0:19:04:**  supply chain? So it really depends by country so in the particular case of Samoa we just  
**0:19:04-0:19:10:**  wrapped up a project that was actually funded through the World Bank interestingly enough  
**0:19:10-0:19:15:**  that was focused primarily on you know climate change adaptation which is a big challenge  
**0:19:15-0:19:23:**  in the South Pacific and there we planted upwards of about 350 hectares of diversified  
**0:19:23-0:19:29:**  multi strata agroforestry systems with 500 farmer families. So that was our first step  
**0:19:29-0:19:35:**  in terms of replanting portions of their farm so the farms in Samoa for example tend to  
**0:19:35-0:19:40:**  be quite a bit bigger anywhere between 10 to 50 hectares and so what we wanted to do  
**0:19:40-0:19:46:**  was start I would say small and have farmers dedicated about three hectares of production  
**0:19:46-0:19:53:**  to really intense you know diversified agroforestry systems as a jumping off point. But overall  
**0:19:53-0:19:57:**  when you work with that many farmer families then you end up with you know decent number  
**0:19:57-0:20:02:**  of hectares. In the particular case of Ghana it's a little bit slower because you know  
**0:20:02-0:20:08:**  farmers as they look at new technologies generally they're not going to commit their entire production  
**0:20:08-0:20:12:**  to a new technology they may not have much experience with. So our approach there has  
**0:20:12-0:20:17:**  been a little bit different. We started several years back with a few pilot farms that we  
**0:20:17-0:20:22:**  owned and managed to be used as trading sites and then with a handful of our own staff and  
**0:20:22-0:20:27:**  some real key farmers to be able to begin to plant these different models on their own  
**0:20:27-0:20:33:**  land and now moving forward we're looking to expand that out quite significantly with  
**0:20:33-0:20:37:**  you know dozens of farmers and you know many hectares of land to be able to expand that  
**0:20:37-0:20:42:**  model out. And I should say you know we've got basic principles that we would like to  
**0:20:42-0:20:47:**  see implemented you know that means that there's diversification certainly that there is a  
**0:20:47-0:20:53:**  biomass and fertility cycling through the system and then shade certainly needs to be  
**0:20:53-0:20:58:**  a priority particularly in West Africa. But from there you know farmers may choose this  
**0:20:58-0:21:02:**  you know sort of whatever crop mix that most suits them well. You know we don't want to  
**0:21:02-0:21:06:**  take that away necessarily from them but really make sure that you know in case of Ghana oil  
**0:21:06-0:21:12:**  palm is really kind of at the core. And then you know right now we're in the process of  
**0:21:12-0:21:19:**  designing a few pilots in India primarily with fodder species. You know there's a big  
**0:21:19-0:21:24:**  challenge there in terms of both biomass and fertility. And while the farmers that we work  
**0:21:24-0:21:30:**  with grow annual crops primarily usually a rotation of mint some type of staple grain  
**0:21:30-0:21:37:**  or rice and then any combination of leguminous crops or other types of crops. One of the  
**0:21:37-0:21:43:**  things we notice is that for the dairy and the cattle population is that they have very  
**0:21:43-0:21:48:**  poor quality pasture and really have very little nutrition. And so the idea would be  
**0:21:48-0:21:54:**  then to create a number of fodder banks where farmers could actually grow perennial fodder  
**0:21:54-0:22:00:**  species that can supplement or be the primary feed source for their livestock. And then  
**0:22:00-0:22:06:**  lastly in Sri Lanka because the vast majority of production there usually goes hand in hand  
**0:22:06-0:22:11:**  with dairy cows and pasture. We're looking at different ways to actually improve both  
**0:22:11-0:22:15:**  the pasture quality which is a big challenge in some tropical countries. But then like  
**0:22:15-0:22:21:**  I said create systems that really capitalize on perennial fodder systems that will take  
**0:22:21-0:22:28:**  some of the pressure off of the ground cover and perhaps actually allow for farmers to  
**0:22:28-0:22:33:**  intensify their dairy herds by having better quality perennial fodder available for their  
**0:22:33-0:22:36:**  farmers.  
**0:22:36-0:22:43:**  This is a huge diversity clearly a huge diversity of expertise that's needed to consult and  
**0:22:43-0:22:47:**  help the farmers with all these systems. So where do you get your knowledge from?  
**0:22:47-0:22:53:**  Well that's a great question. So we are likely to have a great combination of local expertise  
**0:22:53-0:23:03:**  on the ground. Each project has its share of local technicians and field officers that  
**0:23:03-0:23:09:**  is required out of both our approach but also the organic standards required that we provide  
**0:23:09-0:23:13:**  training. So we hire local staffers to be able to do that and be able to implement these  
**0:23:13-0:23:19:**  programs in collaboration with farmers. And then we've also worked with a couple of great  
**0:23:19-0:23:24:**  consultants and technicians that have a lot of deep history and knowledge in the agroforestry  
**0:23:24-0:23:31:**  world. And so one of our primary partners is an organization based out of Bolivia which  
**0:23:31-0:23:36:**  is called Ecotop. And so they've emerged really I think probably out of the same school of  
**0:23:36-0:23:42:**  Ernst Gottsch and those folks in the centropic agricultural system. And so we try to balance  
**0:23:42-0:23:48:**  out a combination of sort of international consultants and our own expertise with that  
**0:23:48-0:23:54:**  of local technicians to make sure that what we're proposing actually makes sense and it  
**0:23:54-0:23:59:**  has a greater likelihood of survival. Once you have this knowledge how do you make  
**0:23:59-0:24:02:**  sure that it really responds to the needs of the local farmers? I understand you have  
**0:24:02-0:24:07:**  a lot of local partners but what is the process for getting those ideas out there and those  
**0:24:07-0:24:10:**  techniques? That is a great question. So you know I'll  
**0:24:10-0:24:17:**  use probably our example in Samoa is one of our sort of like best test cases. So you know  
**0:24:17-0:24:23:**  early on we've done a number of surveys with a small sample of farmers to understand really  
**0:24:23-0:24:28:**  kind of like what their priorities are and what their plans are. So that gives us a base  
**0:24:28-0:24:33:**  of knowledge that's really really important because if we come up with a crazy idea you  
**0:24:33-0:24:37:**  know from internationals or from the Europe or the United States then they just look at  
**0:24:37-0:24:42:**  us like we're totally crazy. And then the other aspect is that you know farmers all  
**0:24:42-0:24:46:**  over the world they get all these proposals all the time that you know somebody comes  
**0:24:46-0:24:51:**  in and says hey look we want to buy you know whatever you know 50 tons of cassava or something  
**0:24:51-0:24:56:**  and then they never show up. So farmers are generally pretty I would say cautious in many  
**0:24:56-0:25:01:**  cases in terms of you know developing commercial relationships. So I would say first off it's  
**0:25:01-0:25:07:**  really important for you know commercial partners to have deep roots and be really committed  
**0:25:07-0:25:10:**  with the communities that they're working with. If you don't have that sort of relationship  
**0:25:10-0:25:15:**  and trust built in the chances of actually developing these systems is really really  
**0:25:15-0:25:20:**  limited. And then from there you know it's a consultation process where we determine  
**0:25:20-0:25:24:**  with each individual farmer you know aside from those things that are really core to  
**0:25:24-0:25:30:**  the project like biomass and shade species you know what do they like to produce and  
**0:25:30-0:25:35:**  where do they see the biggest business opportunity in addition to what they supply for Dr. Bronner's.  
**0:25:35-0:25:40:**  And they basically choose those crop species themselves and that in a way really empowers  
**0:25:40-0:25:46:**  farmers to make those choices. And then we generally start relatively small primarily  
**0:25:46-0:25:52:**  through training. So what we've done is create a number of pilot test farms that act as outdoor  
**0:25:52-0:25:58:**  classrooms for farmers. And you know one of the things that we talk a lot about in you  
**0:25:58-0:26:03:**  know farmer extension is to say you know show don't tell. You know farmers A would like  
**0:26:03-0:26:08:**  to see with their own eyes how the system works. They don't want to see a video. They  
**0:26:08-0:26:11:**  don't want to hear you talk about it in a classroom. They actually want to go into the  
**0:26:11-0:26:18:**  field and see what it looks like. So we established a number of pilots there to be able to really  
**0:26:18-0:26:23:**  demonstrate the technique but also really the potential. You know there's a lot of myths  
**0:26:23-0:26:28:**  you know that you come across sometimes in working in rural communities all over the  
**0:26:28-0:26:33:**  world. And so a lot of times there's sort of fear that species might be competing with  
**0:26:33-0:26:38:**  each other or there's not enough water or you know those types of things that are quite  
**0:26:38-0:26:42:**  common. So what we want to do is actually demonstrate that you know these diversified  
**0:26:42-0:26:49:**  systems really you know many cases planted very closely in terms of the spacing not only  
**0:26:49-0:26:54:**  you know work together you know in many cases but actually can actually produce quite a  
**0:26:54-0:26:58:**  bit more. And so that I think is something that's really important for farmers. And then  
**0:26:58-0:27:04:**  secondly you know our goal as you know trainers in many cases is to draw out some of that  
**0:27:04-0:27:07:**  traditional knowledge that farmers already have. You know I'll be honest I've been to  
**0:27:07-0:27:12:**  some farms you know all over the world that you know go far and above of what I've ever  
**0:27:12-0:27:17:**  expected as far as you know really diversified agroforestry systems. And so it's really working  
**0:27:17-0:27:22:**  with those farmers to really highlight their experience because you know as an outsider  
**0:27:22-0:27:26:**  farmers you know are less likely to trust me than they might you know their neighbor  
**0:27:26-0:27:30:**  for example. And so our goal is to really you know find those those farmers that are  
**0:27:30-0:27:35:**  taking the lead and have some experience because when when farmers learn from their peers there's  
**0:27:35-0:27:41:**  a greater chance that you have you know better adoption. And then from there our goal is  
**0:27:41-0:27:45:**  to be able to monitor and accompany the farmers experience within the first couple of years  
**0:27:45-0:27:52:**  of establishment. So that means regular visits to a troubleshoot any problems that they might  
**0:27:52-0:27:59:**  have. You know we want to be able to monitor seedling mortality and see if there's any  
**0:27:59-0:28:03:**  reason why a given you know cropper species is in fact you know maybe dying you know at  
**0:28:03-0:28:09:**  a higher rate than others. And that requires us to have engagement on going with farmers.  
**0:28:09-0:28:15:**  And then the next step really is to monitor yields right. You want to see what is actually  
**0:28:15-0:28:20:**  being produced on the farm. And that requires a fair amount of note taking by farmers and  
**0:28:20-0:28:26:**  buyer field staff. But we want to be able to prove to say hey look not only is the system  
**0:28:26-0:28:32:**  more productive but potentially over time it will actually be less labor. Because our  
**0:28:32-0:28:36:**  sort of experience at least my experience is that once you have an established and relatively  
**0:28:36-0:28:42:**  mature system in place it actually reduces your labor costs quite a bit. Whether that  
**0:28:42-0:28:45:**  is contractors you have to buy you know you know purchase through the neighborhood or  
**0:28:45-0:28:49:**  that's your own time. We want to make sure that we actually reduce those labor costs.  
**0:28:49-0:28:53:**  But to get there you have to kind of go through this establishment phase which can be a little  
**0:28:53-0:28:58:**  bit tough because it's generally more work at the early stages. But overall you know  
**0:28:58-0:29:03:**  one of our goals is for farmers to keep this basically what we call like a farm diary.  
**0:29:03-0:29:07:**  And that allows for them to you know make sure that they are recording everything that  
**0:29:07-0:29:12:**  they're doing whether it is labor, species you know that are performing well or maybe  
**0:29:12-0:29:17:**  not performing well. Or in some cases you know we want to see what the production looks  
**0:29:17-0:29:24:**  like. Ideally we don't want to sacrifice a farmer's income for having a beautiful you  
**0:29:24-0:29:28:**  know food forest but doesn't necessarily do much for their income. There's no chance of  
**0:29:28-0:29:32:**  them continuing that on. We want to be able to monitor that going on. This actually allows  
**0:29:32-0:29:37:**  us to make decisions on the ground and make changes as needed. You know one of the things  
**0:29:37-0:29:46:**  that we did in Samoa was plant a huge variety of annual biomass species that would allow  
**0:29:46-0:29:51:**  for farmers to really build up that biomass and soil fertility in the first year during  
**0:29:51-0:29:55:**  establishment. And then what we found was that all of these invasive snails really like  
**0:29:55-0:29:59:**  these biomass species and so they went in and you know ate them all up and we had to  
**0:29:59-0:30:04:**  kind of come up with a different plan. But you know had we not been working with farmers  
**0:30:04-0:30:08:**  really closely we would never have known. You know I think too many you know planting  
**0:30:08-0:30:12:**  projects go in, they'll plant species and then they won't see farmers again you know  
**0:30:12-0:30:16:**  for another five years. And when they come back you know the system has not you know  
**0:30:16-0:30:22:**  worked well because they haven't really provided that monitoring and accompaniment.  
**0:30:22-0:30:27:**  You gave enough so much information it's fascinating. You know with the Massey farm and you know  
**0:30:27-0:30:32:**  me currently in Brazil etc. we have quite a lot of we have an understanding or let's  
**0:30:32-0:30:37:**  say we're quite familiar with the syntropic systems. And one of the critics of the system  
**0:30:37-0:30:42:**  of the syntropic systems is the labor cost that's involved with managing the system right.  
**0:30:42-0:30:47:**  I mean all this there's you know there's the chop and drop technique and it requires huge  
**0:30:47-0:30:53:**  labor interventions to manage you know even if it is five hectares it's a lot of labor.  
**0:30:53-0:30:59:**  And so I'm very interested to find out how did because you mentioned it now how did you  
**0:30:59-0:31:03:**  manage to and your farmers and all the teams that you're working with how did you manage  
**0:31:03-0:31:13:**  to reduce that need, reduce that labor requirement in this type of stratified biomass producing  
**0:31:13-0:31:20:**  tropical systems. Yeah that's a great point Dimitri. I think you know in general farmers  
**0:31:20-0:31:28:**  are a little hesitant in some cases to you know adopt this the service and tropic approach  
**0:31:28-0:31:35:**  for that same reason right. They see you know that their workload is multiplying exponentially.  
**0:31:35-0:31:40:**  And so really there's a couple of approaches that we've kind of looked at. One of the things  
**0:31:40-0:31:47:**  that we do when we evaluate a farmer for their suitability for a project like this is to  
**0:31:47-0:31:53:**  see how much family labor or contractors they have to be able to actually implement this  
**0:31:53-0:31:59:**  in their early stages. Certainly if there is a you know a farmer and all of his or her  
**0:31:59-0:32:04:**  children have now left the farm and they live in the city and it's just him by himself or  
**0:32:04-0:32:09:**  her by herself they're probably not a great candidate. So we want to start first and just  
**0:32:09-0:32:14:**  do an inventory to see what is available and you know what has been the recent experience.  
**0:32:14-0:32:19:**  And second we're looking at two things. One is to figure out how to best take advantage  
**0:32:19-0:32:26:**  of different technologies in particular implements and tools to be able to streamline that process.  
**0:32:26-0:32:32:**  So for example in Ghana you know they're you know sort of maintaining even just in the  
**0:32:32-0:32:38:**  palm monocultures with you know prairie cover cropping their you know hand labor is quite  
**0:32:38-0:32:44:**  expensive and you know quite time consuming. So we've been able to sort of work with local  
**0:32:44-0:32:51:**  contractors to substitute you know like electric or gasoline powered you know streamers or  
**0:32:51-0:32:57:**  brush cutters for the traditional machetes. And so as a result then that basically reduces  
**0:32:57-0:33:01:**  their workload and cost quite a bit. Though we're still looking at you know different  
**0:33:01-0:33:05:**  options as well. You know one of my favorite things to do is talk with other agroforestry  
**0:33:05-0:33:09:**  folks and figure out what tools are they using to do these types of things. And especially  
**0:33:09-0:33:14:**  kind of on the larger plantations you can actually use you know mechanized you know  
**0:33:14-0:33:20:**  weeders and brush cutters and things like that at a greater success rate. And then lastly  
**0:33:20-0:33:25:**  you know one of the things that we really tried to do is look at sort of this element  
**0:33:25-0:33:29:**  as a potential opportunity. You know one of the things that is a big challenge all over  
**0:33:29-0:33:35:**  the world is just you know unemployment especially for young people. And so potentially this  
**0:33:35-0:33:41:**  could be an opportunity for young people to actually be trained in the maintenance and  
**0:33:41-0:33:44:**  I would say probably a bigger challenge is the you know the tree pruning especially as  
**0:33:44-0:33:50:**  trees get quite tall it becomes a lot more challenging. And so we're hoping you know  
**0:33:50-0:33:56:**  as time goes on to be able to support teams of young contractors to be able to provide  
**0:33:56-0:34:02:**  these services but with tools and at a reasonable rate in the event that farmers take on a relatively  
**0:34:02-0:34:06:**  large you know plot of land that the plant in an agroforestry system but quite can't  
**0:34:06-0:34:11:**  manage it themselves. So you know I would say you know looking at those opportunities  
**0:34:11-0:34:16:**  might be one possible way to tackle this problem.  
**0:34:16-0:34:23:**  Have you found that it is worth investing in biomass tree producing species even if  
**0:34:23-0:34:27:**  you have to invest in all this pruning work?  
**0:34:27-0:34:31:**  I would say you know if you ask me I would say it's absolutely worth it. You know one  
**0:34:31-0:34:38:**  of the analogies I like to tell farmers it's as if you you know if you were to plant a  
**0:34:38-0:34:45:**  you know your grid or your plot and it was all just cash crop species it might look good  
**0:34:45-0:34:49:**  and you might have some decent production early on. But the reality is it's like having  
**0:34:49-0:34:54:**  a beautiful you know sports car like a Lamborghini but then putting in like very bad gas you  
**0:34:54-0:35:00:**  know. And so in the end you know you're not going to be performing optimally. And so that  
**0:35:00-0:35:06:**  you know sometimes makes sense for farmers. And I would say you know part of it is that  
**0:35:06-0:35:09:**  they have to kind of get over the hump of those first couple of years. And so we certainly  
**0:35:09-0:35:16:**  understand that. And we in fact try to come up with different alternatives for farmers  
**0:35:16-0:35:21:**  to sort of manage that you know in the event that they don't have sort of the labor available  
**0:35:21-0:35:25:**  or quite frankly sometimes they're quite old and so they're unable to do some of these  
**0:35:25-0:35:30:**  kind of more laborious things. So because the systems are relatively young I would say  
**0:35:30-0:35:36:**  less than five years it's really a little bit you know maybe early to say whether or  
**0:35:36-0:35:41:**  not farmers have totally adopted this process wholeheartedly. But certainly something that  
**0:35:41-0:35:45:**  we'll continue to monitor.  
**0:35:45-0:35:50:**  Because as the as the trees grow it's expected to have more work with the pruning right?  
**0:35:50-0:35:56:**  You might have less work with other types of you know initiation phase labor but you'll  
**0:35:56-0:36:02:**  have more work managing these biomass producing trees. Is that is that what you guys are expecting  
**0:36:02-0:36:04:**  to happen?  
**0:36:04-0:36:08:**  That's what we're anticipating. So I think there's two sort of you know concerns along  
**0:36:08-0:36:13:**  those lines. One certainly is the labor you know and that that is something that we can't  
**0:36:13-0:36:20:**  underestimate. And the second one is really you know a centropic or diversified agroforestry  
**0:36:20-0:36:27:**  system really requires much more engagement by the farmer than they might have done previously.  
**0:36:27-0:36:31:**  You know it's really easy if you're just growing a monoculture of coconuts you know with some  
**0:36:31-0:36:35:**  cattle and you know some you know sort of ground species you know cover crops you don't  
**0:36:35-0:36:41:**  have to worry about the timing of your pruning or harvesting as much. But as we look to incorporate  
**0:36:41-0:36:47:**  more biomass and shade species you know the timing of that pruning is really critical.  
**0:36:47-0:36:54:**  And if you don't actually prune according to the season you might have challenges with  
**0:36:54-0:36:59:**  you know sort of like ripening or maturing of your coco pods or your citrus or what have  
**0:36:59-0:37:05:**  you. So those are all things that need to be sort of continually trained. And I think  
**0:37:05-0:37:10:**  you know by providing enough incentives for farmers to continue to sort of maintain their  
**0:37:10-0:37:15:**  system hopefully we can have enough momentum that they'll continue on you know really with  
**0:37:15-0:37:17:**  this approach.  
**0:37:17-0:37:23:**  As you include more diversity in these systems are then the farmers able to sell this diversity?  
**0:37:23-0:37:29:**  Do they have the markets then to bring that produce to and actually sell it?  
**0:37:29-0:37:33:**  Yeah so that's an absolutely important point at the end. You know this is one of the things  
**0:37:33-0:37:37:**  as I mentioned before in Samoa we ended up with a whole bunch of papaya because that  
**0:37:37-0:37:43:**  was something that was gross relatively quickly in the establishment phase. But then farmers  
**0:37:43-0:37:47:**  end up with a whole bunch of papaya and no market. So really what we want to do is make  
**0:37:47-0:37:54:**  sure we have a good balance and then figure out how to best allocate that production.  
**0:37:54-0:37:59:**  So in most cases our goal is basically divided kind of what I call like three buckets or  
**0:37:59-0:38:05:**  three you know sort of categories. One Dr. Bronner's will take on all of their coconut  
**0:38:05-0:38:11:**  production or palm production or coco production to be able to process and then export with  
**0:38:11-0:38:17:**  an organic and fair trade premium. Second you have sort of these new emerging opportunity  
**0:38:17-0:38:24:**  crops which I would call like cassava, turmeric and ginger and others. And there we're in  
**0:38:24-0:38:29:**  the process of developing the infrastructure and the processing facilities to actually  
**0:38:29-0:38:36:**  accommodate that production and then to sell. So for example in Samoa we are going to build  
**0:38:36-0:38:43:**  a facility to manage the sort of harvesting cleaning and processing of ginger and turmeric  
**0:38:43-0:38:47:**  because that was one of the crops that we noticed that produces quite well in the first  
**0:38:47-0:38:52:**  couple of years and that could actually fetch a decent price internationally. And the same  
**0:38:52-0:38:58:**  thing for cassava in Ghana for example. We're in the process of building out that system  
**0:38:58-0:39:02:**  to be able to accommodate that production. And then lastly we want to make sure that  
**0:39:02-0:39:06:**  there's an opportunity for farmers to sell into their local markets or just have enough  
**0:39:06-0:39:11:**  food for their families. And so we're looking at a couple of different ways of accommodating  
**0:39:11-0:39:17:**  that. So for example in Ghana at the mill we have several hundred workers that work  
**0:39:17-0:39:22:**  at the mill and so we provide meals for them there and so our kitchen will then be able  
**0:39:22-0:39:27:**  to accommodate the farmers production and buy their produce to be able to prepare in  
**0:39:27-0:39:33:**  the kitchen itself. That's not a long term strategy as the system begins to develop and  
**0:39:33-0:39:38:**  expand but certainly we're looking at local marketplaces in urban areas to have access  
**0:39:38-0:39:43:**  to sort of fresh and regenerative products as well. So luckily we have a fantastic team  
**0:39:43-0:39:48:**  in Ghana who are already thinking about these things and have already discussed ways to  
**0:39:48-0:39:53:**  actually convey that produce to Accra to be able to sell in the local markets and to ensure  
**0:39:53-0:39:58:**  that there's enough income for farmers. But this is kind of an ongoing quest that we've  
**0:39:58-0:40:04:**  been dealing with because the reality is is without that incentive to have this diversified  
**0:40:04-0:40:10:**  system it's really difficult for farmers to commit this sort of time you know this investment  
**0:40:10-0:40:15:**  into a diversified system only for it to just sort of compost in the field. Yeah sure but  
**0:40:15-0:40:20:**  just to understand the extent to which Dr. Braun is involved if I understand you do provide  
**0:40:20-0:40:24:**  all this support in terms of infrastructure and transformation and getting the produce  
**0:40:24-0:40:29:**  to markets even on the ones that you weren't originally buying but where does that stop?  
**0:40:29-0:40:34:**  I mean is it just a kind of transition phase and then you would you'd hopefully have the  
**0:40:34-0:40:38:**  farmers manage that on their own? Is it then that once you've provided the infrastructure  
**0:40:38-0:40:44:**  you also actually buy that produce as Dr. Brauner? So you know one of the things that  
**0:40:44-0:40:51:**  we've found ourselves doing in the last couple of years is to get in the business of trading  
**0:40:51-0:40:56:**  so that means finding marketplaces at least internationally that farmers wouldn't be able  
**0:40:56-0:41:03:**  to do by themselves and so that means that engaging you know buyers whether that is you  
**0:41:03-0:41:11:**  know organic and fair trade and you know manufacturers in Europe or in the United States. And so  
**0:41:11-0:41:17:**  as a result what we'd like to do is sort of kickstart that process in so far as we can  
**0:41:17-0:41:22:**  be useful and provide a service. So you know our partners and project in India while we  
**0:41:22-0:41:27:**  buy all of the mint oil that we need for our soaps there they also produce a number of  
**0:41:27-0:41:32:**  other crops that are really really useful so they're now sending you know organic and  
**0:41:32-0:41:38:**  fair trade peanuts to Germany. They're also sending holy basil or Tulsi to a healthcare  
**0:41:38-0:41:44:**  company here in the United States and so where we can sort of facilitate and make those connections  
**0:41:44-0:41:48:**  that's really valuable right even though we don't necessarily benefit financially from  
**0:41:48-0:41:53:**  that it means that the projects themselves are much more stable and it reduces their  
**0:41:53-0:41:59:**  overhead and costs. So in a way it's kind of an indirect way for us to support the project  
**0:41:59-0:42:05:**  in farmers that we would not necessarily sort of you know capitalize it on ourselves. It's  
**0:42:05-0:42:11:**  kind of like the diversity in having to have diversity in the farms is obliging you also  
**0:42:11-0:42:17:**  to diversify your business in a way right? Yeah I mean that's a great point I think you  
**0:42:17-0:42:21:**  know it's you know our sort of journey I would say is like you know we thought it was really  
**0:42:21-0:42:26:**  just enough to be able to buy organic raw materials. We realized that wasn't enough  
**0:42:26-0:42:31:**  we needed more engagement with farmers and then as you see you know to actually run a  
**0:42:31-0:42:36:**  business and to stimulate and incentivize diversification you know you have to accompany  
**0:42:36-0:42:40:**  farmers along that way and you know ultimately our goal would be for the projects to be able  
**0:42:40-0:42:44:**  to manage that process themselves but you know quite frankly you know there's enough  
**0:42:44-0:42:49:**  challenges on the ground working with you know several hundred or several thousand small  
**0:42:49-0:42:55:**  holder farmers and managing that just on our primary work alone. So insofar as that we  
**0:42:55-0:43:00:**  can support that process and that really that transition to diversity and resilience then  
**0:43:00-0:43:05:**  we're doing our job I think. And do you think this diversity and this resilience would be  
**0:43:05-0:43:10:**  a model that farmers could adopt even if they weren't selling the produce abroad or do you  
**0:43:10-0:43:13:**  think it's really attached to being able to sell with a premium? Well you know really  
**0:43:13-0:43:19:**  you know my sort of approach is what we call here in the US you know the campsite rule  
**0:43:19-0:43:23:**  you want to leave where you're you know working or living better off than where you found  
**0:43:23-0:43:29:**  it so even eventually you know Dr. Bronner's you know disappears for whatever reason that  
**0:43:29-0:43:34:**  farmers will continue on with sort of organic production and really this diversified approach  
**0:43:34-0:43:42:**  and you know I see this actually as a kind of like a test pilot that might be useful  
**0:43:42-0:43:46:**  and inspiration you know for other places in the world or even in Ghana and Samoa even  
**0:43:46-0:43:50:**  if it has no direct commercial connection to a buyer in the United States or Europe  
**0:43:50-0:43:56:**  for example. You know I see it you know really from a couple of different angles one certainly  
**0:43:56-0:44:03:**  there's a need to produce more you know food and fuel and medicinal plants ecologically  
**0:44:03-0:44:10:**  and I think agroforestry is the best way to do that and I also see a couple of co-benefits  
**0:44:10-0:44:15:**  that need to be incorporated into any you know sustainable development goals or programs  
**0:44:15-0:44:22:**  developed by you know national or local governments. Certainly we have a problem with employment  
**0:44:22-0:44:27:**  for young people and so I feel like agroforestry provides much more opportunities than just  
**0:44:27-0:44:32:**  growing conventionally or with monocultures. Certainly there needs to be a way to take  
**0:44:32-0:44:37:**  land potentially out of production if we can produce more on less land through agroforestry  
**0:44:37-0:44:42:**  then that allows us to leave land to nationally regenerate and go back to its wild state as  
**0:44:42-0:44:46:**  opposed to you know this massive expansion that we're seeing in places like Indonesia  
**0:44:46-0:44:52:**  and Brazil and other places. And then lastly I see as farmers begin to look at this as  
**0:44:52-0:44:57:**  a response to sort of climate change this just really builds in what I would call insurance  
**0:44:57-0:45:02:**  for them going forward. You know one of the things that we've seen really in the coffee  
**0:45:02-0:45:08:**  sector particularly in Central America and Southern Mexico is this you know widespread  
**0:45:08-0:45:15:**  infestation of this coffee rust La Roya which has been just decimating the coffee marketplace  
**0:45:15-0:45:20:**  in these communities and as farmers begin to respond you know my you know sort of view  
**0:45:20-0:45:24:**  and experience experience has been it hasn't been sort of these improved varieties of coffee  
**0:45:24-0:45:29:**  necessarily that are gonna save the day for coffee communities but it's really this diversification  
**0:45:29-0:45:34:**  and returning to much more sort of traditional agroforestry approaches. So I you know I my  
**0:45:34-0:45:38:**  friends always get tired of me always talking about agroforestry but I do really feel like  
**0:45:38-0:45:45:**  it's you know one of the few techniques that you know can actually has multiple benefits  
**0:45:45-0:45:51:**  and you know above and beyond just producing you know raw materials for for committed you  
**0:45:51-0:45:58:**  know fair trade companies. So hopefully our approach will actually provide like a I don't  
**0:45:58-0:46:02:**  know I would hate to use this metaphor but kind of like a lifeboat or sometimes they  
**0:46:02-0:46:07:**  call it like a lighthouse to provide inspiration information to be able to expand the model  
**0:46:07-0:46:14:**  even if it isn't for you know cash crops to send sell to an external market for example.  
**0:46:14-0:46:21:**  So Ryan earlier on you mentioned the importance of infrastructure to be able to to be able  
**0:46:21-0:46:26:**  to provide solutions for the farmers to to maintain these diversified systems and that's  
**0:46:26-0:46:30:**  something that with Etienne we've often very often talked about and something that in the  
**0:46:30-0:46:37:**  podcast we want to dig deeper into and so I'd love to know what are in in your experience  
**0:46:37-0:46:41:**  with Dr Bronner and with these thousands of smallholders what are the key you know pieces  
**0:46:41-0:46:47:**  of infrastructure that are missing for these types of farmers in order to adopt and to  
**0:46:47-0:46:53:**  scale these types of agroforestry systems? Yeah that's a that's a great question Dimitri  
**0:46:53-0:46:57:**  you know infrastructure really is so key and this is one of the things I've noticed working  
**0:46:57-0:47:02:**  with smallholders all over the world is that in many cases they are you know doing great  
**0:47:02-0:47:06:**  things or in many cases feeding their families but really there's a lot of missing elements  
**0:47:06-0:47:12:**  that are either just unavailable to them or there's just structural challenges to actually  
**0:47:12-0:47:17:**  be able to advance these things and so I see it you know kind of you know pre-implementation  
**0:47:17-0:47:23:**  and post-implementation so really to start things off you know farmers need you know  
**0:47:23-0:47:28:**  capital you know there's a lot of good studies out there about the establishment costs for  
**0:47:28-0:47:34:**  you know like an average hectare of a diversified agroforestry system and in general you're  
**0:47:34-0:47:39:**  looking at anywhere between you know like 1000 to 1200 euros to start off you know a  
**0:47:39-0:47:45:**  system and I've seen that to be pretty common at least in the places that we work so you  
**0:47:45-0:47:49:**  know for smallholders in West Africa or you know throughout the Americas that's you know  
**0:47:49-0:47:55:**  it's a pretty big investment so certainly financing is something that needs to be addressed  
**0:47:55-0:47:59:**  and then we've done that through a combination of different ways at our projects and I would  
**0:47:59-0:48:03:**  say I don't know if we're necessarily unique but you know we try to leverage as much as  
**0:48:03-0:48:09:**  we do through financing you know seedlings through our own program whether that is like  
**0:48:09-0:48:16:**  no interest loans or we're able to access grants through development agencies like GIZ  
**0:48:16-0:48:20:**  to be able to actually implement these projects so I would say you know sort of that startup  
**0:48:20-0:48:24:**  capital I think is really really critical and not always available you know there's  
**0:48:24-0:48:29:**  a lot of you know I would say bad you know financial institutions all across the world  
**0:48:29-0:48:35:**  in rural communities where the terms are just really not very favorable to farmers so I  
**0:48:35-0:48:38:**  think that needs to be addressed and we've tried to do that in a variety of different  
**0:48:38-0:48:44:**  ways but every place is really different. Second you know of course there is the issue  
**0:48:44-0:48:47:**  of you know where are you going to find the planting material you know a lot of farmers  
**0:48:47-0:48:53:**  may have enough like oil palm or coconuts or you know whatever you know olive trees  
**0:48:53-0:48:57:**  for example that they can actually produce on their own but as you look to really diversify  
**0:48:57-0:49:01:**  the system and incorporate you know things like biomass species for example or different  
**0:49:01-0:49:07:**  fruit species you know finding those seedlings aren't necessarily that easy so you know establishing  
**0:49:07-0:49:10:**  nurseries that can actually accommodate and produce that I think is really absolutely  
**0:49:10-0:49:15:**  critical and secondly you know what I call sort of like you know after the farm gate  
**0:49:15-0:49:19:**  or post-production really it's this sort of you know I would say these hubs that are able  
**0:49:19-0:49:25:**  to accommodate and do some value added you know for farmers and so in many cases I've  
**0:49:25-0:49:30:**  seen this mostly in the Americas where cooperatives let's say for a coffee cooperative you know  
**0:49:30-0:49:34:**  certainly they'll buy and sell you know coffee on behalf of their members but then they look  
**0:49:34-0:49:38:**  to actually do some value added elements which is important as well whether that's conserving  
**0:49:38-0:49:42:**  and preserving other you know crops I think is really important or just doing some minimal  
**0:49:42-0:49:47:**  processing before it heads off to the marketplace I think is absolutely critical so this is  
**0:49:47-0:49:52:**  a place where I feel like there needs to be much more development funding because right  
**0:49:52-0:49:58:**  now we have this really kind of extractive model where you know farmers continue to produce  
**0:49:58-0:50:03:**  most of the value is added outside of their community and as a result they're always going  
**0:50:03-0:50:08:**  to be in this very precarious or vulnerable state right because most of that value is  
**0:50:08-0:50:13:**  being you know sort of generated someplace else so insofar as that we can have different  
**0:50:13-0:50:19:**  systems that allow for value added preservation and processing relatively close to the farm  
**0:50:19-0:50:23:**  gate I think that's really really critical you know some crops are great you know that  
**0:50:23-0:50:29:**  you can you can you can you know store cocoa for example for you know quite a while before  
**0:50:29-0:50:36:**  it actually goes bad but a lot of them even oil palm for example actually has a relatively  
**0:50:36-0:50:41:**  short shelf life and you need to process it relatively quickly or it could go rancid so  
**0:50:41-0:50:46:**  I think that piece is very very important and then lastly my sort of dream would be  
**0:50:46-0:50:53:**  to have a global or regional network of practitioners that could share both knowledge and experience  
**0:50:53-0:50:58:**  but also tools and resources because I think that's really really critical as we look to  
**0:50:58-0:51:02:**  really optimize these systems you know to do what you guys are talking about which is  
**0:51:02-0:51:07:**  how do we sort of manage for labor costs for example hopefully there's some technology  
**0:51:07-0:51:12:**  that we can implement that actually reduces those challenges a little bit but I think  
**0:51:12-0:51:16:**  that's going to have to emerge from this you know global network that you both are actually  
**0:51:16-0:51:20:**  fostering to be able to share those experiences as we go forward.  
**0:51:20-0:51:25:**  Continuing on the infrastructure because it's a very very important topic does it somehow  
**0:51:25-0:51:32:**  also require your farmers to be located geographically in the similar regions I mean if you need  
**0:51:32-0:51:37:**  the teams to train them if you need to build infrastructure to process etc etc.  
**0:51:37-0:51:42:**  Yeah absolutely I think that is one thing that is absolutely critical as you look to  
**0:51:42-0:51:48:**  set these systems up and and create whatever you know commercial or cooperative relationships  
**0:51:48-0:51:54:**  amongst farmers because I think no one farmer can do this on their own and so you know by  
**0:51:54-0:51:58:**  setting up systems to collaborate I think that's really important and as a result the  
**0:51:58-0:52:03:**  scale you need to be able to do that it needs to have enough farmers to make it worthwhile  
**0:52:03-0:52:08:**  to aggregate and have enough throughput to make it you know kind of commercially viable  
**0:52:08-0:52:12:**  but you don't want to have such a wide you know sort of geographic distance where it  
**0:52:12-0:52:16:**  becomes really really challenging you know both to provide sort of that those services  
**0:52:16-0:52:21:**  that as accompaniments you know the certification services as well but also if you're if you're  
**0:52:21-0:52:26:**  conveying you know your produce over you know you know many you know hundreds of kilometers  
**0:52:26-0:52:30:**  you know not only are you having a horrible climate climate impact with your greenhouse  
**0:52:30-0:52:35:**  gases but it just doesn't make for an efficient system so I think there's different ways that  
**0:52:35-0:52:39:**  you know putting on sort of the crop and the country and those types of things that you  
**0:52:39-0:52:44:**  can accommodate for that I do know you know in places in West Africa with cocoa you may  
**0:52:44-0:52:50:**  have like satellite offices or purchasing centers that accommodate for that but I think  
**0:52:50-0:52:54:**  there needs to be kind of this I would say like sweet spot right you don't want to have  
**0:52:54-0:52:58:**  it so big that it's very difficult to manage and you lose that intimacy with farmers but  
**0:52:58-0:53:04:**  it can't be so small as well that you just never reach economies of scale so you know  
**0:53:04-0:53:09:**  that's really been our goal is to make sure that everything is within you know relatively  
**0:53:09-0:53:13:**  close distances so you have those connections but you want to make sure that you're able  
**0:53:13-0:53:17:**  to provide those same opportunities for farmers in the region as well.  
**0:53:17-0:53:22:**  In this past five years have you seen this diversification and also the work infrastructure  
**0:53:22-0:53:27:**  work and all the different support that you've provided to the farmers etc has it made the  
**0:53:27-0:53:32:**  farmers better off than they were five years ago are the farmers following you and wanting  
**0:53:32-0:53:40:**  you know and really taking on this work and are they economically satisfied with this  
**0:53:40-0:53:44:**  type of new agroforestry that you're presenting to them?  
**0:53:44-0:53:49:**  Well first off Dimitri I should clarify you know we started this journey five years ago  
**0:53:49-0:53:53:**  we haven't actually planted you know for the last five years and so really it's been in  
**0:53:53-0:53:57:**  the last couple of years that we've actually begun this process like on the ground so we're  
**0:53:57-0:54:01:**  you know I would say between three to four years we have you know in terms of some like  
**0:54:01-0:54:07:**  from start to finish at a given you know plot or pilot so I would say you know I don't want  
**0:54:07-0:54:12:**  to say it's too early to tell but you know one of the sort of you know sort of the beautiful  
**0:54:12-0:54:17:**  things but also challenges of working with trees and perennial systems is that you know  
**0:54:17-0:54:22:**  until you start to get some decent production I think what we say is like all bets are off  
**0:54:22-0:54:28:**  you know you can't really tell so well if you know a farmers are really you know enthusiastic  
**0:54:28-0:54:34:**  about adopting and experimenting with the system and you know you really can't tell  
**0:54:34-0:54:37:**  you know what the production what looks like for like your cash crop to be able to compare  
**0:54:37-0:54:43:**  it to yields of a monoculture for example certainly there's enough experience and you  
**0:54:43-0:54:48:**  know scientific studies and literature to suggest that you'll have more production and  
**0:54:48-0:54:53:**  you'll be more resilient but we also have to just sort of prove that out on the ground  
**0:54:53-0:54:58:**  where we're working as well so I would say it's a little too early to tell but that being  
**0:54:58-0:55:03:**  said you know I would say you know at least you know where we have the probably the most  
**0:55:03-0:55:08:**  advanced you know and really diversity of experiences it's really kind of a mixed bag  
**0:55:08-0:55:13:**  I would say about half the farmers are very very enthusiastic and have really gone you  
**0:55:13-0:55:18:**  know the full agroforestry route in terms of planting all the biomass species and shade  
**0:55:18-0:55:23:**  and you know the great diversity and there's probably another half or so that does kind  
**0:55:23-0:55:27:**  of this agroforestry light what I like to call it where they basically you know they  
**0:55:27-0:55:33:**  may plant some you know biomass species but not you know the recommendations or they may  
**0:55:33-0:55:39:**  have a limited number of you know species beyond some of the more basic cash crops but  
**0:55:39-0:55:44:**  you know really it's you know our job to be able to demonstrate that we can in fact you  
**0:55:44-0:55:50:**  know absorb and buy some of these other crops for example or demonstrate that you know while  
**0:55:50-0:55:55:**  there is some additional labor costs certainly that investment then you know pays dividends  
**0:55:55-0:55:59:**  down the road so we're well maybe we should we should we should circle around and talk  
**0:55:59-0:56:03:**  about it next year that we will have more information to talk about.  
**0:56:03-0:56:09:**  Let's have you on the podcast again to cover this issue in a few years time or something  
**0:56:09-0:56:11:**  see how the model has has proved itself.  
**0:56:11-0:56:13:**  That sounds great.  
**0:56:13-0:56:17:**  And wrapping up a bit this first part where we really were able to go into some detail  
**0:56:17-0:56:22:**  on the projects on the ground with Dimitri we greatly value mistakes you know as a source  
**0:56:22-0:56:26:**  of learning and that's I guess what I want to ask you you know if you could talk to the  
**0:56:26-0:56:30:**  Ryan of a few years ago before he started the project and share a few of your mistakes  
**0:56:30-0:56:35:**  and learnings what would your key mistakes and learnings be?  
**0:56:35-0:56:40:**  Oh wow there's so many in a way you know this is one of the things that I think is really  
**0:56:40-0:56:46:**  critical to be you know open to evaluation and things like that and so in general I would  
**0:56:46-0:56:52:**  say you know while I've been personally exposed to you know many different you know agroforestry  
**0:56:52-0:56:58:**  models and experiences in general that's not always the case for a lot of farmers or even  
**0:56:58-0:57:04:**  some of our local staff and so you know in you know in my particular case you know I  
**0:57:04-0:57:09:**  get a little bit too enthusiastic about agroforestry and so I want to you know push ahead and start  
**0:57:09-0:57:15:**  off at a very large scale but in truth you know I think it's a much more of a stepwise  
**0:57:15-0:57:20:**  approach in terms of engaging not only farmers but really you know local staff to be able  
**0:57:20-0:57:25:**  to implement these projects hand in hand with farmers as well so I would say you know part  
**0:57:25-0:57:30:**  of it is probably moving a little bit too fast and also trying to strike this balance  
**0:57:30-0:57:39:**  of you know finding a way to accommodate all of these other you know crops with you know  
**0:57:39-0:57:42:**  sometimes it's kind of we put the cart before the horse so you plant all of these crops  
**0:57:42-0:57:47:**  but you don't necessarily have a clear pathway on how you want to commercialize or process  
**0:57:47-0:57:53:**  them and so to be honest with you you know we are very familiar with you know oil palm  
**0:57:53-0:57:58:**  and coconuts for example but we're not so familiar with things like you know cassava  
**0:57:58-0:58:04:**  and turmeric and so it's taken us a fair amount of work to be able to understand both you  
**0:58:04-0:58:10:**  know the agronomics the reality on the ground but also the marketplace you know as you may  
**0:58:10-0:58:17:**  know I'm not sure what the experience is in Europe so much but certainly in the US context  
**0:58:17-0:58:22:**  you know there's always like what we call like food fads right and so you know some  
**0:58:22-0:58:26:**  days you may have like everybody wants to buy gluten-free products or you know this  
**0:58:26-0:58:32:**  type of superfood and so that's a good opportunity in the short term for producers to sort of  
**0:58:32-0:58:39:**  fill those needs but long term we want to make sure that if a fad or superfood you know  
**0:58:39-0:58:44:**  goes away that farmers aren't left you know sort of planting all of these things and not  
**0:58:44-0:58:48:**  left with it so we want to be really cautious there and so I noticed that has been you know  
**0:58:48-0:58:52:**  not so much for us but you know in the industry a big challenge some of you might remember  
**0:58:52-0:58:57:**  like you know years back you know quinoa was really really popular and then you know farmers  
**0:58:57-0:59:01:**  and the Andes started to plant quinoa and build all this infrastructure and then now  
**0:59:01-0:59:05:**  quinoa you know doesn't make much money and people aren't buying it as much and then farmers  
**0:59:05-0:59:10:**  are left with all this debt and overproduction so we have to be really careful there because  
**0:59:10-0:59:15:**  you know we don't want to undermine the farmers ability to continue to produce and have a  
**0:59:15-0:59:20:**  good livelihood so anyways that was a little bit of a tangent but I would say you know  
**0:59:20-0:59:25:**  when you try to convert some of these you know systems thinking that have been really  
**0:59:25-0:59:30:**  embedded for many many years or even in the university system in different countries it  
**0:59:30-0:59:34:**  takes a long time and so sometimes I move a little too fast as far as the things I would  
**0:59:34-0:59:35:**  like to do.  
**0:59:35-0:59:40:**  Listening to you speak it's true that the big difference that you're trying to do similar  
**0:59:40-0:59:45:**  things to us in terms of you know regenerative agriculture, agroforestry but instead of focusing  
**0:59:45-0:59:49:**  on local markets which would be the strategy in our case for example or in the case of  
**0:59:49-0:59:53:**  a lot of farms we talk to you're having to also cope with these dynamics of like the  
**0:59:53-0:59:58:**  global markets and you know food as a commodity somehow so that's like a whole other level  
**0:59:58-1:00:00:**  of challenge as well.  
**1:00:00-1:00:06:**  Yeah that's an absolutely important point I mean really you know our goal is not to  
**1:00:06-1:00:12:**  sort of design systems that go primarily to external you know sort of global commodity  
**1:00:12-1:00:17:**  markets or even you know these premium ethical fair trade and organic markets either really  
**1:00:17-1:00:24:**  we want to strike a balance so that way if for whatever reason you know the you know  
**1:00:24-1:00:27:**  let's say there's an economic downturn and as we're seeing right now through the COVID  
**1:00:27-1:00:32:**  crisis you know and maybe there isn't as many imports into Europe and the United States  
**1:00:32-1:00:37:**  we don't want that to then really jeopardize farmers ability to produce you know profitably  
**1:00:37-1:00:42:**  right so we need to strike this balance really between really addressing sort of local food  
**1:00:42-1:00:47:**  needs either within the family structure within the local community and then you know expanding  
**1:00:47-1:00:52:**  out into the region in the nation and then also look where we can be opportunistic to  
**1:00:52-1:00:58:**  have stable and long committed marketplaces for some of these other cash crops so it's  
**1:00:58-1:01:00:**  a little bit of a balance in act.  
**1:01:00-1:01:08:**  I wanted to ask you Ryan if we could talk a bit just briefly about some of the agricultural  
**1:01:08-1:01:16:**  mistakes in terms of the designs that you did and that you wish you'd done other in  
**1:01:16-1:01:21:**  another way or you know more specific towards the agricultural side.  
**1:01:21-1:01:27:**  Yeah well absolutely I think probably the most relevant you know examples would be our  
**1:01:27-1:01:32:**  larger scale projects in Samoa and they're you know one of the things that is always  
**1:01:32-1:01:38:**  kind of a little bit more flexible in you know maybe potentially open to mistakes but  
**1:01:38-1:01:44:**  you know we know for example that we can always have a market for coconuts and cocoa and certainly  
**1:01:44-1:01:51:**  the marketplace for fruit in Samoa locally is quite advanced but I think you know the  
**1:01:51-1:01:56:**  really sort of like unknown part is you know trying to figure out what is most important  
**1:01:56-1:02:03:**  you know planting during the succession phase of any new plantation so as we look to come  
**1:02:03-1:02:11:**  up with different crop combinations whether that's you know taro or cassava or turmeric  
**1:02:11-1:02:17:**  and ginger and other things you know we were kind of playing a little bit in the dark there  
**1:02:17-1:02:22:**  and so as a result you know one of the things we realized is that though there's kind of  
**1:02:22-1:02:27:**  this global you know marketplace for cassava that's really emerging in large part because  
**1:02:27-1:02:34:**  of the need for gluten-free ingredients if we don't actually have the facilities to either  
**1:02:34-1:02:38:**  process that or if there's not enough local demand then it's just a waste of time so we  
**1:02:38-1:02:44:**  ended up planting a fair amount of cassava early on in a number of the plots in large  
**1:02:44-1:02:49:**  part because it grows fast it provides good shade for for young seedlings for cocoa for  
**1:02:49-1:02:55:**  example but then farmers if they end up with cassava and nothing to do with it then they  
**1:02:55-1:02:59:**  become you know I would say demoralized a little bit and then you end up with a lot  
**1:02:59-1:03:04:**  of cassava without a marketplace and so you know it's one of those things that you want  
**1:03:04-1:03:09:**  to make sure you do your best to sort of develop those relationships and trust but then if  
**1:03:09-1:03:13:**  you encourage farmers to grow something that nobody wants then it's always like you know  
**1:03:13-1:03:19:**  kind of a problem and so you learn you know I would say you know sometimes not as quickly  
**1:03:19-1:03:25:**  as you should so for example there's a great species in the Pacific called noni which is  
**1:03:25-1:03:32:**  is really fantastic very resilient it grows in pretty much any soil type and it was clear  
**1:03:32-1:03:37:**  there even with some good pruning that you know noni could be so you know substituted  
**1:03:37-1:03:42:**  for cassava in some cases and so we learned as a result of our kind of like ongoing engagement  
**1:03:42-1:03:47:**  with farmers that we should you know maybe shift to focus a little bit there even though  
**1:03:47-1:03:50:**  noni is a you know it's a perennial tree crop but you can actually you know sort of prune  
**1:03:50-1:03:54:**  and maintain at a relatively low level to continue to provide that shade during that  
**1:03:54-1:03:59:**  succession period so I would say that would be just a perfect example of something that  
**1:03:59-1:04:03:**  we think make a whole lot of sense and it works in other countries but we needed to  
**1:04:03-1:04:07:**  make adjustments you know relatively quickly in the case of Samoa.  
**1:04:07-1:04:11:**  Thank you so much for being so honest with your experience and sharing all of this with  
**1:04:11-1:04:16:**  us somehow I find it so motivating when we're talking about mistakes and learnings because  
**1:04:16-1:04:20:**  it's like well you know everyone's human even the people doing the most amazing stuff get  
**1:04:20-1:04:26:**  some stuff wrong and you know that comforts me somehow.  
**1:04:26-1:04:31:**  Yeah well to be honest with you we're pretty transparent I mean we've made a lot of mistakes  
**1:04:31-1:04:36:**  you know but I think you know our sort of like motto or approach is like you know it's  
**1:04:36-1:04:41:**  fine to make mistakes as long as you're moving forward and then you just like honest with  
**1:04:41-1:04:46:**  it because you know this is tough work in general you know you need to kind of you know  
**1:04:46-1:04:52:**  find your space between you know you're primarily a commercial entity right but you also have  
**1:04:52-1:04:57:**  this these ethics that really focus on you know rural development and you know human  
**1:04:57-1:05:02:**  empowerment and all these other values and so you need to be able to balance that all  
**1:05:02-1:05:06:**  not only to have you know be able to sleep at night with a clear conscience but really  
**1:05:06-1:05:12:**  I would say in the long term by making sure you have sort of this transparency and commitment  
**1:05:12-1:05:18:**  that that can only help your business down the road so I think it's important to be honest.  
**1:05:18-1:05:23:**  That's a great ethic and that's how we all learn so for the last part of the interview  
**1:05:23-1:05:28:**  we also wanted to have a bit of a perspective of you know understanding what it takes for  
**1:05:28-1:05:33:**  a company like Dr. Brunner to integrate agroforestry and regenerative agriculture in their supply  
**1:05:33-1:05:39:**  chain and to scale it so maybe to give an idea to give us an idea could you explain  
**1:05:39-1:05:44:**  a bit you know where you're at now in terms of integrating these regenerative practices  
**1:05:44-1:05:49:**  and you know what are the next steps and what kind of scale are we talking about?  
**1:05:49-1:05:54:**  Now that's a great question and I may not exactly know since it's kind of a you know  
**1:05:54-1:05:59:**  kind of a changing landscape but I can give you a just sort of a general idea you know  
**1:05:59-1:06:04:**  so first off I should point out that Dr. Bronner's is relatively unique so it's a family owned  
**1:06:04-1:06:11:**  business and so as a result we have a lot more sort of longer term perspectives than  
**1:06:11-1:06:17:**  let's say a publicly traded company would you know a lot of times either through you  
**1:06:17-1:06:21:**  know venture capital and other investors or if you have stockholders you know they want  
**1:06:21-1:06:27:**  to see a very quick return on their investment so we have the luxury and privilege really  
**1:06:27-1:06:34:**  to be you know much more you know of a long term thinking as far as our planning there  
**1:06:34-1:06:40:**  so we're really lucky to have you know a fantastic family that is able to give us a lot of leeway  
**1:06:40-1:06:46:**  to be able to do these projects knowing that we may not see a huge return you know in 12  
**1:06:46-1:06:51:**  months or 18 months I think that's really really important so I'd say you know in general  
**1:06:51-1:06:55:**  you know there needs to be some financing or approach to be able to realize that you  
**1:06:55-1:07:01:**  know actually implementing agroforestry in some cases may take a while to be profitable  
**1:07:01-1:07:04:**  though that's certainly not our kind of goal hopefully we'd have enough sort of production  
**1:07:04-1:07:08:**  in the early years to make it profitable in general but anyway I just wanted to underscore  
**1:07:08-1:07:12:**  that point because I think that's one of the biggest challenges for businesses and other  
**1:07:12-1:07:17:**  companies to be able to really implement these projects is that the startup capital is not  
**1:07:17-1:07:23:**  insignificant and the return on investment sometimes takes a little bit longer so I would  
**1:07:23-1:07:29:**  say you know broadly speaking you know the vast majority of our raw materials come from  
**1:07:29-1:07:34:**  perennial crops but just because it's perennial doesn't necessarily mean it has that agroforestry  
**1:07:34-1:07:38:**  values that we're looking to implement so what we've done is a couple of things one  
**1:07:38-1:07:46:**  in most many of our projects we've begun to do you know if not larger scale you know plantings  
**1:07:46-1:07:52:**  with farmers we've at least started the process of training and establishing pilot plots to  
**1:07:52-1:07:56:**  be able to demonstrate and train farmers there so that's really I would say the first step  
**1:07:56-1:08:02:**  and then as we look to sort of leverage financing we can then expand that out with more farmers  
**1:08:02-1:08:07:**  and really our goal isn't that farmers you know even if they have a small plot convert  
**1:08:07-1:08:12:**  everything to a really diversified agroforestry system you know overnight or you know all  
**1:08:12-1:08:17:**  at once but we want to make sure that there's a transition to that process so that way that  
**1:08:17-1:08:22:**  as an opportunity that they can learn in the process and it reduces their risk right you  
**1:08:22-1:08:26:**  know if they farm they grow everything you know in a diversified agroforestry system  
**1:08:26-1:08:30:**  and then for example they have like challenges with their family and they're not able to  
**1:08:30-1:08:35:**  maintain it then that's not a good model that we would like to promote and then lastly you  
**1:08:35-1:08:39:**  know one of the things that we've been looking at here in the United States is you know how  
**1:08:39-1:08:45:**  do we leverage third-party certifications so for example you know many consumers are  
**1:08:45-1:08:50:**  familiar with you know B.O. or organic that's been very important for the development of  
**1:08:50-1:08:55:**  the marketplace certainly fair trade is another element that's very very important we want  
**1:08:55-1:08:59:**  to make sure that you know farmers are paid fairly for their production and that workers  
**1:08:59-1:09:06:**  are protected and treated fairly throughout the supply chain but the reality is is that  
**1:09:06-1:09:12:**  in a way they're a little bit incomplete so Dr. Bronner's and a couple of other NGOs and  
**1:09:12-1:09:19:**  businesses like Patagonia as well as research outfits decided to create a third-party certification  
**1:09:19-1:09:23:**  called the regenerative organic certified certified and really our goal was to bring  
**1:09:23-1:09:30:**  together not only organic and fair trade but really to layer on additional elements that  
**1:09:30-1:09:37:**  focus primarily on soil health and so one of the things we realized you know early on  
**1:09:37-1:09:41:**  is just because it's organic doesn't mean it's actually ecological so we wanted to come  
**1:09:41-1:09:46:**  up with a system that could actually bring all of these values under one roof and make  
**1:09:46-1:09:52:**  sure that farmers and producers are actually rewarded for their regenerative practices  
**1:09:52-1:09:56:**  so that that process has kicked off and over the course of the last year there was a number  
**1:09:56-1:10:02:**  of pilots including three at our projects in India, Sri Lanka and in Ghana and our hope  
**1:10:02-1:10:08:**  is that there would be sort of a commercial pathway for those producers looking to market  
**1:10:08-1:10:13:**  their crops as regenerative you know in the marketplace and I think that's really critical  
**1:10:13-1:10:19:**  and there needs to be this combination of you know upfront financing a long-term perspective  
**1:10:19-1:10:24:**  but also a pathway for for farmers to be rewarded for all of the investment that they're doing  
**1:10:24-1:10:29:**  in regenerative practices and we think this this certification the ROC might be one way  
**1:10:29-1:10:30:**  to do that.  
**1:10:30-1:10:35:**  And could Dr. Bronner's be certified like all of its suppliers could have that certification  
**1:10:35-1:10:38:**  is that something then that would apply to Dr. Bronner's products?  
**1:10:38-1:10:45:**  Yep so that is ultimately our goal you know we as a result of the pilot our virgin coconut  
**1:10:45-1:10:51:**  oil out of Sri Lanka was one of the first products to be to be certified as regenerative  
**1:10:51-1:10:58:**  organic and really our goal is that the rest of our supply chains will go along that pathway  
**1:10:58-1:11:02:**  but you know one of the challenges that we're facing going forward and this is something  
**1:11:02-1:11:07:**  that's you know a big challenge for people all over the world with with third-party certifiers  
**1:11:07-1:11:12:**  is that with COVID we're seeing sort of limits on how much transportation or you know travel  
**1:11:12-1:11:17:**  can be done you know even within countries or you know from you know outside countries  
**1:11:17-1:11:22:**  as well so as a result all of those audits to actually do the certification have been  
**1:11:22-1:11:27:**  put on hold in some cases so we're exploring you know whether or not we can do this with  
**1:11:27-1:11:32:**  you know virtual audits or you know self-reporting or what have you but ultimately our goal would  
**1:11:32-1:11:37:**  be able to to make sure that all of our supply chains or major raw materials are certified  
**1:11:37-1:11:43:**  regenerative organic and to be honest you know we're quite confident that we can get  
**1:11:43-1:11:48:**  there in large part we've got you know a good you know sort of foundation of organic and  
**1:11:48-1:11:53:**  in fair practices already all of our you know major raw materials organic and fair trade  
**1:11:53-1:11:58:**  so basically we just sort of need to continue to our sort of pathway towards regenerative  
**1:11:58-1:12:03:**  production and I think we'll get there. Do you have a date for that objective? Is it  
**1:12:03-1:12:11:**  a matter of a decade, a few years, more? Yeah I would say you know for the tropical perennial  
**1:12:11-1:12:16:**  crops I would say we would get there you know probably in you know two to three years you  
**1:12:16-1:12:22:**  know for some of the more dry land or arid crops you know things like olive oil or jojoba  
**1:12:22-1:12:27:**  oil that might take a little bit longer because you know the sort of the infrastructure in  
**1:12:27-1:12:32:**  approach is really different and so we have to rely on our partners there to be able to  
**1:12:32-1:12:37:**  you know design those systems and we certainly know that they've been doing you know some  
**1:12:37-1:12:42:**  of those things already you know certainly our partners in Palestine, Kanan Fair Trade,  
**1:12:42-1:12:46:**  I mean they're working with you know olive trees that are over a thousand years old in  
**1:12:46-1:12:52:**  some cases so that's pretty regenerative to me but that being said you know we want to  
**1:12:52-1:12:57:**  figure out the best approach you know for most of our raw materials and so I think for  
**1:12:57-1:13:03:**  the tropical you know oil crops that is probably sooner than later but there are a number of  
**1:13:03-1:13:07:**  other crops you know like especially in essential oils like lavender for example or eucalyptus  
**1:13:07-1:13:12:**  or tea tree where that may take a little bit longer in large part because those are third  
**1:13:12-1:13:16:**  party suppliers and we don't have as much you know kind of influence or control there  
**1:13:16-1:13:21:**  as we would otherwise. I was wondering you know you mentioned that one of the main obstacles  
**1:13:21-1:13:28:**  is that you know extra cost that comes with maybe having this truly regenerative supply  
**1:13:28-1:13:34:**  chain and I'm wondering you know how is Dr. Bronner able to do that is it you know through  
**1:13:34-1:13:39:**  a strategy of having really high you know quality products and is it realistic for them  
**1:13:39-1:13:45:**  to have that level of quality throughout their whole supply chain? You know I think it is  
**1:13:45-1:13:50:**  you know one of the great things about Dr. Bronner's is that we've made this commitment  
**1:13:50-1:13:55:**  to transition to organic and then fair trade and now to regenerative and I think that the  
**1:13:55-1:14:01:**  Bronner family is pretty realistic about all of the challenges and the timeline there and  
**1:14:01-1:14:07:**  so I think from our perspective that we're on that pathway pretty clearly but what we've  
**1:14:07-1:14:11:**  also realized is you know basically two things. One I've talked about the diversification  
**1:14:11-1:14:17:**  on the ground that is a pretty clear element to facilitate that transition for farmers.  
**1:14:17-1:14:22:**  They need to make sure that there's additional income to justify this investment in this  
**1:14:22-1:14:28:**  conversion and then similarly what we're realizing is that it's really important to be able to  
**1:14:28-1:14:34:**  collaborate with other like-minded companies whether it's you know body care or food for  
**1:14:34-1:14:41:**  example everybody that sources from agricultural raw material supply chains. We realize that  
**1:14:41-1:14:46:**  to be able to scale out this regenerative approach really requires collaboration so  
**1:14:46-1:14:51:**  what we've done here in the United States is start to work with a small group of companies  
**1:14:51-1:14:57:**  committed to regenerative practices and insofar as that we can leverage either our buying  
**1:14:57-1:15:04:**  power or investments or just education then the chances of us scaling out regenerative  
**1:15:04-1:15:10:**  practices is a lot better. So it's been really exciting because you know through this this  
**1:15:10-1:15:16:**  collaboration we're seeing even competitors work together on sourcing and you know farmer  
**1:15:16-1:15:23:**  support for example as a way to be able to invest in regeneration. So this is really  
**1:15:23-1:15:27:**  kind of I would say one of the more hopeful things I've seen during this you know COVID  
**1:15:27-1:15:33:**  pandemic is that there's been greater collaboration and just kind of openness and transparency  
**1:15:33-1:15:38:**  with other people in the industry because people are starting to realize that not only  
**1:15:38-1:15:44:**  are consumers demanding a regenerative product for sure but really you know their long-term  
**1:15:44-1:15:50:**  viability depends on regenerative practices on the ground and so insofar as that we can  
**1:15:50-1:15:57:**  do that collaboratively and really kind of leverage our power all the better. Yeah it's  
**1:15:57-1:16:02:**  great to hear that and I really hope you do manage to do that for everyone's benefit and  
**1:16:02-1:16:07:**  it's great to have that perspective of you know how companies are tackling that challenge  
**1:16:07-1:16:12:**  because as I said before we're more used to direct selling in a sense and you know dealing  
**1:16:12-1:16:16:**  with the final consumer as well so it's great that companies are positioning themselves.  
**1:16:16-1:16:23:**  I did have maybe among my last questions you know knowing all it takes to change your supply  
**1:16:23-1:16:29:**  chains towards regenerative practices does it make you optimistic that that's something  
**1:16:29-1:16:33:**  that we're going to see like expand through a lot of companies or do you think the constraints  
**1:16:33-1:16:38:**  you were talking about in terms of investments and returns of investments are massive how  
**1:16:38-1:16:44:**  do you feel about that transition? I would say I'm both optimistic but like realistic  
**1:16:44-1:16:49:**  you know it like as we've talked about you know there's a big sort of education gap and  
**1:16:49-1:16:55:**  training gap that's a reality certainly the financing is going to be a big issue and I  
**1:16:55-1:17:01:**  you know I think that you know there is a I would say I'm optimistic that there's kind  
**1:17:01-1:17:07:**  of a sea change with a lot of the development agencies out there whether it's you know DFID  
**1:17:07-1:17:15:**  in the UK or GIZ in Germany and others where they see the value in regenerative practices  
**1:17:15-1:17:21:**  and really looking for ways to facilitate the you know the adoption of these practices  
**1:17:21-1:17:26:**  not only you know at the farm gate you know with farmers but also kind of in these intermediary  
**1:17:26-1:17:31:**  steps whether it's processing or distribution you know one of the sort of most you know  
**1:17:31-1:17:37:**  it's a little bit off topic but one of the most you know disappointing statistics out  
**1:17:37-1:17:42:**  there is from the FAO that you know there's a fair amount of food waste that happens you  
**1:17:42-1:17:46:**  know globally and it's you know almost like equal equivalent to like the emissions of  
**1:17:46-1:17:52:**  China in terms of you know greenhouse gases but most of that either happens you know at  
**1:17:52-1:17:57:**  consuming level with consumers in their homes or at restaurants but a fair amount of it  
**1:17:57-1:18:02:**  is just like food loss right there's so much food that goes to waste because of poor transportation  
**1:18:02-1:18:09:**  lack of refrigeration or processing particularly in the global south and so as a result like  
**1:18:09-1:18:13:**  like there needs to be greater investment there and so you know we could talk all we  
**1:18:13-1:18:19:**  want about the sort of agronomic practices that lead to regeneration but we also have  
**1:18:19-1:18:24:**  to be just really honest to say hey look we need to have a full scale transformation of  
**1:18:24-1:18:29:**  the food system if we're able to accommodate that so I would say insofar as that there  
**1:18:29-1:18:35:**  is additional sort of like funding and realization at that level I think that's absolutely critical  
**1:18:35-1:18:40:**  and I think the one sort of silver lining that I've seen as a result of COVID has been  
**1:18:40-1:18:45:**  that one you know people are starting to realize that obviously you know having you know healthy  
**1:18:45-1:18:51:**  and safe food is pretty critical and that there's been sort of a renewed effort both  
**1:18:51-1:18:55:**  here in the United States and really in a lot of the countries where we work where people  
**1:18:55-1:19:00:**  are starting to go back to the country and farm again so that to me is really exciting  
**1:19:00-1:19:05:**  we need to make sure that those young people actually have a pathway to farm you know profitably  
**1:19:05-1:19:11:**  and stably and I think regenerative agriculture is the way to do it.  
**1:19:11-1:19:15:**  Oh great concluding remarks there.  
**1:19:15-1:19:21:**  Thank you so much for all this information and as a last tiny question we'd love to know  
**1:19:21-1:19:26:**  what would you like to hear about in the next episodes on the podcast and what kind of topics  
**1:19:26-1:19:29:**  and questions are you excited about?  
**1:19:29-1:19:34:**  Well I mean so first of all I want to say congratulations on the first couple of episodes  
**1:19:34-1:19:39:**  I recommended it to all of my friends and colleagues I think you know your approach  
**1:19:39-1:19:44:**  of looking at both you know all of the different elements that go into regenerative agroforestry  
**1:19:44-1:19:50:**  are so critical whether that is getting very specific into you know the experience on the  
**1:19:50-1:19:55:**  ground and how to design and carry out these programs to the marketing and value-added  
**1:19:55-1:19:59:**  step and then lastly I think you know what's important are these big structural questions  
**1:19:59-1:20:05:**  like how do we actually you know scale out regenerative agroforestry at a larger scale  
**1:20:05-1:20:09:**  and what are really kind of that is implications you know I continue to look at the situation  
**1:20:09-1:20:16:**  in the Amazon with dread and I keep thinking like wow you know agroforestry could really  
**1:20:16-1:20:22:**  release a lot of that pressure to expand the agricultural landscape and actually protect  
**1:20:22-1:20:26:**  some of these this native land so I think you know touching on all of these points is  
**1:20:26-1:20:31:**  just so critical we can't just focus on one or the other and I think the podcast is really  
**1:20:31-1:20:33:**  the best platform to do that.  
**1:20:33-1:20:38:**  On these kind words from Ryan that's all for today we'd really love to have your input

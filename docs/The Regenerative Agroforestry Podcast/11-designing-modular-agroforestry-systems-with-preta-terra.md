### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sun, 06 Dec 2020 17:23:45)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:47:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:52:**  We're your host Dimitri Enyetien and today we're super happy to have on the show Paulo  
**0:00:52-0:00:54:**  and Valter from Preta Terra.  
**0:00:54-0:00:59:**  Preta Terra has a consulting company that specializes in agroforestry systems.  
**0:00:59-0:01:03:**  They're based in Brazil but they operate around the world and today they're going to tell  
**0:01:03-0:01:07:**  us a bit about how they operate and what they do.  
**0:01:07-0:01:12:**  This is a bit of a shorter interview than usual because they are extremely busy at the  
**0:01:12-0:01:18:**  moment which is very good news for agroforestry and this is the amount of time that we managed  
**0:01:18-0:01:25:**  to have from them but we hope that we're going to be able to interview them again later or  
**0:01:25-0:01:33:**  in the future in order to go into more depth on many issues and the many topics that we  
**0:01:33-0:01:35:**  just started touching upon today.  
**0:01:35-0:01:39:**  So without further ado we hope you enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:39-0:01:42:**  Hello Valter and Paulo, welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:42-0:01:47:**  Hello guys Etienne and Dimitri, thank you so much for the invitation.  
**0:01:47-0:01:50:**  Yeah it's very good to be here with both of you.  
**0:01:50-0:01:56:**  We'd love to have a quick introduction of yourselves and also you know for you to tell  
**0:01:56-0:01:59:**  us a bit about what Preta Terra does.  
**0:01:59-0:02:00:**  So maybe I could start?  
**0:02:00-0:02:01:**  Yeah please.  
**0:02:01-0:02:10:**  Okay my name is Paulo, I am a Brazilian and well I'm a forest engineer and a biologist  
**0:02:10-0:02:21:**  as well so I started my work with forest restoration, degraded land reforestation and afterwards  
**0:02:21-0:02:29:**  I understood the importance of bringing people together through the forest landscapes so  
**0:02:29-0:02:35:**  I started to work with, I started working with biodiverse production systems.  
**0:02:35-0:02:43:**  That's why I invested all my career, most of my career with two agroforestry systems.  
**0:02:43-0:02:51:**  So I started working with smallholder farmers and remote communities and indigenous people  
**0:02:51-0:02:59:**  especially in the Amazon in many contexts in the Amazon close to NGOs and well after  
**0:02:59-0:03:07:**  a few years of experience with smallholder farmers and understanding the operational  
**0:03:07-0:03:15:**  part of agroforestry in a small scale I had the challenge to apply these to a large scale  
**0:03:15-0:03:21:**  and that's exactly where I met Valter, where we worked together in Fazenda da Toca which  
**0:03:21-0:03:32:**  is a very important intrapreneur, entrepreneurship here in Brazil where we applied our knowledge  
**0:03:32-0:03:41:**  to expand agroforestry and systematize it our knowledge to a large scale and that was  
**0:03:41-0:03:46:**  the challenge we had at that time to apply the knowledge to a large scale.  
**0:03:46-0:03:53:**  I introduce myself, my name is Valter, Valter Ziantoni, I'm the partner of Paula and the  
**0:03:53-0:04:01:**  foundation of Preta Terra and well I'm a forest engineer as well as she is.  
**0:04:01-0:04:07:**  I also hold a master on agroforestry, I am SSC on agroforestry from Bangor University  
**0:04:07-0:04:15:**  in the UK and I have several years of experience, I mean more than 15 years working with agroforestry  
**0:04:15-0:04:18:**  now all over the world basically.  
**0:04:18-0:04:25:**  After my masters I worked a couple of years in Africa, in Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa  
**0:04:25-0:04:37:**  and Kenya and then in Southeast Asia for UNDP, in Turkey for FIO and several other NGOs and  
**0:04:37-0:04:43:**  companies and initiatives especially in the Brazilian Amazon where I have together with  
**0:04:43-0:04:50:**  Paula also more than six years of experience in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon.  
**0:04:50-0:04:57:**  And since the beginning of my career I was always passionate by people and first dependent  
**0:04:57-0:04:59:**  people livelihoods.  
**0:04:59-0:05:06:**  So my specialization is basically on local knowledge or better saying the acquirement  
**0:05:06-0:05:14:**  of the local knowledge vision of how people interpretate their environment and why they  
**0:05:14-0:05:22:**  choose this species instead of those or everything else that is the decision made by farmers  
**0:05:22-0:05:23:**  in the field.  
**0:05:23-0:05:29:**  So from this perspective we believe the projects can be developed, the ideas, the designs and  
**0:05:29-0:05:38:**  they will rely in time, they will be more resilient facing climate change and other  
**0:05:38-0:05:44:**  challenges including market fluctuations and everything else that is our challenges for  
**0:05:44-0:05:46:**  farmers in the field.  
**0:05:46-0:06:00:**  And as Paula mentioned we met working and leading the RD section of Fazendo da Toca,  
**0:06:00-0:06:03:**  this large enterprise carried by Pedro Paulo Dines who was an entrepreneur who started  
**0:06:03-0:06:12:**  the biggest agroforestry challenge in the world probably by the time and we were hired  
**0:06:12-0:06:20:**  to be the leaders of the RD section, the research and development section of this company and  
**0:06:20-0:06:29:**  we worked there for around two years and there we learned, we brought a lot from our experience  
**0:06:29-0:06:35:**  and background but we also learned with challenges we were about to face.  
**0:06:35-0:06:40:**  And then we decided to found Preta Pera and bring you all this knowledge and capability  
**0:06:40-0:06:44:**  of creating replicable systems to the world.  
**0:06:44-0:06:54:**  Yes, so we merged all the experience we had in the operational part, in the local knowledge  
**0:06:54-0:07:03:**  acquisition part, in designing and economically modeling, economical modeling to put it all  
**0:07:03-0:07:05:**  in Preta Pera.  
**0:07:05-0:07:13:**  What Preta Pera does now, what we work with now is mainly designing complex production  
**0:07:13-0:07:17:**  systems and especially agroforestry systems.  
**0:07:17-0:07:25:**  Of course we always focus on putting trees in the landscape but the idea is to design,  
**0:07:25-0:07:32:**  to systematize, to plan properly the production systems because the problem we have so far  
**0:07:32-0:07:41:**  is well, of course everybody knows the monocropping is depleting soil and what we need is regenerative  
**0:07:41-0:07:52:**  production systems but a very strong challenge we face to do this transition is this systematization,  
**0:07:52-0:07:58:**  the systematization itself, the planning itself because when we have a complex production  
**0:07:58-0:08:04:**  system, farmers have a hard time to understand where to start, which species to manage, which  
**0:08:04-0:08:11:**  is going to be the fertilizer, how are they supposed to prune each new species and everything.  
**0:08:11-0:08:19:**  So it is a complex system, so we need to systematize, we need to plan, we need to have a proper  
**0:08:19-0:08:21:**  operational chronogram.  
**0:08:21-0:08:29:**  So that's pretty much what we do and especially the financial modeling.  
**0:08:29-0:08:36:**  Well Complimenti, I think the core of Preta Pera is bringing ancestral knowledge, so all  
**0:08:36-0:08:42:**  the knowledge that comes empirically from farmers all around the world and put it together  
**0:08:42-0:08:44:**  with technology.  
**0:08:44-0:08:50:**  So that's the main approach and I would say that's the core of our initiative and for  
**0:08:50-0:08:57:**  four years now we have been working systematizing empirical knowledge and put that into economical  
**0:08:57-0:09:06:**  modeling and process that's enabled farmers to replicate this process anywhere in the  
**0:09:06-0:09:16:**  world and part of our methodology applies or relies, part of our methodology relies  
**0:09:16-0:09:21:**  on modularity, replicability and elasticity.  
**0:09:21-0:09:25:**  We bring those concepts to farmers, through farmers.  
**0:09:25-0:09:32:**  I think that's very important to say because what we do, what we try to master since the  
**0:09:32-0:09:37:**  very beginning of our initiative is to see from the farmer's point of view.  
**0:09:37-0:09:44:**  So that's the main thing, if you see and if you understand what are the challenges and  
**0:09:44-0:09:49:**  what farmers are expecting, we are able to design something that will be acceptable and  
**0:09:49-0:09:56:**  that will be successful in time and when I say successful, not only resilient environmentally  
**0:09:56-0:10:05:**  but also economically because we face a lot of challenges regarding market prices, when  
**0:10:05-0:10:07:**  you produce commodities.  
**0:10:07-0:10:11:**  So you are looking for premium prices, you are looking for nutrient density, you are  
**0:10:11-0:10:19:**  looking for a better way to manage soil and when we use the replicability model using  
**0:10:19-0:10:26:**  modularity and using another methodology we have that we call functional niche that is  
**0:10:26-0:10:33:**  putting species into a kind of systematization.  
**0:10:33-0:10:44:**  So each species is selected and grouped in different niches.  
**0:10:44-0:10:50:**  It allows us to replicate systems that we have developed for Brazil, for example, to  
**0:10:50-0:10:52:**  any other place in the world.  
**0:10:52-0:11:02:**  So making changes and changing every species as it was a piece in a chess board, for example.  
**0:11:02-0:11:10:**  Each species corresponds to a niche with specific functions and specific demands and management  
**0:11:10-0:11:13:**  and everything else within specific markets.  
**0:11:13-0:11:20:**  So we can apply the same logic whenever we have a new project in a new biome or a new  
**0:11:20-0:11:21:**  region.  
**0:11:21-0:11:27:**  I think what would be useful is if you could maybe continue explaining this by using a  
**0:11:27-0:11:31:**  few examples of projects you are working on currently or that you've worked on in the  
**0:11:31-0:11:32:**  past.  
**0:11:32-0:11:39:**  We have a project in the Amazon we established, we started working in 2018 there, especially  
**0:11:39-0:11:48:**  focusing with cassava because that was the livelihood base.  
**0:11:48-0:11:50:**  All farmers plant cassava there.  
**0:11:50-0:11:57:**  So in any design we have, we are not going to bring a complete different logic.  
**0:11:57-0:12:00:**  The idea is that it's adherent and makes sense for them.  
**0:12:00-0:12:06:**  So we kept the cassava, of course, in the design pretty much in the same way that they  
**0:12:06-0:12:07:**  were used to.  
**0:12:07-0:12:15:**  The only difference is that we wouldn't do the slash and burn as they are used to do.  
**0:12:15-0:12:23:**  We just did the slash and moat technique, which is when we manage the biomass of the  
**0:12:23-0:12:29:**  secondary forest and organize all the biomass in the ground and plant over it.  
**0:12:29-0:12:32:**  We don't burn it as they are used to do.  
**0:12:32-0:12:43:**  And so the design we carried out and planted with the farmers, we designed lines of trees  
**0:12:43-0:12:48:**  every 10 meters in between the cassava plantation.  
**0:12:48-0:13:00:**  And every 10 meters we have in this line, we have a large cycle, high value timber tree.  
**0:13:00-0:13:02:**  And this is what we call the niche.  
**0:13:02-0:13:04:**  That's the interesting part.  
**0:13:04-0:13:08:**  We didn't mention a species, we just mentioned the niche.  
**0:13:08-0:13:12:**  So it's a timber tree or a non-timber tree.  
**0:13:12-0:13:18:**  And we have a few species that we can put inside according to what the farmer wants  
**0:13:18-0:13:20:**  or what they don't want.  
**0:13:20-0:13:28:**  So for instance, they could plant the Brazil nut, for instance, or other timber or andiraba,  
**0:13:28-0:13:33:**  which produces the oil or the rosewood also.  
**0:13:33-0:13:38:**  So they had this list of species, like 10 species, native species of high value that  
**0:13:38-0:13:40:**  they could allocate.  
**0:13:40-0:13:44:**  If they only wanted the Brazil nut, they could do only the Brazil nut.  
**0:13:44-0:13:47:**  But if they want to diversify, they could as well.  
**0:13:47-0:13:55:**  And so we have the design that every 10 meters we have the long cycle timber tree.  
**0:13:55-0:13:58:**  And in the line, it occurs every 10 meters.  
**0:13:58-0:14:06:**  And then along the line, in between trees, we have three fruit species as well.  
**0:14:06-0:14:08:**  And it's the same logic.  
**0:14:08-0:14:11:**  They could choose which fruit species they want.  
**0:14:11-0:14:19:**  So they could choose acai, they could choose graviola, they could choose the anona, acerola.  
**0:14:19-0:14:25:**  So many species that were native for them, that they knew, that they know how to manage,  
**0:14:25-0:14:30:**  that they had the market, they could choose and put in this functional niche of simply  
**0:14:30-0:14:38:**  fruits every two and a half meters in between these long timber trees, long cycle timber  
**0:14:38-0:14:39:**  trees.  
**0:14:39-0:14:45:**  And then finally, in between these lines of 10 meters, every five meters, we have a line  
**0:14:45-0:14:53:**  of bananas every five meters and a mix of seeds of service species that we call it.  
**0:14:53-0:15:00:**  We call service species the one that grows fast, produce biomass and can be pruned very  
**0:15:00-0:15:07:**  frequently so that we can boost the nutrient cycling.  
**0:15:07-0:15:13:**  And then in the first years, like two, three years, we just managed intensively these trees  
**0:15:13-0:15:19:**  and they will be planted by seed so that you don't spend much money on buying seedlings  
**0:15:19-0:15:20:**  and so forth.  
**0:15:20-0:15:25:**  And the idea is that these species produce a lot of biomass to cover the soil and to  
**0:15:25-0:15:28:**  produce, to boost the nutrient cycling process.  
**0:15:28-0:15:36:**  Yeah, I think this project is very emblematic because you worked in 22 unities scattered  
**0:15:36-0:15:42:**  around the place in the Amazon that was very difficult to reach.  
**0:15:42-0:15:44:**  So we used the bolts.  
**0:15:44-0:15:51:**  Most of the time, the truck has to be carried in a bolt.  
**0:15:51-0:15:56:**  So there are so many little stories that would have been nice to present.  
**0:15:56-0:16:04:**  I'm trying to make it less boring of talking just about the system itself because there's  
**0:16:04-0:16:06:**  so much to be said about this project.  
**0:16:06-0:16:07:**  It's beautiful.  
**0:16:07-0:16:08:**  Inclusive.  
**0:16:08-0:16:15:**  We have a YouTube channel with a few videos of the implementation process with the farmers  
**0:16:15-0:16:19:**  showing the species, showing the adventure it was.  
**0:16:19-0:16:21:**  Yeah, you can really...  
**0:16:21-0:16:22:**  That's perfect.  
**0:16:22-0:16:34:**  I think what I could say about this project is that what you used is maintaining the big  
**0:16:34-0:16:40:**  business as usual of the farmers in the region, but applying a layer of agroforestry system  
**0:16:40-0:16:47:**  without changing the livelihood, not changing intrinsically, but changing in time.  
**0:16:47-0:16:54:**  So what we did was implementing those lines every 10 meters, the service trees, but not  
**0:16:54-0:16:59:**  changing the first years of production using cassava as they always did.  
**0:16:59-0:17:02:**  So this was maintained the same.  
**0:17:02-0:17:13:**  So we didn't have this shock that could end up making problems for the project acceptance.  
**0:17:13-0:17:15:**  And that was very good.  
**0:17:15-0:17:19:**  And basically that was the biggest difference.  
**0:17:19-0:17:24:**  And one more thing is that we used everything that was nearby.  
**0:17:24-0:17:31:**  So all the inputs was found by the farmers or if not by the farmers or not produced,  
**0:17:31-0:17:36:**  if it was not produced by them, it was acquired really nearby.  
**0:17:36-0:17:38:**  So it's completely sustainable.  
**0:17:38-0:17:40:**  We didn't bring anything from far away.  
**0:17:40-0:17:47:**  And it made it possible, including of course, the help from the farmers working in work  
**0:17:47-0:17:54:**  groups to make it for the price of your one-tenth of the normal price of one hectare of agroforestry  
**0:17:54-0:17:57:**  system in the region.  
**0:17:57-0:18:02:**  So that's a project that we like to talk about, but there are several others, but I'd like  
**0:18:02-0:18:04:**  to mention a special one that we are working with.  
**0:18:04-0:18:09:**  We call that Pasto Vivo, like a live pasture land.  
**0:18:09-0:18:17:**  The name is in Portuguese, Pasto Vivo is carried out by a group of investors, basically involving  
**0:18:17-0:18:24:**  Meraki Impact Investments and Luxor Group and Progreso Family Office.  
**0:18:24-0:18:33:**  And we are finalizing the design after all the acquirement of information in the field,  
**0:18:33-0:18:38:**  you are finalizing the design and the economical modeling right now, in the very moment we  
**0:18:38-0:18:40:**  are speaking to you now.  
**0:18:40-0:18:51:**  And it will start in 1200 hectares of cattle ranching, and it's supposed to be scaled for  
**0:18:51-0:18:56:**  23,000 hectares in the next years.  
**0:18:56-0:19:02:**  And we will be implementing these plots, the 1200 in the next months.  
**0:19:02-0:19:07:**  Now, it's still this year, if everything goes well with the rain pattern.  
**0:19:07-0:19:16:**  And that's a project that is basically cattle ranching in 30 meters intercropped lines of  
**0:19:16-0:19:27:**  grass, in a sustainable, improved pasture land, where you use also Cajunas and Titonia  
**0:19:27-0:19:29:**  to improve the cattle fodder.  
**0:19:29-0:19:42:**  And the trees, we are using a cashelnut with Brazilian native timber called Arrueta, and  
**0:19:42-0:19:47:**  also Makauba palm tree that produces essential oil.  
**0:19:47-0:19:51:**  And of course, those trees can be changed and the nuts can be changed.  
**0:19:51-0:19:55:**  And also Baru, which is another native nut.  
**0:19:55-0:19:59:**  Yeah, it's a very important and pricing one.  
**0:19:59-0:20:04:**  And of course, it's the same logic, as I will not repeat the part of the ecological niche  
**0:20:04-0:20:07:**  or functional niche, but they can change.  
**0:20:07-0:20:12:**  So not necessarily we have to maintain the cashelnut, but we are using the cashel also  
**0:20:12-0:20:16:**  for the cattle.  
**0:20:16-0:20:18:**  For fodder, right?  
**0:20:18-0:20:19:**  For the fruit.  
**0:20:19-0:20:22:**  The fruits are used for the cattle as well.  
**0:20:22-0:20:26:**  So that you can understand what the elasticity of this design is.  
**0:20:26-0:20:34:**  For instance, we have the Baru tree, which is a nut native from the Cerrado biome.  
**0:20:34-0:20:40:**  And it's very much appreciated in the last years in the market.  
**0:20:40-0:20:45:**  But if they choose, they can change the Baru for Carite, for instance.  
**0:20:45-0:20:50:**  It's another, which is the name of Carite?  
**0:20:50-0:20:51:**  Share butter.  
**0:20:51-0:20:52:**  Yeah, share butter.  
**0:20:52-0:20:56:**  They can exchange the Baru tree for share butter tree.  
**0:20:56-0:20:59:**  And that's an interesting opportunity in the market.  
**0:20:59-0:21:04:**  So if you find an opportunity in the market for a few years from now to sell the share  
**0:21:04-0:21:11:**  butter tree, to sell the share butter, you can choose to plant it instead of the Baru.  
**0:21:11-0:21:16:**  Or along with the Baru, you can intercalate it in the system.  
**0:21:16-0:21:22:**  And for instance, the cashelnut, if you want to change it, you can put macadamia in its  
**0:21:22-0:21:24:**  place.  
**0:21:24-0:21:28:**  So that in one line you have the cashelnut, in the other line you have the macadamia.  
**0:21:28-0:21:31:**  So you can have a biodiverse production system.  
**0:21:31-0:21:33:**  It will depend on the market.  
**0:21:33-0:21:38:**  It will depend on the availability of seeds and seedlings at the time that you're going  
**0:21:38-0:21:39:**  to plant.  
**0:21:39-0:21:45:**  It will depend also if the farmer is interested in that, if they have the know-how developed  
**0:21:45-0:21:48:**  and the knowledge to manage these species.  
**0:21:48-0:21:55:**  But step by step, every new plot that they will implement, they can add a new layer of  
**0:21:55-0:21:57:**  complexity.  
**0:21:57-0:22:03:**  So the first one will be complex, but not that much.  
**0:22:03-0:22:09:**  Let's try to simplify and choose species that we already know, we already understand, and  
**0:22:09-0:22:10:**  perfect.  
**0:22:10-0:22:15:**  So we implemented 10 hectares that it's a little bit easier so that we can learn the  
**0:22:15-0:22:16:**  management.  
**0:22:16-0:22:20:**  And then the next 10 hectares, we can add more complexity.  
**0:22:20-0:22:25:**  Next 10 hectares, a little bit more so that we can have the time also to find the market  
**0:22:25-0:22:26:**  for each species.  
**0:22:26-0:22:31:**  So that's the logic that we call the elasticity of the system.  
**0:22:31-0:22:33:**  Yeah, very well explained.  
**0:22:33-0:22:40:**  I just want to add that that's not an intrinsic agroforestry system.  
**0:22:40-0:22:47:**  It's kept being a normal system, but with regenerative approach, mainly regarding the  
**0:22:47-0:22:48:**  soil practices.  
**0:22:48-0:22:55:**  So all the intercropping lines, the 30 meters before the cattle coming, or I mean, like  
**0:22:55-0:23:02:**  for the three or four first years where the trees are still growing, the lines of trees,  
**0:23:02-0:23:09:**  we are having maize and soybeans being planted, but in a more regenerative way and using green  
**0:23:09-0:23:15:**  manure to soil covering during this time to aggregate more biomass to the soil.  
**0:23:15-0:23:25:**  So you have exactly the same farm producing maize, producing corn, producing soybean.  
**0:23:25-0:23:31:**  But at the same time, the trees are growing and you can expect much more income in the  
**0:23:31-0:23:33:**  future from the trees.  
**0:23:33-0:23:41:**  And as soon as the cattle comes, all the animal welfare is absolutely covered by the shade  
**0:23:41-0:23:45:**  and the better environment provided by those trees.  
**0:23:45-0:23:51:**  Furthermore, you have all the income from the non-timber forest products and the fodder  
**0:23:51-0:23:53:**  to the cattle.  
**0:23:53-0:23:57:**  And what's nice about this design is that we have cash flow since the first year.  
**0:23:57-0:24:06:**  So as soon as we plant the trees, we plant the maize as well in this 30 meter row in  
**0:24:06-0:24:08:**  between them.  
**0:24:08-0:24:15:**  And as soon as we harvest the maize, we plant the green manure.  
**0:24:15-0:24:20:**  Then the next year we plant the soybeans, we harvest the soybeans.  
**0:24:20-0:24:23:**  So the soil is never left bare.  
**0:24:23-0:24:26:**  It's always with a live covering.  
**0:24:26-0:24:34:**  And then in the fourth year, when we plant the next maize harvest, we plant also the  
**0:24:34-0:24:36:**  grass with it.  
**0:24:36-0:24:43:**  So as soon as you harvest the corn, the maize, you have the grass established.  
**0:24:43-0:24:52:**  And then in between this grass, we diversify with other kinds of fodder, like bush kinds  
**0:24:52-0:24:58:**  of fodder, like the cajon and the titonia, which are two species that are very, very  
**0:24:58-0:25:08:**  interesting for not only for soil improvement, but also for fodder diversification, especially  
**0:25:08-0:25:09:**  in the dry season.  
**0:25:09-0:25:15:**  Yeah, and basically we're just grasping the complexity of those systems and how we can  
**0:25:15-0:25:23:**  go deep into the economical modeling and indicators of the system and the expectations and prognosis  
**0:25:23-0:25:31:**  we are trying to design beforehand to understand what will be the management and which will  
**0:25:31-0:25:36:**  be the impact in the environment.  
**0:25:36-0:25:42:**  And for that, we are also calculating or having a methodology to imply which will be ecosystem  
**0:25:42-0:25:46:**  services that will arise from such a system.  
**0:25:46-0:25:53:**  And that is just a little bit of what we can say about our methodology.  
**0:25:53-0:26:02:**  But regarding the amplitude of our projects, we are starting now a more social project  
**0:26:02-0:26:10:**  in the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil, nearby where we have our farm, our Preta Terra farm.  
**0:26:10-0:26:18:**  That's like 400 kilometers from San Paulo capital, San Paulo city in the San Paulo state,  
**0:26:18-0:26:25:**  but in a very remote area, super remote with familiar agriculture and smallholder farmers.  
**0:26:25-0:26:33:**  And we are right now, this very December, we are starting a project funded by UBS Optimus  
**0:26:33-0:26:37:**  Foundation from UBS bank.  
**0:26:37-0:26:44:**  And they are financing the implementation of 100 hectares and you're involving 30 farmers,  
**0:26:44-0:26:49:**  30 families, and we are taking agroforesting plantations.  
**0:26:49-0:26:58:**  I'm sorry, I say again, we are taking coffee plantations that are monoculture so far, and  
**0:26:58-0:27:01:**  you are applying this layer of agroforestry.  
**0:27:01-0:27:08:**  So basically, mostly it will be coffee plantations that are being converted to agroforestry,  
**0:27:08-0:27:15:**  but we are also working with restoration of degraded lands, especially on springy waters.  
**0:27:15-0:27:21:**  So what we wanted to get into and to understand a bit better, digging into a few of the things  
**0:27:21-0:27:27:**  that you talked about now with especially the project in the Amazon and then in pasto  
**0:27:27-0:27:33:**  vivo, if I remember the name correctly, we're curious to know how, when you're including  
**0:27:33-0:27:37:**  all these extra tree species, and especially at such a scale, for example, with the second  
**0:27:37-0:27:43:**  project you described, it's going to incur a lot of management costs, and especially  
**0:27:43-0:27:48:**  with the support or the service species, as you call them, we'd be really curious to know  
**0:27:48-0:27:51:**  how you, you know, what's the economics behind that?  
**0:27:51-0:28:02:**  How do you make those species and make that extra complexity valuable economically?  
**0:28:02-0:28:03:**  That's a good question.  
**0:28:03-0:28:07:**  Well, first of all, each project is a new project.  
**0:28:07-0:28:14:**  So the one we implemented in the Amazon, it's a little bit more complex and relies more  
**0:28:14-0:28:20:**  on management of the trees, especially because we are dealing with the smallholder farmers  
**0:28:20-0:28:23:**  that they have a workforce available.  
**0:28:23-0:28:26:**  They have their family available too.  
**0:28:26-0:28:33:**  However, in this specific project, pasto vivo, which is in Matagrossa state here in Brazil,  
**0:28:33-0:28:40:**  in the Cerrado region, this project, well, since it's large scale, we cannot rely on  
**0:28:40-0:28:43:**  much of management on labor.  
**0:28:43-0:28:55:**  So what we do to plan the labor and especially the costs of the labor, we need to plan ahead,  
**0:28:55-0:29:02:**  to understand ahead for each species, which are going to be the management process.  
**0:29:02-0:29:09:**  So for instance, we know that we have the barrow tree and the barrow produces the cashew,  
**0:29:09-0:29:12:**  the nuts once a year.  
**0:29:12-0:29:13:**  Okay.  
**0:29:13-0:29:18:**  So we plan all the management involved in these specific species.  
**0:29:18-0:29:23:**  So for instance, we know that in the first year, three months after replanted, we need  
**0:29:23-0:29:26:**  to do a first pruning process.  
**0:29:26-0:29:31:**  So the first pruning process in the first year, and then every two years we do a, we  
**0:29:31-0:29:38:**  do a new formation pruning that we call right after the harvesting process.  
**0:29:38-0:29:45:**  And so we understand, okay, how much, and this is another very important aspect of the  
**0:29:45-0:29:49:**  financial modeling is that you need to do it by module.  
**0:29:49-0:29:56:**  That's why we call our systems modular because you either do it by hectare or by area, by  
**0:29:56-0:30:01:**  unit of area, or you do it by species, by tree or by plant.  
**0:30:01-0:30:08:**  So for instance, for one barrow, I know that for doing this formation pruning, I will take  
**0:30:08-0:30:11:**  30 seconds.  
**0:30:11-0:30:15:**  And so I can extrapolate that for the entire hectare.  
**0:30:15-0:30:19:**  I know that I'm going to plant, for instance, I'm not really sure.  
**0:30:19-0:30:20:**  I think 88, right?  
**0:30:20-0:30:24:**  88 trees of barrow in one hectare.  
**0:30:24-0:30:30:**  And so if I take 30 seconds to prune each one for this formation pruning, this first  
**0:30:30-0:30:37:**  year pruning, I will know how many minutes or how many hours I will take to manage the  
**0:30:37-0:30:39:**  entire hectare.  
**0:30:39-0:30:46:**  And I know how much it costs for the farmer to pay for one hour or for one day of labor  
**0:30:46-0:30:49:**  of one specialized person in pruning.  
**0:30:49-0:30:55:**  So if you're going to pay for, for instance, 100 reais, which is the currency there, 100  
**0:30:55-0:31:03:**  reais for one day of labor of eight hours, I will know how many trees this person will  
**0:31:03-0:31:05:**  prune in one day.  
**0:31:05-0:31:09:**  And then I will know how much this pruning will cost, right?  
**0:31:09-0:31:10:**  For each tree.  
**0:31:10-0:31:18:**  So the idea is that for every operation I have, and we're talking about a very large  
**0:31:18-0:31:25:**  chronogram with a very large number of operations, of course, because it is a complex system,  
**0:31:25-0:31:32:**  for each and every operation, I will know how much it will cost by tree per tree and  
**0:31:32-0:31:34:**  per hectare.  
**0:31:34-0:31:40:**  And in the end, I will know which is going to be the price, the least price that I have  
**0:31:40-0:31:45:**  to sell this product so that it is viable in the future.  
**0:31:45-0:31:52:**  So if I do all this process and I understand how much will the management of the, of the  
**0:31:52-0:31:58:**  barrow cost, and it doesn't cover the price that it's paying today in the market, I have  
**0:31:58-0:32:00:**  to change my design.  
**0:32:00-0:32:08:**  I either have to rethink about the management or I have to do it more, the operation better.  
**0:32:08-0:32:13:**  I have to improve my operation, maybe mechanize it, or I have to reduce the number of trees  
**0:32:13-0:32:19:**  per hectare, or I have to look for a better price in the market.  
**0:32:19-0:32:26:**  So the idea is not what is a viable system, a viable production system.  
**0:32:26-0:32:32:**  The selling price, the price the market will pay for you have got to cover your costs and  
**0:32:32-0:32:36:**  have got to give you some profit on it.  
**0:32:36-0:32:41:**  So you have to understand all the costs so that you know how much you're going to sell  
**0:32:41-0:32:42:**  it for.  
**0:32:42-0:32:47:**  And this is a very profound study that you have to do in each design so that you can  
**0:32:47-0:32:55:**  say, okay, this design is viable only if you sell the kilo of the nut of barrow per, for,  
**0:32:55-0:33:02:**  I don't know how many heyes, you know, so, so that you can make the, have the decision  
**0:33:02-0:33:07:**  making based on, on the financial modeling.  
**0:33:07-0:33:14:**  What's fascinating here is that on 1,500 hectares, or I can't remember exactly, you've managed  
**0:33:14-0:33:21:**  to work out that including trees 30 minutes, 30 meters apart covering this whole area is  
**0:33:21-0:33:24:**  profitable based on your current assumptions.  
**0:33:24-0:33:25:**  Is that correct?  
**0:33:25-0:33:27:**  That's more than correct.  
**0:33:27-0:33:35:**  And that's, it allows us to compliment the answer Paola has given so broadly.  
**0:33:35-0:33:41:**  In fact, when you have those other products there, it will be much more profitable.  
**0:33:41-0:33:49:**  And you're not talking about the profitability of a premium price because it's a regenerative,  
**0:33:49-0:33:58:**  organically or for any other thing or fair trade or any other stamp that you have on  
**0:33:58-0:34:00:**  your product or welfare.  
**0:34:00-0:34:07:**  But what you're talking about is that the barrow nut or the cash on that, it can compete  
**0:34:07-0:34:09:**  with the cattle in price.  
**0:34:09-0:34:14:**  So you are diversifying, having more income.  
**0:34:14-0:34:15:**  That's the idea.  
**0:34:15-0:34:17:**  So yes, the answer is yes.  
**0:34:17-0:34:26:**  I just, I just think it's important you compliment that you have environmental services, ecosystem  
**0:34:26-0:34:35:**  services being produced by such a system that will guarantee the resilience of your enterprise  
**0:34:35-0:34:40:**  because your soil is the most important asset you have.  
**0:34:40-0:34:47:**  And if you don't save, conserve, promote or keep your soil fertile, you lose income in  
**0:34:47-0:34:48:**  time.  
**0:34:48-0:34:49:**  So that's the first idea.  
**0:34:49-0:34:54:**  So you have to understand this and that's why you're applying agroforestry system.  
**0:34:54-0:34:56:**  But that's not enough, not in time.  
**0:34:56-0:35:04:**  So of course, we have embraced these challenges to ourselves as Preta Terra to make biodiversity  
**0:35:04-0:35:06:**  profitable and scalable.  
**0:35:06-0:35:11:**  And that's what we are trying to do and what you have been doing for over four years as  
**0:35:11-0:35:16:**  Preta Terra and what we are doing now in this Pasto Vivo project that is actually 1,200  
**0:35:16-0:35:22:**  hectares, this first plot, and in all the other projects.  
**0:35:22-0:35:28:**  And I'm wondering in that challenge that you've taken, what role has mechanization?  
**0:35:28-0:35:33:**  Because to explain, one of the problems we are confronted in in Massey Farm is the more  
**0:35:33-0:35:38:**  we can flexify systems, the harder it is to mechanize them in some cases.  
**0:35:38-0:35:43:**  And I'm wondering, have you invested time and research in mechanizing these systems  
**0:35:43-0:35:45:**  and innovating in that domain?  
**0:35:45-0:35:48:**  And how is that going for you?  
**0:35:48-0:35:49:**  Very good point.  
**0:35:49-0:35:56:**  So this domain that is one of the main challenges of agroforestry that is developing technology  
**0:35:56-0:36:05:**  and machinery that's not only for agriculture nor for forestry or civic culture, but for  
**0:36:05-0:36:07:**  agroforestry.  
**0:36:07-0:36:10:**  And that's what we have to develop together.  
**0:36:10-0:36:17:**  And yes, in this project, there is a lot of mechanization there because that's a large  
**0:36:17-0:36:24:**  farm and this is a group of investors that are putting the upfront money to make it to  
**0:36:24-0:36:25:**  happen.  
**0:36:25-0:36:30:**  So we can use mechanization and there was mechanization available.  
**0:36:30-0:36:38:**  But where our intelligence or our agroforestry intelligence comes in place is at the moment  
**0:36:38-0:36:45:**  where we choose the trees and the crops accordingly to what we already have in hands.  
**0:36:45-0:36:52:**  And we consider tree architecture and succession and strata to understand what would be the  
**0:36:52-0:36:54:**  best mechanization.  
**0:36:54-0:37:02:**  And so in that very example you mentioned, there is a lot of mechanization.  
**0:37:02-0:37:11:**  But if we come back to our first example in our talk today where we talked about the Amazon  
**0:37:11-0:37:15:**  example, there we have basically zero mechanization.  
**0:37:15-0:37:21:**  Let's say that you have a chainsaw sometimes or an only chainsaws, but nothing else.  
**0:37:21-0:37:22:**  So everything you're-  
**0:37:22-0:37:23:**  The earth auger.  
**0:37:23-0:37:27:**  The earth auger, this drill to make the holes.  
**0:37:27-0:37:28:**  Motorized.  
**0:37:28-0:37:29:**  Yeah.  
**0:37:29-0:37:35:**  And sometimes not always, but yeah, that was basically all the mechanization.  
**0:37:35-0:37:41:**  So depends where we are, mechanization is always good, but depending on the special  
**0:37:41-0:37:49:**  price you have or how steep is your land or how precise is the management of your system,  
**0:37:49-0:37:55:**  it's not really necessary, but definitely it's a challenge and you have to address mechanization  
**0:37:55-0:38:02:**  and prepare modular equipments, not huge equipments, but think about what we already have and can  
**0:38:02-0:38:06:**  be adapted to work properly on agroforestry.  
**0:38:06-0:38:12:**  So for you, it's going through developing specific tools or is it also that you're working  
**0:38:12-0:38:19:**  at a scale where you have such a huge amount of land that these farms can afford to have  
**0:38:19-0:38:21:**  many different machines?  
**0:38:21-0:38:24:**  Because to put things in context, one of the problems we often realize is when you're trying  
**0:38:24-0:38:30:**  to have a very diversified operation on a small scale, it's been very hard because if  
**0:38:30-0:38:35:**  you had to have all the machines that it takes to produce and process this diversity, it's  
**0:38:35-0:38:37:**  very hard to be economically viable.  
**0:38:37-0:38:41:**  But what's interesting in what you're doing is that you're working on thousands of hectares,  
**0:38:41-0:38:43:**  so maybe that problem doesn't occur so much.  
**0:38:43-0:38:50:**  Yeah, yeah, I think that we mentioned two projects that are very much, each one in the  
**0:38:50-0:38:51:**  extreme, right?  
**0:38:51-0:38:56:**  One that is without any mechanization and the other one is super mechanized.  
**0:38:56-0:39:08:**  Basically the size of the rows is defined by the size of the machines of the tractor.  
**0:39:08-0:39:15:**  The operations that we defined are defined by the implements that we have available in  
**0:39:15-0:39:17:**  the farm.  
**0:39:17-0:39:24:**  So for instance, one very important operation that we have in agroforestry is soil covering.  
**0:39:24-0:39:28:**  And especially covering in the lines, along the lines.  
**0:39:28-0:39:32:**  So this is a challenge that people are facing everywhere.  
**0:39:32-0:39:38:**  So how do you organize the soil covering and not do it by hand, right?  
**0:39:38-0:39:40:**  Just with a rake.  
**0:39:40-0:39:42:**  This is super inefficient.  
**0:39:42-0:39:49:**  And so actually in Fazenda da Toca, in Toca Farm where we used to work, we used to plant  
**0:39:49-0:39:58:**  the green manure and to mow the green manure mechanically with the tractor and then use  
**0:39:58-0:40:02:**  an implement called rotary rake.  
**0:40:02-0:40:09:**  So it's like a rake, but it rotates so that it throws all the biomass into a line.  
**0:40:09-0:40:16:**  It was very efficient, but the problem is that this is a very specific implement.  
**0:40:16-0:40:18:**  Not everybody has it available.  
**0:40:18-0:40:33:**  So in this farm, they have had available another truck with dispenser of biomass.  
**0:40:33-0:40:41:**  And this truck goes along the line and leaves the biomass along the line.  
**0:40:41-0:40:48:**  So they already had this available because they used it a long time ago when they used  
**0:40:48-0:40:55:**  to feed the animals.  
**0:40:55-0:40:58:**  So this is like a distributor of forage.  
**0:40:58-0:41:00:**  Yeah, forage wagon.  
**0:41:00-0:41:02:**  That's the name of this.  
**0:41:02-0:41:03:**  That's what we are using.  
**0:41:03-0:41:07:**  So the idea is that you need to understand your operations.  
**0:41:07-0:41:12:**  You need to understand what you're looking for, what is the results you need in the field,  
**0:41:12-0:41:18:**  and you need to understand the machineries you already have available so you will adapt.  
**0:41:18-0:41:21:**  So eventually you find a way to solve it.  
**0:41:21-0:41:26:**  But I think that Walter mentioned one of the most important point of views that we need  
**0:41:26-0:41:34:**  to have for mechanization, which is using modular machines.  
**0:41:34-0:41:38:**  So not only machines, but for instance, the EarthAlgar.  
**0:41:38-0:41:45:**  It's a very simple machine and you use it with a lot of, it's improved so much the work.  
**0:41:45-0:41:46:**  Yeah.  
**0:41:46-0:41:55:**  I mean, I think just to close this topic, not closing, but just to emphasize one point.  
**0:41:55-0:41:59:**  There are projects that you don't use any machinery, others that you use everything  
**0:41:59-0:42:03:**  that's available, like the wagon distributor.  
**0:42:03-0:42:10:**  There are places like this 100 hectares project from UBS that definitely we are having a tractor  
**0:42:10-0:42:12:**  in every plot.  
**0:42:12-0:42:22:**  We have a brush cutter to cut all the biomass, especially the grass, but also the pruning  
**0:42:22-0:42:28:**  material, all the biomass, the branches that are generated from the pruning, and that will  
**0:42:28-0:42:29:**  be necessary.  
**0:42:29-0:42:33:**  And since the 100 hectares are close by, this will be available.  
**0:42:33-0:42:41:**  So in this sense, you have this tractor to work within the coffee in the intercropping.  
**0:42:41-0:42:43:**  But there are others that we cannot.  
**0:42:43-0:42:50:**  But the main thing is try to adapt to what you already have and try to be modular.  
**0:42:50-0:42:51:**  That's what you are trying to do.  
**0:42:51-0:42:57:**  See what exists in Europe, in United States, or even China, and what you can do with this  
**0:42:57-0:43:05:**  like adapting machinery that are maybe used for another system or another kind of production,  
**0:43:05-0:43:09:**  but you can adjust it for our tropical purposes here.  
**0:43:09-0:43:11:**  So that's what you have been trying to do.  
**0:43:11-0:43:15:**  Something that I'm very curious about is, are there any machines that you use to prune  
**0:43:15-0:43:17:**  the trees?  
**0:43:17-0:43:25:**  What mechanization for tree pruning and tree management have you included in your modeling?  
**0:43:25-0:43:31:**  Well for this one, specific for tree pruning, we need to use the basics actually.  
**0:43:31-0:43:44:**  We use the scissors, we use the saw, and of course we have a motorized saw, but it's not  
**0:43:44-0:43:45:**  interesting to use actually.  
**0:43:45-0:43:48:**  You just use the motorized saw when…  
**0:43:48-0:43:50:**  And the multifunctional.  
**0:43:50-0:43:58:**  The multifunctional tool is probably what we most use with a chainsaw.  
**0:43:58-0:44:09:**  Yeah, but when you need to use a motorized saw, it's because the branch has grown too  
**0:44:09-0:44:13:**  much, like it's past the point of pruning.  
**0:44:13-0:44:21:**  So that's a very important challenge because it's not only the mechanization, so pruning,  
**0:44:21-0:44:26:**  even when you're talking about monocropping of trees, well here in Brazil we have a lot  
**0:44:26-0:44:30:**  of monocropping of trees, even for timber.  
**0:44:30-0:44:35:**  Like 20 years, you plant it now in a monocropping and you're just going to harvest it from  
**0:44:35-0:44:42:**  20 years from now, and you plan to have at least three or four pruning processes along  
**0:44:42-0:44:46:**  the cycle, along this 20 year cycle.  
**0:44:46-0:44:52:**  One of the other challenges that we come across is some things might make ecological sense.  
**0:44:52-0:44:56:**  You were talking about niches before, and so it might be tempting to fill in these niches  
**0:44:56-0:45:03:**  with certain plants that fit well in the agro-ecosystem, but that doesn't always fit the needs of  
**0:45:03-0:45:08:**  the markets, whether it's the local markets on more small-scale projects or the commodity  
**0:45:08-0:45:11:**  markets if you're working on large-scale projects.  
**0:45:11-0:45:17:**  So I'm wondering how you accommodate that tension sometimes between what makes sense  
**0:45:17-0:45:23:**  to design and ecologically and how you can actually sell that diversity afterwards.  
**0:45:23-0:45:30:**  Well I believe the main thing is to educate the consumer.  
**0:45:30-0:45:35:**  The storytelling is a very important part of the whole process, and that's what we are  
**0:45:35-0:45:42:**  doing here right now together, you guys, I mean you Etienne and Dimitri and with us,  
**0:45:42-0:45:45:**  Preta Terra and with all other people that you have interviewed so far.  
**0:45:45-0:45:50:**  That's our mission all together, because definitely we know that you have to do something for  
**0:45:50-0:45:55:**  the environment, we have to change the way you do agriculture and monoculture mainly  
**0:45:55-0:45:56:**  around the world.  
**0:45:56-0:46:03:**  So maybe you are just starting and grasping the very beginning of it, but it will be mainstream.  
**0:46:03-0:46:09:**  And we hope it will be mainstream as soon as possible.  
**0:46:09-0:46:15:**  And together with this we know that you are producing real food, food that are nutrient-dense  
**0:46:15-0:46:25:**  and that has all the benefits of being real food instead of ultra super mega processed  
**0:46:25-0:46:27:**  stuff from the industry.  
**0:46:27-0:46:33:**  And so we embrace this, we defend this, but we have to show this as well.  
**0:46:33-0:46:38:**  We have to go to the consumer, we have to tell people that what you are doing is the  
**0:46:38-0:46:43:**  right to do for the environment and for us as human beings.  
**0:46:43-0:46:46:**  And I think that's the main thing here.  
**0:46:46-0:46:51:**  We have to have a storytelling, you have to tell why you are doing agroforestry.  
**0:46:51-0:46:57:**  We love the planet, but we love to be real human beings and eat like humans.  
**0:46:57-0:47:02:**  I think that's the main purpose we have and that's why you do agroforestry, because you  
**0:47:02-0:47:05:**  like to eat.  
**0:47:05-0:47:13:**  Well I think that the most important challenge that farmers come across is the commercialization,  
**0:47:13-0:47:16:**  is to sell their products.  
**0:47:16-0:47:24:**  And especially today that, well, the farmers, they are the weak part of the chain, right?  
**0:47:24-0:47:29:**  The most explored and vulnerable part of the chain.  
**0:47:29-0:47:38:**  And especially if you only have one product, you only rely on one market.  
**0:47:38-0:47:41:**  And this is very dangerous for him.  
**0:47:41-0:47:45:**  It has a huge risk related to it.  
**0:47:45-0:47:52:**  So to diversify, for one hand it's harder, of course, because you need to know much more  
**0:47:52-0:47:59:**  about many other species and you need to access many other markets.  
**0:47:59-0:48:04:**  But in the other hand, you are much more safe, you are much more secure.  
**0:48:04-0:48:12:**  Because if you have only, for instance, soybeans to sell and you have a super crash in the  
**0:48:12-0:48:15:**  market, it lowers the price suddenly.  
**0:48:15-0:48:21:**  So while you thought you were going to sell, it costs nothing anymore, it's not worth it  
**0:48:21-0:48:22:**  for you.  
**0:48:22-0:48:27:**  So you just go bankrupt from one year to the other.  
**0:48:27-0:48:33:**  And on the other side, if you have, of course, there's no problem, you can sell commodity  
**0:48:33-0:48:35:**  by commodity prices, you can have them.  
**0:48:35-0:48:42:**  But you could also have diversified production that you sell locally, you sell to your neighbors,  
**0:48:42-0:48:51:**  you sell in a street fair or you sell for a regional supermarket, you sell for a regional  
**0:48:51-0:48:53:**  cooperative.  
**0:48:53-0:49:00:**  So you need to find in different scales, in different spheres, what are the markets that  
**0:49:00-0:49:01:**  you can access.  
**0:49:01-0:49:07:**  So if you have a global crisis, you still have the local communities buying your products.  
**0:49:07-0:49:10:**  So you're not going to die of hunger at least.  
**0:49:10-0:49:13:**  So this is the resilience.  
**0:49:13-0:49:18:**  And I understand it's hard to access this market, but it's much more safe for the farmers.  
**0:49:18-0:49:24:**  And that's what we're looking for, to give safety for the farmers, to make them understand  
**0:49:24-0:49:30:**  that diversity is their resilience, especially their economical resilience.  
**0:49:30-0:49:37:**  And I think this is the most important strategy to access markets in different scales, in  
**0:49:37-0:49:44:**  the local scale, the regional scale, in the national scale, in the international scale,  
**0:49:44-0:49:51:**  and working with other farmers in the region, trying to make a huge bulk of production to  
**0:49:51-0:49:53:**  sell it for a better price.  
**0:49:53-0:49:59:**  And farmers need to organize, of course, especially if you're a smallholder or a mediumholder  
**0:49:59-0:50:00:**  farmer.  
**0:50:00-0:50:08:**  You don't have a power, bargaining power, the market, but if you get together, you'll  
**0:50:08-0:50:14:**  be able to dictate the price much more than if you're alone, if you're by yourself.  
**0:50:14-0:50:17:**  So this is also a movement that is very important.  
**0:50:17-0:50:27:**  Farmers' organizations, so that they can understand that they can be a strong and powerful part  
**0:50:27-0:50:31:**  of the chain, not only the weakest and the most explored part.  
**0:50:31-0:50:39:**  And I think that's also the focus of our job, of our work, to give power to farmers, to  
**0:50:39-0:50:45:**  encourage them, to make them understand how powerful they are, if they organize, if they  
**0:50:45-0:50:51:**  plan ahead, and if they diversify and get more resilient.  
**0:50:51-0:50:59:**  Well, there's a lot to dig into there, and we'll have to do it on another episode or  
**0:50:59-0:51:01:**  at another time.  
**0:51:01-0:51:06:**  But definitely some very interesting strategies there for farmers to think about.  
**0:51:06-0:51:12:**  And this is something that's coming up as a theme as well in our interviews about selling  
**0:51:12-0:51:19:**  locally and the resilience that it brings about, stepping out of the commodity markets,  
**0:51:19-0:51:23:**  which is, as you said, not always easy for all farmers to do, especially when they're  
**0:51:23-0:51:26:**  already in the system and they have to transition out of it.  
**0:51:26-0:51:29:**  So that's really great.  
**0:51:29-0:51:36:**  And thank you so much for your time and for sharing your amazing story and work.

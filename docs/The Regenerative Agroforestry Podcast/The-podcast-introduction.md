### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sun, 02 Aug 2020 00:06:21)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:42:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:42-0:00:47:**  Hi everyone, and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:50:**  We're your hosts Dimitri and Etienne.  
**0:00:50-0:00:55:**  So today we're just thinking of presenting the podcast to you and kind of introducing  
**0:00:55-0:01:00:**  ourselves and introducing agroforestry as well for those who don't know about it and  
**0:01:00-0:01:04:**  giving you a bit of a preview into the next episode so you can understand what you can  
**0:01:04-0:01:05:**  expect.  
**0:01:05-0:01:11:**  So Dimitri, how about you just start and tell us a bit about yourself?  
**0:01:11-0:01:18:**  So hi everyone, I'm Dimitri, I'm 26 and I've been working with agroforestry for the past  
**0:01:18-0:01:19:**  four years.  
**0:01:19-0:01:27:**  I've been lucky to work and study alongside Ernst Gotch and Mark Sheppard where they inspired  
**0:01:27-0:01:32:**  me to start my own farm with my family in the south of Greece.  
**0:01:32-0:01:38:**  So this started, we started the farm two and a half years ago and Etienne joined us shortly  
**0:01:38-0:01:40:**  after as well.  
**0:01:40-0:01:47:**  And so we implemented an agroforestry, a complex agroforestry system greatly inspired by Ernst  
**0:01:47-0:01:50:**  Gotch's syntropic agroforestry.  
**0:01:50-0:01:56:**  And for now I've left the farm in my family's hands and I'm trying to expand my knowledge  
**0:01:56-0:02:01:**  and experience in agroecology and agroforestry.  
**0:02:01-0:02:09:**  I'm passionate about all the technical aspects of agroforestry and agronomy from soil science  
**0:02:09-0:02:10:**  to tractor tools.  
**0:02:10-0:02:12:**  I love digging into the details.  
**0:02:12-0:02:14:**  Over to you Etienne.  
**0:02:14-0:02:21:**  Hey yeah so I'm Etienne, also 26, and so Dimitri and I met at university where we were already  
**0:02:21-0:02:26:**  really good friends, although we did speak a bit less about agriculture at that time.  
**0:02:26-0:02:31:**  But yeah so when he told me that he was starting a farm in Greece with his family, I got really  
**0:02:31-0:02:36:**  excited and I joined him there and that's how I got involved as well.  
**0:02:36-0:02:42:**  And before that, back in university I studied environmental politics and then went to work  
**0:02:42-0:02:46:**  for an organization in Paris for about a year.  
**0:02:46-0:02:51:**  And while I'm now back in France and I'm in the process of starting an agroforestry farm  
**0:02:51-0:02:58:**  there, I'm really passionate about developing accessible and scalable farming systems where  
**0:02:58-0:03:04:**  we can combine high production and ecological regeneration and doing that while producing  
**0:03:04-0:03:07:**  a decent income for farmers.  
**0:03:07-0:03:11:**  So let's start by trying to define agroforestry then.  
**0:03:11-0:03:16:**  Well there's actually a lot of definitions out there but the simplest one we found was  
**0:03:16-0:03:21:**  just that it's the interaction between agriculture and trees.  
**0:03:21-0:03:26:**  And more specifically for us that means integrating trees and shrubs with other productive elements  
**0:03:26-0:03:33:**  and creating like that synergistic relationships that make farms more productive, more profitable,  
**0:03:33-0:03:35:**  and ecologically sound.  
**0:03:35-0:03:41:**  So among some typical practices you may know, you'll find for example alley cropping where  
**0:03:41-0:03:47:**  you just grow crops between rows of trees, silver pasture where you integrate trees and  
**0:03:47-0:03:53:**  animals, we also talk about support species which just means putting wild trees among  
**0:03:53-0:04:02:**  an orchard, and then other terms such as windbreaks, hedges, riparian zones and planting them out.  
**0:04:02-0:04:06:**  Well you might think I'm not talking about anything new here and exactly, I mean trees  
**0:04:06-0:04:11:**  have been playing an important role in agriculture for thousands of years and in Western Europe  
**0:04:11-0:04:18:**  where we're from, hedges and pollarded trees were essential for protecting crops from the  
**0:04:18-0:04:24:**  elements at the same time producing wood on a regular basis and also fodder for animals,  
**0:04:24-0:04:27:**  so really multi-purpose and multi-functional.  
**0:04:27-0:04:31:**  But what happens is that during and since the green revolution, well farmers were heavily  
**0:04:31-0:04:35:**  incentivized to cut down their trees and still are today.  
**0:04:35-0:04:43:**  And even if that's the case, well in many parts of the world you still find trees, animals  
**0:04:43-0:04:45:**  and crops all integrated together.  
**0:04:45-0:04:50:**  And if you go to Costa Rica you might see coffee grown under shade trees, if you go  
**0:04:50-0:04:55:**  to China, paulownia into a crop with grain, or vegetables grown under coconut trees in  
**0:04:55-0:04:57:**  Tanzania.  
**0:04:57-0:05:02:**  And today many organizations and farmers are reviving traditional agroforestry systems  
**0:05:02-0:05:06:**  or they're inventing new ones altogether.  
**0:05:06-0:05:11:**  And there's a great diversity, some are simple like alley cropping with one type of tree  
**0:05:11-0:05:18:**  in a monoculture, while others like the ones we did and are doing in Mazze Farm are much  
**0:05:18-0:05:24:**  more complex as they try to mimic forest dynamics and integrate a lot of diversity.  
**0:05:24-0:05:28:**  And we're not really interested in trying to establish that one approach is better than  
**0:05:28-0:05:29:**  the other one.  
**0:05:29-0:05:33:**  Rather like we really like that diversity and we'd like to explore all the different  
**0:05:33-0:05:40:**  models that they are and what they offer in different contexts.  
**0:05:40-0:05:44:**  So what does agroforestry have to offer?  
**0:05:44-0:05:49:**  It seems that there is a trade-off between farmers' interests in the environment, or  
**0:05:49-0:05:51:**  at least often so.  
**0:05:51-0:05:57:**  But imagine a farm that's highly productive and also hosts a functioning ecosystem.  
**0:05:57-0:06:02:**  Imagine we can produce food while tackling some of the key challenges we face, such as  
**0:06:02-0:06:07:**  soil fertility, water quality, and climate change.  
**0:06:07-0:06:12:**  And how about doing this in a way that strengthens the farmers' business instead of sacrificing  
**0:06:12-0:06:14:**  it?  
**0:06:14-0:06:19:**  And although this seems like a utopia, we're convinced that it's possible.  
**0:06:19-0:06:22:**  And agroforestry has a strong role to play in making this a reality.  
**0:06:22-0:06:26:**  So let's take a closer look.  
**0:06:26-0:06:30:**  Agroforestry can have a direct impact on the business model of the farm.  
**0:06:30-0:06:36:**  And although it struggles to provide short-term cash flow, if done well, it has the potential  
**0:06:36-0:06:39:**  to increase farm profitability.  
**0:06:39-0:06:45:**  A study in Europe found that farm profitability can increase by as much as 15 to 53% when  
**0:06:45-0:06:48:**  implementing agroforestry systems.  
**0:06:48-0:06:52:**  It does this in various ways.  
**0:06:52-0:06:55:**  One of them is bringing more diversity into the farm.  
**0:06:55-0:07:00:**  Different types of crops means different sources of income, which means that when it's a tough  
**0:07:00-0:07:07:**  year for your main crop, you might get something from those nut trees, for example.  
**0:07:07-0:07:10:**  Diversity in the ecosystem is also very beneficial.  
**0:07:10-0:07:14:**  For example, if you're raising sheep in a silver pasture system, in times of drought  
**0:07:14-0:07:19:**  where the grass is all dried up, you can still use fodder from the trees that you planted  
**0:07:19-0:07:21:**  for this purpose.  
**0:07:21-0:07:28:**  So however you look at it, diversity is a good ally in mitigating risk, whether it is  
**0:07:28-0:07:34:**  from climate irregularities or market variations and shocks.  
**0:07:34-0:07:38:**  Another way of looking at it is stacking production.  
**0:07:38-0:07:44:**  This means increasing the total production by making better use of the vertical space  
**0:07:44-0:07:46:**  on the farm.  
**0:07:46-0:07:52:**  By properly placing one productive element over another, such as walnuts over wheat,  
**0:07:52-0:07:57:**  the overall productivity of the land can be increased even though the individual wheat  
**0:07:57-0:08:00:**  or walnut yield is smaller.  
**0:08:00-0:08:04:**  So choosing the right associations of the plants and the right spacing is key to this  
**0:08:04-0:08:07:**  type of success.  
**0:08:07-0:08:12:**  Another way in which trees can be beneficial to the farmer is that they can make the application  
**0:08:12-0:08:17:**  of fertilizers, whether organic or not, much more effective.  
**0:08:17-0:08:22:**  Studies have shown that covering 10% of the farmland with trees can reduce nutrient leaching  
**0:08:22-0:08:24:**  by more than 80%.  
**0:08:24-0:08:30:**  These otherwise lost nutrients are absorbed by the deep-rooted tree roots and thus cycled  
**0:08:30-0:08:37:**  back into the system or even transformed into tree crops such as wood, biomass, or fruit  
**0:08:37-0:08:40:**  and nuts.  
**0:08:40-0:08:47:**  All farmers, and indeed all humans, depend at some level on the services ecosystems provide  
**0:08:47-0:08:49:**  for free.  
**0:08:49-0:08:53:**  Agroforestry is a great way of harnessing several services on the farm.  
**0:08:53-0:08:59:**  Hedges create habitat for beneficial insects and birds, which improves pest management.  
**0:08:59-0:09:06:**  Perennial roots reduce soil erosion and increase soil organic matter, which benefits fertility.  
**0:09:06-0:09:11:**  These provide windbreaks that reduce plant stress, especially in drought conditions.  
**0:09:11-0:09:19:**  Overall, these services, and many more, create a buffer against climate extremes whilst helping  
**0:09:19-0:09:23:**  stabilize production and reducing farm costs.  
**0:09:23-0:09:30:**  Not only are these services extremely useful, but at the same time they provide a crop.  
**0:09:30-0:09:36:**  These are all the reasons why, as farmers, we're excited by the potential of agroforestry  
**0:09:36-0:09:43:**  and the way it can improve our management and our operations.  
**0:09:43-0:09:48:**  If we look beyond the farm, agroforestry can offer tools to address some urgent problems  
**0:09:48-0:09:50:**  our world faces.  
**0:09:50-0:09:57:**  Indeed, if applied at a sufficient scale, it can impact positively whole biomes, ecosystems,  
**0:09:57-0:09:58:**  and continents.  
**0:09:58-0:10:04:**  And this may seem like quite a bold statement, but there is serious amount of science and  
**0:10:04-0:10:06:**  empirical evidence backing this up.  
**0:10:06-0:10:09:**  So let's take two examples.  
**0:10:09-0:10:13:**  Agricultural pollution is damaging our rivers, lakes, and aquifers.  
**0:10:13-0:10:20:**  This is not only tragic for biodiversity and nature, but it's also costing human societies  
**0:10:20-0:10:22:**  a lot of money.  
**0:10:22-0:10:27:**  In France alone, for example, over 1 billion euros per year is spent on purifying water  
**0:10:27-0:10:31:**  from pollution specifically linked to agriculture.  
**0:10:31-0:10:37:**  And that is paid directly by the consumer through their water bill.  
**0:10:37-0:10:41:**  Reducing erosion and nutrient leaching through increased tree cover, amongst other things,  
**0:10:41-0:10:45:**  could bring that bill drastically down.  
**0:10:45-0:10:50:**  In addition to all of these things, trees turn out to be really good at something else,  
**0:10:50-0:10:55:**  and that's removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in their biomass  
**0:10:55-0:10:57:**  and in the soil.  
**0:10:57-0:11:01:**  Given the disruptive effects that climate change is already having on agriculture and  
**0:11:01-0:11:06:**  the direction we're heading in, agroforestry surely has an important role in addressing  
**0:11:06-0:11:09:**  this challenge.  
**0:11:09-0:11:14:**  What this means is that farmers can contribute to solving some of the most pressing issues  
**0:11:14-0:11:16:**  of our time.  
**0:11:16-0:11:22:**  Not only is that exciting in itself, but there's an increasing number of paying for ecosystem  
**0:11:22-0:11:27:**  services schemes, where farmers are starting to get paid for the environmental benefits  
**0:11:27-0:11:30:**  of their management practices.  
**0:11:30-0:11:35:**  Farmers are already getting paid for providing clean water and capturing carbon on their  
**0:11:35-0:11:39:**  farms, and the trend seems to be growing.  
**0:11:39-0:11:44:**  It's important to remember that our agricultural systems depend on the functioning of our natural  
**0:11:44-0:11:45:**  systems.  
**0:11:45-0:11:49:**  And although agroforestry is not the only tool out there, it has potential in bringing  
**0:11:49-0:11:53:**  some harmony back into our relationship with nature.  
**0:11:53-0:11:59:**  So you might be wondering, if it's that amazing and obvious, why is agroforestry not more  
**0:11:59-0:12:00:**  common?  
**0:12:00-0:12:03:**  And although there is a lot to be excited about, there remains a number of points that  
**0:12:03-0:12:06:**  we need to work on.  
**0:12:06-0:12:10:**  Some of these obstacles are systemic, for example with subsidy systems that often lead  
**0:12:10-0:12:13:**  to cutting trees down rather than planting them.  
**0:12:13-0:12:16:**  And some other occur at the farm level.  
**0:12:16-0:12:21:**  Many farmers remain skeptical that agroforestry is profitable and are worried that it will  
**0:12:21-0:12:24:**  just make their life more complicated.  
**0:12:24-0:12:28:**  These are legitimate concerns, and it will take solid data and successful local examples  
**0:12:28-0:12:31:**  to overcome them.  
**0:12:31-0:12:34:**  Even for those who want to give it a go, it's not that easy.  
**0:12:34-0:12:40:**  To make it work, it requires smart design and careful integration of various elements,  
**0:12:40-0:12:44:**  such as which genetics to use, what is the appropriate infrastructure and where to source  
**0:12:44-0:12:48:**  it, having good management techniques, and understanding the interactions between the  
**0:12:48-0:12:51:**  different elements of the system.  
**0:12:51-0:12:57:**  This specific expertise takes time to develop, and is sometimes hard to have access to.  
**0:12:57-0:13:02:**  This podcast probably won't single-handedly overcome all of these issues, but we do hope  
**0:13:02-0:13:06:**  that it can be a place where we can share valuable information, have good conversations  
**0:13:06-0:13:09:**  with the right people, and all learn together.  
**0:13:09-0:13:14:**  And hopefully you'll find inspiration as well as practical tools that help you on your current  
**0:13:14-0:13:16:**  or future projects.  
**0:13:16-0:13:21:**  You might have noticed that we included in our podcast title the term regenerative alongside  
**0:13:21-0:13:23:**  agroforestry.  
**0:13:23-0:13:28:**  As Dimitri explains, agroforestry holds great promise as a tool of regeneration on many  
**0:13:28-0:13:32:**  scales, and it's that potential that we want to highlight.  
**0:13:32-0:13:37:**  We don't use the word as another label or to be exclusive, rather it's about stating  
**0:13:37-0:13:41:**  the direction of a journey that everyone is welcome to join.  
**0:13:41-0:13:47:**  In that journey, we'll investigate all the ways we can make agroforestry work in practice.  
**0:13:47-0:13:51:**  We want this to be as practical as possible, and avoid too much theory where everything  
**0:13:51-0:13:55:**  sounds so amazing but you have no idea how to get there.  
**0:13:55-0:13:59:**  We'll talk to farmers who have set up successful agroforestry systems to understand how they've  
**0:13:59-0:14:00:**  done it.  
**0:14:00-0:14:05:**  We'll ask scientists how their research can help us build better systems, and we'll interview  
**0:14:05-0:14:09:**  anyone who can bring their expertise to the conversation, whether it be about funding  
**0:14:09-0:14:10:**  or marketing.  
**0:14:10-0:14:16:**  With them, we'll be exploring questions such as what trees to include, how to manage them,  
**0:14:16-0:14:20:**  or what business models are appropriate for agroforestry farms.  
**0:14:20-0:14:25:**  We'll have in-depth conversations with them to really establish what works and what doesn't.  
**0:14:25-0:14:27:**  So that's the end of our day view episode.  
**0:14:27-0:14:30:**  Thank you so much for listening.  
**0:14:30-0:14:35:**  I hope that we managed to get across the essential message of what we're going to be doing on  
**0:14:35-0:14:39:**  this podcast and what our approach is going to be like.  
**0:14:39-0:14:45:**  So other than that, as you maybe perceived, we're kind of new to this whole podcast thing  
**0:14:45-0:14:50:**  and we would love to receive some feedback or some tips.  
**0:14:50-0:14:53:**  And even better, we would really like if you could share with us people that you'd like  
**0:14:53-0:14:57:**  to see on this show, be it farmers, scientists, whoever you think has something to contribute  
**0:14:57-0:15:01:**  to this agroforestry conversation.  
**0:15:01-0:15:06:**  You'll also be able to find us on social media, on Instagram and Facebook if you type in regenerative  
**0:15:06-0:15:11:**  agroforestry podcast, and we also have a website regenerativeagroforestry.org where you're  
**0:15:11-0:15:16:**  going to find all the resources that are backing up everything that we said in this podcast.  
**0:15:16-0:15:20:**  So thank you so much for listening and I really hope that you enjoyed this as much as we did  
**0:15:20-0:15:39:**  and we look forward to seeing you next time.

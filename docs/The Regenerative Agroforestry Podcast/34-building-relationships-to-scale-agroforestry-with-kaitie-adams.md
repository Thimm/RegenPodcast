### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 31 Jan 2022 15:41:28)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:45:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:50:**  Hi and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:50-0:00:54:**  Those of you who tuned in to episode 33 will be familiar with the Savannah Institute by  
**0:00:54-0:00:55:**  now.  
**0:00:55-0:01:00:**  Well, today I talk with Katie Adams, she leads their Illinois Demonstration Farm program  
**0:01:00-0:01:05:**  and helps build community through agroforestry education across the state and beyond.  
**0:01:05-0:01:11:**  As we have progressed in the podcast series and in our own personal experiences, Dimitri  
**0:01:11-0:01:16:**  and I have come to realize how important the human relationships and cultural perceptions  
**0:01:16-0:01:19:**  were to successful agroforestry projects.  
**0:01:19-0:01:25:**  Sometimes even more so than technical or economic constraints that we have often exposed here.  
**0:01:25-0:01:30:**  This is why I'm so thrilled that Katie and I explored together how the Savannah Institute  
**0:01:30-0:01:35:**  builds relationships with different stakeholders to make agroforestry projects become a reality  
**0:01:35-0:01:37:**  in the Midwest.  
**0:01:37-0:01:41:**  We engage with themes such as culture in relation to agroforestry and the multiple ways the  
**0:01:41-0:01:44:**  Savannah Institute is leveraging change.  
**0:01:44-0:01:49:**  We also took the time to discuss their demonstration sites, their design methodology working with  
**0:01:49-0:01:54:**  local farmers, as well as debriefing on certain of their mistakes and lessons learned.  
**0:01:54-0:01:55:**  Enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:55-0:01:59:**  Hi, Katie, and welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:59-0:02:02:**  Hello, thank you so much for having me.  
**0:02:02-0:02:04:**  I'm so excited to be here.  
**0:02:04-0:02:09:**  Maybe we could start by you telling us a bit about how you got involved with agroforestry.  
**0:02:09-0:02:11:**  Sure.  
**0:02:11-0:02:13:**  It's kind of a long story.  
**0:02:13-0:02:21:**  I feel like my trajectory is an anthropologist turned no-till veggie farmer turned agroforester.  
**0:02:21-0:02:25:**  So these things don't seem to be related, but there's actually quite a few of us, at  
**0:02:25-0:02:33:**  least in the United States, that have kind of wandered our way to trees and agroforestry.  
**0:02:33-0:02:39:**  But my background in training is really in relationship building through my work in agroforestry.  
**0:02:39-0:02:46:**  So my master's degree focused on the ways that small-scale farmers build relationships  
**0:02:46-0:02:53:**  through seed saving and the exchange of mushroom cultures and start to build kind of regionally  
**0:02:53-0:03:00:**  adapted varieties such as garlic or ginger and start to share knowledges to prop up kind  
**0:03:00-0:03:02:**  of entire farming systems.  
**0:03:02-0:03:08:**  And so my career in farming kind of started through doing that work where I realized that  
**0:03:08-0:03:15:**  I enjoyed the actual work of agriculture way more than I enjoyed the writing and thinking  
**0:03:15-0:03:19:**  about agriculture, although I still do that today.  
**0:03:19-0:03:25:**  And then I became a no-till veggie farmer and did that for close to four years.  
**0:03:25-0:03:29:**  And my body was really tired.  
**0:03:29-0:03:35:**  And I became increasingly interested in the trees that were growing as part of the no-till  
**0:03:35-0:03:40:**  veggie system that I was working in at a farm and nonprofit called Earth Dance Organic Farm  
**0:03:40-0:03:41:**  School.  
**0:03:41-0:03:46:**  And I had pretty intensive vegetable fruit alley cropping happening, although I had no  
**0:03:46-0:03:49:**  idea it was called alley cropping.  
**0:03:49-0:03:53:**  We kind of called it permaculture and inner cropping and things like that.  
**0:03:53-0:04:01:**  And when I decided to move on from that job, I was looking for work within the more perennial  
**0:04:01-0:04:08:**  realm and trying to look for things that were kind of outside of the vegetable farming background.  
**0:04:08-0:04:13:**  And I came to find a job with Kevin Wohl, who's the co-executive director of the Savannah  
**0:04:13-0:04:15:**  Institute.  
**0:04:15-0:04:21:**  And that job really introduced me to what agroforestry was, because I honestly had never  
**0:04:21-0:04:28:**  heard that term until about four years ago when I found that job.  
**0:04:28-0:04:29:**  So kind of a winding path.  
**0:04:29-0:04:30:**  Yeah.  
**0:04:30-0:04:31:**  Yeah.  
**0:04:31-0:04:35:**  But it's amazing to see all the different ways people interact with agroforestry as  
**0:04:35-0:04:36:**  well.  
**0:04:36-0:04:41:**  And also that's why we wanted to talk with you today and also explore a bit about that  
**0:04:41-0:04:46:**  more social side to agroforestry and farming and creating relationships and creating change  
**0:04:46-0:04:48:**  through relationships.  
**0:04:48-0:04:52:**  But before we go to that, why don't you tell us a bit more about the Savannah Institute  
**0:04:52-0:04:54:**  and how it operates?  
**0:04:54-0:05:00:**  So the Savannah Institute is a nonprofit organization that's based in the Midwestern United States.  
**0:05:00-0:05:07:**  And we're really focused on the catalyzation of widespread agroforestry in the Midwestern  
**0:05:07-0:05:08:**  U.S. and beyond.  
**0:05:08-0:05:11:**  So we do this in a couple different ways.  
**0:05:11-0:05:16:**  We kind of focus on three different areas.  
**0:05:16-0:05:18:**  The first is research.  
**0:05:18-0:05:24:**  So we have folks on staff that are really looking at what are the productive, resilient  
**0:05:24-0:05:30:**  tree crops for fruit and fodder for agroforestry systems that would work here in the Midwest  
**0:05:30-0:05:32:**  specifically.  
**0:05:32-0:05:36:**  And then also looking at building robust supply chains.  
**0:05:36-0:05:42:**  So what are all the other structures that are needed to make agroforestry not only possible  
**0:05:42-0:05:48:**  but profitable here in the Midwest but also the greater United States as well?  
**0:05:48-0:05:53:**  And then we have a research team that's also looking at different things like water quality  
**0:05:53-0:06:01:**  and carbon sequestration and research around the practices that we employ on the landscape.  
**0:06:01-0:06:06:**  And then the second big arm of what we do can kind of be classified as generally the  
**0:06:06-0:06:10:**  farming systems that create agroforestry.  
**0:06:10-0:06:18:**  So looking at the different ways that these practices create economic and ecological resilience.  
**0:06:18-0:06:21:**  And this is kind of where our demonstration farm program ties in.  
**0:06:21-0:06:27:**  So the Savannah Institute operates a network of demonstration farms to show what agroforestry  
**0:06:27-0:06:31:**  looks like in different places and all the possibilities.  
**0:06:31-0:06:38:**  And then we also have an apprenticeship program which pairs folks that are interested in learning  
**0:06:38-0:06:44:**  how to do agroforestry with mentor farmers that have been doing this work for an extended  
**0:06:44-0:06:48:**  amount of time and have an immense amount of knowledge and wisdom to share.  
**0:06:48-0:06:53:**  And then we also just offer a ton of online and in-person resources such as field days  
**0:06:53-0:07:01:**  and events and an annual perennial farm gathering as well as an online course that's currently  
**0:07:01-0:07:03:**  free right now to everyone.  
**0:07:03-0:07:10:**  So we've been building this online course to really make agroforestry education accessible.  
**0:07:10-0:07:17:**  And then I guess the third kind of arm of what we do is community development and relationship  
**0:07:17-0:07:18:**  building.  
**0:07:18-0:07:24:**  So humans are an integral part of our ecosystems and a major part of agroforestry.  
**0:07:24-0:07:31:**  So it's one of our focuses to help build communities around this work.  
**0:07:31-0:07:38:**  So bringing together farmers and researchers and investors and folks that are really interested  
**0:07:38-0:07:45:**  in making agroforestry a force on the landscape.  
**0:07:45-0:07:49:**  Given all these amazing things, what is your role specifically then?  
**0:07:49-0:07:54:**  Yeah, so my role is, I guess my title is community agroforestry.  
**0:07:54-0:07:59:**  And I do this work in the state of Illinois here in the Midwest, which is a major corn  
**0:07:59-0:08:01:**  and soy producing state.  
**0:08:01-0:08:07:**  Most of the agriculture that happens here is corn and soybean production with a little  
**0:08:07-0:08:11:**  bit of wheat, but mostly those two major crops.  
**0:08:11-0:08:19:**  And broadly, my role is to help farmers, landowners, organizations, and agencies see agroforestry  
**0:08:19-0:08:23:**  as possible on their landscapes.  
**0:08:23-0:08:25:**  So that's a lot of education.  
**0:08:25-0:08:30:**  It's a lot of outreach and just a lot of really long, deep conversations with folks to really  
**0:08:30-0:08:35:**  understand what's happening in their lives and in their farm landscapes.  
**0:08:35-0:08:43:**  How can agroforestry fit into that and be productive for the ecosystem, be productive  
**0:08:43-0:08:47:**  for their families and for the community at large?  
**0:08:47-0:08:53:**  Because we really need supportive systems that go all the way from the farm scale to  
**0:08:53-0:09:02:**  the legislature to make sure that we have the support and the funding and also the acceptance  
**0:09:02-0:09:06:**  that's needed for more trees to be on the farm landscape.  
**0:09:06-0:09:08:**  Well yeah, that's fascinating.  
**0:09:08-0:09:13:**  And it echoes with something I've realized recently in the process of planting trees  
**0:09:13-0:09:20:**  on the farm where I'm farming and I'm not owning the land, I'm renting it off and having  
**0:09:20-0:09:25:**  to convince the farmer that's leasing the land to me that it would be valuable to add  
**0:09:25-0:09:26:**  trees.  
**0:09:26-0:09:30:**  And many of the obstacles aren't economic because there's funding at the moment.  
**0:09:30-0:09:34:**  It's not even technical because it's simply putting hedges out.  
**0:09:34-0:09:37:**  We're not attempting to do something so complex, but it's definitely cultural.  
**0:09:37-0:09:43:**  And it's about his perception and understanding of what the landscape should be.  
**0:09:43-0:09:44:**  What was it before?  
**0:09:44-0:09:46:**  Where should it go?  
**0:09:46-0:09:47:**  What are the rules of trees?  
**0:09:47-0:09:52:**  And I find that fascinating because we often overemphasize more the economics and the technical  
**0:09:52-0:09:54:**  with Dimitri in the podcast.  
**0:09:54-0:09:57:**  And increasingly I'm realizing that a lot of the blockages are much more on a cultural  
**0:09:57-0:09:58:**  level.  
**0:09:58-0:10:02:**  So what's your opinion if that's something you experienced as well when you work in community  
**0:10:02-0:10:03:**  building?  
**0:10:03-0:10:07:**  Yeah, I mean the situation that you find yourself in is a situation that we find ourselves in  
**0:10:07-0:10:09:**  here in the Midwestern United States.  
**0:10:09-0:10:15:**  So it's something that's shared I think across a lot of different geographies and landscapes.  
**0:10:15-0:10:23:**  And I think your point of people thinking of what should a farm look like or how should  
**0:10:23-0:10:30:**  a farm function is a little bit at the heart of that because so many, as you said, so many  
**0:10:30-0:10:37:**  of those hard points are cultural and they're not economic or ecological because we have  
**0:10:37-0:10:38:**  good data, right?  
**0:10:38-0:10:46:**  We have the numbers to show that trees are sinking carbon, they're purifying water, they  
**0:10:46-0:10:55:**  increasingly can create more production and more profits per acre than say grain monocrops.  
**0:10:55-0:10:58:**  But it doesn't look right to folks.  
**0:10:58-0:11:01:**  And the time scale is completely different.  
**0:11:01-0:11:07:**  We're so used to an annual cropping cycle or even a two or three year cropping cycle  
**0:11:07-0:11:09:**  or rotations.  
**0:11:09-0:11:14:**  And when we bring trees into it, we're suddenly making a long-term investment.  
**0:11:14-0:11:19:**  I mean, these are things that are going to be on the landscape for a long time.  
**0:11:19-0:11:25:**  And folks, especially here in the United States, I think we have a pretty short memory and  
**0:11:25-0:11:26:**  a pretty short history.  
**0:11:26-0:11:31:**  So we think of things in one generation instead of in multiple generations.  
**0:11:31-0:11:38:**  And trees force us to confront that we're not going to be able to control something  
**0:11:38-0:11:43:**  or a farm or a landscape or a system for one lifetime.  
**0:11:43-0:11:49:**  Trees kind of force us to look beyond one singular lifetime and look more to the future.  
**0:11:49-0:11:53:**  And so those are really hard conversations to have with folks because ultimately they're  
**0:11:53-0:12:01:**  conversations around value and timelines and legacy and all of these things that annual  
**0:12:01-0:12:07:**  cropping systems just don't force us to look at.  
**0:12:07-0:12:12:**  And so once you've established that this is cultural, how do you actually proceed in trying  
**0:12:12-0:12:15:**  to take the conversation forward?  
**0:12:15-0:12:19:**  What kind of stories or what angles do you take in engaging that dialogue?  
**0:12:19-0:12:25:**  Yeah, this is something that I definitely don't have a for sure or clear answer on because  
**0:12:25-0:12:28:**  it's something that we're continually working on.  
**0:12:28-0:12:35:**  And every person we talk to is different and they come to agroforestry from all different  
**0:12:35-0:12:43:**  types of backgrounds and histories and passions and things that they value.  
**0:12:43-0:12:50:**  So oftentimes the conversation around agroforestry isn't one that we start right away, but it's  
**0:12:50-0:12:52:**  one that comes in a little bit later.  
**0:12:52-0:12:57:**  So for folks that come to us and want to do agroforestry, it's a little bit of a different  
**0:12:57-0:12:58:**  conversation.  
**0:12:58-0:13:05:**  For say farmers or landowners that we're looking to work with or specifically in situations  
**0:13:05-0:13:09:**  where the landowner is very interested in agroforestry, but the farmer that they work  
**0:13:09-0:13:16:**  with is not familiar or maybe very hesitant or skeptical, then it's often a conversation  
**0:13:16-0:13:24:**  around, well, I just want to know about you as a person, as a farmer, the types of things  
**0:13:24-0:13:25:**  that you're interested in.  
**0:13:25-0:13:27:**  Why do you do this work?  
**0:13:27-0:13:29:**  What motivates you to do it?  
**0:13:29-0:13:36:**  Is it because you're called to farm?  
**0:13:36-0:13:38:**  Is it something that's a family legacy?  
**0:13:38-0:13:44:**  Is it something where you feel like you're contributing to the greater good or feeding  
**0:13:44-0:13:51:**  folks in your community or oftentimes the United States, the line is we feed the world,  
**0:13:51-0:13:54:**  so farmers feed the world.  
**0:13:54-0:14:00:**  So having an understanding of how people view themselves within their farms and the larger  
**0:14:00-0:14:06:**  kind of farm landscape and ecosystem can then help us figure out how we can build bridges  
**0:14:06-0:14:07:**  within that.  
**0:14:07-0:14:14:**  So for example, I had a meeting with a farmer that I work with on Friday and we sat and  
**0:14:14-0:14:20:**  talked for an hour and a half and maybe only 15 minutes was actually about agroforestry,  
**0:14:20-0:14:23:**  where we were talking about plans for next year and what was going to be happening on  
**0:14:23-0:14:26:**  the landscape and the lease and those sort of things.  
**0:14:26-0:14:32:**  But it was only about 15 minutes and the whole hour and 15 was more generally around me asking  
**0:14:32-0:14:38:**  lots of questions about his year this year and asking clarifying questions about some  
**0:14:38-0:14:45:**  of his processes and some other work that he's engaged in off the landscape that we  
**0:14:45-0:14:46:**  work on together.  
**0:14:46-0:14:49:**  And then we also talked about our families.  
**0:14:49-0:14:54:**  I'm about to have my first child and so he was giving me some words of wisdom and talking  
**0:14:54-0:14:58:**  about his children and things like that.  
**0:14:58-0:15:05:**  And to me, that sort of deep relationship building is extremely important for this because  
**0:15:05-0:15:09:**  agroforestry is a long-term investment.  
**0:15:09-0:15:14:**  And when we make long-term investments in people, then we're able to make long-term  
**0:15:14-0:15:22:**  investments on the landscape too because we've come to a mutual trust with each other because  
**0:15:22-0:15:29:**  I value him as a person, I value him as a farmer and I value him as a partner.  
**0:15:29-0:15:35:**  So if we can trust each other to make good decisions and be transparent, then we have  
**0:15:35-0:15:41:**  a transformational relationship instead of one that's just transactional, where we're  
**0:15:41-0:15:48:**  each trying to get as much of what we can from the relationship or the landscape.  
**0:15:48-0:15:53:**  So I think this focus on transformational relationships is really key because that's  
**0:15:53-0:15:59:**  really what we're trying to do within perennial systems in agroforestry is make transformational  
**0:15:59-0:16:00:**  choices.  
**0:16:00-0:16:09:**  So things that are going to take a landscape or a growing system from one place to another  
**0:16:09-0:16:17:**  in a way that is regenerative and based on good relationships.  
**0:16:17-0:16:22:**  And just to understand how you work, because you were talking about long-term relationships.  
**0:16:22-0:16:28:**  So that means that when you work with farmers or a landowner, you really accompany them  
**0:16:28-0:16:29:**  in the long term.  
**0:16:29-0:16:35:**  You kind of help them design, but then also kind of stay present with them on the long  
**0:16:35-0:16:36:**  run.  
**0:16:36-0:16:42:**  So yeah, so within our demonstration farm program, we're always around and we're constantly  
**0:16:42-0:16:46:**  checking in with the landowners, with the farmers.  
**0:16:46-0:16:52:**  We're inviting them to present and be present at field days and educational events.  
**0:16:52-0:16:55:**  We pay them for their time as needed as well.  
**0:16:55-0:17:03:**  So the time to help design systems or to come see a practice that we're wanting to implement  
**0:17:03-0:17:09:**  on their farm landscape, like yeah, we know that you're taking time out of your life and  
**0:17:09-0:17:11:**  your job to come do this.  
**0:17:11-0:17:15:**  So we'd be happy to compensate you for that.  
**0:17:15-0:17:20:**  And so we want to be there for the long haul.  
**0:17:20-0:17:25:**  So when folks work with me and when folks are with Savannah Institute, we're invested  
**0:17:25-0:17:27:**  long-term in that.  
**0:17:27-0:17:31:**  And there's always going to be one or two people that you're always going to see or  
**0:17:31-0:17:36:**  talk to so that you have that constant thread of consistency.  
**0:17:36-0:17:43:**  And then within our technical service provider program, which pairs landowners and farmers  
**0:17:43-0:17:48:**  with someone at the Savannah Institute that can walk them through the process of planning  
**0:17:48-0:17:54:**  for agroforestry, applying for funding, doing design work, and then helping them find resources  
**0:17:54-0:18:02:**  to put that agroforestry design on the landscape, we pair the landowner, the farmer, with someone  
**0:18:02-0:18:04:**  in their state.  
**0:18:04-0:18:09:**  So there is a community agroforestry and a technical service provider in both the state  
**0:18:09-0:18:11:**  of Illinois and Wisconsin.  
**0:18:11-0:18:19:**  And so those pairs work with a farmer or landowner through the entire process of what I like  
**0:18:19-0:18:25:**  to call ideation to implementation, which is kind of a mouthful and not something that  
**0:18:25-0:18:29:**  I would probably use with farmers or landowners.  
**0:18:29-0:18:33:**  That's kind of the way we think about it is you're going to have a stable relationship  
**0:18:33-0:18:38:**  from just the idea of agroforestry to tree planting.  
**0:18:38-0:18:43:**  And then you'll have a resource within the Savannah Institute kind of beyond that too.  
**0:18:43-0:18:50:**  But ultimately what we hope will happen and what we're building towards is that once trees  
**0:18:50-0:18:57:**  are in the ground, folks can create a community of practice for themselves so that farmers  
**0:18:57-0:19:03:**  and landowners are regularly interacting and sharing ideas and resources amongst themselves  
**0:19:03-0:19:10:**  in ways that are more regionally located and adapted than someone at the Savannah Institute  
**0:19:10-0:19:12:**  who's just there.  
**0:19:12-0:19:16:**  Because all the knowledge base is being created on the ground.  
**0:19:16-0:19:20:**  And we have some of that through our demonstration farm program, but it's really the farmers  
**0:19:20-0:19:28:**  and landowners that are really pushing innovation, are really building these connected systems.  
**0:19:28-0:19:34:**  And at a certain point we want to step out of the way and let folks guide that ship.  
**0:19:34-0:19:36:**  That sounds amazing.  
**0:19:36-0:19:41:**  We always feel the need for being able to share experiences in a really localized manner.  
**0:19:41-0:19:45:**  And yeah, as more and more projects get out of the ground, definitely that will probably  
**0:19:45-0:19:47:**  happen on a much more local scale.  
**0:19:47-0:19:50:**  And that's very exciting.  
**0:19:50-0:19:55:**  I still wanted to understand, when going back to these perceptions of agroforestry and getting  
**0:19:55-0:20:01:**  back to understanding what people, how they think about themselves and about their farming  
**0:20:01-0:20:08:**  practices, in your experience, what has been like a driver for change and what's been the  
**0:20:08-0:20:14:**  elements of agroforestry that have been interesting farmers or landowners for that matter?  
**0:20:14-0:20:18:**  What kind of part of the story attracts people?  
**0:20:18-0:20:21:**  It's different for every person.  
**0:20:21-0:20:28:**  So for the most part, everyone that we've worked with comes to it from a different angle.  
**0:20:28-0:20:36:**  So some folks are really interested in agroforestry for climate resilience.  
**0:20:36-0:20:43:**  So their main motivation is tree planting and putting in agroforestry systems that will  
**0:20:43-0:20:52:**  directly sequester carbon and build soil health and do the work that the majority of farmers  
**0:20:52-0:20:56:**  in their area necessarily aren't doing on their farms yet.  
**0:20:56-0:21:03:**  And really wanting to be a leader within that climate resilience movement.  
**0:21:03-0:21:10:**  Some folks are really interested in creating strong legacies for their families.  
**0:21:10-0:21:15:**  So one farmer that we worked with here in Illinois, he was really interested in planting  
**0:21:15-0:21:20:**  chestnuts to keep his family engaged in the farm.  
**0:21:20-0:21:26:**  So he was, I think he was maybe the third or fourth generation on this farm landscape.  
**0:21:26-0:21:32:**  He wasn't currently farming and he was seeing his family become less and less engaged with  
**0:21:32-0:21:34:**  the family farm.  
**0:21:34-0:21:39:**  So they had a family meeting and discussed how chestnuts might work within that.  
**0:21:39-0:21:44:**  And then everyone agreed that chestnuts would be a great way for us all to stay engaged.  
**0:21:44-0:21:51:**  And then they planted acres of chestnuts where it was four generations that were doing the  
**0:21:51-0:21:55:**  planting and actively engaged in the business planning.  
**0:21:55-0:22:01:**  So now folks have reason to come back to the farm and to stay engaged on that land.  
**0:22:01-0:22:04:**  And then some folks are purely profit driven.  
**0:22:04-0:22:11:**  So they see the economic opportunities within that and have the capital resources to invest  
**0:22:11-0:22:17:**  the time and money to set up a longer term perennial system.  
**0:22:17-0:22:23:**  And then there's folks like my husband and I and many of our young farming friends that  
**0:22:23-0:22:26:**  don't see any other option.  
**0:22:26-0:22:34:**  But to include perennials within our farm business planning because we don't have options  
**0:22:34-0:22:35:**  for crop insurance.  
**0:22:35-0:22:40:**  We don't have options for subsidies through the government.  
**0:22:40-0:22:44:**  So it's up to us to build our own insurance into our farm businesses.  
**0:22:44-0:22:54:**  And we see perennials as part of that long term business planning and farm stability.  
**0:22:54-0:22:59:**  Well, and after hearing all this diversity of motives, probably there's not going to  
**0:22:59-0:23:00:**  be one answer either at all.  
**0:23:00-0:23:07:**  But I'm wondering, as you see things change as you engage with different people, what  
**0:23:07-0:23:10:**  do you see as the main obstacles that need to be dealt with in order to really shift  
**0:23:10-0:23:15:**  this agricultural culture and kind of change scale?  
**0:23:15-0:23:19:**  Because it feels at the moment like it's been a while now that there's a lot of initiatives  
**0:23:19-0:23:26:**  with agroforestry, but it's still quite unique projects and we're still needing to kind of  
**0:23:26-0:23:31:**  shift gears and really seeing it come up at a massive scale.  
**0:23:31-0:23:37:**  Yeah, I think in the US, I think there's a big barriers that we talked about earlier  
**0:23:37-0:23:41:**  are around cultural ideas about farming and productivity.  
**0:23:41-0:23:46:**  So what makes a farm and what makes a farm productive?  
**0:23:46-0:23:53:**  We specifically see this when it comes to quote unquote taking land out of production  
**0:23:53-0:23:57:**  for agroforestry, which is kind of an oxymoron, right?  
**0:23:57-0:24:03:**  Because we're taking land out of production to put it into longer term production, but  
**0:24:03-0:24:06:**  it's not seen as productive.  
**0:24:06-0:24:10:**  Because we think of productivity in the United States as yield.  
**0:24:10-0:24:15:**  And if we're not getting a certain bushel per acre of grain, then it's not a productive  
**0:24:15-0:24:18:**  acre.  
**0:24:18-0:24:22:**  And so that also ties into that's not just like an idea that comes out of nowhere.  
**0:24:22-0:24:29:**  It's really tied to the way that the US Department of Agriculture and other sort of government  
**0:24:29-0:24:34:**  and federal entities and funders look at what farming is.  
**0:24:34-0:24:42:**  So our commodity system that basically creates and maintains markets for particular crops  
**0:24:42-0:24:46:**  pretty much ensures that those are the only things that we see on our landscape at any  
**0:24:46-0:24:53:**  great scale because they have the commodity markets that are supported and commodity markets  
**0:24:53-0:24:59:**  that the government ensures will continue in production because there's an incredible  
**0:24:59-0:25:02:**  amount of land and resources that are tied into that.  
**0:25:02-0:25:07:**  And also our crop insurance system here in the US also ensures that only particular crops  
**0:25:07-0:25:12:**  stay on the landscape because there's only particular crops and particular systems that  
**0:25:12-0:25:14:**  can be insured.  
**0:25:14-0:25:18:**  So this is slowly changing, which is really exciting to see.  
**0:25:18-0:25:23:**  So now we're starting to see some like whole farm revenue insurance policies.  
**0:25:23-0:25:28:**  We're starting to see some more diversified smaller scale insurance options, but still  
**0:25:28-0:25:36:**  many of those are outside of what diversified civically farmers can afford because you constantly  
**0:25:36-0:25:40:**  have to balance the risk versus the cost.  
**0:25:40-0:25:47:**  And some folks, as I mentioned earlier, decided to put that cost into diversifying their systems  
**0:25:47-0:25:53:**  even more rather than taking out an insurance policy.  
**0:25:53-0:25:56:**  But all of that also comes down to access to capital.  
**0:25:56-0:26:03:**  So if you go to a traditional bank in a rural area like where I live and you say, I want  
**0:26:03-0:26:10:**  to put in a alley cropping system with perennial fruits and nuts, annual vegetable production,  
**0:26:10-0:26:14:**  and have livestock rotate throughout that, the bank is going to say, I've never seen  
**0:26:14-0:26:15:**  this before.  
**0:26:15-0:26:17:**  This is incredibly risky.  
**0:26:17-0:26:23:**  There is zero way that we're going to give you an operating loan to start up this business.  
**0:26:23-0:26:32:**  But there's also creative ways that folks are crowdfunding capital or working within  
**0:26:32-0:26:37:**  government or financial programs to finance one part of it and then incorporating a whole  
**0:26:37-0:26:44:**  second element into it that maybe they're not expressing or they're letting them know  
**0:26:44-0:26:50:**  that this is the second part of my farm business, but it's not going to impact the funding that  
**0:26:50-0:26:53:**  you're giving me at all.  
**0:26:53-0:27:02:**  And then I think one of the biggest ones for civically young beginning and returning farmers  
**0:27:02-0:27:10:**  is the land consolidation and land price in the US is distressing to say the very least  
**0:27:10-0:27:17:**  and makes systems and especially perennial systems seem impossible.  
**0:27:17-0:27:23:**  When you're on rented lands, number one, it can be incredibly expensive.  
**0:27:23-0:27:28:**  Number two, there's no guarantee unless you have an extremely long term lease that you're  
**0:27:28-0:27:35:**  going to be able to be on that land for a long period of time and planting perennials  
**0:27:35-0:27:41:**  becomes a hard thing to do when you don't know if your financial and time investment  
**0:27:41-0:27:46:**  will pay off on that rented land.  
**0:27:46-0:27:54:**  And here in Champaign County where I live in Illinois, land is routinely selling for  
**0:27:54-0:28:01:**  between like 17,000 and 20,000 US dollars an acre, which I wish I had the hectare and  
**0:28:01-0:28:02:**  Euro conversion to that.  
**0:28:02-0:28:06:**  I probably should have done that.  
**0:28:06-0:28:15:**  It basically ensures that if you don't have some sort of wealth base, you will not be  
**0:28:15-0:28:24:**  able to purchase land, which can be a horrific barrier.  
**0:28:24-0:28:33:**  But there's also, I think, an opportunity within that as well for us to really rethink  
**0:28:33-0:28:41:**  how we work on the landscape and how we view ownership of lands.  
**0:28:41-0:28:48:**  In the United States specifically, all land is native land and it was stolen land.  
**0:28:48-0:28:56:**  So the ownership of land is something personally for me that is something that I'm working  
**0:28:56-0:29:01:**  through and trying to square with.  
**0:29:01-0:29:09:**  Agroforestry is an indigenous farming system and land ownership is a colonial system.  
**0:29:09-0:29:17:**  So how do we figure out systems that work, that honor and not appropriate all the knowledge  
**0:29:17-0:29:25:**  and work that's been done by the native peoples here while creating new structures of ownership  
**0:29:25-0:29:34:**  and access that aren't reliant on single entity or single person ownership.  
**0:29:34-0:29:38:**  Do you have examples of maybe some initiatives or very localized projects where that's been  
**0:29:38-0:29:42:**  attempted and offers some interesting avenues to explore?  
**0:29:42-0:29:43:**  Sure.  
**0:29:43-0:29:47:**  I mean, here, I'll start with my work because that's the work that I know the best and then  
**0:29:47-0:29:52:**  can provide some examples that I've been really inspired by.  
**0:29:52-0:29:57:**  I'm really looking right now, my work for the past year and moving forward is really  
**0:29:57-0:30:03:**  focused on how can we utilize public agricultural lands for agroforestry.  
**0:30:03-0:30:08:**  So for example, here in the state of Illinois, we have 85,000 acres of agricultural land  
**0:30:08-0:30:13:**  that are currently rented out every year for the most part, grain agriculture.  
**0:30:13-0:30:21:**  So that's 85,000 acres that's owned by the state that currently has not many conservation  
**0:30:21-0:30:23:**  requirements in their leases.  
**0:30:23-0:30:26:**  It's mostly the same type of farming everywhere.  
**0:30:26-0:30:31:**  And they're often close to sensitive ecological areas such as waterways or protected wildlife  
**0:30:31-0:30:32:**  areas.  
**0:30:32-0:30:41:**  So agroforestry has an opportunity to really help protect those fragile ecosystems by also  
**0:30:41-0:30:49:**  providing a pathway for young beginning and returning farmers to utilize land that supposedly  
**0:30:49-0:30:54:**  belongs to us all if it's public lands.  
**0:30:54-0:30:59:**  So I'm talking, my work in the next year is going to be focused on how can we make that  
**0:30:59-0:31:02:**  possible here in Illinois.  
**0:31:02-0:31:06:**  And I've been really inspired by some work that's being done specifically in the city  
**0:31:06-0:31:12:**  of Chicago by the Chicago Food Policy Council.  
**0:31:12-0:31:19:**  And they've been working with how to utilize public and city lots for vegetable production  
**0:31:19-0:31:26:**  for folks and getting areas that are publicly owned by park systems or the city of Chicago  
**0:31:26-0:31:34:**  or other municipalities or utilities within the city that is just kind of sitting vacant.  
**0:31:34-0:31:40:**  So how can folks utilize these public lands that are serving no purpose except as land  
**0:31:40-0:31:43:**  holding to produce food?  
**0:31:43-0:31:50:**  And they've really convened a pretty amazing network of folks that control those lands  
**0:31:50-0:31:55:**  with farmers that are looking for land access and are creating some really phenomenal resources  
**0:31:55-0:31:57:**  around that.  
**0:31:57-0:32:05:**  I've also been really inspired by work that's happening forever in Mexico with communal  
**0:32:05-0:32:14:**  land holdings and the recognition of the Mexican government of folks to hold land in community  
**0:32:14-0:32:22:**  so that community level folks can make decisions of what happens on those landscapes.  
**0:32:22-0:32:26:**  One of the ways that colonialism has really destroyed Native communities here in the United  
**0:32:26-0:32:34:**  States is through allotment systems where treaties allocated large tracts of land to  
**0:32:34-0:32:39:**  Native communities that were communally held and then the United States government started  
**0:32:39-0:32:43:**  allotting those to particular people and families.  
**0:32:43-0:32:49:**  So they end up breaking apart landscapes that were once held by everyone.  
**0:32:49-0:32:56:**  So it's been digging into that history and trying to learn what other folks are doing  
**0:32:56-0:33:02:**  has been kind of key to figuring out how this might work in Illinois.  
**0:33:02-0:33:08:**  So those are just a couple of things that have been inspiring for me in this work.  
**0:33:08-0:33:13:**  And there's examples of this happening all around the world as well.  
**0:33:13-0:33:19:**  So these are just tiny snippets of lots of different work that's happening in places.  
**0:33:19-0:33:24:**  It's fascinating, but I guess what's even more difficult in your situation compared  
**0:33:24-0:33:29:**  to, for example, Chicago, where there was vacant land is that here there's different  
**0:33:29-0:33:33:**  uses of the land that are competing because then that land that's being already leased  
**0:33:33-0:33:39:**  to broadacre crops to farmers who...  
**0:33:39-0:33:43:**  And how do you include these people, if so, how do you do?  
**0:33:43-0:33:48:**  And it's quite a similar thing that we have in France where farms are getting bigger and  
**0:33:48-0:33:53:**  bigger because of the subsidy system and because of a lack of a younger generation and because  
**0:33:53-0:33:59:**  it's always more advantageous to sell to your neighbor at a high price than try and have  
**0:33:59-0:34:02:**  young people take over which don't have much capital.  
**0:34:02-0:34:06:**  So again, it's linked to this capital idea, but it's a really tricky question because  
**0:34:06-0:34:12:**  everything's intertwined, but between these more labor intensive systems, which have the  
**0:34:12-0:34:21:**  potential to bring back people on the landscapes and the way the land is being used currently,  
**0:34:21-0:34:25:**  there's quite a big gap and it's really not easy, isn't it, to mix everything and make  
**0:34:25-0:34:30:**  sure that no one's marginalized in the process because that would be counterproductive as  
**0:34:30-0:34:31:**  well probably.  
**0:34:31-0:34:39:**  Yeah, I mean, this is a really big thing because we don't want to...  
**0:34:39-0:34:48:**  It's really difficult because we don't want to displace anyone from their livelihoods.  
**0:34:48-0:34:52:**  So when we talk about agroforestry taking land on a production, that's really the conversation  
**0:34:52-0:35:01:**  we're having, is we're taking money from someone else that has their farm business based on  
**0:35:01-0:35:05:**  this landscape or as part of their farm business.  
**0:35:05-0:35:13:**  And I think one of the things that is so unique about agroforestry is that we can have multiple  
**0:35:13-0:35:17:**  farm businesses and multiple farming systems on one landscape.  
**0:35:17-0:35:28:**  And so this actually forces us to share in a way that we're not comfortable with doing,  
**0:35:28-0:35:36:**  but I think there's major opportunities to have both an older generation and a younger  
**0:35:36-0:35:41:**  generation operating on the farm landscape and doing two separate things that work together.  
**0:35:41-0:35:46:**  So alley cropping to me is a huge example of this.  
**0:35:46-0:35:56:**  And we've been working through different structures of how can alley cropping support two folks  
**0:35:56-0:35:59:**  or two businesses on one landscape?  
**0:35:59-0:36:00:**  What's the type of planning that's needed?  
**0:36:00-0:36:06:**  What are the type of lease structures that are needed to make sure that each party is  
**0:36:06-0:36:15:**  protected and supported and has opportunity to say on what happens on either side, but  
**0:36:15-0:36:20:**  also to ensure that people are working for mutual benefit.  
**0:36:20-0:36:28:**  And it also ensures that for young farmers and beginning farmers that they have acreage  
**0:36:28-0:36:32:**  that they can have the capacity to manage.  
**0:36:32-0:36:40:**  So oftentimes, green farmers have equipment that allows them to manage hundreds or thousands  
**0:36:40-0:36:46:**  of acres at a time, and those machines cost an immense amount of money, $500,000 to $1  
**0:36:46-0:36:52:**  million, something that I would never have access to.  
**0:36:52-0:36:58:**  But if we take 100, say 100 acre field, and we put 10 of those acres into alley cropping,  
**0:36:58-0:37:05:**  I could probably handle 10 acres and find the opportunity and figure out ways of management  
**0:37:05-0:37:09:**  to manage those 10 acres.  
**0:37:09-0:37:15:**  For some folks, that's more than enough land to do the type of farm business that they  
**0:37:15-0:37:19:**  would be interested in starting and running.  
**0:37:19-0:37:24:**  So I think there's major opportunities to really workshop and think through ways that  
**0:37:24-0:37:31:**  we can build multiple businesses, multiple generations, and multiple practices on one  
**0:37:31-0:37:32:**  landscape.  
**0:37:32-0:37:38:**  And I think one of the big goals within that also has to be a transition of that landscape.  
**0:37:38-0:37:45:**  So if we're taking it from conventional chemically managed grain production and then starting  
**0:37:45-0:37:51:**  to put trees in there, the practices have to change, even to accommodate the trees to  
**0:37:51-0:37:57:**  ensure that the trees and whatever crop is being grown is done in a safe manner that  
**0:37:57-0:38:01:**  isn't harming the crop that's coming off those perennial acres.  
**0:38:01-0:38:06:**  So it's already starting the conversation of transformation and saying that for this  
**0:38:06-0:38:10:**  to work for both of us, we both need to make some concessions.  
**0:38:10-0:38:16:**  And with alley cropping over time, the trees will start to impact, say, a summer grain  
**0:38:16-0:38:19:**  like corn or soybeans that are being grown.  
**0:38:19-0:38:25:**  So then there's an opportunity to transition to wheat, winter wheat or winter annuals.  
**0:38:25-0:38:32:**  And if the tree rows are close enough together, then even winter annuals become untenable  
**0:38:32-0:38:33:**  on that landscape.  
**0:38:33-0:38:37:**  So then, oh, now we have no choice but to bring animals back on the landscape.  
**0:38:37-0:38:43:**  So then we have a corn and soybean field that's been completely transformed into a kind of  
**0:38:43-0:38:45:**  multi-story silvopasture system.  
**0:38:45-0:38:48:**  That's the dream, right?  
**0:38:48-0:38:50:**  That's the ultimate goal.  
**0:38:50-0:38:57:**  So I think there's opportunities to really dream and figure out how we can make this  
**0:38:57-0:39:03:**  work for everyone because we are going to see a huge transition of land.  
**0:39:03-0:39:04:**  It's a beautiful dream.  
**0:39:04-0:39:06:**  Yeah, it's a beautiful dream, right?  
**0:39:06-0:39:07:**  Sorry.  
**0:39:07-0:39:10:**  No, but I mean, it's a beautiful dream in the sense that it makes so much sense and  
**0:39:10-0:39:14:**  it probably needs to happen that way if it is going to be successful.  
**0:39:14-0:39:19:**  But it just requires an incredible amount of flexibility from everyone involved.  
**0:39:19-0:39:25:**  And that's not always easy for someone who's been doing things in a certain way and has  
**0:39:25-0:39:29:**  a certain representation of what their farm is.  
**0:39:29-0:39:33:**  Going back to that, then being able to say, like, no, it doesn't matter, you know, just  
**0:39:33-0:39:36:**  change crops and then evolve and then bring in back animals.  
**0:39:36-0:39:40:**  Again, I don't think it's necessarily that it's technically impossible.  
**0:39:40-0:39:45:**  It's just that at the moment you have to find the right people willing to engage in that.  
**0:39:45-0:39:49:**  Yeah, and the right people is kind of the hard thing, right?  
**0:39:49-0:39:58:**  So there's the willing people and then there's the people that can be convinced to change  
**0:39:58-0:40:03:**  a little bit and then there's folks that won't be able to change at all.  
**0:40:03-0:40:09:**  And I think that one of the things that working with public lands provides an opportunity  
**0:40:09-0:40:18:**  for is if the land is public, then the government or an entity or agency related to the government  
**0:40:18-0:40:23:**  is the one that sets the lease standards, which means they have the power to change  
**0:40:23-0:40:27:**  the lease standards.  
**0:40:27-0:40:33:**  So you could say, well, what's easier, to change an individual or to change a government  
**0:40:33-0:40:34:**  entity?  
**0:40:34-0:40:38:**  I don't have the answer to that question.  
**0:40:38-0:40:43:**  But I think there's an argument to be made for public entities that agroforestry can  
**0:40:43-0:40:49:**  help achieve many of the goals that, for example, the state of Illinois has set for themselves  
**0:40:49-0:40:54:**  when it comes to nutrient loss reduction, where we're pouring, you know, nitrogen and  
**0:40:54-0:40:58:**  phosphorus into our waterways at extremely damaging and high rates.  
**0:40:58-0:41:04:**  Like agroforestry is proven to improve that water quality.  
**0:41:04-0:41:10:**  They have carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission caps that they have to meet.  
**0:41:10-0:41:16:**  You know, all of these things can show that agroforestry can be a tool to help reach the  
**0:41:16-0:41:19:**  goals of the state of Illinois.  
**0:41:19-0:41:27:**  So whether or not that's going to be a fruitful argument is kind of my work in the next year  
**0:41:27-0:41:29:**  to see what's possible.  
**0:41:29-0:41:34:**  Because you have to give up power for systems to transition.  
**0:41:34-0:41:39:**  Someone has to give up power, land, opportunity or capital for it to happen.  
**0:41:39-0:41:49:**  So we really need to look at what's the mechanisms that is going to force that transfer of power.  
**0:41:49-0:41:52:**  Because it doesn't seem like folks are willingly giving it up.  
**0:41:52-0:42:00:**  So what mechanisms can we utilize that kind of force those power structures to shift?  
**0:42:00-0:42:05:**  So a lot of your job actually in the coming months or years is going to be lobbying like  
**0:42:05-0:42:11:**  public bodies in a sense and trying to make that voice being heard.  
**0:42:11-0:42:16:**  I have no idea how easy it is to get access to that decision body because here in Europe,  
**0:42:16-0:42:22:**  we're on the European level and the European Union for all the decisions around the cap  
**0:42:22-0:42:23:**  policy.  
**0:42:23-0:42:29:**  And that's obviously at a level where an organization of the size of the Savannah Institute, even  
**0:42:29-0:42:34:**  on a national level, is quite hard to get to the bottom of it or to get any leverage  
**0:42:34-0:42:39:**  for change because it's so huge, you know, and there's so many interests.  
**0:42:39-0:42:45:**  So yeah, is the state level in the US like actually an approachable level of power?  
**0:42:45-0:42:48:**  I think it is.  
**0:42:48-0:42:53:**  It's yet to be seen, but I think this is where the power of community really comes in.  
**0:42:53-0:43:01:**  Because me as one person or us as the Savannah Institute only has a particular power and  
**0:43:01-0:43:08:**  a particular audience and a level of voice that we can utilize within state or federal  
**0:43:08-0:43:11:**  structures.  
**0:43:11-0:43:18:**  But when we work together with other organizations that are tapped into particular relationships  
**0:43:18-0:43:24:**  or networks or are really skilled at amplifying voices and making connections between the  
**0:43:24-0:43:29:**  folks that are writing the laws and the folks that are enforcing the laws, then we have  
**0:43:29-0:43:36:**  an opportunity for our message around trees and agroforestry to become tied in with greater  
**0:43:36-0:43:45:**  arguments and greater work around public well-being, environmental protection, carbon sequestration  
**0:43:45-0:43:48:**  in ways that we wouldn't if we were doing it alone.  
**0:43:48-0:43:53:**  So we're really looking to work rather than the Savannah Institute or me just as an individual  
**0:43:53-0:44:00:**  person kind of launching this work, we're really looking to partner with other organizations  
**0:44:00-0:44:08:**  that are doing like-minded work so that we can kind of create a connected and larger  
**0:44:08-0:44:13:**  powered block for action.  
**0:44:13-0:44:19:**  In the United States at least, the way our Constitution is constructed is states have  
**0:44:19-0:44:26:**  quite a bit of power within the structure of the United States.  
**0:44:26-0:44:35:**  I think for Illinois, we have a pretty progressive governor right now and within the whole United  
**0:44:35-0:44:39:**  States government, we have a little bit more of a progressive push.  
**0:44:39-0:44:47:**  And so the time is now to try to get some of these things moving and we'll see what  
**0:44:47-0:44:49:**  happens.  
**0:44:49-0:44:59:**  But I think that there is an opportunity and especially for young folks, it's now or never  
**0:44:59-0:45:01:**  on some of these things.  
**0:45:01-0:45:06:**  So we just have to keep trying things until we find something that sticks.  
**0:45:06-0:45:12:**  So we're going to fail a lot and we're going to go down a lot of dead ends but we just  
**0:45:12-0:45:17:**  got to keep going and a term we use kind of often at Savannah Institute is building the  
**0:45:17-0:45:19:**  ship while we sail it.  
**0:45:19-0:45:23:**  And that's kind of what we're doing here too is building the ship while we sail it.  
**0:45:23-0:45:28:**  So I have no answers and hope is the only thing keeping us going.  
**0:45:28-0:45:35:**  Well, I wish you a lot of luck in this endeavor and yeah, hopefully you'll be successful because  
**0:45:35-0:45:42:**  it is a very beautiful dream and I think it's good to have these visions that keep us going.  
**0:45:42-0:45:47:**  I wanted to hear a bit more about the demonstration sites but before we go there, one point that  
**0:45:47-0:45:51:**  you mentioned I find interesting is the access to capital.  
**0:45:51-0:45:56:**  And I'm wondering, does the Savannah Institute then help, like let's say you have people  
**0:45:56-0:46:00:**  that approach you and they're saying, okay, I'm a landowner and I want to have agroforestry  
**0:46:00-0:46:03:**  systems or I'm a farmer.  
**0:46:03-0:46:06:**  Do you also like put them in contact with capital?  
**0:46:06-0:46:09:**  Is it something that you fundraise in the name of Savannah Institute?  
**0:46:09-0:46:12:**  How does this kind of finance aspect work?  
**0:46:12-0:46:17:**  Yeah, it's something that we're doing a lot more work on now.  
**0:46:17-0:46:22:**  Savannah Institute's really grown in the past seven years and we've gone from mostly just  
**0:46:22-0:46:28:**  like an education and outreach kind of nonprofit to one that's more actively engaged in helping  
**0:46:28-0:46:32:**  farmers and landowners get agroforestry out.  
**0:46:32-0:46:36:**  And so one of the things that we're doing now through our technical service provider  
**0:46:36-0:46:43:**  program is specifically connecting farmers and landowners to federal funding through  
**0:46:43-0:46:50:**  the Natural Resource Conservation Service, which is a nationwide program that's administered  
**0:46:50-0:46:57:**  at the state level that cost shares and sometimes covers the full cost of certain agroforestry  
**0:46:57-0:46:59:**  practice installation.  
**0:46:59-0:47:07:**  So things like alley cropping, wind breaks, woody repairing and buffers, silva pasture  
**0:47:07-0:47:15:**  establishment, there's cost share funding opportunities where the NRCS will reimburse  
**0:47:15-0:47:22:**  you 30 to basically 100% of the cost of installation of these systems.  
**0:47:22-0:47:31:**  And so our TSPs work directly with NRCS to help people apply for that funding and get  
**0:47:31-0:47:32:**  their designs approved.  
**0:47:32-0:47:35:**  So that's one mechanism.  
**0:47:35-0:47:44:**  Another mechanism is through sort of partnership grant programs where we try to work with financial  
**0:47:44-0:47:53:**  institutions and other entities to kind of innovate different insurance strategies, capital  
**0:47:53-0:48:00:**  finance strategies, loan opportunities for agroforestry to one, provide those opportunities  
**0:48:00-0:48:09:**  to farmers and landowners, but also two, to push those institutions to open their structures  
**0:48:09-0:48:17:**  and their minds a little bit to the opportunity and the reality of risk when it comes to agroforestry  
**0:48:17-0:48:19:**  systems.  
**0:48:19-0:48:24:**  So I'd say there's a couple different angles and in the past year we've hired a business  
**0:48:24-0:48:33:**  analyst on staff, which has been absolutely amazing in showing what's possible and asking  
**0:48:33-0:48:39:**  really tough questions around like, well, how much does it actually cost to design an  
**0:48:39-0:48:43:**  install a complex, you know, alley cropping system?  
**0:48:43-0:48:48:**  And what are the actual financial projections and returns on those?  
**0:48:48-0:48:54:**  So one thing that we've been working on in partnership with some other entities is sort  
**0:48:54-0:49:01:**  of those actual ground truth cost projection models around different practices.  
**0:49:01-0:49:05:**  And so that's something that's in the works now, but it's also something that's really  
**0:49:05-0:49:11:**  needed for folks to make informed decisions on how they're going to incorporate these  
**0:49:11-0:49:13:**  things onto their landscapes.  
**0:49:13-0:49:19:**  Yeah, that would be amazing once that's released, like to get some, maybe do an episode with  
**0:49:19-0:49:25:**  you guys and get that information as well, because it's so hard to get like solid economic  
**0:49:25-0:49:28:**  data on such complex systems.  
**0:49:28-0:49:33:**  And that's definitely something I think that would be interesting to get an insight into  
**0:49:33-0:49:37:**  for all our listeners as well as for ourselves.  
**0:49:37-0:49:42:**  And just on this idea of community building, we've explored a lot like community in the  
**0:49:42-0:49:47:**  sense of, you know, connecting farmers and landowners and lobbying and the greater like  
**0:49:47-0:49:51:**  political or state level community in a sense.  
**0:49:51-0:49:56:**  But do you do also things on a more like localized levels with maybe schools or local communities  
**0:49:56-0:49:59:**  and building links with Agroforestry as well?  
**0:49:59-0:50:03:**  Yeah, that's something that we are working more towards in the next couple of years,  
**0:50:03-0:50:06:**  especially with our demonstration farms.  
**0:50:06-0:50:12:**  So we really see the demonstration farms as being hubs for that type of more localized  
**0:50:12-0:50:14:**  community building.  
**0:50:14-0:50:19:**  And so for the past two years and I should say two seasons, we've been really focusing  
**0:50:19-0:50:24:**  on just getting those systems off the ground and learning how they work and learning those  
**0:50:24-0:50:30:**  landscapes and making mistakes and recording those mistakes so that we can share with others.  
**0:50:30-0:50:38:**  And the long term goals of these sites are to become those locations of community building.  
**0:50:38-0:50:44:**  So working with K through 12 education, so really introducing young people to what Agroforestry  
**0:50:44-0:50:51:**  is and what might be possible for work within those systems or just kind of the internal  
**0:50:51-0:50:56:**  hope of trees on farm landscapes.  
**0:50:56-0:51:04:**  And also really working more closely with folks that are working within the processing  
**0:51:04-0:51:06:**  and market side of things as well.  
**0:51:06-0:51:14:**  So one personal project that I've been involved in is a local food processing co-op that's  
**0:51:14-0:51:18:**  getting off the ground here in central Illinois.  
**0:51:18-0:51:22:**  And to me it's things like that that will actually encourage folks to plant more tree  
**0:51:22-0:51:28:**  crops if there are processing facilities that are close to them that know how to process  
**0:51:28-0:51:34:**  and store product correctly and then can be used to market that pass there.  
**0:51:34-0:51:40:**  So we're hoping the demonstration farms, it's not hope, it's actual real planning that we're  
**0:51:40-0:51:41:**  doing.  
**0:51:41-0:51:49:**  So it's not just hope, it's actual work and planning to really make them those sorts of  
**0:51:49-0:51:51:**  local sites.  
**0:51:51-0:51:55:**  And that's why they're kind of spread, at least in Illinois and into Wisconsin, they're  
**0:51:55-0:52:02:**  in very specific geographic locations that are near sort of rural areas.  
**0:52:02-0:52:09:**  They're kind of interesting locations that are near universities, near some city centers,  
**0:52:09-0:52:17:**  but surrounded by larger scale agriculture farmlands so that there is still access to  
**0:52:17-0:52:24:**  markets, access to university research, access to populations that buy, but also large amounts  
**0:52:24-0:52:31:**  of farmland that can then support these types of systems being integrated.  
**0:52:31-0:52:32:**  Amazing.  
**0:52:32-0:52:38:**  And this, you know, it'd be great to understand a bit more about those demonstration sites  
**0:52:38-0:52:42:**  and what those actual designs look like in practice.  
**0:52:42-0:52:44:**  Could you give us a bit of an overview?  
**0:52:44-0:52:45:**  Sure.  
**0:52:45-0:52:48:**  I can definitely talk about the Illinois ones because those are the ones that I work with  
**0:52:48-0:52:50:**  the most closely.  
**0:52:50-0:52:57:**  So for the past two years, the main chunk of my work has been really focused on getting  
**0:52:57-0:53:01:**  three demonstration farms off the ground here in the state of Illinois.  
**0:53:01-0:53:08:**  So the first one is the Memorial 4-H Camp Demonstration Farm, and that's located in  
**0:53:08-0:53:13:**  Monticello, Illinois, and it's land that's owned by the University of Illinois.  
**0:53:13-0:53:19:**  So it's public lands held by what we call a land grant university here in the United  
**0:53:19-0:53:21:**  States.  
**0:53:21-0:53:29:**  And it's 35 acres of what was for the past 20 years corn and soybean production.  
**0:53:29-0:53:34:**  The site is really interesting because it was originally wooded land, then it was deforested  
**0:53:34-0:53:40:**  to become an airstrip, and then it was transitioned into row crop agriculture.  
**0:53:40-0:53:49:**  So unlike some lands in Illinois, there were trees on this site originally.  
**0:53:49-0:53:57:**  And it's a really great location because it's located next to an estate called Allerton  
**0:53:57-0:54:04:**  Park which is open to the public which includes hiking trails and formal gardens and a formal  
**0:54:04-0:54:08:**  mansion that attracts people to the site.  
**0:54:08-0:54:14:**  So they get about a thousand visitors a year, and this agricultural field is adjacent to  
**0:54:14-0:54:17:**  their main parking lot, which is great.  
**0:54:17-0:54:24:**  And it's located completely surrounded by corn and soybean land for the most part.  
**0:54:24-0:54:32:**  And so this site is an alley cropping demonstration where we have six what we call paddocks of  
**0:54:32-0:54:37:**  trees which is a confusing term but I don't know what other term to use.  
**0:54:37-0:54:40:**  And each paddock of trees is three rows.  
**0:54:40-0:54:45:**  So we have timber as well as native species growing in those three rows.  
**0:54:45-0:54:52:**  And then we have 200 foot alleys where there's corn and soybean production happening.  
**0:54:52-0:54:59:**  So it's a pretty large, as far as alley cropping goes, it's a pretty large length between each  
**0:54:59-0:55:02:**  paddock of trees.  
**0:55:02-0:55:06:**  But we did that to create a flexible system.  
**0:55:06-0:55:12:**  In working with the tenant farmer there, we wanted to create a system that would not change  
**0:55:12-0:55:16:**  the way that he moved through his fields at all.  
**0:55:16-0:55:23:**  So the way we laid out the alley cropping design was to make sure that that farmer never  
**0:55:23-0:55:31:**  did a single extra pass to plant, harvest, or spray their crop.  
**0:55:31-0:55:36:**  And so that was one way we built trust of saying we want to learn how you farm and then  
**0:55:36-0:55:40:**  we'll fit our system within that.  
**0:55:40-0:55:45:**  So we designed our system around his production and his equipment, and then we left these  
**0:55:45-0:55:52:**  pretty large alleys so that over time we could add more rows of trees as our relationship  
**0:55:52-0:55:59:**  with that farmer grew and the trust grew and then we could work on that design together.  
**0:55:59-0:56:06:**  It also provided us some flexibility if he changed his equipment, we could then, we had  
**0:56:06-0:56:08:**  a lot of room to play with.  
**0:56:08-0:56:14:**  So we really tried to build something that worked for both of us.  
**0:56:14-0:56:19:**  Another interesting thing about this site is our lease on the site.  
**0:56:19-0:56:25:**  So we have a long term lease with the University of Illinois and then we sublease annually  
**0:56:25-0:56:28:**  to the row crop farmer.  
**0:56:28-0:56:37:**  So we set the terms of the farmer's lease because we're kind of the main holder of that  
**0:56:37-0:56:44:**  lease land, which has been really helpful for us because that means that we can ban  
**0:56:44-0:56:48:**  certain chemicals from being used in his farming.  
**0:56:48-0:56:54:**  So we obviously had a conversation about that before we wrote the lease with that farmer  
**0:56:54-0:56:57:**  and we have an annual review of that lease every year.  
**0:56:57-0:57:02:**  But to us that was pretty key to ensure, there's certain chemicals that are used in the United  
**0:57:02-0:57:09:**  States that can easily kill trees that are routinely used on corn and soybean crops.  
**0:57:09-0:57:17:**  So we needed that kind of decision making power within the lease to protect the trees  
**0:57:17-0:57:18:**  that we were planting.  
**0:57:18-0:57:23:**  But just to understand, this farmer wasn't farming that piece of land beforehand?  
**0:57:23-0:57:27:**  It's like you got the lease from University of Missouri and then you sourced the farmer  
**0:57:27-0:57:29:**  in a sense that wanted to farm within that?  
**0:57:29-0:57:32:**  Oh, thanks for bringing that up.  
**0:57:32-0:57:38:**  No, the farmer that had that lease had been farming that piece of land for the past 20  
**0:57:38-0:57:40:**  years or so.  
**0:57:40-0:57:47:**  So we worked with him to keep him on that land while we were working within the structure.  
**0:57:47-0:57:54:**  And he was very skeptical at first, but it's been great working with him.  
**0:57:54-0:57:56:**  So yeah, he's the farmer.  
**0:57:56-0:58:04:**  That's what we try to do is we keep the farmer on the property if possible.  
**0:58:04-0:58:06:**  That's the goal, right?  
**0:58:06-0:58:11:**  Because then we can build a relationship, then they ask questions, we build something  
**0:58:11-0:58:17:**  that works for them and hopefully will also work for their farming neighbors too.  
**0:58:17-0:58:19:**  And then they become advocates.  
**0:58:19-0:58:24:**  It's still quite tough for them because it means they do lose a certain amount of power  
**0:58:24-0:58:29:**  by even though the partnership is respectful and everything, you still have to make it  
**0:58:29-0:58:35:**  acceptable to them that now you're setting the terms and also modifying even if it's  
**0:58:35-0:58:36:**  slightly the way they work.  
**0:58:36-0:58:43:**  So I understand why it takes a lot of relationship building as you were mentioning because the  
**0:58:43-0:58:45:**  initial reaction must be a bit cautious from their end.  
**0:58:45-0:58:48:**  Oh, it's totally cautious.  
**0:58:48-0:58:52:**  It's a little mistrustful, it's totally cautious, it's incredibly skeptical.  
**0:58:52-0:58:59:**  And then it's also one of those things where for the most part, the farmers and landowners  
**0:58:59-0:59:10:**  are working with me, this young woman who's not the typical person that most farmers work  
**0:59:10-0:59:12:**  with.  
**0:59:12-0:59:18:**  We make it work, but I'm not a middle aged white guy.  
**0:59:18-0:59:23:**  So there's actually a little bit of the benefit of the doubt that comes with it being me who's  
**0:59:23-0:59:30:**  doing this instead of another white guy.  
**0:59:30-0:59:35:**  But there definitely is gender and power dynamics within those two.  
**0:59:35-0:59:36:**  Sure.  
**0:59:36-0:59:42:**  Coming back to these designs then, where do you get the inspiration and the technical  
**0:59:42-0:59:47:**  data to make those decisions on choice of crops, for example, and then spacings and  
**0:59:47-0:59:51:**  maybe projecting things in the long term as well?  
**0:59:51-0:59:52:**  Sure.  
**0:59:52-0:59:57:**  So we do design work as a group within the Savannah Institute.  
**0:59:57-1:00:07:**  So there might be one or two of us that are really driving the goal setting and things  
**1:00:07-1:00:08:**  like that.  
**1:00:08-1:00:13:**  But we design and we do goal setting within a group within the Savannah Institute.  
**1:00:13-1:00:19:**  So for example, for the demonstration farms, we have a team that works on design elements  
**1:00:19-1:00:22:**  and goal setting for those farms.  
**1:00:22-1:00:28:**  So we have folks that have PhDs in ecology.  
**1:00:28-1:00:32:**  We have folks that have been doing design work for a long time.  
**1:00:32-1:00:36:**  There's folks like me that are just anthropologist turned farmers that have no formal training  
**1:00:36-1:00:42:**  in agroforestry whatsoever.  
**1:00:42-1:00:46:**  And folks that work more routinely with farmers and landowners.  
**1:00:46-1:00:52:**  And so we kind of come together with ideas and then we look at the research and data.  
**1:00:52-1:00:58:**  So there's obviously a really great research that's come out of France and Europe, specifically  
**1:00:58-1:01:01:**  on alley cropping systems.  
**1:01:01-1:01:05:**  There's really great research that's been done at the University of Missouri here in  
**1:01:05-1:01:10:**  the United States, as well as some great Canadian research on alley cropping.  
**1:01:10-1:01:14:**  So we kind of look at the data that's already out there.  
**1:01:14-1:01:19:**  We look at different designs that have been on the landscape and how those have worked  
**1:01:19-1:01:22:**  for different farmers and landowners.  
**1:01:22-1:01:26:**  We make a lot of phone calls to people and say, is this a dumb idea?  
**1:01:26-1:01:31:**  Is this going to work?  
**1:01:31-1:01:39:**  And then we take into consideration what people might actually do in that area.  
**1:01:39-1:01:44:**  So the reason we chose timber as our kind of productive tree species for this site in  
**1:01:44-1:01:52:**  central Illinois is because, number one, we were working with a corn and soybean farmer.  
**1:01:52-1:01:56:**  And we have to make sure that whatever type of farming system they're doing, the alleys  
**1:01:56-1:02:00:**  is compatible with the trees that are in that paddock.  
**1:02:00-1:02:06:**  Because we wanted to kind of create a simple system that could start a transition, but  
**1:02:06-1:02:10:**  not force major transition right away.  
**1:02:10-1:02:16:**  And so when we were deciding what tree species to use for that timber, we went to the University  
**1:02:16-1:02:22:**  of Illinois Extension Forester and sat down and had a conversation with him about, this  
**1:02:22-1:02:29:**  is the soils, this is what we're planning to do within the system, what would you recommend  
**1:02:29-1:02:33:**  as the top timber species for this landscape?  
**1:02:33-1:02:39:**  So we got a series of recommendations from him, and we used that to really build out  
**1:02:39-1:02:40:**  the system.  
**1:02:40-1:02:46:**  And when it came to spacing, we were looking at, I already talked a little bit about the  
**1:02:46-1:02:49:**  farmer's equipment, so that was number one, the farmer's got to be able to move through  
**1:02:49-1:02:50:**  the field.  
**1:02:50-1:02:58:**  Number two, we looked at what equipment Savannah Institute had to manage those tree rows and  
**1:02:58-1:03:03:**  how we were going to move throughout the field and get in there to do what we needed to do.  
**1:03:03-1:03:09:**  As well as the equipment we were going to be able to rent or borrow to make those systems  
**1:03:09-1:03:12:**  happen if needed.  
**1:03:12-1:03:18:**  And then we kind of sat down and pulled it all together into a first draft and sent it  
**1:03:18-1:03:24:**  to the farmer to look at, and we made revisions based on what he, the kind of roadblocks he  
**1:03:24-1:03:27:**  was going to see with it.  
**1:03:27-1:03:33:**  We shared with other folks at SI who then had feedback on the design, and then we kind  
**1:03:33-1:03:36:**  of came to that design decision.  
**1:03:36-1:03:41:**  And because we work also with researchers, there's a research component to this farm  
**1:03:41-1:03:47:**  as well where we're looking at different ground management systems of what ground covers we're  
**1:03:47-1:03:51:**  using and how we manage those ground covers for the growth of the trees.  
**1:03:51-1:04:00:**  So we're constantly kind of balancing the demonstration aspect for different types of  
**1:04:00-1:04:05:**  farmers in that area, the research aspects so we can collect good data, and then just  
**1:04:05-1:04:12:**  like the ease of management of can we manage this system effectively.  
**1:04:12-1:04:16:**  And so far, at least for that site, it's worked out pretty well.  
**1:04:16-1:04:22:**  It's year two, so we have a lot more mistakes and a lot more work to do.  
**1:04:22-1:04:30:**  But all of that work that went into the design has paid off dividends and dividends because  
**1:04:30-1:04:36:**  we put the time in to do the research and the communication ahead of time.  
**1:04:36-1:04:41:**  And now we're just kind of tweaking systems as we go.  
**1:04:41-1:04:47:**  I have to say what I find very smart with your approach is the fact that you work with  
**1:04:47-1:04:51:**  farmers and other tenants that are in their reality and that you have to therefore compromise  
**1:04:51-1:04:53:**  and work with that reality.  
**1:04:53-1:04:58:**  Because if you were just 100% managing that land, it'd be so tempting to go for much more  
**1:04:58-1:05:04:**  complex systems because you have that freedom and then completely disconnect yourself from  
**1:05:04-1:05:07:**  your surroundings in terms of farming reality.  
**1:05:07-1:05:12:**  So I think that's really inspiring and really amazing that you get to have this dialogue  
**1:05:12-1:05:18:**  between maybe some very ambitious plans or ideas or things you've seen around and then  
**1:05:18-1:05:21:**  okay well let's make this work with the local context.  
**1:05:21-1:05:23:**  I think that's amazing.  
**1:05:23-1:05:28:**  And I was wondering when I was listening to you, so the deal with the farmer is he just  
**1:05:28-1:05:32:**  takes care of his crops and then you come in and do all the management of the trees  
**1:05:32-1:05:36:**  and then we'll also like sell the produce.  
**1:05:36-1:05:42:**  You have the kind of tree operation completely separate and that you're in charge with?  
**1:05:42-1:05:51:**  Yep, so the tree paddocks are completely managed, leased and profited through the Savannah Institute.  
**1:05:51-1:05:58:**  So this is one system we use for the demonstration farms is that if it's going to be a Savannah  
**1:05:58-1:06:06:**  Institute demonstration farm, Savannah Institute holds the overarching lease.  
**1:06:06-1:06:13:**  We make design decisions with input obviously, lots of community input and conversations  
**1:06:13-1:06:19:**  and we make the decisions on the ground for the lease sections that we hold and then we  
**1:06:19-1:06:27:**  manage and harvest and potentially profit from whatever's coming off of them.  
**1:06:27-1:06:36:**  So whether that be profit of research, profit of crop production, profit of education, that  
**1:06:36-1:06:41:**  sounds like a weird phrase to use.  
**1:06:41-1:06:46:**  But I'm assuming you're also really planning these systems as profitable economically because  
**1:06:46-1:06:51:**  if the plan is later for younger farmers to be able to replicate what the Savannah Institute  
**1:06:51-1:06:55:**  is doing today, it's quite important that you could earn a livelihood just from these  
**1:06:55-1:06:56:**  tree paddocks.  
**1:06:56-1:06:58:**  Yeah, 100%.  
**1:06:58-1:07:04:**  So that's one of the reasons that we have different systems on different demonstration  
**1:07:04-1:07:13:**  farms is to show the different economic possibilities from different practices.  
**1:07:13-1:07:19:**  So the alley cropping is kind of long term investment and profitability of timber.  
**1:07:19-1:07:26:**  So we have black locust, black walnut, swamp white oak and shagbark hickory as kind of  
**1:07:26-1:07:27:**  our timber species.  
**1:07:27-1:07:33:**  And then we're also adding a couple of rows this year of northern pecan, which is for  
**1:07:33-1:07:36:**  nut production but can also be used for timber as well.  
**1:07:36-1:07:43:**  And then on fields restored, which is another demonstration farm, we have an edible riparian  
**1:07:43-1:07:45:**  buffer.  
**1:07:45-1:07:50:**  So showcasing kind of the ways that we can use riparian buffers for water quality and  
**1:07:50-1:07:59:**  soil erosion prevention and soil health, but also creating harvestable profitable crops  
**1:07:59-1:08:03:**  that can come off of that riparian buffer.  
**1:08:03-1:08:08:**  And then there's also a silvopasture experiment happening there where we're looking at different  
**1:08:08-1:08:15:**  tree combinations in a silvopasture by addition, we're planting trees into pasture for fodder.  
**1:08:15-1:08:22:**  So with all of these things, we're taking labor numbers, we're taking establishment  
**1:08:22-1:08:30:**  cost numbers, and we're looking at labor hours so that we can actually provide really detailed  
**1:08:30-1:08:36:**  projections for folks around like all the work that was done, all the money that was  
**1:08:36-1:08:37:**  spent.  
**1:08:37-1:08:43:**  And here's the findings basically from these demonstration farms.  
**1:08:43-1:08:48:**  Have you found ways in the designs to ensure some like short term cash flow sometimes because  
**1:08:48-1:08:52:**  what's particularly difficult when you start a perennial system can be those first few  
**1:08:52-1:08:53:**  years of establishments.  
**1:08:53-1:08:58:**  And usually you can use sometimes the space between the trees to run chickens or have  
**1:08:58-1:09:03:**  animals or grow vegetables, anything that will kind of give you that short term income.  
**1:09:03-1:09:08:**  So if you don't have access to that in alley in a way, because you have like a system like  
**1:09:08-1:09:13:**  you're implementing with a farmer that's cultivating it, are you managing to do that  
**1:09:13-1:09:14:**  on the line then?  
**1:09:14-1:09:20:**  Yeah, so this has been a really kind of blind spot within the demonstration program here  
**1:09:20-1:09:26:**  in Illinois is that because of staffing and because we're managing multiple farm landscapes  
**1:09:26-1:09:33:**  at one time, we actually haven't been able to do any of that short term kind of annual  
**1:09:33-1:09:34:**  cash flowing.  
**1:09:34-1:09:40:**  That is really important for folks that need that transition help.  
**1:09:40-1:09:45:**  And like, obviously the situation that most young and small diversified farmers find themselves  
**1:09:45-1:09:49:**  in when they're wanting to add perennials to their landscape.  
**1:09:49-1:09:53:**  One thing that is going to help address that a little bit on the Savannah Institute side  
**1:09:53-1:09:59:**  is that the Savannah Institute now does own farmland in Spring Green, Wisconsin.  
**1:09:59-1:10:04:**  And so there's going to be farmers living on the property of that farm that's going  
**1:10:04-1:10:09:**  to allow livestock to come into the equation in a way that we haven't been able to do in  
**1:10:09-1:10:15:**  Illinois that is going to allow for annual production and more of these short term sort  
**1:10:15-1:10:22:**  of profit builders that allow for agroforestry transition that we're just not able to do  
**1:10:22-1:10:27:**  with the way that our staffing and network is set up here in Illinois.  
**1:10:27-1:10:33:**  So I mean, ultimately, you have to have both, right?  
**1:10:33-1:10:35:**  In order for it to work.  
**1:10:35-1:10:41:**  So we're just kind of demonstrating one model where it's more of this like grain sort of  
**1:10:41-1:10:42:**  grain transition model.  
**1:10:42-1:10:47:**  And in Wisconsin, they're going to be modeling completely different ways of doing that.  
**1:10:47-1:10:48:**  Amazing.  
**1:10:48-1:10:54:**  And in terms of the designs you've gone for, we kind of explored more like the timber system,  
**1:10:54-1:10:58:**  but then you also mentioned like edible riparian buffer.  
**1:10:58-1:11:02:**  Do you have then different levels of complexity that you go for, like some really simple ones  
**1:11:02-1:11:07:**  and some like more diversified and complex systems?  
**1:11:07-1:11:13:**  Yeah, so we've decided, you know, kind of the designs based on number one, the landscape.  
**1:11:13-1:11:19:**  So the landscape always comes first of, you know, what type of agroforestry can we do  
**1:11:19-1:11:23:**  to serve this landscape and this farm the best?  
**1:11:23-1:11:30:**  And then the second is looking outside of that farm to systems that we think folks would  
**1:11:30-1:11:36:**  want to see and could be operationalized on the surrounding landscapes.  
**1:11:36-1:11:43:**  And then the third thing is like, are we able to manage the systems that we design and create?  
**1:11:43-1:11:48:**  Because if we don't have the capacity, then we can't do it and we can't get good data  
**1:11:48-1:11:51:**  and we can't do it well.  
**1:11:51-1:11:56:**  But so we've gone with more simple systems than, I mean, there's complexity within every  
**1:11:56-1:12:03:**  system that we create, but we tend to go for the systems that are more easily managed in  
**1:12:03-1:12:08:**  terms of day to day or week to week or, you know, month to month management.  
**1:12:08-1:12:15:**  But we are bringing on a new demonstration farm in Champaign County where I'm located  
**1:12:15-1:12:20:**  and we have kind of our hub of personnel and equipment and things like that.  
**1:12:20-1:12:25:**  We're bringing out a farm that is going to be much more complex within its design and  
**1:12:25-1:12:26:**  management.  
**1:12:26-1:12:34:**  So for this farm, we're looking at fruit and nut alley cropping, which we haven't done  
**1:12:34-1:12:37:**  in other places and some kind of multi-story work within that.  
**1:12:37-1:12:42:**  We're looking at experimentation with different sized alleys within that alley cropping system.  
**1:12:42-1:12:48:**  So looking from 40 foot alleys to 120 foot alleys so we're able to see the differences  
**1:12:48-1:12:50:**  between those.  
**1:12:50-1:12:55:**  And we're also looking at elderberries and hazelnuts and things that, number one, come  
**1:12:55-1:13:01:**  into production a little, well, a lot sooner if we're talking about timber, but a little  
**1:13:01-1:13:06:**  sooner if we're talking about fruit and nut production and doing some variety trials and  
**1:13:06-1:13:11:**  some work around those so we can find, you know, what varieties are going to work really  
**1:13:11-1:13:14:**  well here in Illinois and the Midwest.  
**1:13:14-1:13:19:**  So those systems are going to take, they're going to be more complex in design.  
**1:13:19-1:13:22:**  They're going to be more complex in management.  
**1:13:22-1:13:27:**  But we're also going to only travel 10 minutes to manage those systems where the rest of  
**1:13:27-1:13:32:**  the demonstration farms in Illinois are spread out, sometimes an hour and a half between  
**1:13:32-1:13:38:**  each other, an hour and a half drive, which means we can't manage them daily.  
**1:13:38-1:13:42:**  So they're systems that we're managing weekly or monthly.  
**1:13:42-1:13:47:**  I think it will be really interesting to get the data out of that and see how it works  
**1:13:47-1:13:52:**  out because, you know, we had started with a very complex system when we were working  
**1:13:52-1:13:54:**  in Greece with Dimitri.  
**1:13:54-1:14:01:**  And although we saw how exciting it was on an ecological perspective, we also saw the  
**1:14:01-1:14:06:**  huge challenges coming in in terms of management and sometimes the additional costs linked  
**1:14:06-1:14:07:**  to complexity.  
**1:14:07-1:14:12:**  But, you know, we've already discussed that in previous episodes, but I'll be really interested  
**1:14:12-1:14:17:**  to see, you know, the same people measuring different things on different sites.  
**1:14:17-1:14:21:**  I think that would be fascinating data, really.  
**1:14:21-1:14:28:**  It's also been a stretch for me as someone that wants to dig really deep into one thing  
**1:14:28-1:14:30:**  and one place.  
**1:14:30-1:14:35:**  And this work across multiple landscapes has really forced me to change the ways that I  
**1:14:35-1:14:42:**  think about landscapes and places and work to accommodate sort of work that's spread out  
**1:14:42-1:14:47:**  a little bit instead of work that's more deep and localized.  
**1:14:47-1:14:49:**  And I would say there's trade-offs on both, obviously.  
**1:14:49-1:14:54:**  Like you were just saying, like complexity can lead to like deep ecological richness  
**1:14:54-1:14:57:**  that you wouldn't get from more simple systems.  
**1:14:57-1:15:02:**  But I think that the power within designing simple systems is you can build complexity  
**1:15:02-1:15:10:**  over time as you have time and capital and capacity, which is something that I've really  
**1:15:10-1:15:16:**  had to learn over these past couple years of working on the ground is where that balance  
**1:15:16-1:15:18:**  lies.  
**1:15:18-1:15:22:**  Because within farming, you're always going to...  
**1:15:22-1:15:27:**  Sometimes you feel like you're just putting out fires, right?  
**1:15:27-1:15:28:**  Instead of farming.  
**1:15:28-1:15:32:**  So how can you get to the point where you put out a fire once a week or once a month  
**1:15:32-1:15:35:**  instead of putting out fires daily?  
**1:15:35-1:15:36:**  Yeah.  
**1:15:36-1:15:40:**  Yeah, that's a good analogy.  
**1:15:40-1:15:44:**  And are you keeping timber in your designs?  
**1:15:44-1:15:50:**  For example, I was talking with Eric Tonesmeyer recently, and he's actually writing a little  
**1:15:50-1:15:55:**  booklet on alley cropping and that he'll be releasing.  
**1:15:55-1:15:59:**  And he was saying, because he obviously studied a lot of systems in Europe, especially in  
**1:15:59-1:16:00:**  France.  
**1:16:00-1:16:03:**  And then he was telling me a bit what was going on in the US.  
**1:16:03-1:16:07:**  And he was saying that in the US, people are moving away from timber and going more towards  
**1:16:07-1:16:11:**  nuts and fruits just for a question of like harvest cycles.  
**1:16:11-1:16:18:**  And people weren't willing to wait 40 years to get a return on their investments.  
**1:16:18-1:16:23:**  Is that something you're getting that vibe from the field as well and talking with farmers?  
**1:16:23-1:16:31:**  Yeah, I think it depends on the type of farmer and landowner and what they actually need.  
**1:16:31-1:16:35:**  I think that there's need for both kind of long term and short term.  
**1:16:35-1:16:41:**  If we are constantly going short term, then we're kind of selling ourselves short a little  
**1:16:41-1:16:42:**  bit.  
**1:16:42-1:16:47:**  And if we don't incorporate timber into these agroforestry systems, then we'll just continue  
**1:16:47-1:16:50:**  plantation lumber production.  
**1:16:50-1:16:53:**  So I think that there's room and opportunity for both.  
**1:16:53-1:17:00:**  But I want to recognize what Eric is saying there, because that shorter turnaround and  
**1:17:00-1:17:08:**  that higher profit margin is vital for letting folks actually engage in these types of practices  
**1:17:08-1:17:12:**  that are perennial and take a large amount of investment.  
**1:17:12-1:17:16:**  So I think that there's ways to do both.  
**1:17:16-1:17:23:**  But it depends on what scale and what location and who's engaged in the work.  
**1:17:23-1:17:31:**  So when it comes to cash flowing, that's really a question for each individual farmer and  
**1:17:31-1:17:37:**  landowner of fruit and nuts are probably meeting the goals that they're setting for themselves  
**1:17:37-1:17:42:**  in a much faster and different way than timber production is.  
**1:17:42-1:17:50:**  And for folks that have smaller land footprints, of course that would make way more sense.  
**1:17:50-1:17:55:**  But here in the Midwest, where we have large tracts of land that are sometimes owned by  
**1:17:55-1:18:02:**  one person or one entity, and then I think we have different possibilities and also kind  
**1:18:02-1:18:09:**  of creates long term transition that can happen on that landscape.  
**1:18:09-1:18:14:**  So I think that both are important.  
**1:18:14-1:18:20:**  But from the smaller landholding folks that we work with, fruit and nut is absolutely  
**1:18:20-1:18:26:**  what they're going for within their alley cropping and perennial systems.  
**1:18:26-1:18:33:**  I'm wondering, have you developed some ideas on the sales aspect, because that's obviously  
**1:18:33-1:18:35:**  a few years down the line.  
**1:18:35-1:18:40:**  But how are you planning to commercialize and also handle the logistics on all these  
**1:18:40-1:18:42:**  different sites?  
**1:18:42-1:18:46:**  Yeah, that's a really great question.  
**1:18:46-1:18:49:**  One of the things that we're looking at when it comes to sort of the marketing and logistics  
**1:18:49-1:18:57:**  of these is how can we incorporate our apprenticeship program into the demonstration farm program?  
**1:18:57-1:19:02:**  Are there folks that are coming out of the apprenticeship program that would be open,  
**1:19:02-1:19:08:**  willing and able to kind of take over the systems that we've put into place, where they  
**1:19:08-1:19:14:**  become the main managers, they become the profitors of those sites, and they sort of  
**1:19:14-1:19:19:**  put in the work to do that, either on a short term or a long term scale, so that we can  
**1:19:19-1:19:25:**  sort of provide land access and business opportunity to folks.  
**1:19:25-1:19:31:**  We recognize that that's not always appealing to folks, because oftentimes folks want to  
**1:19:31-1:19:37:**  set up their own systems and they want to kind of build their own businesses.  
**1:19:37-1:19:43:**  But it's an opportunity to learn as you're growing.  
**1:19:43-1:19:48:**  And for example, my husband and I rent an apple orchard.  
**1:19:48-1:19:50:**  And it's a yearly lease.  
**1:19:50-1:19:55:**  But we did this, number one, to keep an apple orchard in production from a couple that was  
**1:19:55-1:20:01:**  retiring, and two, so we could actually learn how to manage apples.  
**1:20:01-1:20:06:**  So we run a business on rented orchard land with this apple orchard, and it's been really  
**1:20:06-1:20:09:**  great for us to see what works and what doesn't work.  
**1:20:09-1:20:13:**  And it's provided us an opportunity that we would have never had if we were starting from  
**1:20:13-1:20:16:**  scratch with young trees.  
**1:20:16-1:20:21:**  So I think there's an opportunity for us to do that with the apprenticeship program and  
**1:20:21-1:20:25:**  to actually provide options for folks afterwards.  
**1:20:25-1:20:31:**  And if that ends up staying within the Savannah Institute, for timber, there's already markets  
**1:20:31-1:20:34:**  in Illinois for timber.  
**1:20:34-1:20:39:**  So being able to sell that, there's strong market channels where that would be easy to  
**1:20:39-1:20:40:**  move.  
**1:20:40-1:20:47:**  For things like fruit and nuts, we're helping build those systems of processing and aggregation  
**1:20:47-1:20:51:**  that we would just then support the systems that are already in place.  
**1:20:51-1:20:59:**  Or if we have an opportunity to be a host to a processing facility or things like that,  
**1:20:59-1:21:06:**  then that would also work within our mission and help support not only us, but other folks  
**1:21:06-1:21:09:**  in that region as well.  
**1:21:09-1:21:13:**  And what scale do you see the demonstration farms evolving to?  
**1:21:13-1:21:18:**  Because obviously it's like a huge amount, I hadn't realized that you kind of design,  
**1:21:18-1:21:26:**  manage and actually fully manage the whole perennial aspects of it.  
**1:21:26-1:21:31:**  So are you kind of reaching a steady level where you're just going to be following up  
**1:21:31-1:21:32:**  on what's been put into place?  
**1:21:32-1:21:37:**  Or are you going to, because I assume that the more time goes by, people are going to  
**1:21:37-1:21:41:**  come with you wanting, I'm a landowner, I have an opportunity, I want to put trees on.  
**1:21:41-1:21:45:**  But at some point you do have to kind of stay like, we can't do this anymore.  
**1:21:45-1:21:49:**  You'll end up having like a huge farming entity.  
**1:21:49-1:22:00:**  Yeah, our goal is not to farm like thousands and thousands and thousands of acres of land.  
**1:22:00-1:22:04:**  But this is a big question that, you know, Savannah Institute is going through a strategic  
**1:22:04-1:22:06:**  planning process right now.  
**1:22:06-1:22:11:**  And this is a big question that we have within the demonstration farm program that, you know,  
**1:22:11-1:22:17:**  we're really looking at, you know, what are these farms doing?  
**1:22:17-1:22:19:**  Why are they here on the landscape?  
**1:22:19-1:22:26:**  And what are the boundaries that we set for ourselves to ensure that we have robust management,  
**1:22:26-1:22:33:**  good oversight, and that we're utilizing the opportunities that come to us effectively?  
**1:22:33-1:22:40:**  So sometimes that means that we say no and suggest someone else.  
**1:22:40-1:22:46:**  And then, you know, allow those opportunities to go to other folks.  
**1:22:46-1:22:54:**  But you know, we created a decision matrix for deciding how we would bring on other farms.  
**1:22:54-1:23:00:**  And so part of that decision matrix is, are we able to showcase a practice here that we  
**1:23:00-1:23:03:**  can't showcase in the other place?  
**1:23:03-1:23:10:**  Is there genetic diversity on this landscape that we want to maintain and support?  
**1:23:10-1:23:16:**  Does this demonstration farm serve a community that we're not currently serving and has been  
**1:23:16-1:23:22:**  asked for or provided interest from that community?  
**1:23:22-1:23:27:**  Are we able to have a long-term lease here so that we can do the work that we need to  
**1:23:27-1:23:31:**  do and make sure that it serves Savannah Institute as well as the landscape?  
**1:23:31-1:23:36:**  So these are like the big questions that we're asking as folks are like, it would be great  
**1:23:36-1:23:42:**  to have a demonstration farm on my property or this property, but we have to be able to  
**1:23:42-1:23:44:**  manage it.  
**1:23:44-1:23:48:**  So you know, we have a hub of work in Champaign County, Illinois.  
**1:23:48-1:23:52:**  We're going to be having a hub of work in Spring Green, Wisconsin.  
**1:23:52-1:23:58:**  So it all comes down to that decision matrix, funding levels, and things like that.  
**1:23:58-1:24:04:**  But ultimately, our goal with like all of our programs is for us not to be ever constantly  
**1:24:04-1:24:11:**  expanding but for us to help hopefully build some strong models that can be replicated  
**1:24:11-1:24:16:**  for other organizations and other farmers and landowners so that we don't have to have  
**1:24:16-1:24:18:**  a demonstration farm everywhere.  
**1:24:18-1:24:25:**  So that there's actually other demonstration farms and demonstration sites that are managed  
**1:24:25-1:24:33:**  and run and ultimately serving people that just isn't the Savannah Institute.  
**1:24:33-1:24:41:**  And maybe as a final question, although maybe it should have been my first question, but  
**1:24:41-1:24:47:**  are there some really interesting mistakes or challenges that you encountered that you'd  
**1:24:47-1:24:53:**  like to share and that could inspire maybe other people experimenting with agroforestry  
**1:24:53-1:24:54:**  systems?  
**1:24:54-1:24:59:**  I'll say that I've made an incredible amount of mistakes and that I'm still pretty young  
**1:24:59-1:25:01:**  and new to agroforestry.  
**1:25:01-1:25:09:**  So I have at least 50 years of mistake making ahead of me.  
**1:25:09-1:25:16:**  But I feel like the biggest mistake that I've personally made and that we've made on our  
**1:25:16-1:25:21:**  demonstration farms is sometimes moving too fast.  
**1:25:21-1:25:29:**  So what I mean by that is having a really great idea, thinking we have all the data,  
**1:25:29-1:25:37:**  thinking we know what we're doing, and then moving forward without doing some deep observation.  
**1:25:37-1:25:43:**  So this is, I say this in terms of like, in my mind it's great to have at least a year  
**1:25:43-1:25:50:**  on a property before planting anything perennial so that you learn how humans and animals and  
**1:25:50-1:25:56:**  equipment and water and the sun move across the landscape.  
**1:25:56-1:26:03:**  And you look at a full season of pest cycles, you look at a full cycle of freezing and thawing  
**1:26:03-1:26:06:**  and depending on where you're at.  
**1:26:06-1:26:11:**  And then that might change where you will put certain things because when you plant  
**1:26:11-1:26:14:**  a tree, that tree is there for a long time.  
**1:26:14-1:26:18:**  And our goal is always right tree, right time, right place.  
**1:26:18-1:26:23:**  And so if you move too quickly, it's really easy to mess up one of those three things.  
**1:26:23-1:26:31:**  So I feel like a lot of mistakes, especially when it comes to weed pressure, establishing  
**1:26:31-1:26:41:**  ground cover, choosing the right species in the right soils, taking a year or at least  
**1:26:41-1:26:47:**  a couple seasons to make those deep observations can pay off dividends.  
**1:26:47-1:26:55:**  And I especially say this with weeds, with weed management and establishing ground cover.  
**1:26:55-1:27:03:**  If you get the timing and the right ground cover or management system right, you actually  
**1:27:03-1:27:06:**  don't spend that much time weeding.  
**1:27:06-1:27:12:**  If you don't get the timing and the ground cover right, you spend the majority of your  
**1:27:12-1:27:14:**  time weeding.  
**1:27:14-1:27:23:**  So I've done more weed whipping than I ever cared to do in my entire life.  
**1:27:23-1:27:31:**  So every design and system that I help with is always focused on how do we not weed whip  
**1:27:31-1:27:41:**  ever at this site because I am done with that type of management.  
**1:27:41-1:27:49:**  So I'm looking at how can we use landscape fabric, how can we use heavy mulching, what  
**1:27:49-1:27:55:**  are the different mechanisms that we can use for seeding, what are different ground cover  
**1:27:55-1:28:02:**  combinations or cover cropping schemes that we can get our weed seed banks down so that  
**1:28:02-1:28:05:**  we don't have to be weeding.  
**1:28:05-1:28:11:**  I feel like that's the biggest mistake that I've made and we've made.  
**1:28:11-1:28:22:**  And I would say also another one that I've kind of struggled with is timing.  
**1:28:22-1:28:31:**  So getting the timing right for things like planting, pruning, spraying, even weeding  
**1:28:31-1:28:36:**  to make sure that you're knocking things back before they set and drop seeds.  
**1:28:36-1:28:43:**  When you're managing multiple landscapes, if you miss a window, that might set you back  
**1:28:43-1:28:46:**  an entire year.  
**1:28:46-1:28:51:**  So when it comes to design, and this is one of the reasons that we're starting a little  
**1:28:51-1:28:57:**  more simple and more complex and then adding the complexity in later, is it can be really  
**1:28:57-1:29:02:**  difficult to get all the timing right across multiple landscapes.  
**1:29:02-1:29:07:**  And I didn't even mention this, but pest cycles.  
**1:29:07-1:29:13:**  You're not on the farm, maybe, and you'll miss the larva stage or the egg stage where  
**1:29:13-1:29:16:**  you can easily knock back a pest.  
**1:29:16-1:29:20:**  But you're not there to see it, and so you miss it completely.  
**1:29:20-1:29:27:**  So integrated pest management becomes really, really difficult across multiple landscapes.  
**1:29:27-1:29:34:**  So that's a big, big blind spot and mistake that we've made.  
**1:29:34-1:29:41:**  And then the third is making sure you have the right equipment for the job.  
**1:29:41-1:29:46:**  And sometimes that means waiting until you can afford the right piece of equipment or  
**1:29:46-1:29:51:**  not designing your system around the equipment you think is coming but you might not ever  
**1:29:51-1:29:52:**  get.  
**1:29:52-1:30:00:**  So just being really honest with the equipment that you have now, the time you have now to  
**1:30:00-1:30:07:**  do it, because the equipment thing is really, really, really hard.  
**1:30:07-1:30:14:**  Especially when you're borrowing equipment or things break down or things like that.  
**1:30:14-1:30:20:**  So we've been traveling around in a bus for the past two years, so the equipment that  
**1:30:20-1:30:22:**  we've been able to use has been limited.  
**1:30:22-1:30:28:**  And Sand Institute is getting some tractors and things that are going to make things a  
**1:30:28-1:30:29:**  little easier.  
**1:30:29-1:30:31:**  Yeah, for sure.  
**1:30:31-1:30:36:**  Yeah, thank you so much for sharing this so honestly.  
**1:30:36-1:30:40:**  And it's always more interesting to hear about what went wrong than what went well, isn't  
**1:30:40-1:30:41:**  it?  
**1:30:41-1:30:43:**  So all our listeners will be happy.  
**1:30:43-1:30:45:**  Yeah, check back with me next year.  
**1:30:45-1:30:48:**  I'll have more mistakes to add to it.  
**1:30:48-1:30:50:**  And successes, I'm sure.  
**1:30:50-1:30:51:**  Oh yeah.  
**1:30:51-1:30:54:**  But yeah, we will, with great pleasure.  
**1:30:54-1:30:57:**  It was really fascinating to talk with you today.  
**1:30:57-1:30:59:**  So thank you so much for coming on the podcast.  
**1:30:59-1:31:01:**  Yeah, thank you so much for having me.  
**1:31:01-1:31:06:**  This has been such a wonderful conversation and I just want to express some gratitude  
**1:31:06-1:31:12:**  to you and Dimitri for this podcast and all the wisdom and knowledge that's shared.  
**1:31:12-1:31:19:**  It's been really fascinating and hopeful and just so wonderful to be able to learn from  
**1:31:19-1:31:22:**  so many different people in one place.  
**1:31:22-1:31:25:**  So thank you so much.

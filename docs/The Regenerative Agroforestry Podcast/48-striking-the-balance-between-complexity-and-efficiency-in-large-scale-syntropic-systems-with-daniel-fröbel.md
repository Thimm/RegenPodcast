### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:48:46)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:30:**  a promising technique called agroforestry.  
**0:00:30-0:00:35:**  In order to find out how it can help us with these challenges, we'll be interviewing farmers,  
**0:00:35-0:00:40:**  scientists, and other experts to share with you their experiences, practical advice, and  
**0:00:40-0:00:45:**  scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:48:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:53:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we have the immense pleasure of welcoming Danielle Froebel  
**0:00:53-0:00:54:**  on the show.  
**0:00:54-0:01:02:**  So Danielle is the co-founder of the Agroforestry branch of Mata do Lobo, a 2,800 farm in the  
**0:01:02-0:01:05:**  Guayas region of Brazil.  
**0:01:05-0:01:13:**  And this farm produces soybeans, corn, other beans, and also has a pig fattening operation.  
**0:01:13-0:01:17:**  And they've decided to diversify with centropic agroforestry.  
**0:01:17-0:01:21:**  And we're really interested in this because it's quite a good follow up from the last  
**0:01:21-0:01:28:**  conversation we had with Mark Leiber who introduced us to centropic.  
**0:01:28-0:01:33:**  And today Danielle is going to show us how they are scaling the centropic system up to  
**0:01:33-0:01:36:**  a 50 hectares on the farm.  
**0:01:36-0:01:39:**  So Danielle, thank you so much for joining us today and welcome on the show.  
**0:01:39-0:01:42:**  Hey Dimitri, thanks for having me.  
**0:01:42-0:01:43:**  Awesome.  
**0:01:43-0:01:47:**  I really look forward to this conversation.  
**0:01:47-0:01:49:**  From what I understood, you know Mark, right?  
**0:01:49-0:01:50:**  Yes.  
**0:01:50-0:01:53:**  I got to know him in Portugal.  
**0:01:53-0:01:59:**  I just can't quite remember if it was like two or three years ago, but yeah, I got to  
**0:01:59-0:02:00:**  know him.  
**0:02:00-0:02:01:**  Amazing.  
**0:02:01-0:02:03:**  That's really cool.  
**0:02:03-0:02:09:**  And so, you know, the first thing I want to ask you, and I think is important also for  
**0:02:09-0:02:15:**  our guests to know is who is managing the Instagram account of Mata do Lobo?  
**0:02:15-0:02:16:**  Because it is just phenomenal.  
**0:02:16-0:02:21:**  And I advise all of our guests right now before they start to open their phone and to check  
**0:02:21-0:02:26:**  it out and to look at some of the pictures because it's going to give a lot of visual  
**0:02:26-0:02:30:**  information as to what we're going to be talking about today.  
**0:02:30-0:02:36:**  Well, firstly, nice to hear never anybody said something like that.  
**0:02:36-0:02:38:**  I'm sure they have.  
**0:02:38-0:02:39:**  It's so good.  
**0:02:39-0:02:40:**  There's so much info.  
**0:02:40-0:02:44:**  No, we're just, it's me and my wife.  
**0:02:44-0:02:49:**  We just managing it spontaneously like at the beginning I did lots of posts, but now  
**0:02:49-0:02:53:**  they, I really got lazy of Instagram.  
**0:02:53-0:03:00:**  So my wife is doing all the work and sometimes I just going into the fields of filming something  
**0:03:00-0:03:07:**  and then I give the photos and everything to her and then she just processes it and  
**0:03:07-0:03:12:**  yeah, but it's all her merit nowadays.  
**0:03:12-0:03:13:**  Nice.  
**0:03:13-0:03:19:**  And I wanted to also tell our listeners that we wanted to get you and your wife on it together,  
**0:03:19-0:03:22:**  but as you had told me, your wife doesn't speak so good English, right?  
**0:03:22-0:03:26:**  So we're, so we're just with you at the moment.  
**0:03:26-0:03:27:**  Exactly.  
**0:03:27-0:03:28:**  Yes.  
**0:03:28-0:03:29:**  Mm hmm.  
**0:03:29-0:03:30:**  Nice.  
**0:03:30-0:03:38:**  So yeah, maybe you could tell us a bit about how you got started in agriculture, in agroforestry.  
**0:03:38-0:03:44:**  How did you end up having this epic project going at Matador Lobo, maybe giving us a bit  
**0:03:44-0:03:47:**  of context as to the story?  
**0:03:47-0:03:48:**  Okay.  
**0:03:48-0:03:56:**  It's going to be a long story because I actually, I was born in Germany, right?  
**0:03:56-0:03:58:**  I'm from Berlin.  
**0:03:58-0:04:02:**  I'm originally an urban guy.  
**0:04:02-0:04:04:**  So I studied in Germany.  
**0:04:04-0:04:11:**  I studied environmental and resource management and then I, I went into agricultural economics  
**0:04:11-0:04:15:**  just out of, out of interest.  
**0:04:15-0:04:23:**  And during this, these studies I had like an exchange semester in Brazil and the University  
**0:04:23-0:04:26:**  of Sao Paulo.  
**0:04:26-0:04:29:**  And that's where I got to know my, my wife.  
**0:04:29-0:04:31:**  Her name is Maria, by the way.  
**0:04:31-0:04:33:**  And amazing.  
**0:04:33-0:04:34:**  So we got, we got to know that.  
**0:04:34-0:04:42:**  And then her father, her father, he has like, he is the owner of Matador Lobo, right?  
**0:04:42-0:04:47:**  And that's when I really first set foot on the farm.  
**0:04:47-0:04:50:**  It was in 2013.  
**0:04:50-0:04:57:**  I really didn't have any idea of agriculture or I don't know of all the practical details  
**0:04:57-0:04:58:**  of agriculture.  
**0:04:58-0:05:06:**  For example, I, I drive through Brazil and I wouldn't, I wouldn't know what a soybean  
**0:05:06-0:05:08:**  looks like.  
**0:05:08-0:05:13:**  I was really like a nobody, you know, I didn't know anything.  
**0:05:13-0:05:21:**  So yeah, but then in 2016 we decided to, to get married and then we decided also to move  
**0:05:21-0:05:23:**  to Brazil.  
**0:05:23-0:05:30:**  And Maria's father gave us this, this great opportunity to, to work at the farm, Matador  
**0:05:30-0:05:32:**  Lobo, right?  
**0:05:32-0:05:41:**  And at the time it was like a complete a hundred percent conventional farm, like a grain farm.  
**0:05:41-0:05:52:**  And so we started working there and we just like operating and helping, helping my father  
**0:05:52-0:05:54:**  in law, right?  
**0:05:54-0:05:59:**  We just saw like the immense amount of, of like agricultural inputs that I used there,  
**0:05:59-0:06:06:**  like pesticides, all kinds of fertilizers.  
**0:06:06-0:06:11:**  And it was really impressive because like the list of products that they use nowadays  
**0:06:11-0:06:19:**  in Brazil and tropical agriculture is like, wow, it's like, it was really a shock to us,  
**0:06:19-0:06:21:**  you know?  
**0:06:21-0:06:27:**  And especially what it means in terms of dependency also for the farmer, right?  
**0:06:27-0:06:35:**  And what this means for the, for the profit margin too, like the farmers really, really  
**0:06:35-0:06:40:**  just in many cases, just barely surviving, right?  
**0:06:40-0:06:47:**  And the big money is made by the, by the fertilizer and pesticide companies.  
**0:06:47-0:06:53:**  So the first intuition when we got there and we, we moved there, we, we started living  
**0:06:53-0:06:55:**  on the farm.  
**0:06:55-0:07:02:**  The first intuition was like, let's find a way to get out of this dependency, right?  
**0:07:02-0:07:07:**  Because it's really, I don't know, it brings a really bad feeling to be dependent on so  
**0:07:07-0:07:08:**  much stuff.  
**0:07:08-0:07:17:**  And so we started studying like various, various forms of different, different agriculture.  
**0:07:17-0:07:27:**  And then, yeah, like after a couple of months, we stumbled upon this, this course that was  
**0:07:27-0:07:34:**  offered that this workshop that was offered by, I think, at the time it was Namaste.  
**0:07:34-0:07:40:**  Namaste is a pretty famous agroforestry guy in Brazil.  
**0:07:40-0:07:47:**  And so we started, we applied for this workshop and then we started studying about centropic  
**0:07:47-0:07:49:**  agriculture, right?  
**0:07:49-0:07:51:**  And so that's where it all started.  
**0:07:51-0:07:56:**  And like, we really fell in love with the idea, you know, especially with the idea to  
**0:07:56-0:08:07:**  build like a complex agroforestry system that is completely independent from, from any input,  
**0:08:07-0:08:08:**  you know?  
**0:08:08-0:08:15:**  And so, yeah, we started studying, started studying, and then we started talking to my  
**0:08:15-0:08:17:**  father-in-law.  
**0:08:17-0:08:24:**  He could give us like some land to, I don't know, to test some stuff to practice.  
**0:08:24-0:08:30:**  Then he would just say, oh, I have this plot, you have 50 hectares.  
**0:08:30-0:08:33:**  If you want, you can plant by the end of this year.  
**0:08:33-0:08:38:**  We were just totally, I don't know, totally overwhelmed because 50 hectares is quite a  
**0:08:38-0:08:42:**  lot, you know?  
**0:08:42-0:08:46:**  But for him is like just this little piece of land, you know?  
**0:08:46-0:08:53:**  And so we got really, I don't know, we got really overwhelmed and we somehow got in touch  
**0:08:53-0:08:58:**  with Ernst Goertz, right?  
**0:08:58-0:09:04:**  We talked to him and we convinced him to come down to the farm and give some ideas to us,  
**0:09:04-0:09:07:**  to my father-in-law.  
**0:09:07-0:09:09:**  And yeah, that's where it all started.  
**0:09:09-0:09:20:**  So we worked out some designs with him and decided that we want to go into coffee production.  
**0:09:20-0:09:30:**  So coffee production is, how do you say, is the main cash crop of the agroforestry.  
**0:09:30-0:09:34:**  Okay, very interesting.  
**0:09:34-0:09:39:**  And I'm just curious because, you know, when you talk about complex and tropic systems,  
**0:09:39-0:09:46:**  that's very different agricultural approach to conventional corn and soy rotations.  
**0:09:46-0:09:48:**  And so if even there is rotation.  
**0:09:48-0:09:52:**  So I'm curious as to what, you know, your father-in-law and I'm sure he has a large  
**0:09:52-0:09:53:**  team there.  
**0:09:53-0:10:01:**  What were their initial thoughts about, you know, having such a massive paradigm shift?  
**0:10:01-0:10:06:**  Of course on a small plot, but I'm curious as to how that culturally, you know, sat for  
**0:10:06-0:10:07:**  him.  
**0:10:07-0:10:14:**  No, actually for him, I have to give like a huge credit to him because he was surprisingly  
**0:10:14-0:10:21:**  open to this and we even went to visit a farm in Sao Paulo state that's also quite famous  
**0:10:21-0:10:32:**  and Ernst worked on this farm like to start scaling centropic agroforestry.  
**0:10:32-0:10:33:**  It's Fazenda da Toca.  
**0:10:33-0:10:35:**  It's really quite famous.  
**0:10:35-0:10:45:**  That's how he visited this farm and yeah, I think he just saw there, ah, maybe it's  
**0:10:45-0:10:46:**  possible.  
**0:10:46-0:10:53:**  It looks really good and most of all, maybe we can do even better, you know, and he just  
**0:10:53-0:11:00:**  wanted to, if you guys like it, okay, then just do it, but do it like really, how do  
**0:11:00-0:11:03:**  you say it?  
**0:11:03-0:11:08:**  Let's do it a hundred percent, you know, let's don't just try to turn on.  
**0:11:08-0:11:15:**  Let's do it like full on, you know, and that reminds me of conversations that I had with  
**0:11:15-0:11:17:**  my father when we were starting Massey Farm as well.  
**0:11:17-0:11:23:**  It was like, you know, the same kind of approach, I guess it's interesting, but then, oh, but  
**0:11:23-0:11:24:**  then that's my father-in-law.  
**0:11:24-0:11:32:**  But then if we talk about like all the workers and neighbors and we have, for example, a  
**0:11:32-0:11:41:**  good friend here in the city of Rio Verde and we were talking about this idea and he  
**0:11:41-0:11:51:**  just said, ah, I can offer you something like in two years, if everything goes wrong, I  
**0:11:51-0:11:58:**  can borrow you some machines to rip out all the trees again and plant soybeans.  
**0:11:58-0:12:08:**  So I think that sums up like the mean opinions like of the people in the region, right?  
**0:12:08-0:12:09:**  So it, but that's the beginning, right?  
**0:12:09-0:12:15:**  It all over the years, the dynamic quite changed a little bit.  
**0:12:15-0:12:20:**  So I'm curious as to the objectives of this agroforestry plot, were you really looking  
**0:12:20-0:12:27:**  to do something that's, you know, economically viable and kind of maximizing, let's say,  
**0:12:27-0:12:29:**  maximizing the economics of agroforestry for that plot?  
**0:12:29-0:12:35:**  So were you looking to do more something kind of to learn kind of research-based to actually,  
**0:12:35-0:12:42:**  let's say the main objective, like which we are still, it's of course economics.  
**0:12:42-0:12:48:**  We want to create like a large scale system that is economically viable, but there are  
**0:12:48-0:12:53:**  like some sub objectives that are quite different, I would say.  
**0:12:53-0:13:03:**  For example, like it was really, how do you say, if you, if we talk about complex centropic  
**0:13:03-0:13:11:**  agriculture, like Mark Leiber was talking about, you use like really thousands and thousands  
**0:13:11-0:13:18:**  of specimen on one hectare, for example, and like really an immense amount of species,  
**0:13:18-0:13:19:**  right?  
**0:13:19-0:13:26:**  Like in a really dense plantation.  
**0:13:26-0:13:29:**  And if you do that, it's quite easy in my mind.  
**0:13:29-0:13:34:**  And we tested this at first, like in really small scale plots, like let's say a hundred  
**0:13:34-0:13:37:**  square meters and something.  
**0:13:37-0:13:43:**  And it's really easy to achieve like input independency, right?  
**0:13:43-0:13:49:**  So you do the system, maybe at the beginning you fertilize it, but in some cases you don't  
**0:13:49-0:13:50:**  even need it.  
**0:13:50-0:13:53:**  And the system just works on its own.  
**0:13:53-0:14:04:**  You then you prune the system, you prune the trees, you accelerate the organic matter recycling,  
**0:14:04-0:14:05:**  right?  
**0:14:05-0:14:08:**  And the system just works on its own.  
**0:14:08-0:14:11:**  So now we want to do it on large scale.  
**0:14:11-0:14:21:**  We need, for example, for the coffee production and for the managing of the organic material,  
**0:14:21-0:14:24:**  we need to, we need machines, right?  
**0:14:24-0:14:31:**  Like for example, we need a tractor to pass between the lines and we need to simplify.  
**0:14:31-0:14:37:**  It's really hard to work with, I don't know, a hundred species on a 50 hectare scale and  
**0:14:37-0:14:41:**  like manage it somehow mechanically.  
**0:14:41-0:14:56:**  So a really big sub objective is to find a system, like a prototype for our region, right?  
**0:14:56-0:15:04:**  Which is economically viable, but also doesn't need an input like on a long scale, you know?  
**0:15:04-0:15:12:**  So the question is by how many species, by how much plant density we can simplify the  
**0:15:12-0:15:20:**  system so that it still works independently and doesn't need any disease control from  
**0:15:20-0:15:24:**  outside or any fertilizers, right?  
**0:15:24-0:15:26:**  So that's the big question.  
**0:15:26-0:15:28:**  Yeah, for sure.  
**0:15:28-0:15:31:**  No, it makes a lot of sense.  
**0:15:31-0:15:39:**  And some people will kind of be kind of shocked or impressed to hear that you can have a system  
**0:15:39-0:15:46:**  that is this really complex system you're talking about that doesn't require any inputs  
**0:15:46-0:15:48:**  to work.  
**0:15:48-0:15:50:**  And so I'm just going to ask you to reconfirm that.  
**0:15:50-0:15:55:**  Is that something that you've really, you've experienced there on your land in your context  
**0:15:55-0:16:01:**  that things just work like trees, fruit trees grow and produce in that kind of context?  
**0:16:01-0:16:03:**  No, I totally can confirm it.  
**0:16:03-0:16:11:**  Like the plot, the oldest plot, it's like five years old, right?  
**0:16:11-0:16:14:**  And it's a small scale plot, 100 square meters.  
**0:16:14-0:16:17:**  And we planted it, it was our first or second plot.  
**0:16:17-0:16:21:**  The first didn't go so well.  
**0:16:21-0:16:29:**  And then we rethought everything and like did it in, let's say, had more luck or planted  
**0:16:29-0:16:34:**  more densely, adapted our whole planting system there.  
**0:16:34-0:16:35:**  And it is possible.  
**0:16:35-0:16:42:**  And I, until now I didn't, I didn't use any fertilizer, anything, but it's the, it's still,  
**0:16:42-0:16:45:**  it's a small scale plot, right?  
**0:16:45-0:16:54:**  And we also, we also made some soil analysis and it's really interesting because the organic  
**0:16:54-0:16:56:**  matter content like really increased.  
**0:16:56-0:17:01:**  I think it's, it's 18% or something.  
**0:17:01-0:17:07:**  And the phosphorus amount is like really insanely high on this plot too.  
**0:17:07-0:17:10:**  And it got confirmed by university too.  
**0:17:10-0:17:16:**  So there was a master student that came there and like took some soil samples and took it  
**0:17:16-0:17:20:**  to the professors and they were like, ah, but it's not possible.  
**0:17:20-0:17:22:**  Take it again.  
**0:17:22-0:17:24:**  You know, it's really surprising.  
**0:17:24-0:17:25:**  But wow.  
**0:17:25-0:17:30:**  Yeah, and then again, on the large scale, it's a whole different story.  
**0:17:30-0:17:39:**  We are still like, I call it like a transitioning system because we are still applying some  
**0:17:39-0:17:40:**  fertilizers.  
**0:17:40-0:17:42:**  It's, it's certified organic, right?  
**0:17:42-0:17:50:**  So we, we use compost, we use manure, for example, like in the first year, because for  
**0:17:50-0:17:57:**  example, coffee is like really, it's like really dependent on some, on some available  
**0:17:57-0:17:59:**  nitrogen at the beginning.  
**0:17:59-0:18:03:**  So we have to use some, some other fertilizers.  
**0:18:03-0:18:08:**  And so how many years in that, like, let's say in this transition system or the larger  
**0:18:08-0:18:13:**  scale system, how many years are you expecting to be continually bringing in fertility?  
**0:18:13-0:18:20:**  Ah, like, I think like about three years would be a realistic number.  
**0:18:20-0:18:22:**  And then you can just let it go.  
**0:18:22-0:18:29:**  Yeah, but it's like, it's really hard to say too, but because we are still adapting like  
**0:18:29-0:18:34:**  on the, on the species composition of the whole system.  
**0:18:34-0:18:38:**  And that's the tricky, the tricky, the tricky part of it.  
**0:18:38-0:18:44:**  Like what trees to use and what spacings to make it like easy, easy, manageable, right?  
**0:18:44-0:18:47:**  And large scale to make the coffee harvest easy.  
**0:18:47-0:18:53:**  There's so many components and so many plants that I don't know, for example, there are  
**0:18:53-0:18:54:**  so many variables, right?  
**0:18:54-0:18:59:**  For example, you have one plant and I don't know how this plant will behave like five  
**0:18:59-0:19:01:**  years from now, you know?  
**0:19:01-0:19:08:**  So it's really, and how it will interact with some other plant on the other end of the,  
**0:19:08-0:19:09:**  of the system.  
**0:19:09-0:19:17:**  So it's really a really complex task, you know, to, to simplify a syntropic system.  
**0:19:17-0:19:18:**  Yeah.  
**0:19:18-0:19:22:**  And I mean, in general, this is one of the big topics around syntropic is the complexity  
**0:19:22-0:19:23:**  of it.  
**0:19:23-0:19:25:**  And I wanted to get back to that soon.  
**0:19:25-0:19:30:**  But before we go into all these like very juicy topics which are, I'd love to maybe  
**0:19:30-0:19:34:**  set a bit more context about your system first, so people can understand it a bit better.  
**0:19:34-0:19:41:**  But to finish off this last conversation we were having, you see the factors that make  
**0:19:41-0:19:50:**  that that creates a input independence system is just the species density and high diversity.  
**0:19:50-0:19:54:**  Or is it also the fact that these systems you have to manage them more with more pruning,  
**0:19:54-0:19:56:**  more organic matter cycling?  
**0:19:56-0:20:01:**  You know, what are the factors that create, that make the system so, I mean, independent  
**0:20:01-0:20:02:**  from inputs?  
**0:20:02-0:20:05:**  No, it's the, it's the whole design of the system, right?  
**0:20:05-0:20:07:**  It's so it's the diversity, right?  
**0:20:07-0:20:09:**  The root diversity.  
**0:20:09-0:20:15:**  So we, because we haven't even started to talk about it and that's what makes it so,  
**0:20:15-0:20:16:**  so complex too.  
**0:20:16-0:20:20:**  For us nowadays, it's all about the soil biology, right?  
**0:20:20-0:20:28:**  And so for like a good soil biology that can sustain the plants, you need like diverse  
**0:20:28-0:20:34:**  root systems, right, diverse species.  
**0:20:34-0:20:43:**  And of course in the syntropic system, we also always need to work with the completely  
**0:20:43-0:20:44:**  covered soil, right?  
**0:20:44-0:20:48:**  Because the tropical heat at the sun, it's like really strong.  
**0:20:48-0:20:56:**  And if you have like the uncovered soil, I don't know, so biology just won't get better,  
**0:20:56-0:20:57:**  right?  
**0:20:57-0:21:02:**  So, and in the syntropic system, we, yeah, as you said, we start, we work with a lot  
**0:21:02-0:21:12:**  of pruning, like in order to manipulate the shade of the system too, or the sun intensity,  
**0:21:12-0:21:19:**  that's especially important for the coffee, but also like to create a thick layer of organic  
**0:21:19-0:21:21:**  material on the ground, right?  
**0:21:21-0:21:26:**  That creates lots of humus.  
**0:21:26-0:21:36:**  And yeah, and also the, how do you say the, the composition of the, of the system by itself,  
**0:21:36-0:21:44:**  like in terms of stratification, like how, how do I organize my stratification?  
**0:21:44-0:21:51:**  So for example, coffee is a, a tree species that needs a lot of shade in certain times  
**0:21:51-0:21:52:**  of the year.  
**0:21:52-0:21:57:**  And so I need to organize various plant species that are above my coffee.  
**0:21:57-0:22:04:**  So the, the various layers of the forest system, so a tall layer, then I need some emergent  
**0:22:04-0:22:06:**  layers.  
**0:22:06-0:22:10:**  And so that's, yeah, that's a complex task.  
**0:22:10-0:22:17:**  So maybe we can then go into describing a bit, the, the, I mean, you've told us that  
**0:22:17-0:22:22:**  your, your main product is going to be coffee, but I mean, I'm expecting, I mean, I can't  
**0:22:22-0:22:26:**  expect that you have other products that you'll be generating as well based on the diversity  
**0:22:26-0:22:27:**  that you implemented.  
**0:22:27-0:22:32:**  So when we're looking at now, let's look at the scale systems that you're planting on  
**0:22:32-0:22:37:**  so far 28 hectares, if understood well, maybe tell us a bit about what products in total  
**0:22:37-0:22:40:**  are you expecting to get out of that plot?  
**0:22:40-0:22:44:**  And we had to learn this, like for the large scale, we really are only focused on coffee.  
**0:22:44-0:22:51:**  So the other, the other stuff, they are only like sub-products, you know, for example,  
**0:22:51-0:23:00:**  my, my tall, tall forest layer, I, for example, I planted lots of, um, mango trees, avocado  
**0:23:00-0:23:07:**  trees, but I'm not thinking about the fruits, like per se, I'm thinking about the, the organic  
**0:23:07-0:23:15:**  material that the trees will generate me in, in the longterm, you know, so, but still,  
**0:23:15-0:23:23:**  yeah, we, for example, nowadays we have like tons and tons of bananas that, uh, that are  
**0:23:23-0:23:24:**  producing.  
**0:23:24-0:23:30:**  And yes, I say the mangoes avocados, uh, are you selling those bananas or are you just  
**0:23:30-0:23:31:**  keeping them for internal?  
**0:23:31-0:23:34:**  I mean, on 28 hectares, I just imagine it's quite a lot.  
**0:23:34-0:23:35:**  Yeah.  
**0:23:35-0:23:43:**  We are commercializing them and yeah, using for, uh, we are using them for, for feeding,  
**0:23:43-0:23:51:**  for example, the chickens too, or we are trying to sell them and it's, that's like the next  
**0:23:51-0:23:58:**  big task in our commercialization because, uh, it's a really, really interesting story  
**0:23:58-0:24:04:**  too, because, uh, the bananas, they, they started producing like this year, like really  
**0:24:04-0:24:06:**  big amounts.  
**0:24:06-0:24:11:**  And so we are trying to sell them in the, in the close by city Rio Verde is like one  
**0:24:11-0:24:19:**  hour away and for, and for like, for this to compensate, we need, like, we need to be  
**0:24:19-0:24:26:**  selling like big amounts of bananas, you know, because of the transport costs and everything.  
**0:24:26-0:24:33:**  And so, but because our bananas, they are like growing in the shade and they get like  
**0:24:33-0:24:34:**  really, how do you say it?  
**0:24:34-0:24:40:**  They get like a thick skin and they grow like really big, you know, our bananas are huge  
**0:24:40-0:24:44:**  compared to the supermarket bananas.  
**0:24:44-0:24:49:**  And so we started talking to local distributors and showing our banana say, Oh, it's organic  
**0:24:49-0:24:50:**  bananas.  
**0:24:50-0:24:56:**  We, but we, we are willing to sell them, uh, for a conventional banana price.  
**0:24:56-0:25:03:**  And they say, no, we can't take your bananas because they are too big and too strange.  
**0:25:03-0:25:10:**  And like people will get, they won't, they won't know what to do in the supermarket because  
**0:25:10-0:25:15:**  they're not used to these types of bananas, you know?  
**0:25:15-0:25:21:**  And so now we are talking to some, uh, some government guys there that, uh, that organize,  
**0:25:21-0:25:28:**  how do you say the, uh, the meals and local schools, you know?  
**0:25:28-0:25:34:**  And so now we are trying to sell the bananas directly to the government, you know, maybe  
**0:25:34-0:25:40:**  that will be an a way, but it's really, I don't know.  
**0:25:40-0:25:46:**  It's really, you think about it, it's really, it makes no sense, you know, ah, the optics  
**0:25:46-0:25:48:**  of your banana is different.  
**0:25:48-0:25:50:**  It's it looks, it looks healthier.  
**0:25:50-0:25:56:**  It looks better, but, uh, we can't, we can't buy it because it's out of the, you know,  
**0:25:56-0:26:01:**  the standard we have, you know, so now we are looking, I don't know, we are looking  
**0:26:01-0:26:03:**  on for some other strategies.  
**0:26:03-0:26:11:**  So it would be, for example, an idea to, how do you say, to, to raise some, some pigs to  
**0:26:11-0:26:16:**  like, how do you say organic pigs and then feed the bananas to them or invest more into  
**0:26:16-0:26:21:**  chicken, you know, they eat bananas too.  
**0:26:21-0:26:25:**  But in the end, I only planted the bananas because of the organic matter.  
**0:26:25-0:26:32:**  I wasn't at the beginning thinking about, ah, I need to say, ah, sell this banana, you  
**0:26:32-0:26:33:**  know, it's just a bonus.  
**0:26:33-0:26:37:**  So I can really, I'm really relaxed about it.  
**0:26:37-0:26:43:**  It's not like, ah, oh no, I'm gonna go bankrupt if I don't, don't sell these bananas, you  
**0:26:43-0:26:45:**  know, it's just a bonus.  
**0:26:45-0:26:51:**  And what I am interested in is the, is the organic matter from the, from the tree, you  
**0:26:51-0:26:52:**  know,  
**0:26:52-0:26:58:**  I wanted to know as well about the, the timber products that you've, you've planted.  
**0:26:58-0:27:03:**  Um, I thought I saw on Instagram that you were planting some trees and managing them  
**0:27:03-0:27:07:**  for, for, for timber as well above the coffee.  
**0:27:07-0:27:17:**  So we are, how do you say, we are, we are planting, um, on Instagram, you probably see  
**0:27:17-0:27:19:**  that we are planting lots of eucalyptus.  
**0:27:19-0:27:26:**  And, but the eucalyptus for example, is, is only also for organic matter.  
**0:27:26-0:27:35:**  So the eucalyptus, I have to say to like, as Mark said in the, in the other podcast,  
**0:27:35-0:27:40:**  syntropic agroforestry is all also a successional system, right?  
**0:27:40-0:27:46:**  So we, we planning to have some, uh, some type of species succession.  
**0:27:46-0:27:53:**  So in these timber species, like eucalyptus is the first one in the succession.  
**0:27:53-0:28:00:**  So we planned like really lots of eucalyptus and like, uh, in three or four years, I guess  
**0:28:00-0:28:02:**  we won't have any eucalyptus anymore.  
**0:28:02-0:28:09:**  They will be all chipped and go to the, to the ground, to the soil.  
**0:28:09-0:28:18:**  And then for the actual timber production, we planted, uh, Australian red cedar and African  
**0:28:18-0:28:21:**  mahogany.  
**0:28:21-0:28:25:**  But they are only like the phase two in the succession.  
**0:28:25-0:28:32:**  Then we also planted like lots of native species, which we, uh, planted directly by seed or  
**0:28:32-0:28:39:**  I still, I'm still completing the system, like, uh, with some really slow growing timber  
**0:28:39-0:28:46:**  species that need like, uh, 50, 60 years, you know, like all native species.  
**0:28:46-0:28:47:**  Very interesting.  
**0:28:47-0:28:52:**  And the objective here as well is to get one to create the dynamics of the system and get  
**0:28:52-0:28:55:**  the succession growing and get the diversity in there.  
**0:28:55-0:28:59:**  But at the same time, you're hoping to get some wood out of that, right?  
**0:28:59-0:29:01:**  I'm hoping to get some wood out of that.  
**0:29:01-0:29:08:**  Um, but, uh, especially, but nowadays I'm only thinking about the, for example, about  
**0:29:08-0:29:11:**  the African mahogany and Australian red cedar.  
**0:29:11-0:29:20:**  Like I don't know if, if there's like a 50 year old, uh, uh, Jatoba tree.  
**0:29:20-0:29:23:**  That's like a really, really expensive wood here.  
**0:29:23-0:29:28:**  If I would be able to cut it down because I don't know, like 50 years from now, and  
**0:29:28-0:29:36:**  you have like this beautiful tree, I'm, I'm also not considering it in the economic calculations,  
**0:29:36-0:29:37:**  right?  
**0:29:37-0:29:42:**  So in the economic calculations, and I mean, we love talking about economics on the podcast.  
**0:29:42-0:29:46:**  So I like that you're bringing this, this word up so often, you know, you're, you're  
**0:29:46-0:29:52:**  just looking at, you're, you're, you're, you're basing your business plan on coffee.  
**0:29:52-0:29:57:**  And then everything that happens beyond that is to be able to be dependent on, uh, independent  
**0:29:57-0:30:02:**  of inputs, to be able to activate your soil, to be able to create those successional dynamics  
**0:30:02-0:30:04:**  that create that make the coffee thrive.  
**0:30:04-0:30:05:**  Is that correct?  
**0:30:05-0:30:08:**  If I can summarize it a bit in a schematic.  
**0:30:08-0:30:09:**  Only it's only based on coffee.  
**0:30:09-0:30:16:**  I'm working, I'm working only for the coffee and trying to get the best atmosphere for  
**0:30:16-0:30:21:**  my coffee plant without any, without any inputs.  
**0:30:21-0:30:26:**  So how many of these other species, excluding the seeds that you're planting of the native  
**0:30:26-0:30:31:**  plants, just looking at the ones you mentioned, eucalyptus, the cedars, the mangoes, the ocada,  
**0:30:31-0:30:35:**  bananas, how many of these of these support species you have per coffee plant in a way  
**0:30:35-0:30:40:**  I'd love to understand, like kind of like what's the, what's kind of the, the, the,  
**0:30:40-0:30:45:**  the density, um, um, proportions between your main cash crop and the, and the others, because  
**0:30:45-0:30:49:**  some people may think, and there are some agroforestry systems where, you know, you  
**0:30:49-0:30:55:**  have coffee, but then there's a support species planted on the edges for, um, for, for wind  
**0:30:55-0:30:59:**  breaks or there's a few species dotted around the landscape, which would also be considered  
**0:30:59-0:31:01:**  agroforestry more conventionally.  
**0:31:01-0:31:06:**  So how does, you know, how does, maybe you can tell us a bit about how syntropic differs  
**0:31:06-0:31:09:**  from that and give us a few more details.  
**0:31:09-0:31:19:**  Ah, so like in terms of trees, like only for, if we consider the, yeah, got to go in, go  
**0:31:19-0:31:22:**  into a little bit into the design.  
**0:31:22-0:31:25:**  So if you have like a coffee, a coffee line, right?  
**0:31:25-0:31:29:**  So there are, for example, there are two types of, of, of rows we work with.  
**0:31:29-0:31:39:**  There are the coffee rows and the, let's call them service rows, tree rows, but in the coffee  
**0:31:39-0:31:40:**  row there are, there are trees too.  
**0:31:40-0:31:43:**  So, but there are, but there are not any coffee plants.  
**0:31:43-0:31:46:**  So it's really somehow confusing.  
**0:31:46-0:31:53:**  For example, only in the coffee row, I have like one support plant for every, for every  
**0:31:53-0:31:55:**  coffee plant.  
**0:31:55-0:32:02:**  So for example, I planned a coffee plant, like, like every 65 centimeters.  
**0:32:02-0:32:11:**  And like in the spaces between I planned cassava, I planned some beans and then I planned some,  
**0:32:11-0:32:13:**  some other tree that's called Guapuruvu.  
**0:32:13-0:32:20:**  That's only for shading and for, for organic matter too, like more upfront.  
**0:32:20-0:32:27:**  The only in this line, for example, I have a successional structure and I also have like,  
**0:32:27-0:32:32:**  how do you say, the succession and the stratification, right?  
**0:32:32-0:32:35:**  Because the coffee is my low level plant.  
**0:32:35-0:32:40:**  Then I have the cassava, which is like a really fast growing initial plant that creates really  
**0:32:40-0:32:43:**  good soil conditions.  
**0:32:43-0:32:46:**  And you don't harvest.  
**0:32:46-0:32:48:**  I could, but I don't.  
**0:32:48-0:32:49:**  I just prune it.  
**0:32:49-0:32:53:**  Like whenever the coffee needs more light, I just prune it.  
**0:32:53-0:32:57:**  Like for example, the coffee, it needs more light and dry season, right?  
**0:32:57-0:33:04:**  So in March I would go then prune all the cassava plants and then, and then for example,  
**0:33:04-0:33:10:**  every six coffee plants, I planned a Guapuruvu tree, which gets like a really, it's a really  
**0:33:10-0:33:17:**  big tree and it has like, you can compare it somehow to, to a palm tree.  
**0:33:17-0:33:22:**  It gets like, really diffuses the light, you know?  
**0:33:22-0:33:28:**  So there's still lots of light coming to the ground, but like really filtered in a really  
**0:33:28-0:33:33:**  cool way and really, in a really good way for the coffee plant.  
**0:33:33-0:33:39:**  And it also, this Guapuruvu tree is like the next step of succession because for example,  
**0:33:39-0:33:46:**  my cassava plants, they normally will only survive like for two or three years.  
**0:33:46-0:33:50:**  And so they won't be in the system anymore.  
**0:33:50-0:33:57:**  But then the Guapuruvu tree, it's gotten like really strong and gets like lots of material  
**0:33:57-0:34:01:**  and then lots of organic material.  
**0:34:01-0:34:13:**  And also, how do you say, gives like a complete closed rooftop of, of, of, how do you say,  
**0:34:13-0:34:16:**  of leaves that filters the sunlight, you know?  
**0:34:16-0:34:27:**  So only in this line I have, I have normally for one coffee plant, one support specimen,  
**0:34:27-0:34:28:**  right?  
**0:34:28-0:34:34:**  And then again, I have the, the pure tree lines where I have the eucalyptus, the mango,  
**0:34:34-0:34:37:**  the avocado.  
**0:34:37-0:34:43:**  But just to get an idea, I think, I made, I made this math yesterday.  
**0:34:43-0:34:52:**  I, for example, per hectare, I planned 2,600 coffee plants.  
**0:34:52-0:35:01:**  And in total, in total, I have 7,500 plants per hectare, including the coffee.  
**0:35:01-0:35:12:**  So it's, so it's a ratio like two to one for coffee, not for whichever very dense planted,  
**0:35:12-0:35:17:**  as you said, every 65 centimeters, not for a mango tree planted every four meters.  
**0:35:17-0:35:21:**  So it's, so there's more support species than there's twice coffee.  
**0:35:21-0:35:24:**  Very nice, very interesting, fascinating stuff.  
**0:35:24-0:35:31:**  And so, I mean, the next thing is to ask you, have you experienced coffee, health and vigor  
**0:35:31-0:35:37:**  and growth similar to the banana experience that you're having with very healthy bananas,  
**0:35:37-0:35:43:**  very big fruits, lots of them is, is the coffee responding as you would expect, or as you  
**0:35:43-0:35:51:**  would like from this kind of these conditions with low inputs to no inputs, shade, et cetera?  
**0:35:51-0:36:01:**  Yes, yes, I can say this, especially, especially in the last two years, we like saw, I don't  
**0:36:01-0:36:09:**  know, we saw like really good plant health, you know, and I can say this because coffee  
**0:36:09-0:36:16:**  is a really problematic plant like in our region, because it's in the dry season, it  
**0:36:16-0:36:23:**  gets like really, really dry and it doesn't rain for, for five months.  
**0:36:23-0:36:30:**  And there are lots of problems with the, with the so-called coffee leaf borer.  
**0:36:30-0:36:37:**  It's like, it's like a pest that goes in there and eats all the leaves and it causes like  
**0:36:37-0:36:42:**  huge how do you say, desfoliation, do you say it like, like this?  
**0:36:42-0:36:44:**  Yeah, exactly.  
**0:36:44-0:36:52:**  And it's really interesting because we also have how do you say we have a consultant that  
**0:36:52-0:36:57:**  helps us with the, with the coffee issues on the farm because coffee is like a really  
**0:36:57-0:37:02:**  new area for a really new area for us too.  
**0:37:02-0:37:09:**  And like he gives us some, some hints about the plant physiology and like how to deal  
**0:37:09-0:37:11:**  with the pests and diseases.  
**0:37:11-0:37:18:**  And we also always like to get like the conventional view on the plant, right?  
**0:37:18-0:37:23:**  And he just comes in and sees like all the, all these plants attacked by the coffee leaf  
**0:37:23-0:37:24:**  borer.  
**0:37:24-0:37:31:**  And he's, he would just say, man, if, if this, if you would have so much of this pest on  
**0:37:31-0:37:40:**  a conventional plot, there wouldn't be any leaves left on the, on the coffee plant.  
**0:37:40-0:37:46:**  But for some reason with all the shading and because all the environmental conditions,  
**0:37:46-0:37:48:**  our leaf, they won't drop.  
**0:37:48-0:37:55:**  So it doesn't cause any, any desfoliation on our plants.  
**0:37:55-0:37:56:**  That's fascinating.  
**0:37:56-0:37:57:**  That's really interesting.  
**0:37:57-0:38:00:**  And has the coffee started producing?  
**0:38:00-0:38:10:**  Yeah, this year actually we had the first little harvest and, but it wasn't a lot.  
**0:38:10-0:38:19:**  It's only like for experimenting and try to, because we have to learn about the drying  
**0:38:19-0:38:23:**  of the, of the coffee fruits too, and how to process the coffee.  
**0:38:23-0:38:31:**  So the little bit we, we harvested, we, we, we start, started training how to process  
**0:38:31-0:38:34:**  the coffee, right?  
**0:38:34-0:38:45:**  And two, two weeks ago we sent the first little sample to, how do you say, some, a roasting  
**0:38:45-0:38:47:**  company, right?  
**0:38:47-0:38:53:**  People that are really specialized in roasting, like for a speciality coffee.  
**0:38:53-0:38:57:**  And yeah, they said, wow, great quality.  
**0:38:57-0:39:03:**  They wouldn't expect this great of quality, like from the region where we are from, right?  
**0:39:03-0:39:04:**  Nice.  
**0:39:04-0:39:05:**  Well done.  
**0:39:05-0:39:06:**  Congrats.  
**0:39:06-0:39:07:**  That's really, that's really awesome.  
**0:39:07-0:39:09:**  That's really, really cool to hear.  
**0:39:09-0:39:12:**  And again, this is at now this coffee, how old is it?  
**0:39:12-0:39:13:**  Four years old?  
**0:39:13-0:39:16:**  No, no, the oldest plot.  
**0:39:16-0:39:19:**  The oldest coffee is two and a half years old.  
**0:39:19-0:39:20:**  Okay.  
**0:39:20-0:39:25:**  So you're still bringing in a bit of a fertilization and a bit of input at this stage, right?  
**0:39:25-0:39:28:**  You're still helping the system transition.  
**0:39:28-0:39:29:**  Yeah.  
**0:39:29-0:39:31:**  But still two and a half years.  
**0:39:31-0:39:34:**  But the whole system is older, right?  
**0:39:34-0:39:42:**  Because another strategy is that we, we plant the tree lines that haven't any coffee.  
**0:39:42-0:39:45:**  We plant them one year in advance.  
**0:39:45-0:39:47:**  Then we let the trees grow a little bit.  
**0:39:47-0:39:52:**  And then afterwards we enter with the, with the coffee lines because we discovered in  
**0:39:52-0:39:59:**  our first, in our first endeavors with the, with coffee planting, we planted all at the  
**0:39:59-0:40:04:**  same time and, and try to go low input.  
**0:40:04-0:40:05:**  And it just didn't work out.  
**0:40:05-0:40:07:**  Like coffee trees would die.  
**0:40:07-0:40:16:**  And so we decided our first, our first coffee plantation, we replanted it like a year afterwards.  
**0:40:16-0:40:18:**  So it didn't work out.  
**0:40:18-0:40:26:**  And it's really, it's really interesting to see like on the, how do you say on the, like  
**0:40:26-0:40:32:**  on the, on the borders of the, of the plot, sometimes you have some, some coffee plants  
**0:40:32-0:40:36:**  that don't get any shade, right.  
**0:40:36-0:40:43:**  And they get the same treatment, like from a same amount of compost, same amount of everything.  
**0:40:43-0:40:46:**  And yeah, they just don't like it.  
**0:40:46-0:40:53:**  They get like really sick and eventually don't produce.  
**0:40:53-0:41:00:**  So there's like really a direct, a direct dependence on the, on the conditions you provide  
**0:41:00-0:41:06:**  to the coffee and the amount of, of external inputs you have to use, right.  
**0:41:06-0:41:10:**  So more and more shade at the, at the right time.  
**0:41:10-0:41:18:**  And I'm curious, and of course it's a bit early to say so, but what is your, like your  
**0:41:18-0:41:25:**  best guess or what do you expect the yield at maturity of coffee to be as compared to  
**0:41:25-0:41:29:**  conventional plot, which is without shade, lots of inputs to keep the plants healthy,  
**0:41:29-0:41:31:**  to keep them running.  
**0:41:31-0:41:33:**  I'm convinced about quality differences.  
**0:41:33-0:41:37:**  We don't need to go into that in so much, but you know, just looking at quantity differences,  
**0:41:37-0:41:41:**  do you expect your coffee, your agroforestry coffee to produce as much?  
**0:41:41-0:41:43:**  I want to.  
**0:41:43-0:41:45:**  And your father-in-law as well.  
**0:41:45-0:41:55:**  Yeah, no, but seriously, I think the goal, the goal for us is to, to have the same quantity  
**0:41:55-0:41:56:**  of production.  
**0:41:56-0:42:04:**  Of course we have a, how do you say, a lower density in terms of coffee plants, right?  
**0:42:04-0:42:12:**  So in our, our preferred system, for example, we have a 66% of the, of the amounts of coffee  
**0:42:12-0:42:22:**  plants compared to conventional system because we always have one, one, a tree line.  
**0:42:22-0:42:29:**  So yeah, we want to, to even the, the conventional production in terms of production per coffee  
**0:42:29-0:42:30:**  plant.  
**0:42:30-0:42:31:**  Right.  
**0:42:31-0:42:36:**  And we also, I didn't tell anything about this.  
**0:42:36-0:42:46:**  We we have three types of systems too, so we have this one system I told you about,  
**0:42:46-0:42:52:**  like it has one, one tree line, two coffee lines, but we also planted a system where  
**0:42:52-0:42:58:**  there is one tree line, one coffee line, and we planted a system where there's three tree  
**0:42:58-0:43:03:**  lines and all three coffee lines and one, three, three lines.  
**0:43:03-0:43:09:**  And so we are, we are testing three different systems too, and it's really, it's really,  
**0:43:09-0:43:17:**  really interesting like how the dynamics change and yeah, how the, the coffee health changes  
**0:43:17-0:43:18:**  too.  
**0:43:18-0:43:27:**  If you, if you plant more service species for the, for the coffee plant, for example,  
**0:43:27-0:43:35:**  this one plot where we planted one tree line, one coffee line, we have this really extraordinary  
**0:43:35-0:43:39:**  amount of, of wood chips now.  
**0:43:39-0:43:47:**  So we have on the, on the tree line, no on the coffee line, we have this maybe let's  
**0:43:47-0:43:57:**  say 10 centimeter thick layer of mulch and it directly translates into the, into the,  
**0:43:57-0:44:02:**  into the health of the coffee plants and into the, to the production and to the size of  
**0:44:02-0:44:03:**  the fruit.  
**0:44:03-0:44:05:**  And it's really interesting.  
**0:44:05-0:44:11:**  Our goal is to find out, oh, what is more economically viable?  
**0:44:11-0:44:19:**  This one tree line, one coffee line, one tree line, two coffee lines and yeah, just time  
**0:44:19-0:44:21:**  will tell.  
**0:44:21-0:44:25:**  So I asked on Instagram and I saw that you shared it as well.  
**0:44:25-0:44:29:**  I asked people to tell us about what they wanted to ask you guys.  
**0:44:29-0:44:36:**  And we've got lots of responses and everybody, 95% of the responses that we got were to understand  
**0:44:36-0:44:41:**  the technicalities of, you know, how did you plant the system?  
**0:44:41-0:44:42:**  How do you manage the system?  
**0:44:42-0:44:47:**  It's crazy because people really are hungry for, and so are we with Etienne on the podcast,  
**0:44:47-0:44:52:**  are hungry for these technical details, you know, and how are we going to make it work?  
**0:44:52-0:44:56:**  Because people, they, they, they, they kind of, there's a, there's a certain understanding  
**0:44:56-0:45:02:**  now that agroecology works and, and is powerful and working with ecosystems and ecosystem  
**0:45:02-0:45:08:**  processes is, is important and we're seeing it on various different, you know, from coffee  
**0:45:08-0:45:11:**  to pasture and animals to, you know, row crops.  
**0:45:11-0:45:14:**  So the, what people want to know now is, you know, how does it work in practice?  
**0:45:14-0:45:19:**  So you've taken a syntropic system and you've planted it at scale and, and quite fast.  
**0:45:19-0:45:25:**  So maybe we can start going a bit into some of these details as to first question, how  
**0:45:25-0:45:29:**  the hell did you plant so many trees with such high density?  
**0:45:29-0:45:33:**  You know, we're talking about 7,500 plants per hectare in an efficient way.  
**0:45:33-0:45:36:**  What was your strategy?  
**0:45:36-0:45:37:**  What was like kind of the evolution?  
**0:45:37-0:45:41:**  What did you learn on planting so many trees and making it work?  
**0:45:41-0:45:48:**  So I think the most important part for, for this type of system to work without any, any  
**0:45:48-0:45:53:**  herbicides for example, you need lots of organic material at the beginning.  
**0:45:53-0:46:02:**  And so the first intuition was to plant a really high yielding grass species on the  
**0:46:02-0:46:04:**  whole plot.  
**0:46:04-0:46:16:**  So we planted Mombasa grass on the 50 hectares and let it like grow for, for the, for the  
**0:46:16-0:46:22:**  rainy season and then we're mowing it on the, during the dry season and then let it grow  
**0:46:22-0:46:27:**  again on the, on the beginning of the next rainy season.  
**0:46:27-0:46:37:**  And then we started to, yeah, to, to mark these different rows, you know, like with  
**0:46:37-0:46:45:**  the, with the distance of, we started the system with a row distance of four meters.  
**0:46:45-0:46:54:**  And so we were marking it with the GPS and a subsoiler, but we went in with a subsoiler  
**0:46:54-0:47:03:**  and then with, tried somehow on, on this, on this row to, to kill the Mombasa grass  
**0:47:03-0:47:08:**  with the, I think you call it a rotary tiller.  
**0:47:08-0:47:10:**  Is that right?  
**0:47:10-0:47:20:**  So you have this, this clean row of like 80 centimeters, it's like 80 centimeters wide.  
**0:47:20-0:47:31:**  And then, and these rows, we, we put in some, some limestone, some stone meal, some compost.  
**0:47:31-0:47:38:**  And then, and then afterwards the central part is we, we used, I think you called, I  
**0:47:38-0:47:42:**  even looked it up the, the word you call it.  
**0:47:42-0:47:46:**  It's like a mechanical dented rake.  
**0:47:46-0:47:48:**  Is it just a hay rake?  
**0:47:48-0:47:52:**  It's a rake hay and to, yeah, like a hay rake.  
**0:47:52-0:48:00:**  And so we, so, so we could cover all the, all the rows with the Mombasa grass.  
**0:48:00-0:48:05:**  And so we, we took care of the, of the, of the weeds, right.  
**0:48:05-0:48:09:**  And that was effective as a strategy for weeds that really kept the weed.  
**0:48:09-0:48:10:**  It's really effective.  
**0:48:10-0:48:18:**  If you have like a good, a good biomass at the beginning is the best thing you can do.  
**0:48:18-0:48:22:**  And so it keeps weeding to, to really a bare minimum.  
**0:48:22-0:48:28:**  And so you did that, you applied, you, you mulched with the Mombasa grass just after,  
**0:48:28-0:48:30:**  just after making the line.  
**0:48:30-0:48:35:**  So you, you, you pass the rotary tiller and you, and you soon afterwards you passed your  
**0:48:35-0:48:37:**  mulch, right.  
**0:48:37-0:48:42:**  And then, and then all the trees, for example, we started with the, with the tree lines and  
**0:48:42-0:48:45:**  then we started planting eucalyptus.  
**0:48:45-0:48:48:**  Eucalyptus was all planted manually.  
**0:48:48-0:48:50:**  So we would just, I don't know, how do you say it?  
**0:48:50-0:48:57:**  We would just put a stick in the soil, make like the, and then plant the plant the eucalyptus  
**0:48:57-0:48:58:**  tree.  
**0:48:58-0:48:59:**  I don't know how you call it there.  
**0:48:59-0:49:00:**  Like these little tubes, you know.  
**0:49:00-0:49:02:**  On forestry tubes.  
**0:49:02-0:49:04:**  Just pull out the eucalyptus, plant it.  
**0:49:04-0:49:12:**  And yeah, we would like, we would plant like, I think 5,000 trees a day with about six persons.  
**0:49:12-0:49:17:**  So it's a really quick operation.  
**0:49:17-0:49:25:**  And then for all the avocado, mango, we would plant seedlings, seeds.  
**0:49:25-0:49:31:**  And then for mahogany and Australian red cedar, we would plant them with these tubes too.  
**0:49:31-0:49:35:**  So it's really a quick operation.  
**0:49:35-0:49:40:**  And then for the coffee, the coffee is a little bit special.  
**0:49:40-0:49:47:**  So we would have the same technique where we have the rose, you know, and then for the  
**0:49:47-0:49:53:**  coffee we would call like specialized coffee planters from, you know, the region where  
**0:49:53-0:49:56:**  it is more common to plant coffee.  
**0:49:56-0:50:00:**  And they're just like insanely quick in planting coffee manually.  
**0:50:00-0:50:04:**  So they just want, there are these tubes too, right?  
**0:50:04-0:50:09:**  And they're just like three guys that take the tubes, plant that, that, that, and they  
**0:50:09-0:50:12:**  make it like in a really quick fashion.  
**0:50:12-0:50:21:**  I think the last plantation we did, they planted 30,000 of these coffee seedlings in one and  
**0:50:21-0:50:23:**  a half days for a person.  
**0:50:23-0:50:26:**  Okay, nice.  
**0:50:26-0:50:32:**  And so you've planted and the coffee as well, you had enough bombastic grass to get started  
**0:50:32-0:50:35:**  to not need to import any mulch material.  
**0:50:35-0:50:36:**  Is that correct?  
**0:50:36-0:50:41:**  But still sometimes, of course, there are some spots where there isn't enough.  
**0:50:41-0:50:50:**  And especially in the first year, weeding is one of the principal activities, you know,  
**0:50:50-0:50:53:**  there's lots of weeding going on all the time, especially during the rainy season.  
**0:50:53-0:50:57:**  And so how many people do you have working on the weeding, for example?  
**0:50:57-0:51:02:**  Do you have like a team of six people constantly working on the agroforestry?  
**0:51:02-0:51:07:**  When we started, I think it was, we started with four people, like during the planting,  
**0:51:07-0:51:10:**  we also have, sometimes we have seven.  
**0:51:10-0:51:16:**  And then during the dry season, we maybe have four people.  
**0:51:16-0:51:24:**  But now, nowadays we have a fixed amount of workers, five persons, sometimes six.  
**0:51:24-0:51:26:**  For 28 hectares.  
**0:51:26-0:51:29:**  Yeah, for the 28 hectares.  
**0:51:29-0:51:36:**  But yeah, and they are busy like year round, like with the, with weeding, with mulching.  
**0:51:36-0:51:38:**  Yeah.  
**0:51:38-0:51:42:**  And then, and then I have to say again, like when the system is implanted, then we have  
**0:51:42-0:51:44:**  the bombastic grass coming back, right?  
**0:51:44-0:51:50:**  And here in the rainy season, you can cut the bombastic grass six times.  
**0:51:50-0:51:53:**  So it goes like, it grows, it grows.  
**0:51:53-0:51:58:**  And then we have this other machine.  
**0:51:58-0:52:02:**  If the guys are interested and want to take a look at it, I think there are lots of videos  
**0:52:02-0:52:03:**  on Instagram.  
**0:52:03-0:52:04:**  Yes, and I've seen it.  
**0:52:04-0:52:08:**  It's a, it's a, it's a flail mower with side discharge.  
**0:52:08-0:52:11:**  Oh yeah, a flail mower you call it.  
**0:52:11-0:52:15:**  And it has, it has like a conveyor belt, you know, they're amazing.  
**0:52:15-0:52:17:**  And it just puts the bombastic grass.  
**0:52:17-0:52:29:**  And the really awesome thing about this machine is that you can put wood onto the, onto the,  
**0:52:29-0:52:36:**  onto the field too, like wood with a diameter of up to 15 centimeters.  
**0:52:36-0:52:42:**  And it will just chew the wood and spit it out on the side too.  
**0:52:42-0:52:45:**  So it really, this really, yeah.  
**0:52:45-0:52:48:**  How do you say?  
**0:52:48-0:52:54:**  It was really, it really helped to reduce the labor costs, right?  
**0:52:54-0:52:59:**  So for example, if we, we prune some, some of the trees and we have these little sticks,  
**0:52:59-0:53:04:**  we just throw it all on the, on the field and then the machine goes over it and it spits  
**0:53:04-0:53:07:**  it right out in little pieces.  
**0:53:07-0:53:09:**  It's really.  
**0:53:09-0:53:11:**  I'm kind of in love with that machine.  
**0:53:11-0:53:15:**  I've been following it for, well, since, you know, for six years now.  
**0:53:15-0:53:17:**  I've been looking at it and dreaming of using it.  
**0:53:17-0:53:22:**  Haven't had the opportunity to use it yet, but hopefully it will happen soon.  
**0:53:22-0:53:25:**  Going and shifting now to kind of the inputs that you used at the beginning, you mentioned  
**0:53:25-0:53:26:**  rock dust.  
**0:53:26-0:53:29:**  I always calculate for a meter, like meter of row, you know.  
**0:53:29-0:53:33:**  Do you have an idea of how much compost you find per hectare for the coffee?  
**0:53:33-0:53:43:**  So for example, for the coffee, I applied three kilos per meter of compost.  
**0:53:43-0:53:49:**  And then on the rock dust, for example, depending on the rock dust, it was like half a kilo.  
**0:53:49-0:53:55:**  So there's this one rock dust that has like lots of phosphorus.  
**0:53:55-0:53:57:**  The other one has more potassium.  
**0:53:57-0:53:58:**  Very nice.  
**0:53:58-0:54:00:**  And did you irrigate at all?  
**0:54:00-0:54:01:**  Yeah.  
**0:54:01-0:54:08:**  Actually we tried without irrigation and yeah, the coffee just died.  
**0:54:08-0:54:12:**  But it was also because of the, what I told you at the beginning, because there wasn't  
**0:54:12-0:54:15:**  any shade for the coffee.  
**0:54:15-0:54:22:**  But still we see in our region, even with like really old coffee trees, like in parentheses,  
**0:54:22-0:54:28:**  like six year old coffee trees, we planted at the beginning on our little plot.  
**0:54:28-0:54:36:**  If it's not like a really, really dense, dense agroforestry, it doesn't, for us, it doesn't  
**0:54:36-0:54:40:**  work five months without rain and really dry air.  
**0:54:40-0:54:43:**  It's almost impossible.  
**0:54:43-0:54:44:**  Interesting.  
**0:54:44-0:54:45:**  Yeah.  
**0:54:45-0:54:49:**  The coffee would establish under a canopy of a forest that's already gone through a  
**0:54:49-0:54:54:**  certain evolution in terms of soil, microclimates.  
**0:54:54-0:54:56:**  So that's interesting.  
**0:54:56-0:55:01:**  And so maybe now we can shift to how you manage the system nowadays.  
**0:55:01-0:55:09:**  And again, there's some phenomenal videos of your team working with, as you said, the  
**0:55:09-0:55:12:**  side discharge flail mower with a chipper as well.  
**0:55:12-0:55:17:**  So maybe you could tell us a bit about how you're managing at scale this quantity of  
**0:55:17-0:55:18:**  biomass.  
**0:55:18-0:55:22:**  You know, what's your, what's the strategy, what have you learned and you know, where  
**0:55:22-0:55:23:**  do you want to go with this?  
**0:55:23-0:55:25:**  Yeah, it's really a lot of work.  
**0:55:25-0:55:30:**  If you think about it and, but really have to get credit to the team because they're  
**0:55:30-0:55:37:**  really awesome and like doing all the work because it's, yeah, it's really an immense  
**0:55:37-0:55:38:**  amount of work.  
**0:55:38-0:55:46:**  But still the main strategy is like, there are lots of strategies because you, for example,  
**0:55:46-0:55:49:**  and especially the coffee, right?  
**0:55:49-0:55:54:**  If we look at the coffee again, the coffee at the beginning of the dry season, you need  
**0:55:54-0:55:57:**  to open up light, light for the coffee, right?  
**0:55:57-0:56:04:**  Because he needs more and more light in order to, in order to flower evenly and to get a  
**0:56:04-0:56:07:**  good amount of flowers and fruits.  
**0:56:07-0:56:15:**  So that fact is really interesting because if you, if you look at studies of shaded coffee  
**0:56:15-0:56:20:**  that come from universities, for example, ah, they planted coffee in shaded conditions,  
**0:56:20-0:56:22:**  shaded by African mahogany.  
**0:56:22-0:56:32:**  The result is always, ah, it doesn't produce, it produces only 10% of the normal amount.  
**0:56:32-0:56:33:**  But where's the error?  
**0:56:33-0:56:40:**  The error is they did not work with the dynamics of the shading, right?  
**0:56:40-0:56:45:**  So you have a time of the year where you need shade and a time of the year where you need  
**0:56:45-0:56:49:**  like almost 90% sunlight, right?  
**0:56:49-0:56:54:**  And so if you do that with coffee, it produces a really good.  
**0:56:54-0:56:58:**  So and if this time comes, ah, all the coffee needs light.  
**0:56:58-0:57:05:**  We go around in the coffee lines, we cut down all the cassava, all the guapuruvu trees,  
**0:57:05-0:57:13:**  and then we shred them and put the shredded material on the lines of the, of the coffee,  
**0:57:13-0:57:17:**  like to, to get the whole, the whole row covered.  
**0:57:17-0:57:23:**  And at the beginning of the system, we also worked with, um, how do you say, do you say  
**0:57:23-0:57:26:**  apical pruning of the eucalyptus?  
**0:57:26-0:57:28:**  Like cutting the tops off?  
**0:57:28-0:57:29:**  Yeah.  
**0:57:29-0:57:30:**  Makes sense.  
**0:57:30-0:57:34:**  So we, we would go around, cut the tops of the eucalyptus trees, um, and thinning the  
**0:57:34-0:57:37:**  eucalyptus trees too, because we plant them really densely.  
**0:57:37-0:57:45:**  So some we would cut at the top and some we would eliminate and then go around with the  
**0:57:45-0:57:51:**  wood chipper, ship the wood and where organic material is needed, we would, uh, we would  
**0:57:51-0:57:55:**  put it on, on the row.  
**0:57:55-0:58:04:**  And uh, nowadays, yeah, we see that this apical pruning, it's like, if we, if you think about  
**0:58:04-0:58:10:**  it at scale and you do it all manually, it's really lots, lots of work.  
**0:58:10-0:58:17:**  So in our new systems, we, we designed them to, to don't, to don't do this anymore.  
**0:58:17-0:58:24:**  So we planned a certain amount, for example, of eucalyptus trees, and then we make a plan  
**0:58:24-0:58:25:**  in advance.  
**0:58:25-0:58:28:**  So after two years, we will cut down this one.  
**0:58:28-0:58:30:**  After three years, we will cut down this one.  
**0:58:30-0:58:36:**  And then after four years, we won't have any eucalyptus anymore because then the African  
**0:58:36-0:58:45:**  mahogany, the cedar will be big, big enough to give like a canopy, a canopy layer to the  
**0:58:45-0:58:46:**  whole system.  
**0:58:46-0:58:48:**  So I don't need a eucalyptus anymore.  
**0:58:48-0:58:55:**  And those African mahogany and the Australian red cedar, I won't do any apical pruning.  
**0:58:55-0:59:01:**  I just want them to grow big and big, and they're planted in an amount per hectare that  
**0:59:01-0:59:04:**  they won't influence on the, on the coffee production.  
**0:59:04-0:59:08:**  Wow, that looks really smart, complex system.  
**0:59:08-0:59:10:**  And then comes the other part.  
**0:59:10-0:59:18:**  And then you have to make sure that the, the tall layer of the forest system develops really  
**0:59:18-0:59:24:**  good too, because from this point on, no, I don't have any eucalyptus anymore.  
**0:59:24-0:59:30:**  All my organic, the big, the big amount of my organic material comes from the tall layer  
**0:59:30-0:59:35:**  because I won't touch the canopy layer anymore, which was the eucalyptus, but now it doesn't  
**0:59:35-0:59:36:**  exist anymore.  
**0:59:36-0:59:42:**  So now my organic material comes from the mangoes, the avocados.  
**0:59:42-0:59:47:**  So you're, but you're, you're pruning them at a tight, you're pollarding them still.  
**0:59:47-0:59:49:**  When they are big enough, the mangoes and the avocados.  
**0:59:49-0:59:55:**  No, I could prune them in like two meters.  
**0:59:55-1:00:01:**  I don't need, need any, because you could, you could prune them even in half a meter  
**1:00:01-1:00:08:**  of height and they will just come back like really, really strongly and, and grow again.  
**1:00:08-1:00:15:**  And so, so the whole idea of the, of our new system designers to, to don't need any, how  
**1:00:15-1:00:24:**  do you say, ladders, any ladders that you, so you won't, won't have to go up on some  
**1:00:24-1:00:27:**  ladder on some platform, you know.  
**1:00:27-1:00:28:**  Okay.  
**1:00:28-1:00:35:**  So everything is kind of accessible for human height to be able to easily prune them intensely.  
**1:00:35-1:00:37:**  Okay.  
**1:00:37-1:00:41:**  And then you've, you're still going to have lots of biomass and organic matter, right?  
**1:00:41-1:00:46:**  So I've seen you've been using a chipper to process that organic matter.  
**1:00:46-1:00:47:**  Are you happy with that system?  
**1:00:47-1:00:54:**  Yeah, especially the wood chipper was the first, or first machine for the processing  
**1:00:54-1:00:55:**  of biomass.  
**1:00:55-1:01:01:**  But yeah, we, I'm always thinking it's, it's a really slow process, right?  
**1:01:01-1:01:06:**  If you cut down the eucalyptus, ah, you cut down, I don't know, 2000 trees and you have  
**1:01:06-1:01:07:**  to put them in the wood chipper.  
**1:01:07-1:01:11:**  And sometimes there's a problem with the wood chipper.  
**1:01:11-1:01:15:**  For a big system, I think it's not the future, you know?  
**1:01:15-1:01:21:**  I think maybe the future is the, a really robust flail mower.  
**1:01:21-1:01:26:**  So you throw everything on the ground and just go over it with the flail mower.  
**1:01:26-1:01:34:**  And I've seen some that they use in another coffee system that are really, really robust  
**1:01:34-1:01:40:**  and you just throw like a big chunk of wood on there and just, just goes through and,  
**1:01:40-1:01:43:**  bah, disappears, you know.  
**1:01:43-1:01:47:**  There's some machines called forestry mulchers.  
**1:01:47-1:01:48:**  Yeah.  
**1:01:48-1:01:49:**  They need a big tractor though.  
**1:01:49-1:01:54:**  They need a, quite a, I think, I think a minimum would be 90 horsepower, but I think I'm not  
**1:01:54-1:01:56:**  even sure that's enough.  
**1:01:56-1:01:59:**  And they have like a teeth system, which isn't with hammers.  
**1:01:59-1:02:03:**  It's with little teeth that gradually like eat into the wood.  
**1:02:03-1:02:07:**  And so it, you know, it doesn't require, it doesn't completely smash it up.  
**1:02:07-1:02:09:**  It really just like chips at it.  
**1:02:09-1:02:13:**  And they seem really interesting, but again, they're quite a big piece of equipment.  
**1:02:13-1:02:18:**  In terms of, I'm thinking in terms of compaction, passing it often, but, but how many times  
**1:02:18-1:02:21:**  did you pass in your lines with this type of material?  
**1:02:21-1:02:25:**  Yeah, it's really, that's really not what we want, right?  
**1:02:25-1:02:28:**  Because compaction is really an issue.  
**1:02:28-1:02:32:**  And another option is just cut down big chunks of wood, you know, and just leave them on  
**1:02:32-1:02:33:**  the rows.  
**1:02:33-1:02:35:**  That's another option that we do sometimes.  
**1:02:35-1:02:36:**  Just leave it there.  
**1:02:36-1:02:42:**  Just cut it with the chainsaw and leave it there because, ah, it will get decomposed  
**1:02:42-1:02:47:**  someday, you know, it just takes a lot, a lot of more time.  
**1:02:47-1:02:53:**  A two and a half years of coffee growth evolution.  
**1:02:53-1:02:57:**  Are you still weeding or is that completely, is that not, you don't do that anymore?  
**1:02:57-1:03:05:**  I'm still weeding, but it's a lot less, you know, it's just like some, sometimes it's  
**1:03:05-1:03:11:**  just normal that you have like, I don't know, some grass grows between some coffee plants  
**1:03:11-1:03:15:**  or something, but it's, it's reduced really to a, to a minimum.  
**1:03:15-1:03:22:**  Yeah, but there's, there's another dimension also that I want to talk about is the, the,  
**1:03:22-1:03:26:**  the pest, the pest and disease control, right?  
**1:03:26-1:03:32:**  Because it's, it's a transition system still, and it's not, it's not totally stable.  
**1:03:32-1:03:38:**  So at the beginning we have lots of problems with, how did I say the leaf borer, for example.  
**1:03:38-1:03:44:**  No, that's, yeah, that's probably the only problem.  
**1:03:44-1:03:49:**  And we, we still use some inputs that we produce on farm.  
**1:03:49-1:03:56:**  So we use lots of fungi that we produce on farm, and then we put them into a sprayer  
**1:03:56-1:03:59:**  and spray the spores.  
**1:03:59-1:04:06:**  And so the spores will stick to the, to the leaf borer and then they will just kill it.  
**1:04:06-1:04:08:**  So, but I think.  
**1:04:08-1:04:10:**  What fungi do you use?  
**1:04:10-1:04:18:**  We use bulbaria, the other one is called metarhizo.  
**1:04:18-1:04:23:**  I don't know how it is in English, but we use lots of fungi on the, on the farm that  
**1:04:23-1:04:28:**  we produce in our own lab here.  
**1:04:28-1:04:32:**  And we use them in the, in the conventional fields too.  
**1:04:32-1:04:33:**  Okay.  
**1:04:33-1:04:34:**  That's amazing.  
**1:04:34-1:04:40:**  And so how many times would you be intervening with a sprayer inside your centropic system?  
**1:04:40-1:04:47:**  Ah, in the new system you see, it gets attacked a lot more.  
**1:04:47-1:04:52:**  So at the beginning, the leaf borer, it only attacks like during the dry season.  
**1:04:52-1:04:59:**  And if we talk about like a five months dry season, we go, we spray it like three times.  
**1:04:59-1:05:04:**  But then our, in our oldest system, we only sprayed this year one time and we saw just  
**1:05:04-1:05:06:**  stabilized, you know.  
**1:05:06-1:05:09:**  And there we have, we have another component.  
**1:05:09-1:05:16:**  So now we adapted our, our composition of the tree species.  
**1:05:16-1:05:20:**  We plant, for example, more Inga trees.  
**1:05:20-1:05:24:**  And they have the, they have the property that they, when they flower, they attract  
**1:05:24-1:05:31:**  like these predator wasps and they also attack the leaf borer.  
**1:05:31-1:05:37:**  And so we found that out like two years ago and now we are including these tree species  
**1:05:37-1:05:41:**  like heavily in our, in our new plantations.  
**1:05:41-1:05:44:**  And it really, wow, it's really awesome.  
**1:05:44-1:05:46:**  It really makes, it really makes a big difference.  
**1:05:46-1:05:53:**  So the, of course, here the aim is to, to in the future to have a stable system.  
**1:05:53-1:05:58:**  And so we won't have to, to enter with the sprayer anymore.  
**1:05:58-1:05:59:**  Right.  
**1:05:59-1:06:01:**  Fascinating.  
**1:06:01-1:06:06:**  And so if you look at the work that you're doing on your turn a half old system, would  
**1:06:06-1:06:09:**  you say that most of the work is managing biomass?  
**1:06:09-1:06:15:**  Is that kind of like where most of your team is, is active or cause you're not, you're  
**1:06:15-1:06:17:**  harvesting a bit, but not yet a lot.  
**1:06:17-1:06:21:**  Just understand a bit like the proportion of work that you guys are engaging in.  
**1:06:21-1:06:28:**  Yeah, I would say half of the work, half of the work is managing biomass.  
**1:06:28-1:06:41:**  Then another, let's say a quarter of the work is managing weeds, manual weeding.  
**1:06:41-1:06:42:**  Right.  
**1:06:42-1:06:51:**  And then the other part, I just for example, yeah, harvesting banana harvesting, coffee  
**1:06:51-1:06:52:**  harvesting.  
**1:06:52-1:06:59:**  So, but the, yeah, as you said, the biomass managing is the principle, principle part  
**1:06:59-1:07:01:**  of the activity.  
**1:07:01-1:07:06:**  So I'm, I'm, I'm curious about the, the harvesting process and that you're expecting.  
**1:07:06-1:07:09:**  I mean, now that you've got smaller, smaller yields, they've just started, but when they  
**1:07:09-1:07:14:**  pick up and you start to have bigger quantities and they pick, excuse my ignorance in terms  
**1:07:14-1:07:18:**  of coffee production systems, can you mechanically harvest this?  
**1:07:18-1:07:25:**  Are you, will you be using mechanical harvesters for coffee or does everything go by hand?  
**1:07:25-1:07:37:**  So the system is designed for, to have the possibility to use a harvester, a coffee harvester.  
**1:07:37-1:07:42:**  But if you use a coffee harvester, you have to know, oh, okay, it's a heavy machine.  
**1:07:42-1:07:45:**  There will be compaction.  
**1:07:45-1:07:48:**  Branches of our loved coffee will break off.  
**1:07:48-1:07:56:**  So it's like really how do you say it's a rough method to manage the harvest.  
**1:07:56-1:08:05:**  So in the last years we have been thinking, is it worth it to use a coffee harvester?  
**1:08:05-1:08:14:**  And I think if we get the good compensation out of the coffee, if we get quality coffee,  
**1:08:14-1:08:20:**  bio organic coffee quality, good quality, I think we don't need the coffee harvester.  
**1:08:20-1:08:25:**  We would prefer to have the manual harvest because you get more quality out of it, you  
**1:08:25-1:08:28:**  know.  
**1:08:28-1:08:31:**  So yeah, tell me, sorry, finish off your thoughts.  
**1:08:31-1:08:39:**  And also less losses because normally if they use a coffee harvester, they are like, let's  
**1:08:39-1:08:45:**  say 20% of the coffee fruits, they will end up on the soil.  
**1:08:45-1:08:53:**  And so what they do in a conventional coffee farm, they will like really clean up the area  
**1:08:53-1:09:01:**  between the rows, like really, I don't know, like really get out all the weeds, get out  
**1:09:01-1:09:06:**  all the plants and there's nothing, nothing anymore.  
**1:09:06-1:09:13:**  So it's only bare soil and so the grains that get lost, they pass with another machine that's  
**1:09:13-1:09:23:**  like, how do you say, yeah, a sweeper will get sucked in by a vacuum and so it will suck  
**1:09:23-1:09:26:**  in the rest of the grains.  
**1:09:26-1:09:33:**  And this method, like you can hear, it's really aggressive because yeah, you have to get rid  
**1:09:33-1:09:40:**  of all the vegetation between the coffee lines and all the mulch theoretically, right?  
**1:09:40-1:09:47:**  So it would be for us a stupid thing to do, like during the year to invest in mulch and  
**1:09:47-1:09:55:**  then, ah, let's put the mulch away and then pass with the coffee harvester and then yeah,  
**1:09:55-1:09:57:**  get the rest from the grains from the ground.  
**1:09:57-1:10:05:**  So if you do it manually, there's no necessity because you won't have this much of a loss  
**1:10:05-1:10:09:**  in terms of coffee fruits.  
**1:10:09-1:10:10:**  That's very interesting.  
**1:10:10-1:10:15:**  So it's kind of this mechanical harvesting method is slightly incompatible with some  
**1:10:15-1:10:19:**  of your agroecological techniques.  
**1:10:19-1:10:23:**  You'd have to think about some serious changes to the system.  
**1:10:23-1:10:28:**  And also what I was thinking about is that all the support species that are pollarded  
**1:10:28-1:10:36:**  relatively high in the coffee lines, you'd have to have them really low and without any,  
**1:10:36-1:10:40:**  you know, they'd have to be like kind of sticks so that the coffee harvester could pass on  
**1:10:40-1:10:42:**  top of the coffee lines.  
**1:10:42-1:10:43:**  You see what I mean?  
**1:10:43-1:10:46:**  It would change the management of the support species.  
**1:10:46-1:10:50:**  It's interesting that you mentioned it because we have to do it anyway.  
**1:10:50-1:10:57:**  Like for example, in April, we will, I told you about the guapuruvu tree that looks like  
**1:10:57-1:10:58:**  a palm tree.  
**1:10:58-1:11:04:**  In order to get light, we cut it completely off so there will only be the stick left,  
**1:11:04-1:11:05:**  right?  
**1:11:05-1:11:11:**  And so it would be compatible for a coffee harvesting machine to pass over it.  
**1:11:11-1:11:18:**  So even with the manual harvesting, we will cut it off the same way, you know?  
**1:11:18-1:11:23:**  So for example, I cut it off in April and now we are in September.  
**1:11:23-1:11:31:**  Now the branches that are coming out of the guapuruvu tree, they already grew like one  
**1:11:31-1:11:33:**  meter.  
**1:11:33-1:11:41:**  And so in two more months, I think there will be this closed rooftop we talked about, you  
**1:11:41-1:11:42:**  know?  
**1:11:42-1:11:44:**  I'm going to pick your brains a bit more here.  
**1:11:44-1:11:54:**  What do you see as the main, let's say opportunities for mechanization beyond the mulcher, which  
**1:11:54-1:12:02:**  you mentioned, to be able to have these centropic systems work at scale more efficiently?  
**1:12:02-1:12:06:**  What kind of machines are you talking about with your teams or that you're hearing about  
**1:12:06-1:12:12:**  coming from the different centropic practitioners, consultants, experts in Brazil?  
**1:12:12-1:12:16:**  What are the next steps for mechanization of these systems?  
**1:12:16-1:12:25:**  Well, I think for us, what we feel right now, it's really only about the pruning, you know?  
**1:12:25-1:12:31:**  And the pruning, sometimes you have to, how do you say, you have to get rid of the side  
**1:12:31-1:12:33:**  branches of the eucalyptus.  
**1:12:33-1:12:38:**  So it would be nice to have like really a fast way to cut down the side branches because  
**1:12:38-1:12:48:**  we all do it manually with, how do you say, with the machete and some like tools, you  
**1:12:48-1:12:49:**  know?  
**1:12:49-1:12:50:**  So the guys really do it manually.  
**1:12:50-1:12:57:**  It would be really nice to have like a faster way to do it, like all the pruning activities.  
**1:12:57-1:13:02:**  And I think for our system especially, that's about it.  
**1:13:02-1:13:07:**  I really don't see, it's all about the biomass managing.  
**1:13:07-1:13:13:**  For the other parts, I don't see any special necessities.  
**1:13:13-1:13:18:**  Like for coffee harvesting, if you want to do it mechanically, we could do it.  
**1:13:18-1:13:23:**  And yeah, it's not really, I don't know.  
**1:13:23-1:13:26:**  For me, it's only the part of the biomass managing.  
**1:13:26-1:13:29:**  Okay, that's really interesting.  
**1:13:29-1:13:34:**  So I don't see it like lots of people talk about, ah, because we can't scale it up because  
**1:13:34-1:13:40:**  of, we don't have the machines or something.  
**1:13:40-1:13:43:**  For our system especially, I don't see it this way.  
**1:13:43-1:13:54:**  But if we talk about, I don't know, some other systems based on other crops, maybe it would  
**1:13:54-1:13:56:**  be different.  
**1:13:56-1:14:00:**  But in coffee, traditionally you use lots of manual labor.  
**1:14:00-1:14:01:**  Fascinating.  
**1:14:01-1:14:03:**  Very cool.  
**1:14:03-1:14:08:**  So we talked a lot about the more practical sides, etc.  
**1:14:08-1:14:16:**  I do have a few questions for you relating to, to start off with commercialization.  
**1:14:16-1:14:19:**  And you already brought this up five minutes before.  
**1:14:19-1:14:25:**  And I'm curious, when you're looking at your coffee, are you thinking of marking up the  
**1:14:25-1:14:30:**  price based on quality, based on the fact that it's a syntropic agroforestry coffee?  
**1:14:30-1:14:36:**  And you think you can, you know, how is your system going to influence the way that you're  
**1:14:36-1:14:41:**  going to commercialize it and also take into account that if you do manage to set a higher  
**1:14:41-1:14:46:**  price at a premium, you're probably going to be able to cut out the mechanized harvesting,  
**1:14:46-1:14:51:**  which is going to be able to meet your soil and regeneration objectives.  
**1:14:51-1:14:57:**  So what are you guys talking about internally when it comes to commercialization?  
**1:14:57-1:15:08:**  Internally, I guess, to get a good price out of coffee, I think it's all about quality,  
**1:15:08-1:15:09:**  you know?  
**1:15:09-1:15:17:**  And so without quality, I think even with the best story, syntropic agriculture, I think  
**1:15:17-1:15:22:**  if it's a bad coffee, you won't get a good price.  
**1:15:22-1:15:30:**  So it all depends, it really all depends on if the syntropic system gives me a good quality  
**1:15:30-1:15:34:**  fruit, coffee fruit.  
**1:15:34-1:15:35:**  And so that's one part.  
**1:15:35-1:15:41:**  And then, yeah, of course, we have an organic certificate.  
**1:15:41-1:15:51:**  In Brazil, normally, this gives you like a 20% price advantage, 20, 30%, it's not a lot.  
**1:15:51-1:15:59:**  But if we talk about like specialty coffee with a really good quality, we talk about  
**1:15:59-1:16:02:**  100% price advantage, right?  
**1:16:02-1:16:04:**  So double the price, triple the price.  
**1:16:04-1:16:09:**  There's no limit.  
**1:16:09-1:16:18:**  And that's why I told you like it was a really good news for us that on the last week, we  
**1:16:18-1:16:19:**  got this approval.  
**1:16:19-1:16:24:**  Ah, your coffee really is great, you know?  
**1:16:24-1:16:33:**  So it was like a really a key element because if they would have said, oh, no, your coffee,  
**1:16:33-1:16:37:**  it doesn't drink really well, it would be devastating, you know?  
**1:16:37-1:16:40:**  That's such good news.  
**1:16:40-1:16:44:**  And really, I said it before, but again, congrats, because it's really something special in and  
**1:16:44-1:16:48:**  what kind of markup as compared to conventional coffee?  
**1:16:48-1:16:52:**  What kind of markup can you expect when you have that quality?  
**1:16:52-1:16:59:**  Let's assume a markup, it's how, let's say, how much more will you be able to get paid  
**1:16:59-1:17:01:**  for per kilo?  
**1:17:01-1:17:07:**  Or are we talking about, you know, you said there's a markup at 20, 30% for organic, but  
**1:17:07-1:17:12:**  if you have some really high quality, decent coffee, can you expect 50%, 100% more?  
**1:17:12-1:17:18:**  You know, I want to try and understand the scale of how much flexibility it's going to  
**1:17:18-1:17:19:**  give you economically.  
**1:17:19-1:17:25:**  Yeah, I think you can easily, if you really have a good coffee, you can easily expect  
**1:17:25-1:17:33:**  the 50 to 100% markup, but then you have to consider that, of course, not all of your  
**1:17:33-1:17:42:**  production will be this good quality, because there's also always, like, how do you say,  
**1:17:42-1:17:48:**  inferior quality coffee, like all these, how do you say, my vocabulary.  
**1:17:48-1:17:56:**  So some of the coffee you harvested and it has some damage, you have to do really a separation  
**1:17:56-1:17:58:**  process.  
**1:17:58-1:18:05:**  So I would say, like, for specialty coffee, like, maybe only 60 to 50% of your production  
**1:18:05-1:18:11:**  qualifies, maybe, and then the rest will be conventional coffee.  
**1:18:11-1:18:12:**  No?  
**1:18:12-1:18:18:**  But if you have a really good coffee and a really good story behind it, because story  
**1:18:18-1:18:28:**  is also an important factor, right, especially when you talk to small scale, how do you say,  
**1:18:28-1:18:36:**  these cafeterias that have like a roasting operation, you know, it's really important  
**1:18:36-1:18:41:**  to have this, to have the story too, and the certificates, right.  
**1:18:41-1:18:47:**  And I think in terms of story, syndromic agriculture is really, like, people are looking exactly  
**1:18:47-1:19:00:**  for this, it has, it's the complete package for me, it's CO2 neutral, or at least CO2  
**1:19:00-1:19:07:**  neutral and it's organic and if it works out totally and part independent, it has everything.  
**1:19:07-1:19:08:**  Reforestation.  
**1:19:08-1:19:12:**  Yeah, it ticks a lot of boxes.  
**1:19:12-1:19:13:**  Yeah.  
**1:19:13-1:19:15:**  Very interesting.  
**1:19:15-1:19:22:**  And are you guys planning on having your own processing facility on site eventually when  
**1:19:22-1:19:27:**  the yield goes up or, and you know, being able to really integrate vertically there  
**1:19:27-1:19:29:**  with the coffee?  
**1:19:29-1:19:31:**  What do you mean by processing like roasting?  
**1:19:31-1:19:40:**  Yeah, I mean, having the whole cleaning, separating the skin from the pips and then, and you know,  
**1:19:40-1:19:45:**  the whole kind of transformation processing chain.  
**1:19:45-1:19:54:**  No, that's actually something we will have to do because, for example, if we harvest  
**1:19:54-1:20:01:**  our coffee, organic coffee, and then we ship it out to some, after we dried it, of course,  
**1:20:01-1:20:08:**  and then we ship it out to some processing facility and I don't know any nearby processing  
**1:20:08-1:20:15:**  facility that's certified organically, so we would lose the organic label.  
**1:20:15-1:20:22:**  So it's kind of mandatory for us to take the step.  
**1:20:22-1:20:28:**  So yeah, we will have to invest in it really.  
**1:20:28-1:20:38:**  And then, yeah, the principle idea is do the processing on farm and sell the green beans,  
**1:20:38-1:20:41:**  but I'm really interested to get into roasting too.  
**1:20:41-1:20:43:**  It's really interesting.  
**1:20:43-1:20:44:**  Nice.  
**1:20:44-1:20:45:**  That's awesome.  
**1:20:45-1:20:51:**  But then, for example, roasted coffee would only qualify to sell in Brazil, right, nationally  
**1:20:51-1:20:55:**  because of crazy, of crazy taxes.  
**1:20:55-1:21:06:**  If you want to export roasted coffee to Europe, oh, it's impossible because of import taxes.  
**1:21:06-1:21:11:**  I want to pick your brains on one last subject.  
**1:21:11-1:21:19:**  And I'm very curious as to, I mean, you're from Europe, you know the European context,  
**1:21:19-1:21:27:**  and I'm curious as to how you think a centropic system can scale.  
**1:21:27-1:21:34:**  So you're looking now at 28 hectares, you're going to be scaling up to 50, right, gradually.  
**1:21:34-1:21:37:**  So that's quite a large farm.  
**1:21:37-1:21:43:**  If we even just look at a tree crop farm, it's significant acreage.  
**1:21:43-1:21:50:**  And so do you think that these systems are applicable and would work in a European context?  
**1:21:50-1:21:55:**  And could you a bit like give us your thoughts on this because you're actively there, you're  
**1:21:55-1:22:00:**  managing it, you're managing your teams, you're right in the middle of it.  
**1:22:00-1:22:06:**  So really curious as to what you could share to our listeners on that front.  
**1:22:06-1:22:10:**  Wow, that's a big question.  
**1:22:10-1:22:18:**  First, I think if I would do it in Europe, maybe it would be really, I would need lots  
**1:22:18-1:22:24:**  of more strength because it would be, I don't know, not depressing, but plants are growing  
**1:22:24-1:22:28:**  so slow there if you compare to tropical agriculture.  
**1:22:28-1:22:36:**  Here it's so rewarding, you plant an eucalyptus tree and after one year, it's like eight meters.  
**1:22:36-1:22:39:**  I don't know how it would work there, it would be really slow.  
**1:22:39-1:22:49:**  And then as you said, still even with the best machines and all the stuff you need really  
**1:22:49-1:22:56:**  lots of manual labor and you need people there observing the system daily.  
**1:22:56-1:23:02:**  So you can design a proper system, right?  
**1:23:02-1:23:07:**  And I don't know how it would work in Europe.  
**1:23:07-1:23:09:**  Where do you get your knowledge from?  
**1:23:09-1:23:18:**  Because clearly this is a much more complex system than a traditional orchard and requires  
**1:23:18-1:23:22:**  another set of skills that we discussed in our previous interview with Mark.  
**1:23:22-1:23:28:**  A lot of observation, being very intimate with your system ultimately.  
**1:23:28-1:23:34:**  And so you've also started in 2013 without prior experience with centropic systems.  
**1:23:34-1:23:40:**  So in agricultural terms, it's relatively, well, very relatively young system.  
**1:23:40-1:23:47:**  You've also been doing it for four years in your context, you're pioneering in your region,  
**1:23:47-1:23:53:**  you're finding the solutions, you're kind of breaking through the ice for the other  
**1:23:53-1:23:54:**  people that come behind you.  
**1:23:54-1:23:57:**  So it's a really tough situation to be in.  
**1:23:57-1:24:01:**  And so where do you get your information, your knowledge?  
**1:24:01-1:24:03:**  How do you make it work?  
**1:24:03-1:24:10:**  As it works in your Instagram, which seems like it works.  
**1:24:10-1:24:17:**  The basic knowledge you get in agroforestry courses, like centropic agroforestry courses,  
**1:24:17-1:24:24:**  like the basic understanding of stratification succession, right?  
**1:24:24-1:24:31:**  And reading a little bit about species, but I think the two, the one most important thing  
**1:24:31-1:24:34:**  you said already, it's observation.  
**1:24:34-1:24:40:**  And what we see, especially in conventional agriculture and especially in Europe too,  
**1:24:40-1:24:43:**  like the trend is the opposite.  
**1:24:43-1:24:52:**  It's like nowadays the big companies are trying to sell these iPads where you can track your  
**1:24:52-1:24:56:**  tractors from the city and use drones.  
**1:24:56-1:25:03:**  So all the technology nowadays, it's developing to get the farmer away from the field, right?  
**1:25:03-1:25:08:**  And I think it's especially the wrong direction.  
**1:25:08-1:25:14:**  People have to get back to the fields, like feel the soil, observe.  
**1:25:14-1:25:23:**  An observation is like the principle, it's the most important thing you have to do in  
**1:25:23-1:25:24:**  a centropic system.  
**1:25:24-1:25:28:**  So if not, you will lose track and it just won't work.  
**1:25:28-1:25:38:**  And another big factor is you have to be good at coping with deception because at the beginning  
**1:25:38-1:25:44:**  you plan some stuff, you think this, you have these romantic thoughts about thriving forests  
**1:25:44-1:25:46:**  and stuff.  
**1:25:46-1:25:52:**  And in almost all the cases, at the beginning it won't work that way.  
**1:25:52-1:25:56:**  You will be totally disappointed and then you have to move on.  
**1:25:56-1:25:59:**  You have to be really dynamic.  
**1:25:59-1:26:01:**  Maybe I try this, try this, try this.  
**1:26:01-1:26:04:**  It's all about trying an error, I guess.  
**1:26:04-1:26:14:**  And really, because nowadays with the basic knowledge about some species you could use,  
**1:26:14-1:26:22:**  you just have to try and make errors and try to look also at local ecosystems, see what's  
**1:26:22-1:26:24:**  growing there.  
**1:26:24-1:26:30:**  Try some different species and stuff and always trying to improve the system.  
**1:26:30-1:26:38:**  And another big component we didn't talk about, like in our case, we have to say we are managing  
**1:26:38-1:26:42:**  a system for about trying for five years now.  
**1:26:42-1:26:46:**  Now we will harvest the first good results.  
**1:26:46-1:26:52:**  I think in the modern language you would say we have an angel investor.  
**1:26:52-1:27:01:**  So for example, the convention agriculture is paying for our project now because we didn't  
**1:27:01-1:27:09:**  have any returns yet and had some bad experience, some failures at the beginning.  
**1:27:09-1:27:13:**  So that's a really special situation we have.  
**1:27:13-1:27:19:**  So it would be really different if I would have taken a credit from a bank, for example,  
**1:27:19-1:27:23:**  and I have to repay it in five years.  
**1:27:23-1:27:29:**  I would act differently.  
**1:27:29-1:27:30:**  For sure.  
**1:27:30-1:27:34:**  But this is part of the work of pioneers, as we said, people that are developing solutions  
**1:27:34-1:27:36:**  in a local context.  
**1:27:36-1:27:40:**  The next people that want to start a centropic project, your neighbor that said, I'll rent  
**1:27:40-1:27:43:**  you the machines to take down your orchard.  
**1:27:43-1:27:45:**  Well maybe in a few years you'll see it works.  
**1:27:45-1:27:47:**  He'll be like, well, come and help me do this.  
**1:27:47-1:27:53:**  He's going to start on a completely different basis with a completely different set of,  
**1:27:53-1:28:00:**  let's say, yeah, with a different ability to make the right decisions.  
**1:28:00-1:28:06:**  I just wanted to take on, because you were asking at the beginning what people are saying  
**1:28:06-1:28:12:**  like, and I told you this example about the one guy who wanted to rip out our trees so  
**1:28:12-1:28:15:**  we could plant soybeans again, right?  
**1:28:15-1:28:23:**  And nowadays I have to say the agroforestry, it had like a spillover effect on our conventional  
**1:28:23-1:28:25:**  farm.  
**1:28:25-1:28:31:**  So we started working on the agroforestry and really concentrating on this agroforestry  
**1:28:31-1:28:32:**  system.  
**1:28:32-1:28:37:**  But then we really, because on the system we are only working part-time, like half a  
**1:28:37-1:28:41:**  day, the other half day we are working on the conventional farm.  
**1:28:41-1:28:47:**  And then it just makes no sense to do on the one side business as usual and on the other  
**1:28:47-1:28:51:**  side we have this perfect system.  
**1:28:51-1:29:00:**  And so we really rapidly try to make some changes in the conventional farm too.  
**1:29:00-1:29:06:**  And so nowadays, for example, we don't use any more chemical fertilizer, we don't use  
**1:29:06-1:29:16:**  any more fungicides, and we really have tremendous cost reduction on the conventional farm and  
**1:29:16-1:29:20:**  really amazing results.  
**1:29:20-1:29:26:**  And yeah, all because, yeah, it started with the agroforestry and then it spread like,  
**1:29:26-1:29:31:**  how do you say, a good virus, you know.  
**1:29:31-1:29:39:**  And so nowadays we are really working hard to get a really sustainable soybean production,  
**1:29:39-1:29:41:**  for example, and corn production.  
**1:29:41-1:29:48:**  So when we had talked before, you mentioned that you had quite a large reduction in input  
**1:29:48-1:29:55:**  costs without compromising yield in your, so this is something that needs to be repeated  
**1:29:55-1:30:03:**  to our audience because it's another example of the power of regenerative agriculture capable  
**1:30:03-1:30:09:**  when done correctly and in the form of a slow transition has some pretty spectacular results  
**1:30:09-1:30:14:**  for farmers, especially demonstrated in row crops.  
**1:30:14-1:30:16:**  Yeah.  
**1:30:16-1:30:23:**  So yeah, just to summarize, like I think it was, it's the fourth harvest now that we don't  
**1:30:23-1:30:30:**  use any more chemical fertilizer, so we, again, all credit to my father-in-law, we told him,  
**1:30:30-1:30:36:**  ah, we could change up the fertilization program, why don't we use compost, for example, like  
**1:30:36-1:30:45:**  chicken manure, rock dust, could we make a little test plot, like 30 hectares, and he  
**1:30:45-1:30:51:**  said, no, let's do it on the whole area first year.  
**1:30:51-1:30:58:**  So it's kind of crazy, and so the first year we just cut out all the chemical fertilizer  
**1:30:58-1:31:05:**  and changed to organic fertilization, and ah, you know what, let's not use fungicides  
**1:31:05-1:31:06:**  anymore.  
**1:31:06-1:31:16:**  Okay, we didn't use any fungicides anymore, but we had to substitute them with some, started  
**1:31:16-1:31:24:**  working with bacteria, started working with other fungi that we would apply on the fields  
**1:31:24-1:31:27:**  and surprising results.  
**1:31:27-1:31:37:**  We, like in the second harvest, we did our record production, right, of soybeans with  
**1:31:37-1:31:43:**  reducing the cost by 40%, the whole operation costs, and it was really amazing, and now  
**1:31:43-1:31:51:**  we're going into the fourth harvest with the same program and always trying to reduce more  
**1:31:51-1:31:58:**  and more of the chemical part, and it's working, it's really, and the last news we got, like  
**1:31:58-1:32:05:**  the guy that takes the soil analysis, he said, oh, your phosphorus tripled in the last two  
**1:32:05-1:32:10:**  years without applying any significant amount of phosphorus.  
**1:32:10-1:32:13:**  So how to explain that?  
**1:32:13-1:32:16:**  Phenomenal, this is a hopeful message.  
**1:32:16-1:32:20:**  It gives a lot of hope, you know, when you hear these stories, and this is without a  
**1:32:20-1:32:28:**  complete change in paradigm, but just massive improvements in practices, without yield reductions,  
**1:32:28-1:32:31:**  this is what's going to scale regenerative agriculture.  
**1:32:31-1:32:39:**  And that's awesome because in Brazil, really, lots of farmers are going into the same direction,  
**1:32:39-1:32:48:**  you know, using rock dust, compost, focusing on soil biology, focusing on, how do you say,  
**1:32:48-1:32:55:**  green cover, like mixtures of plants during the dry season to get the soil cover, to maintain  
**1:32:55-1:33:05:**  soil biology, and all like mainly because of the cost pressure, right, because fertilizers,  
**1:33:05-1:33:08:**  they got really expensive.  
**1:33:08-1:33:13:**  Everything got so expensive, and so these guys, they don't have any subsidies, right,  
**1:33:13-1:33:16:**  and so they have to find a way out.  
**1:33:16-1:33:24:**  And so many of these farmers, they go into that direction, the more regenerative approach,  
**1:33:24-1:33:33:**  not because society wants it, because they are forced to do it because of the cost pressure.  
**1:33:33-1:33:44:**  And at the same time, they go back, how do you say, they somehow go back to traditional  
**1:33:44-1:33:52:**  practices and like, learn to observe again, take the soil into the hand, observe with  
**1:33:52-1:33:53:**  a microscope and stuff.  
**1:33:53-1:34:01:**  And so it's really awesome to see what's happening here for many farmers.  
**1:34:01-1:34:02:**  That's amazing.  
**1:34:02-1:34:03:**  That's really cool.  
**1:34:03-1:34:06:**  That's a beautiful way to finish this interview.  
**1:34:06-1:34:10:**  That's your agroforestry adventure that you started and project that you started there  
**1:34:10-1:34:21:**  is kind of emanating and creating change throughout the 2,800 hectares that you guys are managing.  
**1:34:21-1:34:22:**  So that's really cool.  
**1:34:22-1:34:29:**  But Daniel, thank you so, so much for coming on and sharing your experience with us today.  
**1:34:29-1:34:34:**  An absolutely fascinating talk.  
**1:34:34-1:34:37:**  And I know that this is going to be a very practical talk and I know that this is going  
**1:34:37-1:34:40:**  to be very much appreciated by our listeners.  
**1:34:40-1:34:43:**  So thank you so much for taking the time.  
**1:34:43-1:34:44:**  Thank you too.  
**1:34:44-1:34:49:**  And sorry for my English sometimes, for my vocabulary.  
**1:34:49-1:34:52:**  But thank you very much for having me too.  
**1:34:52-1:34:53:**  It's been very good.  
**1:34:53-1:34:54:**  Awesome.

**1:34:55-1:34:56:**  All right.  
**1:34:56-1:34:57:**  And then we'll see you next time then.  
**1:34:57-1:35:02:**  So in three years down the line when you've got, Max, when your coffee has reached maturity,  
**1:35:02-1:35:28:**  we'll check in again and see what's up.

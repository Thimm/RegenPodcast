### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Fri, 25 Jun 2021 15:01:31)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:45:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:48:**  Hi everyone and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:50:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:50-0:00:54:**  Today I have the pleasure of sharing with you an interview with Fabien Balaguet from  
**0:00:54-0:00:57:**  the French Agroforestry Association.  
**0:00:57-0:01:01:**  We've been waiting for a while to get someone on the show to talk about agroforestry in  
**0:01:01-0:01:04:**  France because a lot of things are happening around here.  
**0:01:04-0:01:07:**  And I think Fabien is the perfect guest to do that.  
**0:01:07-0:01:12:**  His organization is leading the way in developing agroforestry practices in France.  
**0:01:12-0:01:17:**  They offer technical guidance to farmers, facilitate knowledge sharing and pretty much  
**0:01:17-0:01:21:**  do everything required to get projects off the ground.  
**0:01:21-0:01:25:**  Fabien has a great overview of some of the challenges and opportunities coming with developing  
**0:01:25-0:01:27:**  agroforestry in a European context.  
**0:01:27-0:01:31:**  And I was really impressed by his pragmatic and smart approach.  
**0:01:31-0:01:34:**  And I'm sure many of you will find it as interesting as I did.  
**0:01:34-0:01:35:**  Enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:35-0:01:37:**  Hello Fabien and welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:37-0:01:39:**  Hello, good afternoon.  
**0:01:39-0:01:41:**  Thanks for joining us today.  
**0:01:41-0:01:48:**  And let's start with a bit of an introduction on you and who are you and how did you get  
**0:01:48-0:01:49:**  into agroforestry?  
**0:01:49-0:01:52:**  Wow, that's a long story.  
**0:01:52-0:01:54:**  Broad question as usual.  
**0:01:54-0:01:59:**  Well, just to try and make it as concise as possible.  
**0:01:59-0:02:02:**  First of all, I'm an agronomist.  
**0:02:02-0:02:08:**  That's what I have been since I started to study that subject.  
**0:02:08-0:02:15:**  I'm passionate about agriculture and agronomy since really long time ago, since I was a  
**0:02:15-0:02:18:**  child actually.  
**0:02:18-0:02:27:**  And then I discovered agroforestry in my studies, quite early in my studies actually.  
**0:02:27-0:02:30:**  And then I specialized in agroforestry.  
**0:02:30-0:02:36:**  I did a master's at Bangor University in Wales.  
**0:02:36-0:02:43:**  And agroforestry has become my main job.  
**0:02:43-0:02:52:**  At first I worked in tropical countries in cooperation, as we say.  
**0:02:52-0:02:58:**  So in the Sahel, which means between Senegal and Ethiopia.  
**0:02:58-0:03:03:**  And I work initially a little bit with the World Agroforestry Center, which is based  
**0:03:03-0:03:10:**  in Kenya, but I was there in East Africa in different countries.  
**0:03:10-0:03:14:**  And then I started working with NGOs all across the Sahel.  
**0:03:14-0:03:22:**  Well, to me, Africa is a big handbook of the well-thought agronomy and agroecology from  
**0:03:22-0:03:24:**  soil to landscape.  
**0:03:24-0:03:30:**  Because of course, you talk about soil fertility, but you talk also about natural resource management  
**0:03:30-0:03:33:**  and of course climate change and how to manage all that.  
**0:03:33-0:03:38:**  It was a big, big learning moment in my career.  
**0:03:38-0:03:46:**  And then I came back to France and I wasn't really sure about what to do.  
**0:03:46-0:03:52:**  And then I came across some people who were already working at the French Agroforestry  
**0:03:52-0:03:56:**  Association and this is how I entered in the loop.  
**0:03:56-0:04:00:**  And now I'm directing the association nationally.  
**0:04:00-0:04:06:**  Could you give us a bit of an overview of what LAFAF does and what it looks like today  
**0:04:06-0:04:07:**  as a structure?  
**0:04:07-0:04:08:**  Yeah, of course.  
**0:04:08-0:04:17:**  So we work, our main job is what we call group facilitation.  
**0:04:17-0:04:25:**  So we work in different regions, in the different regions, trying to have a local development  
**0:04:25-0:04:28:**  approach to agroforestry.  
**0:04:28-0:04:34:**  So we gather, of course, pioneer farmers, but also technical experts.  
**0:04:34-0:04:45:**  And the idea is really to have, to identify and work with pilot farmers to make the best  
**0:04:45-0:04:52:**  practices spread over across more farms every day.  
**0:04:52-0:04:56:**  So this is our main job historically.  
**0:04:56-0:04:59:**  So we have one department of that.  
**0:04:59-0:05:03:**  And then the second department is about research and development.  
**0:05:03-0:05:09:**  We will work a lot more with applied research and with science.  
**0:05:09-0:05:14:**  The main thing is really to answer farmers' questions.  
**0:05:14-0:05:19:**  So yeah, it's very related.  
**0:05:19-0:05:25:**  And we have a lot of demand now on that kind of thing, because of course we know a lot,  
**0:05:25-0:05:29:**  but we still have a lot of questions, especially farmers.  
**0:05:29-0:05:34:**  So technical questions, real ones.  
**0:05:34-0:05:41:**  And then we work also about the economic aspects of all that.  
**0:05:41-0:05:49:**  So meaning all the market channels and how to add value to what farmers are doing.  
**0:05:49-0:05:58:**  Of course, on the economic side, but also on raising awareness among consumers.  
**0:05:58-0:06:00:**  So that's a third department.  
**0:06:00-0:06:05:**  And it's a bit newer, but it's growing also quite a lot.  
**0:06:05-0:06:15:**  And it makes us work with the agri-food actors and quite a lot of companies from that sector.  
**0:06:15-0:06:20:**  So it's quite exciting, actually.  
**0:06:20-0:06:27:**  And last but not least, we have an information and communication department, which is more  
**0:06:27-0:06:29:**  or less like in every organization.  
**0:06:29-0:06:34:**  So altogether, it's about 20 people, paid staff.  
**0:06:34-0:06:44:**  And then in terms of partner, all across the country, we have 120 local organizations that  
**0:06:44-0:06:53:**  we will work with every day, from the field expertise to teaching and training and also  
**0:06:53-0:06:56:**  a little bit of research, of course, as I said.  
**0:06:56-0:07:01:**  Well, I'm sure you're not too bored, quite a program.  
**0:07:01-0:07:02:**  No, yeah.  
**0:07:02-0:07:05:**  That's a busy life.  
**0:07:05-0:07:06:**  Yeah.  
**0:07:06-0:07:11:**  Well, it's a lot of really interesting things going on.  
**0:07:11-0:07:16:**  And maybe you could give us a few examples of some of the projects you're working on  
**0:07:16-0:07:21:**  at the moment, just to understand a bit what the face of agroforestry is in France at the  
**0:07:21-0:07:24:**  moment and your main projects.  
**0:07:24-0:07:33:**  Again, it's a broad question because we basically work on a lot of context and a lot of topics.  
**0:07:33-0:07:37:**  Agroforestry is a really broad thing, right?  
**0:07:37-0:07:46:**  So what I could say is that today in France, in every type of system, you have a dynamic  
**0:07:46-0:07:53:**  that goes towards agroecology and agroforestry, whatever you call it.  
**0:07:53-0:08:02:**  And I would specifically mention what happens in the vineyard sectors.  
**0:08:02-0:08:10:**  So basically trying to reshape the landscape to improve or to allow better management of  
**0:08:10-0:08:13:**  the vineyards.  
**0:08:13-0:08:19:**  That's a big dynamic nowadays due basically to climate change and all the problems that  
**0:08:19-0:08:25:**  we have in making wine in a changing climate.  
**0:08:25-0:08:30:**  We have a lot of drought with degraded soil as well, because that's among the most degraded  
**0:08:30-0:08:33:**  soil, of course.  
**0:08:33-0:08:41:**  So this is mainly in the regions where wine is produced in France.  
**0:08:41-0:08:48:**  There's quite a few of them, but we work even in the Champagne area.  
**0:08:48-0:08:50:**  So again, a lot of work and a lot of challenge.  
**0:08:50-0:09:00:**  And of course, we don't want to really fail with that.  
**0:09:00-0:09:07:**  So it's a big challenge and we try to do our best.  
**0:09:07-0:09:15:**  One thing that's really interesting is also to work in the livestock sector, which is  
**0:09:15-0:09:23:**  another sector with a lot of demands due basically also to climate change and the summer drought.  
**0:09:23-0:09:32:**  So basically how to improve the environment, the animal welfare, and also how to have more  
**0:09:32-0:09:39:**  forage in the dry season.  
**0:09:39-0:09:49:**  So agroforestry allows us to improve both the pasture management and also to have a,  
**0:09:49-0:09:59:**  I would say, complementary forage due to trees, forage trees or fodder trees as we call it.  
**0:09:59-0:10:03:**  So all that is also developing quite a lot.  
**0:10:03-0:10:12:**  But anyway, we work in direct relation with farmers every day and we just try to answer  
**0:10:12-0:10:15:**  what comes out.  
**0:10:15-0:10:20:**  And again, we have activities in a lot of contexts.  
**0:10:20-0:10:27:**  I should mention as well that France has a temperate context, but we also have overseas  
**0:10:27-0:10:34:**  territories in the tropics, especially in the Caribbean, for example.  
**0:10:34-0:10:39:**  And we now have an office as well on that side of the world.  
**0:10:39-0:10:45:**  And it's quite inspiring, of course, because it's tropical agroforestry, which is totally  
**0:10:45-0:10:55:**  different, but it's very useful to see what happens in a more dynamic context, of course.  
**0:10:55-0:11:00:**  Maybe using either the vineyard example or the livestock one, I don't know.  
**0:11:00-0:11:02:**  Could you tell us what it looks like then?  
**0:11:02-0:11:04:**  You were talking about working with farmers.  
**0:11:04-0:11:11:**  So you put up tests, you build experiments with them, and then they feed back some data  
**0:11:11-0:11:12:**  to you.  
**0:11:12-0:11:17:**  And how does that relationship work in terms of generating knowledge on agroforestry?  
**0:11:17-0:11:23:**  Yeah, that's a big question because, of course, agroforestry is something not new at all,  
**0:11:23-0:11:27:**  but that we are rediscovering every day on the field.  
**0:11:27-0:11:32:**  So there is no expert in agroforestry.  
**0:11:32-0:11:34:**  The expert is the group.  
**0:11:34-0:11:41:**  And the main part of our job is really to facilitate that every day and have groups  
**0:11:41-0:11:46:**  of practitioners working together.  
**0:11:46-0:11:52:**  We've been developing methods and tools to allow that every day.  
**0:11:52-0:11:57:**  And we basically want farmers to be able to have a collective brain and put all their  
**0:11:57-0:12:00:**  observations together.  
**0:12:00-0:12:11:**  And then we try to, of course, I would say, edit those data and summarize the main trends.  
**0:12:11-0:12:19:**  So for example, in the vineyard area, if I talk the example of the Champaign area again,  
**0:12:19-0:12:28:**  we have about 80 farmers or technical advisors as well working together every day.  
**0:12:28-0:12:37:**  And really, I would say, making observation and putting all that together, we have a digital  
**0:12:37-0:12:43:**  tool that works on the computer and also on a smartphone.  
**0:12:43-0:12:53:**  So we can share photos, we can share measurements, we can share ideas, et cetera, et cetera.  
**0:12:53-0:12:56:**  So it's very exciting.  
**0:12:56-0:13:06:**  There's something in France called the economic and ecological group, which are innovation  
**0:13:06-0:13:08:**  groups of farmers.  
**0:13:08-0:13:18:**  There's about 500 in the country now, and about 100 works on something that goes towards  
**0:13:18-0:13:20:**  agroforestry.  
**0:13:20-0:13:26:**  So we really rely very much on those local groups.  
**0:13:26-0:13:34:**  And there is a lot to gather every day, of course.  
**0:13:34-0:13:39:**  I want to go into this issue of knowledge because it's so important when we come to  
**0:13:39-0:13:44:**  agroforestry and any kind of complex system.  
**0:13:44-0:13:50:**  But before we do that, I wanted to finish a bit of our overview of agroforestry in France.  
**0:13:50-0:13:58:**  And you mentioned a strong demand from vineyards and livestock farmers because of the challenges  
**0:13:58-0:14:00:**  they face with climate change.  
**0:14:00-0:14:07:**  Would you say that these are the most technically advanced systems, though, or actually some  
**0:14:07-0:14:11:**  of the most developed and well-researched are maybe alley cropping?  
**0:14:11-0:14:21:**  Yeah, I would say they are the most urgent systems.  
**0:14:21-0:14:27:**  I'm not sure what kind of system is the most advanced because really we are late.  
**0:14:27-0:14:32:**  We are very late in every context, I think, nowadays.  
**0:14:32-0:14:35:**  But it's progressing very well, I should mention.  
**0:14:35-0:14:42:**  I mean, I'm not being pessimistic.  
**0:14:42-0:14:50:**  One of the systems that we've been working a lot as well is popular agroforestry.  
**0:14:50-0:14:57:**  So in a diversity of patterns, but you mentioned alley cropping.  
**0:14:57-0:15:06:**  I think alley cropping is a big opportunity as well in some contexts, especially in the  
**0:15:06-0:15:09:**  grain crops.  
**0:15:09-0:15:22:**  What I don't really believe in is the timber production as such over 80, 90 years.  
**0:15:22-0:15:32:**  On the contrary, we've been working with foresters on more pragmatic models with faster growing  
**0:15:32-0:15:37:**  species and popular being one of them.  
**0:15:37-0:15:45:**  And of course, what's interesting with this species is that there is a full industry dedicated  
**0:15:45-0:15:53:**  to popular and a very strong demand for the primary matter, I would say.  
**0:15:53-0:16:01:**  So as soon as you are able to produce quality popular, you will have a market after that.  
**0:16:01-0:16:05:**  And popular agroforestry is a traditional practice in many regions of France.  
**0:16:05-0:16:13:**  So we're trying also to rediscover that and make it a bit more pragmatic in terms of economic  
**0:16:13-0:16:17:**  model, etc.  
**0:16:17-0:16:23:**  So yeah, I wouldn't be able to say what was the best or the most advanced system.  
**0:16:23-0:16:26:**  I think in every context, you have some opportunities.  
**0:16:26-0:16:34:**  And then you want, of course, you want to decide what's in line with your objectives,  
**0:16:34-0:16:36:**  with the work you want to do as well.  
**0:16:36-0:16:45:**  Because as a farmer, if you plant popular, for example, it's a change in practice that  
**0:16:45-0:16:49:**  is very much important, right?  
**0:16:49-0:16:57:**  You need to learn how to prune the trees, how to manage the whole thing.  
**0:16:57-0:17:03:**  So yeah, it's really a farmer's decision.  
**0:17:03-0:17:08:**  And then of course, you want to know what's possible in every context, depending on the  
**0:17:08-0:17:12:**  soil and the climate.  
**0:17:12-0:17:18:**  This might take us down the rabbit hole a bit earlier on, but I can't resist asking,  
**0:17:18-0:17:23:**  why are you so skeptical about timber production on longer cycles?  
**0:17:23-0:17:31:**  Well, because I only believe in what I've seen.  
**0:17:31-0:17:37:**  And I've never seen that kind of system in a commercial context.  
**0:17:37-0:17:44:**  So on farms, that would be profitable in the end.  
**0:17:44-0:17:51:**  So a lot of research has been done on modeling all that on experimental sites, but I've never  
**0:17:51-0:17:55:**  seen this happen in commercial farms.  
**0:17:55-0:18:02:**  And rather what we have seen is the limitations that we are facing when we're trying to implement  
**0:18:02-0:18:06:**  that at bigger scales.  
**0:18:06-0:18:23:**  And on farms with farmers who don't really realize how long is the work behind that.  
**0:18:23-0:18:26:**  And I think it's quite uncertain anyway.  
**0:18:26-0:18:35:**  If you want to do timber, if your main objective is to grow trees for timber, just do forestry.  
**0:18:35-0:18:37:**  That's the main way of doing it.  
**0:18:37-0:18:44:**  It's the most efficient and very well advanced in this case.  
**0:18:44-0:18:50:**  So I think trees on farms can be for timber, but it's just the icing on the cake.  
**0:18:50-0:18:54:**  It shouldn't be the main objective.  
**0:18:54-0:19:02:**  Apart from the fast growing species that you can integrate more easily in farming systems,  
**0:19:02-0:19:10:**  of course, if you grow popular, it will be over a 20-year cycle, 15 to 20 years, depending  
**0:19:10-0:19:13:**  on the context.  
**0:19:13-0:19:18:**  And I think this is a bit more realistic already for a farmer.  
**0:19:18-0:19:23:**  What you say really hits home, because actually Dimitri recorded an interview with Rowan Reed  
**0:19:23-0:19:25:**  a few weeks ago.  
**0:19:25-0:19:29:**  And it was really interesting because he's really into producing timber.  
**0:19:29-0:19:34:**  And what I took out of the episode was how difficult it is if you're not going to process  
**0:19:34-0:19:38:**  yourself with all the infrastructure, a sawmill, and all these things.  
**0:19:38-0:19:47:**  It's actually really hard to enter the timber game and harvest wood in an economically profitable  
**0:19:47-0:19:52:**  way, because of questions of economy, of scale, because of the problems linked to if you're  
**0:19:52-0:19:56:**  planting diverse species, who's going to come and harvest two trees.  
**0:19:56-0:19:57:**  Yeah, but that's a big issue.  
**0:19:57-0:20:02:**  And I think we can probably elaborate a little bit on that.  
**0:20:02-0:20:05:**  I know Rowan very well.  
**0:20:05-0:20:10:**  And of course, first of all, he's a very talented practitioner.  
**0:20:10-0:20:16:**  He's a really good manager.  
**0:20:16-0:20:23:**  But also, he works in Australia, where you can grow timber in 30 years.  
**0:20:23-0:20:29:**  So this already becomes a bit more realistic in this context.  
**0:20:29-0:20:37:**  I think what's complicated is to grow timber trees on a very long period of time, with  
**0:20:37-0:20:43:**  a lot of uncertainty on the market, on the pests, on everything.  
**0:20:43-0:20:50:**  A lot of work also to prune those trees and to shape those trees to really have high quality  
**0:20:50-0:20:55:**  timber in the end.  
**0:20:55-0:21:00:**  So yeah, it's not the most, I think, pragmatic way of doing agroforestry.  
**0:21:00-0:21:05:**  I'm not saying we shouldn't do it, but there is a lot of things we can do before that.  
**0:21:05-0:21:13:**  In terms of management, and you talked about so meals, et cetera, et cetera.  
**0:21:13-0:21:21:**  What we have in France is cooperatives to reassure all the equipments and machineries  
**0:21:21-0:21:23:**  that we need.  
**0:21:23-0:21:27:**  So it becomes, it's not so much of an issue on that side.  
**0:21:27-0:21:35:**  Because if you get together with, at the regional scale, I would say, if you have enough farmers  
**0:21:35-0:21:44:**  going into that kind of things, it's quite easy actually to get organized.  
**0:21:44-0:21:48:**  And you're creating jobs, which is good as well.  
**0:21:48-0:21:53:**  Zooming back a bit to the bigger picture of what you do at L'Afafe, you mentioned the  
**0:21:53-0:21:55:**  tool you have for sharing knowledge.  
**0:21:55-0:21:58:**  And I really want to talk about this topic.  
**0:21:58-0:22:02:**  I think if I'm not wrong, it's called land files.  
**0:22:02-0:22:03:**  Yeah, exactly.  
**0:22:03-0:22:13:**  I'm a user, or a future active user, because I did a training on fodder trees.  
**0:22:13-0:22:16:**  And I thought it was great what you guys were doing, because to give a bit of context to  
**0:22:16-0:22:20:**  our listeners, it wasn't just a training.  
**0:22:20-0:22:26:**  It was then you had access to a platform to share knowledge, and also receiving emails  
**0:22:26-0:22:35:**  and doing webinars and moments of exchange for every person to actively become a source  
**0:22:35-0:22:36:**  of knowledge.  
**0:22:36-0:22:37:**  So congratulations for that.  
**0:22:37-0:22:38:**  It was great.  
**0:22:38-0:22:41:**  And maybe you want to tell us a bit more about that.  
**0:22:41-0:22:47:**  First of all, I should mention that it's a farmer's idea, as usual.  
**0:22:47-0:22:53:**  We've been working with farmers for almost 10 years now on a daily basis in different  
**0:22:53-0:22:55:**  regions.  
**0:22:55-0:23:00:**  And of course, we do what I call group facilitation.  
**0:23:00-0:23:08:**  So we have activities, technical days, trainings, as we said.  
**0:23:08-0:23:13:**  And the farmers are always very motivated and enthusiastic.  
**0:23:13-0:23:20:**  But during a long time, they mentioned that we should be able to exchange on a daily basis  
**0:23:20-0:23:24:**  in between the different meetings.  
**0:23:24-0:23:37:**  So first of all, we set up what we call WhatsApp groups, as everyone does, I think, these days.  
**0:23:37-0:23:44:**  And after a time, we realized that it was really a shame, because we're not gaining  
**0:23:44-0:23:45:**  any knowledge as such.  
**0:23:45-0:23:47:**  We're just exchanging.  
**0:23:47-0:23:50:**  But then we lose everything, right?  
**0:23:50-0:24:03:**  So landfises come as a solution to that, taking the basics of a social network, of course.  
**0:24:03-0:24:12:**  But with some functionalities that have been developed for agricultural development, and  
**0:24:12-0:24:13:**  specifically for that.  
**0:24:13-0:24:22:**  So basically, whatever happens is recorded, plot by plots and farms by farms.  
**0:24:22-0:24:30:**  And then we're able to go back in history and see what happens and really analyze some  
**0:24:30-0:24:33:**  concrete transitions.  
**0:24:33-0:24:39:**  And it's some kind of, I would say, big case studies in real life context.  
**0:24:39-0:24:43:**  So then you can also compare different contexts.  
**0:24:43-0:24:58:**  You can also have some participatory experiments, which is also something we're trying to encourage.  
**0:24:58-0:25:07:**  So as you mentioned, also, it's a big tool to do some follow up after technical days  
**0:25:07-0:25:13:**  and trainings, because, of course, training is also something very important.  
**0:25:13-0:25:17:**  But if you only consider it as, OK, I've done my training.  
**0:25:17-0:25:19:**  Now I'm good.  
**0:25:19-0:25:21:**  It's never going to change the world.  
**0:25:21-0:25:28:**  So what we wanted is to have a training as a, I would say, starting point.  
**0:25:28-0:25:34:**  And then after the training, you want those people to implement and keep creating the  
**0:25:34-0:25:39:**  knowledge and transferring the knowledge between each other.  
**0:25:39-0:25:43:**  So that's what LandFi allows us to do as well.  
**0:25:43-0:25:48:**  But do you have the manpower, because it's such a huge job to then extract from all this  
**0:25:48-0:25:54:**  data and this experience to actually extract conclusions and be able to see patterns?  
**0:25:54-0:25:58:**  Is that something that you're able to do today in your organization?  
**0:25:58-0:26:04:**  Or is it just a kind of peer to peer tool where farmers can gain what they can?  
**0:26:04-0:26:05:**  Yeah.  
**0:26:05-0:26:12:**  Initially, it was a peer to peer tool, which was already quite a good thing, I think.  
**0:26:12-0:26:21:**  And now we're trying to develop some projects with different partners from the R&D sectors.  
**0:26:21-0:26:31:**  And also the more, yeah, even fundamental research with data scientists, et cetera,  
**0:26:31-0:26:41:**  et cetera, to try and see what we can get from these big, big quantity of data, which  
**0:26:41-0:26:46:**  what's interesting is that each data is associated to a context.  
**0:26:46-0:26:52:**  Because of course, if you have data, if some farmer tells you that, look, I've tried this  
**0:26:52-0:26:58:**  and it works, if you don't know anything about the context, it's not an information.  
**0:26:58-0:26:59:**  It's not useful.  
**0:26:59-0:27:06:**  But as soon as you have the context and you have a lot of information in that pattern,  
**0:27:06-0:27:15:**  I would say, then you are able to see what's, it's not statistics.  
**0:27:15-0:27:23:**  It's about probability of when I do that, in most of the cases, I can get bad results.  
**0:27:23-0:27:29:**  And also you can really identify the condition for success.  
**0:27:29-0:27:38:**  So we assess both the successes and the failures, of course, because both are interesting.  
**0:27:38-0:27:43:**  But that story, it's only the start of a bigger story, of course.  
**0:27:43-0:27:51:**  And we need, as you mentioned, we are desperate about how much work we get every day with  
**0:27:51-0:27:55:**  all that and the different projects we are running.  
**0:27:55-0:27:58:**  But the team is growing slowly but surely.  
**0:27:58-0:28:05:**  And also we work in partnership with more and more people.  
**0:28:05-0:28:08:**  So it's promising, I think.  
**0:28:08-0:28:09:**  Wow.  
**0:28:09-0:28:15:**  And then how are you considering feeding back this information to farmers once you've identified  
**0:28:15-0:28:17:**  these patterns and these probabilities?  
**0:28:17-0:28:22:**  Well, you have different types of things.  
**0:28:22-0:28:30:**  You can work, if you work at the group level, like the training and then the follow up on  
**0:28:30-0:28:36:**  implementation, you are able to come back one or two years later with the same group  
**0:28:36-0:28:46:**  and see the, I would say, the new knowledge that has been developed, answer new questions  
**0:28:46-0:28:48:**  as well.  
**0:28:48-0:28:53:**  So it's like second level training.  
**0:28:53-0:28:57:**  That's one type of activities that we can do.  
**0:28:57-0:29:04:**  Second thing is that we can identify some case studies and really have the full story  
**0:29:04-0:29:10:**  across several years, even if we like.  
**0:29:10-0:29:19:**  So it's really important because what we noticed is that farmers don't necessarily need statistics  
**0:29:19-0:29:25:**  and very clear figures and very accurate stuff.  
**0:29:25-0:29:32:**  What they want is to have clear and concrete examples of other farmers doing things in  
**0:29:32-0:29:40:**  a similar context as the one they are working in.  
**0:29:40-0:29:48:**  So it's really about having a big quantity of data and then being able to give everyone  
**0:29:48-0:29:51:**  what he or she needs.  
**0:29:51-0:29:52:**  Yeah.  
**0:29:52-0:29:58:**  And with the land files, I think you've already answered part of the problem of the knowledge  
**0:29:58-0:30:01:**  gap and the amount of knowledge required.  
**0:30:01-0:30:07:**  But even if you have peer to peer information, agroforestry remains very knowledge intensive.  
**0:30:07-0:30:12:**  Let's say you're a farmer that has a certain type of production, integrating trees means  
**0:30:12-0:30:18:**  that you also need to integrate new types of expertise, like working with the tree,  
**0:30:18-0:30:22:**  pruning it, planting it, protecting it.  
**0:30:22-0:30:29:**  How do you think we can overcome this barrier of how much knowledge is required and that  
**0:30:29-0:30:31:**  can be a problem for farmers?  
**0:30:31-0:30:36:**  Well, I think it's just what we call agriculture.  
**0:30:36-0:30:42:**  It's about observation and adaptation every day, especially now in a context of climate  
**0:30:42-0:30:48:**  change and so much challenges that we're facing, of course.  
**0:30:48-0:30:56:**  But I think the only way of doing that is, and the new way of overcoming those issues  
**0:30:56-0:31:03:**  is really to get together and being able to work as a team.  
**0:31:03-0:31:09:**  And the main problem that we see now in the countryside is that you have less and less  
**0:31:09-0:31:11:**  farmers.  
**0:31:11-0:31:19:**  In France, for example, you have 500,000 farmers, which is about 1% of the population.  
**0:31:19-0:31:26:**  And this 1% is managing almost 55% of the country.  
**0:31:26-0:31:33:**  So you have a lot of spreading of people, which means a lot of spreading of the knowledge  
**0:31:33-0:31:35:**  and the brainpower.  
**0:31:35-0:31:38:**  So you have a lot of challenges to tackle.  
**0:31:38-0:31:44:**  The whole society expects the farmers to solve everything from climate change to food quality,  
**0:31:44-0:31:49:**  to sustainable water management, et cetera, et cetera.  
**0:31:49-0:31:57:**  And you have very few people to do that and no tool to allow them to work together.  
**0:31:57-0:31:59:**  So that's the main issue.  
**0:31:59-0:32:00:**  And we are in the 21st century.  
**0:32:00-0:32:01:**  Come on.  
**0:32:01-0:32:04:**  We can overcome that.  
**0:32:04-0:32:11:**  It's just about methods and tools and really being willing to achieve that.  
**0:32:11-0:32:19:**  And once we have everything, really, I don't think it's such a big issue to, of course,  
**0:32:19-0:32:23:**  we need 10 to 15 years probably to do the transition.  
**0:32:23-0:32:26:**  But it can go a lot faster than before.  
**0:32:26-0:32:35:**  Because before what used to happen is that you were being taught by your dad, who were  
**0:32:35-0:32:39:**  taught by your granddad, et cetera, et cetera.  
**0:32:39-0:32:43:**  So generation after generation, you were able to gain knowledge.  
**0:32:43-0:32:51:**  But you needed probably 10, 12 generations to really master your context.  
**0:32:51-0:32:58:**  And if you change farmers from one region to another, they would get lost.  
**0:32:58-0:33:07:**  So right now, we have to go faster in reinventing the way we are farming.  
**0:33:07-0:33:14:**  And I think we can do that with all the technologies that we have nowadays and the ability to really  
**0:33:14-0:33:22:**  cross all the observations and feedbacks and experiences.  
**0:33:22-0:33:26:**  So to me, it's more of a social problem than a technical one.  
**0:33:26-0:33:29:**  I'm feeling inspired now.  
**0:33:29-0:33:31:**  Let's do it.  
**0:33:31-0:33:37:**  Would you say today that the different agroforestry systems you're working with have an established  
**0:33:37-0:33:39:**  economic model?  
**0:33:39-0:33:44:**  Or is it a challenge to find the place of the tree in the farm economy?  
**0:33:44-0:33:49:**  Well, in France, I would say no.  
**0:33:49-0:33:52:**  It's not well established yet, economically speaking.  
**0:33:52-0:33:57:**  It's a bit strange maybe because for many countries, France is considered as the leading  
**0:33:57-0:34:08:**  country, at least in Europe, with a bit of advance in the transition.  
**0:34:08-0:34:17:**  Actually I think nowadays we are facing some kind of shortcomings.  
**0:34:17-0:34:24:**  The agroforestry has been developed as a landscaping activity.  
**0:34:24-0:34:31:**  So it's like you're planting trees because you feel good in planting trees.  
**0:34:31-0:34:39:**  You're kind of curing yourself about the world's problems.  
**0:34:39-0:34:45:**  And of course, the media is also responsible for that, I think.  
**0:34:45-0:34:52:**  So you still have a lot of people and companies committing to plant a lot of trees in a very  
**0:34:52-0:34:57:**  short period of time to really save the world.  
**0:34:57-0:35:02:**  And we all believe in that, but actually it's not going to happen this way.  
**0:35:02-0:35:07:**  In agroforestry, we don't want a lot of trees in a short amount of time.  
**0:35:07-0:35:13:**  We want the right tree in the right place with the right management strategy.  
**0:35:13-0:35:21:**  And this is a bit more complicated, of course, which means that planting trees is something  
**0:35:21-0:35:30:**  essential but we also have to gain knowledge in managing agroforestry systems at the system  
**0:35:30-0:35:31:**  level.  
**0:35:31-0:35:39:**  So I always say that agroforestry is two-thirds of agronomy and one-third of everything else.  
**0:35:39-0:35:45:**  And many people talk about agroforestry as being just tree planting on the farm, which  
**0:35:45-0:35:50:**  is, of course, a little bit simplistic.  
**0:35:50-0:36:00:**  So in terms of economy, we still have to, I think, improve our understanding of that.  
**0:36:00-0:36:09:**  There are good examples, but of course, models are many.  
**0:36:09-0:36:16:**  For the popular agroforestry that I mentioned earlier, we have now very good economical  
**0:36:16-0:36:28:**  and economic and agronomic models that are quite robust and quite viable.  
**0:36:28-0:36:34:**  But it's not the same for all the agroforestry systems that we are working on.  
**0:36:34-0:36:40:**  We still have a lot of work on the pipe.  
**0:36:40-0:36:44:**  As you mentioned, there's such a diversity of systems.  
**0:36:44-0:36:48:**  As soon as I said agroforestry systems, I regretted the term because it actually refers  
**0:36:48-0:36:55:**  to such a diversity of practices that we should ban that term.  
**0:36:55-0:37:01:**  It's really interesting, but maybe I had the wrong impression as well that I felt like  
**0:37:01-0:37:04:**  France was at the forefront of agroforestry.  
**0:37:04-0:37:07:**  But you seem to be saying that not necessarily.  
**0:37:07-0:37:12:**  Are there other countries a bit in similar contexts that you think are doing a better  
**0:37:12-0:37:17:**  job at advancing the kind of economic basis of it?  
**0:37:17-0:37:26:**  Well, it's not an easy question because now I have to choose who to mention.  
**0:37:26-0:37:31:**  Basically what I could say is that in Europe, we have a European Agroforestry Federation,  
**0:37:31-0:37:40:**  which is very dynamic and efficient as well as gathering everyone.  
**0:37:40-0:37:48:**  We can see that in almost every country of Europe, there are some things happening, good  
**0:37:48-0:37:52:**  things.  
**0:37:52-0:37:59:**  And really, you could go to Italy, to Belgium, to the Czech Republic.  
**0:37:59-0:38:04:**  All those countries are really making good progress towards reintegrating trees in the  
**0:38:04-0:38:07:**  farming landscapes.  
**0:38:07-0:38:21:**  But again, what I should mention is that agroforestry is about transitioning from an agriculture  
**0:38:21-0:38:27:**  with of course little trees to a farming system with more trees.  
**0:38:27-0:38:34:**  But it's also about reactivating the soil and the landscape fertility.  
**0:38:34-0:38:44:**  So we should integrate agroforestry in a broader framework of agroecological transition.  
**0:38:44-0:38:50:**  And we work a lot on conservation agriculture as well and that kind of practices that goes  
**0:38:50-0:38:55:**  together with the tree side.  
**0:38:55-0:39:07:**  And agroforestry is really, to my view and to many of us, is really the reunion, I would  
**0:39:07-0:39:11:**  say, of agronomy and trees.  
**0:39:11-0:39:16:**  So trees are a big part, but agroforestry is not limited to planting trees or managing  
**0:39:16-0:39:17:**  trees.  
**0:39:17-0:39:24:**  And I think it's important to, especially when you talk about the economic side of it,  
**0:39:24-0:39:28:**  it's very important to have this system approach.  
**0:39:28-0:39:35:**  But are you seeing certain patterns emerging already in terms of maybe some systems, you  
**0:39:35-0:39:40:**  mentioned the popular system already, but some systems being more challenging than others,  
**0:39:40-0:39:49:**  or maybe that a certain scale is required for them to be successful?  
**0:39:49-0:39:50:**  I'm not sure of that.  
**0:39:50-0:39:57:**  I think in every context you have some valid techniques and options.  
**0:39:57-0:40:08:**  And what we are lacking right now is field expertise, to being able to advise farmers,  
**0:40:08-0:40:18:**  not only in one moment, but on a number of years, to really run this transition altogether.  
**0:40:18-0:40:27:**  But on each farm and sometimes on each plots, you have to really adapt a set of practices  
**0:40:27-0:40:31:**  that is really adapted to that context.  
**0:40:31-0:40:37:**  And right now in France, we are lacking expertise in many regions.  
**0:40:37-0:40:46:**  Farmers are quite keen on trying and discovering, I would say, or rediscovering agroforestry.  
**0:40:46-0:40:54:**  But what they don't want or what they won't be interested in for many years is to just  
**0:40:54-0:40:57:**  having a landscape approach.  
**0:40:57-0:41:02:**  Like I'm doing a postcard and they tell me that it's saving the world and that's it.  
**0:41:02-0:41:09:**  We have to integrate that in the agronomy and in the economy.  
**0:41:09-0:41:14:**  And that's not an easy thing as well, of course.  
**0:41:14-0:41:19:**  So when we talked about teaching and training, I think it's a key thing.  
**0:41:19-0:41:24:**  And technical advice is also a big part of the story.  
**0:41:24-0:41:29:**  Related to this question on economics, there's the question of how to finance the transition  
**0:41:29-0:41:32:**  towards agroforestry.  
**0:41:32-0:41:38:**  And I know that in France and in Europe in general, the cap payment system is huge in  
**0:41:38-0:41:40:**  farm economics.  
**0:41:40-0:41:44:**  And I know that there's also some public subsidies coming out for trees.  
**0:41:44-0:41:52:**  I wanted to understand in your view, how are they encouraging the proper, the right tree  
**0:41:52-0:41:55:**  at the right place, as you were saying?  
**0:41:55-0:42:00:**  And what kind of agroforestry systems are they pushing for in terms of public funding?  
**0:42:00-0:42:04:**  Paradoxically, I think funding is not a problem.  
**0:42:04-0:42:06:**  It's not the problem.  
**0:42:06-0:42:16:**  The problem is to being able to advise every farmer in his transition, his or her transition.  
**0:42:16-0:42:26:**  And as soon as you do that, there is a long work before you plant your trees.  
**0:42:26-0:42:32:**  Most of the time, farmers face very daily problems in terms of soil fertility, in terms  
**0:42:32-0:42:39:**  of water balance, in terms of forage during the summer, as I said, for their livestock.  
**0:42:39-0:42:45:**  And if you're not solving those problems that are problems that they're facing now in the  
**0:42:45-0:42:55:**  present, you won't be able to make farmer invest in the future.  
**0:42:55-0:43:02:**  Just because they are facing those problems right now, and you should tackle them first.  
**0:43:02-0:43:10:**  So the key thing, I think, is to be able to have enough expertise again on the field.  
**0:43:10-0:43:14:**  And of course, then there's an investment.  
**0:43:14-0:43:22:**  And in France, we are lucky enough to have possibilities of different types of financing,  
**0:43:22-0:43:27:**  whether public or private.  
**0:43:27-0:43:31:**  I think if you take it this way, there is no problem.  
**0:43:31-0:43:37:**  If you take it in the other way, like there is money to plant trees, are you interested?  
**0:43:37-0:43:42:**  In this case, you're going to probably fail.  
**0:43:42-0:43:50:**  You're going to, of course, spend your money and plant your trees, but they won't really  
**0:43:50-0:43:55:**  provide what you're expecting from them.  
**0:43:55-0:44:01:**  So in our team, there are people working on fundraising.  
**0:44:01-0:44:09:**  And what I always say is, if you have, for example, founders, potential founders, companies,  
**0:44:09-0:44:15:**  et cetera, if those people ask you to plant a given number of trees for a given amount  
**0:44:15-0:44:23:**  of money, just go away from that, just go to the next contributor, because it's not  
**0:44:23-0:44:25:**  solving the problem ever.  
**0:44:25-0:44:33:**  And we've been doing that for 40, 50 years now in many countries.  
**0:44:33-0:44:43:**  And again, tree funding is not the solution to do sustainable development.  
**0:44:43-0:44:44:**  It's a mean.  
**0:44:44-0:44:47:**  It's not the start of the story.  
**0:44:47-0:44:49:**  I see what you mean.  
**0:44:49-0:44:55:**  The reason why I was asking is, often the cap payment system, because of its scale,  
**0:44:55-0:44:56:**  is very bureaucratic.  
**0:44:56-0:45:02:**  And then on the other hand, you were explaining to us how context specific each agroforestry  
**0:45:02-0:45:06:**  system has to be, how every situation is different, every context.  
**0:45:06-0:45:10:**  And I was just wondering if there's a tension there, because I remember looking at some  
**0:45:10-0:45:16:**  funding opportunities on planting trees, and it was very precise on the number of trees  
**0:45:16-0:45:20:**  per hectare, and what essences were available.  
**0:45:20-0:45:25:**  And instinctively, when I saw that, I thought, OK, well, it's great, because you get some  
**0:45:25-0:45:30:**  money to plant trees, but it also kind of ties your hands technically, and to a certain  
**0:45:30-0:45:31:**  extent as well.  
**0:45:31-0:45:41:**  Yeah, but I think we have now many opportunities, or many ways on how to fund projects.  
**0:45:41-0:45:52:**  And one of our jobs is to really identify the right, what do you call that, the right  
**0:45:52-0:45:59:**  financing tool for each project, right?  
**0:45:59-0:46:05:**  So again, if you're able to really have quality advice, and then you know exactly what you  
**0:46:05-0:46:11:**  have to do on this farm, for example, what this farmer wants to do, and what he's able  
**0:46:11-0:46:17:**  to do, and then you know how much it costs, after that, it's quite easy to go and get  
**0:46:17-0:46:26:**  funds, and to really identify the most adapted funding.  
**0:46:26-0:46:35:**  But it's not the way it happens usually, because of course, as you said, funders are basically,  
**0:46:35-0:46:40:**  they set the objectives before knowing what's the need.  
**0:46:40-0:46:47:**  And also they set the same objective for a whole region, if not the whole country.  
**0:46:47-0:46:54:**  So, yeah, it's a nightmare for us, because you have plenty of projects that are already  
**0:46:54-0:47:01:**  here and it cannot match with what the funders want.  
**0:47:01-0:47:07:**  So again, what we're trying to do is really to identify everything and then do some legal  
**0:47:07-0:47:13:**  work, you know, between the opportunities and the demand.  
**0:47:13-0:47:22:**  But again, this is the reason why I mentioned that what we are lacking now is those people  
**0:47:22-0:47:30:**  with enough technical expertise to really do the job in the right order, and then go  
**0:47:30-0:47:34:**  and get the funds in the proper way.  
**0:47:34-0:47:39:**  So yeah, I agree with your impression.  
**0:47:39-0:47:42:**  You were mentioning private funders as well.  
**0:47:42-0:47:45:**  Who are we talking to at this moment?  
**0:47:45-0:47:49:**  Who wants to be investing money in a transition towards agroforestry?  
**0:47:49-0:47:56:**  Well, I would say in terms of profile, I would say almost everyone, at least a wide range  
**0:47:56-0:48:06:**  of people and companies and funders, whether from the agri-food sector or from totally  
**0:48:06-0:48:18:**  other sectors, transport, airlines, even cosmetic brands, et cetera, et cetera.  
**0:48:18-0:48:27:**  So again, I think it's a good opportunity, but we shouldn't fall in what we could call  
**0:48:27-0:48:36:**  greenwashing or tree washing, as we say now, because basically there is a kind of a competition  
**0:48:36-0:48:38:**  between companies.  
**0:48:38-0:48:42:**  The first one said I commit to plant 100,000 trees.  
**0:48:42-0:48:46:**  And then the one next door said I will plant a million trees.  
**0:48:46-0:48:49:**  And then the next one said I plant 10 million trees.  
**0:48:49-0:48:57:**  Now I think some companies, they are at least at 100,000, 100 billion, sorry, trees or even  
**0:48:57-0:49:00:**  a billion or whatever.  
**0:49:00-0:49:07:**  And this is just a nonsense, because again, we don't want, at least for agroforestry,  
**0:49:07-0:49:12:**  we don't want many trees, but we want the proper trees.  
**0:49:12-0:49:22:**  And it's actually, the perfect agroforestry is actually a landscape with trees in many  
**0:49:22-0:49:28:**  contexts, but in a quite scattered way.  
**0:49:28-0:49:31:**  It's not really dense most of the time.  
**0:49:31-0:49:36:**  So as I said, again, if you want to plant a lot of trees, if you want to do timber trees,  
**0:49:36-0:49:39:**  all that is for the forestry sector.  
**0:49:39-0:49:41:**  It's not for agroforestry.  
**0:49:41-0:49:50:**  But as soon, just one addition to that, I noticed from my experience that as soon as  
**0:49:50-0:49:59:**  you start counting trees or setting an objective in number of trees, you're not going to the  
**0:49:59-0:50:01:**  right path.  
**0:50:01-0:50:04:**  You mentioned companies wanting to plant trees.  
**0:50:04-0:50:09:**  I heard in some of those motives may be linked to carbon sequestration or all these issues  
**0:50:09-0:50:11:**  around climate change.  
**0:50:11-0:50:14:**  Do we also see companies wanting to plant trees to change, for example, their value  
**0:50:14-0:50:18:**  chain or actual change their way of doing business?  
**0:50:18-0:50:22:**  Yeah, very much actually.  
**0:50:22-0:50:26:**  I think the carbon footprint is one way of seeing things.  
**0:50:26-0:50:29:**  And of course, it's a major at the moment.  
**0:50:29-0:50:39:**  But what we always try to say is, again, just do something sensible for farmers.  
**0:50:39-0:50:46:**  Just do some real agroforestry development on the field.  
**0:50:46-0:50:52:**  And then of course, it will be positive in terms of carbon.  
**0:50:52-0:50:56:**  And we will be able to assess your impact if you like.  
**0:50:56-0:50:59:**  But don't start talking about carbon.  
**0:50:59-0:51:02:**  Because it's a consequence.  
**0:51:02-0:51:05:**  It shouldn't be a starting point.  
**0:51:05-0:51:13:**  What we want is to build a more sustainable and profitable agriculture.  
**0:51:13-0:51:15:**  It's not to offset carbon footprint.  
**0:51:15-0:51:21:**  Because if you only want to do that, again, you're able to do that in different kinds  
**0:51:21-0:51:27:**  of ways that will be very efficient in storing carbon, but that they won't be efficient at  
**0:51:27-0:51:34:**  all in terms of sustainability of the farming model.  
**0:51:34-0:51:38:**  So it's a trap most of the time.  
**0:51:38-0:51:45:**  And anyway, we work also with the agri-food sector.  
**0:51:45-0:51:56:**  More and more actors nowadays wanting to really have some CSR approaches and being a bit more  
**0:51:56-0:52:04:**  responsible in producing their primary matter.  
**0:52:04-0:52:10:**  And then some of them don't even talk about carbon, surprisingly.  
**0:52:10-0:52:18:**  So it's about really quality and social impact of their activities.  
**0:52:18-0:52:21:**  And the environmental impact as well.  
**0:52:21-0:52:27:**  Apart from carbon, if you talk about biodiversity, for example, it's a big issue nowadays and  
**0:52:27-0:52:33:**  a big concern for those actors.  
**0:52:33-0:52:34:**  That's really interesting.  
**0:52:34-0:52:40:**  So you're really seeing an avenue for change there with working with big economic actors  
**0:52:40-0:52:43:**  on these issues.  
**0:52:43-0:52:51:**  It's not the easiest part, but it's now starting to be very interesting.  
**0:52:51-0:52:56:**  And the key thing is really to know where you want to go.  
**0:52:56-0:53:04:**  Because of course, if you just want to take money from a company, I think it's doable.  
**0:53:04-0:53:13:**  But the easiest way is to just, again, sell some impact or some intention or some story  
**0:53:13-0:53:19:**  that you won't even be able to write in reality.  
**0:53:19-0:53:31:**  So I think it's our responsibility to work with everyone, but really be extremely ambitious  
**0:53:31-0:53:40:**  on what we are doing and what we are going to invest this money for.  
**0:53:40-0:53:52:**  And it's not the easiest part when you start talking about agricultural development and  
**0:53:52-0:54:00:**  facilitating the transition to a certain number of farmers, say 200 farmers.  
**0:54:00-0:54:08:**  It's a lot of work and not very probably sexy as tree planting can be as such.  
**0:54:08-0:54:14:**  One theme I was very curious about is commercialization.  
**0:54:14-0:54:19:**  As farmers include trees in their productive systems, it often means having additional  
**0:54:19-0:54:21:**  products to sell.  
**0:54:21-0:54:27:**  How do you think we can organize and facilitate selling diversity for a farmer?  
**0:54:27-0:54:32:**  Ag and forest trees should always go with an additional income eventually.  
**0:54:32-0:54:35:**  That's the definition, I would say.  
**0:54:35-0:54:42:**  But then the key thing is really to adapt the system to what the farmers want to do  
**0:54:42-0:54:46:**  on his or her farm.  
**0:54:46-0:54:52:**  And this is why I was mentioning that the technical advice is very important.  
**0:54:52-0:54:59:**  Because you won't be able to really let the thing go and then decide.  
**0:54:59-0:55:06:**  You have to decide at first and really analyze the constraints and opportunities.  
**0:55:06-0:55:20:**  And from there you build something that is tailored to the farm you are helping to transition.  
**0:55:20-0:55:27:**  So there shouldn't be a problem if you do things again in the right order.  
**0:55:27-0:55:32:**  But then of course you have to assess the productivity of that new system and maybe  
**0:55:32-0:55:41:**  the need for additional work, which means creation of additional jobs for example.  
**0:55:41-0:55:44:**  So all this has to be planned.  
**0:55:44-0:55:51:**  Otherwise it can be a big issue at some point if you didn't anticipate.  
**0:55:51-0:55:56:**  But it seems it also requires again some kind of collective work.  
**0:55:56-0:55:58:**  You mentioned cooperatives earlier on.  
**0:55:58-0:56:01:**  I'm not sure it necessarily has to go through them.  
**0:56:01-0:56:07:**  But at some point organizing what in French we call filleres, and I don't know how the  
**0:56:07-0:56:09:**  English word, I apologize.  
**0:56:09-0:56:12:**  Market channels, I would say.  
**0:56:12-0:56:13:**  Market channels.  
**0:56:13-0:56:17:**  But also in the case of people doing direct selling, they might need to have collective  
**0:56:17-0:56:21:**  transformation units or whatever the product is.  
**0:56:21-0:56:29:**  I often feel that when you're a farmer diversifying a lot, it can be hard to do so alone in your  
**0:56:29-0:56:30:**  corner.  
**0:56:30-0:56:34:**  Well, it depends really on the system.  
**0:56:34-0:56:45:**  If you have a poultry farmer and that farmer wants to produce walnut, it's a very efficient  
**0:56:45-0:56:53:**  system to have walnut above your poultry on the same piece of land.  
**0:56:53-0:57:02:**  And by the way, it's one of the most profitable systems that we have been working on.  
**0:57:02-0:57:08:**  The economic results of both systems is really impressive.  
**0:57:08-0:57:16:**  Of course, on a hectare basis, right?  
**0:57:16-0:57:23:**  On a piece of land that is relatively small most of the time, but that's really having  
**0:57:23-0:57:27:**  two productions on top of each other.  
**0:57:27-0:57:41:**  So in this case, you might be quite self-sufficient in really developing your model.  
**0:57:41-0:57:49:**  Then of course, if you want to produce, for example, wood pellet for energy, for fuel  
**0:57:49-0:57:59:**  wood, in that case, it's more of a regional project and you need a bunch of farmers to  
**0:57:59-0:58:05:**  get together and really work on that.  
**0:58:05-0:58:13:**  And also it's about new tree planting, but it's also about managing the existing trees  
**0:58:13-0:58:16:**  and the existing hedges most of the time.  
**0:58:16-0:58:20:**  So this is more of a collective project in that case.  
**0:58:20-0:58:29:**  We have a few of them that are quite well established in different regions of France,  
**0:58:29-0:58:34:**  including one in the Caribbean, as I said earlier.  
**0:58:34-0:58:39:**  So it really depends on context and opportunities.  
**0:58:39-0:58:45:**  And what we try to do when we work in a region is really to assess, and that's the very  
**0:58:45-0:58:52:**  first point, to assess what are the main opportunities in this region.  
**0:58:52-0:59:01:**  Because in some regions, you would be able to produce fuel wood from hedges, for example,  
**0:59:01-0:59:05:**  and it will be a very big lever for change.  
**0:59:05-0:59:16:**  And in other regions, it's not an option for local, economic and political reasons.  
**0:59:16-0:59:20:**  So it's really important to know where you are and to assess the context before you start  
**0:59:20-0:59:24:**  thinking about what's doable.  
**0:59:24-0:59:29:**  And then once you know what's doable, economically speaking, and in terms of soil and climate,  
**0:59:29-0:59:40:**  you can go and see what your farmers want to do, but really sticking to what's doable  
**0:59:40-0:59:43:**  among the doable options.  
**0:59:43-0:59:47:**  Because it's a nonsense as well to say, I would like to do that.  
**0:59:47-0:59:52:**  But if it's not possible in your context, if your soil is not adapted to that, you're  
**0:59:52-0:59:54:**  dreaming.  
**0:59:54-1:00:02:**  So it's important to have this initial analysis.  
**1:00:02-1:00:09:**  And again, it's why I was pointing out that we need more expertise and that is more people  
**1:00:09-1:00:10:**  in the different regions.  
**1:00:10-1:00:16:**  In agroforestry, we're often talking about, for example, supporting systems such as hedges  
**1:00:16-1:00:22:**  that can create ecosystem services and support a crop and benefit the crop, for example,  
**1:00:22-1:00:23:**  in certain contexts.  
**1:00:23-1:00:27:**  But we're also talking about, as you said, walnuts over chickens, which is an actual  
**1:00:27-1:00:31:**  crop being produced and being stacked on top of another enterprise.  
**1:00:31-1:00:35:**  Could be, for example, timber intercropping, etc.  
**1:00:35-1:00:38:**  Like timber production stacked on top of a grain production.  
**1:00:38-1:00:43:**  I'm curious in practice, because this is what's really interesting with talking to you here,  
**1:00:43-1:00:48:**  is that we can see, we can hear through you what's been implemented in practice on a few,  
**1:00:48-1:00:50:**  on hundreds of projects or a hundred projects.  
**1:00:50-1:00:54:**  I don't know exactly how much it is in France.  
**1:00:54-1:00:55:**  What do you see more of?  
**1:00:55-1:00:58:**  What do farmers in practice tend more towards?  
**1:00:58-1:01:08:**  Is it, do they always manage to reach the optimal end result of having supporting systems  
**1:01:08-1:01:13:**  plus managing to produce from them plus super well integrated with the other crops that  
**1:01:13-1:01:15:**  they have?  
**1:01:15-1:01:17:**  Where are we dreaming and where not?  
**1:01:17-1:01:25:**  Well, you're not dreaming at all, but we have to really keep in mind and mention that first  
**1:01:25-1:01:26:**  of all, it's a transition.  
**1:01:26-1:01:30:**  So you won't do that from one day to another.  
**1:01:30-1:01:42:**  And the farms that we can consider as a mature agroforestry farms now are in this path since  
**1:01:42-1:01:44:**  sometimes even 15 years.  
**1:01:44-1:01:50:**  Okay, but at least a number of years, at least eight to 10 years.  
**1:01:50-1:01:52:**  So it's a process.  
**1:01:52-1:02:00:**  And it's good that it is a process because it's a change in practices that is really  
**1:02:00-1:02:07:**  important and the farmers really need to also gain knowledge and be able to learn this new  
**1:02:07-1:02:11:**  way of farming basically.  
**1:02:11-1:02:18:**  Then the other point here is that agroforestry is something that we are inventing or reinventing  
**1:02:18-1:02:19:**  every day.  
**1:02:19-1:02:25:**  As I said, you don't have the ultimate agroforestry handbook.  
**1:02:25-1:02:31:**  You won't ever have it just because it's practice and knowledge exchange.  
**1:02:31-1:02:39:**  So yeah, as we mentioned already a little bit, agroforestry is not black and white.  
**1:02:39-1:02:46:**  It's always, there's always a margin for improvement in every context.  
**1:02:46-1:02:54:**  So we start from where we are and then every day it's a process of improvement.  
**1:02:54-1:03:02:**  And yes, of course, we have farms that have transitioned long enough, I would say, to  
**1:03:02-1:03:12:**  have both an economically viable and robust system and also some significant change in  
**1:03:12-1:03:15:**  terms of ecosystem services.  
**1:03:15-1:03:21:**  I think the most tricky part is the economic side.  
**1:03:21-1:03:31:**  But as soon as you have an agroforestry system that is economically viable, first of all,  
**1:03:31-1:03:43:**  it means that it has more chances to be sustainable.  
**1:03:43-1:03:48:**  Sustainability is directly linked to profitability.  
**1:03:48-1:03:56:**  And then once you reach this point, the ecosystem services are just a bonus.  
**1:03:56-1:03:59:**  And you will have everything coming together.  
**1:03:59-1:04:04:**  It's about, it's what agroforestry is, it's the magic.  
**1:04:04-1:04:12:**  You have impact on the biodiversity and the water cycle, on the climate and the microclimate  
**1:04:12-1:04:15:**  locally as well.  
**1:04:15-1:04:25:**  As soon as your trees grow properly, all this will go with the package, it will come together.  
**1:04:25-1:04:28:**  But your trees have to grow and this is the hardest part.  
**1:04:28-1:04:34:**  Whilst we're on this economics aspect, I just wanted to understand what you said earlier  
**1:04:34-1:04:42:**  on about, you know, when you said we asked if we had reached a point where economically  
**1:04:42-1:04:46:**  agroforestry was established and you said, you know, not yet.  
**1:04:46-1:04:51:**  And I just wanted to understand a bit more why you had said not yet.  
**1:04:51-1:05:02:**  In most of the examples, it's not, I would say it's not mature enough to my view.  
**1:05:02-1:05:11:**  But yes, we have examples that are established, that are analyzed and we have some economic  
**1:05:11-1:05:18:**  models in a number of systems that are perfectly well known.  
**1:05:18-1:05:23:**  Because as I said, we do some research and development.  
**1:05:23-1:05:28:**  It's practically what we are trying to do every day, to look at the concrete example  
**1:05:28-1:05:39:**  and analyze the transition, the cost, the type and the amount of work and then the profit  
**1:05:39-1:05:44:**  in the short, mid and long term basis.  
**1:05:44-1:05:51:**  So right now, yes, we have examples and we have the information.  
**1:05:51-1:05:59:**  But what I was saying is that most of what we call agroforestry is not yet robust enough,  
**1:05:59-1:06:02:**  economically speaking, to my view.  
**1:06:02-1:06:06:**  And to my view, it shouldn't be called agroforestry.  
**1:06:06-1:06:14:**  But you know, that's the, I don't know what you call that.  
**1:06:14-1:06:20:**  But it's like a very well known word now and everyone is using it.  
**1:06:20-1:06:26:**  But agroforestry implies economy.  
**1:06:26-1:06:35:**  And it implies a very systemic approach about the farm and its economy, of course.  
**1:06:35-1:06:42:**  I just wanted to ask, which types of systems are you specifically referring to that, in  
**1:06:42-1:06:45:**  your opinion, shouldn't be called agroforestry?  
**1:06:45-1:06:55:**  Well, every system that are just here to be planting trees as some kind of landscaping,  
**1:06:55-1:06:58:**  as I was saying earlier.  
**1:06:58-1:07:05:**  We have plenty of people planting hedges, for example, and saying that, look, it's going  
**1:07:05-1:07:13:**  to bring back some biodiversity, which is, of course, realistic.  
**1:07:13-1:07:19:**  As soon as your tree grows properly, of course, if the tree doesn't grow, you won't have any  
**1:07:19-1:07:21:**  ecosystem service.  
**1:07:21-1:07:29:**  You won't have enough biomass, enough habitat, enough whatever you like.  
**1:07:29-1:07:37:**  But those systems that are really the most important ones in terms of quantity, most  
**1:07:37-1:07:43:**  of the time they have no economic model behind.  
**1:07:43-1:07:46:**  So that's what I was trying to mention.  
**1:07:46-1:07:55:**  I'm not saying it's not useful or it's not an interesting step.  
**1:07:55-1:08:02:**  But if we want it to be sustainable, it has to be profitable, which is why I was pointing  
**1:08:02-1:08:04:**  out this.  
**1:08:04-1:08:10:**  But to take the example of a hedge, then, let's say you're a farmer and you plant a  
**1:08:10-1:08:13:**  hedge as a windbreak.  
**1:08:13-1:08:15:**  Let's take the livestock example.  
**1:08:15-1:08:25:**  I put hedges in to provide shade to my cows and maybe a bit of fodder, et cetera.  
**1:08:25-1:08:29:**  Would you be happy with that result saying, OK, it's improving my production system?  
**1:08:29-1:08:34:**  Or does this for you, it necessarily implies an additional production?  
**1:08:34-1:08:52:**  Well, I think if a windbreak allows you to basically keep growing a crop or having livestock,  
**1:08:52-1:08:57:**  of course, it's economically sensible.  
**1:08:57-1:09:02:**  In plenty of regions, you don't even know if you will be able tomorrow to have livestock  
**1:09:02-1:09:06:**  in the pastures, et cetera, et cetera.  
**1:09:06-1:09:13:**  So if it's well thought in this way that you were describing, I think it's good enough.  
**1:09:13-1:09:19:**  Of course, you could go beyond that and have a proper economy for those trees or those  
**1:09:19-1:09:21:**  hedges.  
**1:09:21-1:09:32:**  In such a way that the trees will pay for what they take in terms of space and time  
**1:09:32-1:09:36:**  for management, of course.  
**1:09:36-1:09:42:**  But in many ways, still you have hedges that cost a lot to the farmers and they are just  
**1:09:42-1:09:50:**  seen as a boundary or maybe a fence, kind of a living fence.  
**1:09:50-1:10:00:**  But they take a lot in terms every year in terms of cleaning and maintaining without  
**1:10:00-1:10:04:**  having any economic model behind.  
**1:10:04-1:10:12:**  And I think this is one of the main reasons why trees and hedges are seen as a charge,  
**1:10:12-1:10:17:**  as something costly and time consuming.  
**1:10:17-1:10:23:**  So in this case, if you look at the landscape with those kind of hedges, most of the time  
**1:10:23-1:10:30:**  quite low hedges just for the sake of having it at the boundary of a field.  
**1:10:30-1:10:42:**  In those case, you could call it agroforestry, but it's not really what we want.  
**1:10:42-1:10:50:**  Because in those landscapes, the number of trees and hedges are still decreasing just  
**1:10:50-1:10:57:**  because they are seen as a problem by farmers and as something that doesn't pay for what  
**1:10:57-1:10:59:**  they cost.  
**1:10:59-1:11:05:**  When you're looking at even the fastest, let's take the timber example, even a hedge, even  
**1:11:05-1:11:11:**  for fast growing trees such as a poplar or a black locust, which you're going to harvest  
**1:11:11-1:11:13:**  in maybe 20 years.  
**1:11:13-1:11:18:**  If you're producing maybe biomass, it could be a faster cycle with other trees, etc.  
**1:11:18-1:11:23:**  But the question is, is often whatever happens in agroforestry when you're dealing with trees,  
**1:11:23-1:11:30:**  you've got a long term project and that's a barrier to entry for farmers because even  
**1:11:30-1:11:35:**  for these fast systems, they're taking the costs of managing it, but they're only going  
**1:11:35-1:11:36:**  to benefit in many years.  
**1:11:36-1:11:41:**  We're not talking here of 90-year oak systems.  
**1:11:41-1:11:47:**  And so how do you see in the field farmers going beyond this boundary?  
**1:11:47-1:11:53:**  How do you as the Afaf can help farmers to deal with this?  
**1:11:53-1:12:03:**  Well, first of all, this is one of the reasons why having a system based on the slow growing  
**1:12:03-1:12:08:**  timber trees is not realistic to my view.  
**1:12:08-1:12:15:**  So you can have a long term profit, but you should also have a mid term or short term  
**1:12:15-1:12:17:**  profit in the same system.  
**1:12:17-1:12:24:**  So this is how we are trying to design our systems.  
**1:12:24-1:12:29:**  You should always have those different timescales.  
**1:12:29-1:12:34:**  And again, on the tree side, but also on the crop side, that most of the time you can do  
**1:12:34-1:12:38:**  a lot also to improve the model.  
**1:12:38-1:12:45:**  And then one thing we talked about financing.  
**1:12:45-1:12:51:**  There are opportunities, I think, today in some types of system.  
**1:12:51-1:13:00:**  And we could take again the example of Poplar, where the industry is able to reinvest in  
**1:13:00-1:13:05:**  the production of quality primary matter.  
**1:13:05-1:13:17:**  And in that case, the farmer is able to have some intermediary revenue for his work.  
**1:13:17-1:13:32:**  So those systems are starting to be developed in some context and some types of markets.  
**1:13:32-1:13:37:**  For example, for the Poplar, we're working now on that type of systems.  
**1:13:37-1:13:48:**  So really having a contract for production of quality would in the end, but with the  
**1:13:48-1:13:53:**  commitment of the industry behind.  
**1:13:53-1:13:57:**  So a security, a guarantee for the farmer who knows that if he gets involved with this  
**1:13:57-1:14:03:**  business and he does an OK job at letting the trees grow or a good job at getting the  
**1:14:03-1:14:06:**  trees grow, he is guaranteed a certain income.  
**1:14:06-1:14:12:**  I'd like us to maybe move on to the last section I had in mind, which is going back to a bit  
**1:14:12-1:14:18:**  more technical design aspects, just because I think a lot of our listeners are in the  
**1:14:18-1:14:22:**  field trying to find solutions.  
**1:14:22-1:14:28:**  So in this final part, I was wondering, Fabien, of course, I don't want to ask you to make  
**1:14:28-1:14:35:**  any generalizations, but are there some recurring mistakes that you see in the conception and  
**1:14:35-1:14:40:**  implementation of agroforestry systems that you would like to share with our listeners?  
**1:14:40-1:14:46:**  I'll try not to repeat too much what I've been saying already, but what we see very  
**1:14:46-1:14:56:**  often is mistakes in choosing the right tree, adapting to the context.  
**1:14:56-1:15:00:**  So that's a very common mistake.  
**1:15:00-1:15:07:**  And again, it's a question of expertise and initial diagnosis.  
**1:15:07-1:15:18:**  But then one thing also I think is, and maybe it's even more specific to France, we tend  
**1:15:18-1:15:24:**  to plant trees at final density in agroforestry.  
**1:15:24-1:15:34:**  So basically, I plant a tree and I want it to grow and have this ultimate quality that  
**1:15:34-1:15:39:**  I'm expecting.  
**1:15:39-1:15:47:**  And I'm not sure it's realistic when you work with trees to work with that kind of mindset.  
**1:15:47-1:15:56:**  Because basically, if you look at what foresters do since centuries ago, they plant more trees  
**1:15:56-1:15:58:**  than what they needed in the end, right?  
**1:15:58-1:16:04:**  And then they do some selection, some thinning, some etc, etc.  
**1:16:04-1:16:13:**  And I think we should rediscover a little bit the basics of silviculture in agroforestry  
**1:16:13-1:16:15:**  as well.  
**1:16:15-1:16:20:**  And this is even more important in the context of climate change, where we don't really know  
**1:16:20-1:16:25:**  what's going to happen next.  
**1:16:25-1:16:38:**  So yeah, planting more trees and giving us the opportunity to select, I think is important.  
**1:16:38-1:16:50:**  Having the right mix, trying to also integrate probably new species to really kind of anticipate  
**1:16:50-1:16:53:**  climate change effects.  
**1:16:53-1:16:59:**  All these are questions that we are trying to tackle nowadays.  
**1:16:59-1:17:03:**  What about planting a diversity, vs planting a single species?  
**1:17:03-1:17:06:**  Is that something that you're also working with at the moment?  
**1:17:06-1:17:08:**  Yeah, of course.  
**1:17:08-1:17:09:**  Always.  
**1:17:09-1:17:17:**  I think we should have a mix, as I said, and it's really important.  
**1:17:17-1:17:28:**  Which doesn't mean that, for example, if you work with walnut above chicken, of course,  
**1:17:28-1:17:31:**  your main species will be walnut.  
**1:17:31-1:17:34:**  And that's the sensible way of doing it.  
**1:17:34-1:17:41:**  And if it's the project, if it's what the farmer wants to do, you have to go with that.  
**1:17:41-1:17:46:**  But then you could always do things in the boundaries to add more diversity and have  
**1:17:46-1:17:56:**  hedges, for example, to integrate that in the broader landscape and have some corridors,  
**1:17:56-1:17:57:**  etc.  
**1:17:57-1:18:05:**  So this is always what we try to do, to add as much diversity as possible in terms of  
**1:18:05-1:18:14:**  species, but also inside every species to have a genetic diversity.  
**1:18:14-1:18:22:**  So for example, if you want to plant walnut again, you would choose a diversity of varieties.  
**1:18:22-1:18:28:**  Just because, yeah, of course, you want to not put all the eggs in the same basket.  
**1:18:28-1:18:35:**  I was wondering in terms of tree genetics, are you able to find good nurseries to work  
**1:18:35-1:18:41:**  on to try and in that diversity already bring genetics that might be more adapted to climate  
**1:18:41-1:18:42:**  change?  
**1:18:42-1:18:45:**  Or is that something you're not focusing on as a priority?  
**1:18:45-1:18:48:**  Well, it's one of the priorities, yes.  
**1:18:48-1:18:54:**  Because the quality, the genetic quality is the key thing.  
**1:18:54-1:19:02:**  I mean, yeah, it's what determines everything else.  
**1:19:02-1:19:07:**  So yes, we do work with tree nurseries.  
**1:19:07-1:19:17:**  There is still a lot of work to do because, of course, in agroforestry, we have a diversity  
**1:19:17-1:19:22:**  of contexts and we have complicated contexts for trees.  
**1:19:22-1:19:29:**  Trees are, I would say they need the most fertile soil, right?  
**1:19:29-1:19:35:**  If you look at the forest, the soil quality in a forest is the best one.  
**1:19:35-1:19:43:**  And trees always come in the ecological succession when the soil is already fertile enough.  
**1:19:43-1:19:50:**  And when you try to plant trees on farmlands, most of the time you put them in a complicated  
**1:19:50-1:19:56:**  context in this case because most of the soils are degraded.  
**1:19:56-1:20:07:**  So you need to be really looking at genetics and good quality of seedlings as well.  
**1:20:07-1:20:12:**  And again, this is also the reason why every time you should, every time you plant a tree,  
**1:20:12-1:20:22:**  you should also adapt your agronomy and be good at soil management practices.  
**1:20:22-1:20:31:**  Just because that's the only way your trees can grow properly and provide you your services  
**1:20:31-1:20:35:**  and your diversity of incomes.  
**1:20:35-1:20:41:**  In the fringe context, because it's the one where, of course, you know the most about,  
**1:20:41-1:20:49:**  if I'm a farmer and I'm thinking about agroforestry I'm interested in, what are the next steps  
**1:20:49-1:20:50:**  for me?  
**1:20:50-1:20:52:**  Who do I contact and where do I start?  
**1:20:52-1:20:59:**  Well, one of the main contexts I think is agroforestry.fr.  
**1:20:59-1:21:05:**  And we have, of course, a phone number and a contact email, etc.  
**1:21:05-1:21:12:**  So we try to answer everyone and then depending on the region, we can put them in contact  
**1:21:12-1:21:17:**  with local partners.  
**1:21:17-1:21:25:**  And then, yeah, I think farmers should just go and talk with other farmers.  
**1:21:25-1:21:31:**  And when you're able to get together the ones who want to do and the ones who have already  
**1:21:31-1:21:40:**  done is the best way, I think, of learning and identifying the best solution for everyone.  
**1:21:40-1:21:44:**  Do you think that there's an agroforestry system for every context?  
**1:21:44-1:21:50:**  Or can you think of some situations where it's just better to leave trees out of the  
**1:21:50-1:21:52:**  agricultural field?  
**1:21:52-1:21:55:**  That's a very good question.  
**1:21:55-1:22:03:**  My experience has shown me that there is no sustainable agriculture without trees.  
**1:22:03-1:22:06:**  At least I've not seen that in my life.  
**1:22:06-1:22:10:**  It might exist, but I don't believe in that yet.  
**1:22:10-1:22:15:**  Because I only believe in what I've seen, as I was saying in the beginning.  
**1:22:15-1:22:25:**  So I think it's already well known that we need to have trees in the farming system.  
**1:22:25-1:22:29:**  And now the very big question is how?  
**1:22:29-1:22:32:**  And that's where it starts to be interesting.  
**1:22:32-1:22:37:**  But to answer your question, yes, agroforestry is adaptable, I think, to every context.  
**1:22:37-1:22:40:**  And it's a necessity.  
**1:22:40-1:22:46:**  But then, of course, you won't do the same thing in every context and in every type of  
**1:22:46-1:22:47:**  systems.  
**1:22:47-1:22:52:**  Bouncing back to this interview with Rowan Reade, because I think it was very thought-provoking.  
**1:22:52-1:23:00:**  At one point, he said that the context between Australia and Europe was very different.  
**1:23:00-1:23:07:**  And that, for example, in Australia, farmers couldn't afford to plant trees in the same  
**1:23:07-1:23:10:**  way because they had much less subsidies.  
**1:23:10-1:23:12:**  They had to be much more flexible.  
**1:23:12-1:23:19:**  And he was saying that putting trees in the agricultural field, in entre parceler, for  
**1:23:19-1:23:24:**  him didn't make much sense because it tied down farmers for two long periods of time  
**1:23:24-1:23:30:**  when for him, you needed a maximum of flexibility.  
**1:23:30-1:23:33:**  Do you agree with that in the European context?  
**1:23:33-1:23:40:**  Well, I think alley cropping is one type of practice.  
**1:23:40-1:23:48:**  And it's valid in some contexts, but probably not too many of them.  
**1:23:48-1:23:51:**  Probably I would say 20%.  
**1:23:51-1:23:56:**  80% is everything else.  
**1:23:56-1:24:01:**  But alley cropping is quite useful when you have bigger plots, basically.  
**1:24:01-1:24:06:**  So the first thing is really to see what you can do in the boundaries.  
**1:24:06-1:24:14:**  And you can always do a lot of things, field boundaries, the road verges as well, the riparian  
**1:24:14-1:24:17:**  areas, et cetera, et cetera.  
**1:24:17-1:24:23:**  And once you've done that, if you have plots that you think are still too big, you can  
**1:24:23-1:24:30:**  divide them up a little bit more through alley cropping systems.  
**1:24:30-1:24:33:**  That's the way I try to put it.  
**1:24:33-1:24:36:**  It's like building a house, right?  
**1:24:36-1:24:43:**  You have the first walls, and then you can divide and have more rooms, et cetera, et  
**1:24:43-1:24:44:**  cetera.  
**1:24:44-1:24:48:**  But you should start with the beginning, of course.  
**1:24:48-1:24:49:**  So it's the same here.  
**1:24:49-1:24:55:**  Again, it's a transition of a number of years.  
**1:24:55-1:25:02:**  And we should go from the easiest part to the hardest and the most committing part as  
**1:25:02-1:25:03:**  well.  
**1:25:03-1:25:04:**  Yeah.  
**1:25:04-1:25:05:**  So I agree.  
**1:25:05-1:25:07:**  I agree with what Roland was saying.  
**1:25:07-1:25:11:**  Well, thank you so much, Fabien, for taking the time to talk to us.  
**1:25:11-1:25:13:**  It was really a fascinating conversation.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Tue, 03 May 2022 10:25:10)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:47:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:52:**  I'm your host Dimitri and we've just finished a fantastic interview with Campbell Mercer,  
**0:00:52-0:00:57:**  an Australian farmer from Victoria state who has 40 hectares of mixed farm with his main  
**0:00:57-0:00:59:**  crop being olive trees.  
**0:00:59-0:01:03:**  He's actually a winner of an olive award, you'll hear more about it during the show.  
**0:01:03-0:01:08:**  And on his farm he's planted shelter belts, windbreaks, different forestry systems and  
**0:01:08-0:01:13:**  has planted his olive trees on a unique plantation pattern called the key line pattern.  
**0:01:13-0:01:15:**  So we'll go into all of these subjects.  
**0:01:15-0:01:19:**  Again we are talking to a farmer that has 20 years of experience with different tree  
**0:01:19-0:01:20:**  systems.  
**0:01:20-0:01:23:**  He's already started harvesting his first timber crops.  
**0:01:23-0:01:28:**  He's won awards for his olive oil and it was absolutely fascinating so I really hope you  
**0:01:28-0:01:29:**  enjoy.  
**0:01:29-0:01:32:**  Hello Campbell and welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:32-0:01:35:**  Thank you, thank you, great to be here.  
**0:01:35-0:01:36:**  Wow that's awesome.  
**0:01:36-0:01:42:**  I wanted to start off by firstly congratulating you on your gold medal in the 2020 Australian  
**0:01:42-0:01:47:**  International Olive Awards competition which I found out on your website and I thought  
**0:01:47-0:01:49:**  that was quite incredible.  
**0:01:49-0:01:56:**  Thank you, yeah no that was really, really pleasing, we're a relatively small farm and  
**0:01:56-0:02:04:**  organically certified and yeah a lot of contestants in the international competition and to get  
**0:02:04-0:02:10:**  a gold medal was really good and we'll also nominate as the best extra virgin olive oil  
**0:02:10-0:02:11:**  in Victoria.  
**0:02:11-0:02:16:**  So there's about 73 entries from Victoria as well.  
**0:02:16-0:02:22:**  So yeah to be like the best in that group is really pleasing.  
**0:02:22-0:02:29:**  Yeah that's really, really amazing to see and I guess that's going to open up lots of  
**0:02:29-0:02:33:**  questions about you know how is that happening, how did you make that, you know how did you  
**0:02:33-0:02:38:**  get that gold medal and I'm sure we're going to get into it in the conversation little  
**0:02:38-0:02:39:**  by little.  
**0:02:39-0:02:44:**  But before that maybe we could have a bit of an introduction as to you know what's your  
**0:02:44-0:02:48:**  story and how you got started with olive farming.  
**0:02:48-0:03:00:**  Right actually yeah I guess I grew up on a farm, a mixed farm and from that yeah went  
**0:03:00-0:03:06:**  to university, went into corporate life, did a whole lot of stuff there over a number of  
**0:03:06-0:03:12:**  years but I guess once we had children I sat down with my wife and said okay what do we  
**0:03:12-0:03:19:**  want to do long term and said okay I said I'd be really keen to get back to the land  
**0:03:19-0:03:22:**  and she was really keen as well.  
**0:03:22-0:03:30:**  So that's what we decided to do so we moved back to the land, bought this place and at  
**0:03:30-0:03:39:**  the time it was a very rundown sheep farm and you know really been you know set stocked,  
**0:03:39-0:03:46:**  very poor pasture in fact it mainly had cape weed, we're looking at some early photos from  
**0:03:46-0:03:52:**  a few years ago and yeah almost like a hundred percent cape weed and so yeah a huge challenge  
**0:03:52-0:04:00:**  to start with but yeah I guess I had a vision and passion and energy and thought yep this  
**0:04:00-0:04:02:**  will work for us.  
**0:04:02-0:04:11:**  So that's sort of my background, we started about 20 years ago and yeah maybe if I just  
**0:04:11-0:04:18:**  tell you a little bit about the farm that'll give a bit of context for you know maybe a  
**0:04:18-0:04:20:**  further conversation.  
**0:04:20-0:04:26:**  So yeah we're really, we're a small farm, certified organic, we're located at an altitude  
**0:04:26-0:04:34:**  of about 500 metres and we're about a hundred kilometres from Melbourne so that's in the  
**0:04:34-0:04:36:**  southern part of Australia.  
**0:04:36-0:04:45:**  We pretty much have a Mediterranean climate so coolish winters and hot dry summers so  
**0:04:45-0:04:48:**  classified as temperate in terms of climate.  
**0:04:48-0:04:53:**  So in winter we do get down to zero at night and maybe six or eight degrees during the  
**0:04:53-0:05:01:**  day and occasionally get snow but most of the rain occurs in the winter and then in  
**0:05:01-0:05:09:**  summers they tend to be relatively dry and hot so typically high 30s we usually get a  
**0:05:09-0:05:19:**  bout of days in the 40s but that depends on the season because we're typically impacted  
**0:05:19-0:05:26:**  by both La Nina and El Nino so we're the reverse of South America.  
**0:05:26-0:05:32:**  So when there's an El Nino they get flooding, we get droughts, this year we're a La Nina  
**0:05:32-0:05:38:**  so we're getting flooding so Brisbane up north of Australia they've had a metre of rain in  
**0:05:38-0:05:40:**  the last three days.  
**0:05:40-0:05:46:**  Yeah I saw that on the news huh, it looked pretty bad.  
**0:05:46-0:05:51:**  So lots of rain in a La Nina season, having said that because we're down south we're not  
**0:05:51-0:05:59:**  as affected and it hasn't rained here for a month like zero and so yeah so we get quite  
**0:05:59-0:06:06:**  a lot of variability and historically the rainfall here has been around 700 milli year  
**0:06:06-0:06:13:**  but it's fallen with climate change and we're probably closer to an average of around 600  
**0:06:13-0:06:20:**  with quite significant variations in the last few years we've had as low of 400 and as much  
**0:06:20-0:06:27:**  as 850 so yeah big variation year to year.  
**0:06:27-0:06:30:**  Just to give a bit of background on the soil because that has a huge impact in terms of  
**0:06:30-0:06:37:**  what you can grow and how you can grow it, it's really old soil like a lot of Australia  
**0:06:37-0:06:42:**  we're on very old soil it's about 400 million years old and that doesn't mean much to many  
**0:06:42-0:06:49:**  people but to put it in perspective when this soil was laid down there was only one continent  
**0:06:49-0:06:55:**  that was Gondwanaland so it was one super continent that's when the soil was laid down  
**0:06:55-0:07:01:**  for this place so it is really really old.  
**0:07:01-0:07:08:**  So as a result like a lot of Australian soils it's relatively infertile and has relatively  
**0:07:08-0:07:14:**  higher concentration of heavy metals things like iron, aluminium and they tend to lock  
**0:07:14-0:07:21:**  up your nutrients in the soil so you know in terms of what you do and your biological  
**0:07:21-0:07:29:**  treatment and how do you unlock some of that then yeah that's really really important in  
**0:07:29-0:07:30:**  this context.  
**0:07:30-0:07:38:**  And our topsoil was really really thin like yeah the previous owner really just had flogged  
**0:07:38-0:07:46:**  it out so the topsoil was maybe 25 mil thick and then you went pretty quickly into like  
**0:07:46-0:07:54:**  a hard clay layer with quite a lot of stone through it and luckily the stone gives it  
**0:07:54-0:08:02:**  pretty good infiltration so that's the one upside but relatively infertile and we're  
**0:08:02-0:08:07:**  generally north facing slopes and so because we're in the southern hemisphere that means  
**0:08:07-0:08:11:**  we're warmer and drier typically.  
**0:08:11-0:08:17:**  So yeah that's a bit of context in terms of you know about the farm itself the sort of  
**0:08:17-0:08:26:**  temperature we have, sort of soil we have and yeah and you know potentially just a little  
**0:08:26-0:08:33:**  bit about the farm itself sorry I just should probably put that in is that you know we've  
**0:08:33-0:08:41:**  developed quite a diverse set of activities across the farm so we've got agroforestry  
**0:08:41-0:08:49:**  which is to my sense classic agroforestry close spacing 4x3 meter spacing typically  
**0:08:49-0:08:58:**  Australian natives but for the most part with one or two exceptions not indigenous and I'll  
**0:08:58-0:09:01:**  come back to that in a moment.  
**0:09:01-0:09:07:**  We also have wide spaced tree crops which is you know probably what people think is  
**0:09:07-0:09:15:**  the traditional silvopasture so that's on a 15x15 meter spacing so yeah plenty of grazing  
**0:09:15-0:09:18:**  opportunity and alley cropping.  
**0:09:18-0:09:23:**  Then we have olives so we have about two and a half thousand trees olives which run an  
**0:09:23-0:09:30:**  8x5 meter spacing non-irrigated so we're dry range.  
**0:09:30-0:09:38:**  We also have a riparian zone which is about 20% of the total land area and we're really  
**0:09:38-0:09:46:**  committed to regenerating that to the original vegetation which is grassy woodland and the  
**0:09:46-0:09:54:**  reason for that is that in the state of Victoria is that we've got about less than 1% of that  
**0:09:54-0:10:02:**  natural grassland left from pre-european settlement so and again we can talk about some of the  
**0:10:02-0:10:04:**  things we're doing there.  
**0:10:04-0:10:11:**  We also have some open grazing land that's large the exotic imported grass species and  
**0:10:11-0:10:18:**  extensive sheller belts so that sort of gives a bit of a summary about the place.  
**0:10:18-0:10:22:**  Yeah it gives us a bit too much to talk about as well this is the problem as we had talked  
**0:10:22-0:10:27:**  about as we had said before Campbell it's too much stuff to discuss too many interesting  
**0:10:27-0:10:33:**  projects going on which makes the interview more challenging.  
**0:10:33-0:10:37:**  You know there's one or two details I wanted to confirm with you I was curious about this  
**0:10:37-0:10:43:**  actual size of the farm you said it was relatively small but how many hectares do you have?  
**0:10:43-0:10:46:**  So it's just a little under 40 hectares.  
**0:10:46-0:10:52:**  And when did you start farming over there when did you actually like buy the land and  
**0:10:52-0:10:53:**  or take over the land?  
**0:10:53-0:10:58:**  Yeah so we started out in 2002 so it's almost exactly 20 years ago.  
**0:10:58-0:11:03:**  You know I saw on your website and as you explained earlier on you're organic and I  
**0:11:03-0:11:10:**  was curious why you had decided to go organic what was the motivation for that?  
**0:11:10-0:11:22:**  Yeah so I guess it was all driven by a personal belief that 20 years ago that was quite unusual  
**0:11:22-0:11:34:**  less unusual now but I guess I was personally committed to agriculture without the use of  
**0:11:34-0:11:41:**  you know industrial fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and so it was really taken from  
**0:11:41-0:11:49:**  a philosophical approach and subsequently I discovered that yeah there's certainly a  
**0:11:49-0:11:55:**  premium associated with organic produce and you know one of the advantages certainly in  
**0:11:55-0:12:02:**  terms of selling my olives and olive oil and olive products is that organic certification  
**0:12:02-0:12:10:**  is that that gives me some opportunities that enables me to compete in the marketplace and  
**0:12:10-0:12:11:**  still make a living.  
**0:12:11-0:12:15:**  I guess that's also yeah it's similar to our case in Massey farm I guess we came from a  
**0:12:15-0:12:20:**  philosophical place at the beginning wanting to not put chemicals on our land as challenging  
**0:12:20-0:12:22:**  as that can be at times.  
**0:12:22-0:12:28:**  Yeah it's not as if we don't have weeds and it's not as if we don't have pests and all  
**0:12:28-0:12:35:**  the rest of it it's just saying okay well you know there's I actually think industrial  
**0:12:35-0:12:42:**  farming as a general rule shows of lack of imagination is that you know for every problem  
**0:12:42-0:12:49:**  that you have if you see it as a problem is that there's an opportunity there and to a  
**0:12:49-0:12:55:**  large extent you're just challenged to find what that opportunity is and so yeah I think  
**0:12:55-0:13:00:**  it's just a smarter way you've just got to be smarter in terms of the way in which you  
**0:13:00-0:13:07:**  approach things and be happy with complexity but that's the other issue is that you've  
**0:13:07-0:13:15:**  got to recognize that these are complex systems and that you know if you apply a simple solution  
**0:13:15-0:13:19:**  you end up with a whole lot of unintended consequences because we don't understand the  
**0:13:19-0:13:21:**  systems.  
**0:13:21-0:13:28:**  Is that why you have planted such a or integrated such a diverse set of systems on your farm?  
**0:13:28-0:13:39:**  Yeah part of this was driven like our agroforestry is a diverse species agroforestry so we have  
**0:13:39-0:13:48:**  you know quite probably about a dozen different species that we've planted across there.  
**0:13:48-0:13:56:**  Some of that was just in terms of how did we want to go about putting the agroforestry  
**0:13:56-0:14:04:**  in so we planted an indigenous species about every second tree which was a black wattle  
**0:14:04-0:14:14:**  which is acacia myrnsii and it grows very very quickly and as a result it forces the  
**0:14:14-0:14:22:**  other trees to grow straight up to get to the light and so it saves a lot of pruning  
**0:14:22-0:14:28:**  by doing that so you get these trees and because they're indigenous species they have a lot  
**0:14:28-0:14:35:**  of indigenous pests and typically they don't last live much longer than about somewhere  
**0:14:35-0:14:44:**  between 15 and 25 years and so on one of our dryer plots you know they basically all died  
**0:14:44-0:14:51:**  they got the lyctospora into them and they've all died which is great it's then left the  
**0:14:51-0:14:58:**  other species to continue to grow and we're getting some great logs coming from those.  
**0:14:58-0:15:05:**  In the wetter portion where they were quite happy to keep growing to some extent is that  
**0:15:05-0:15:14:**  I had to thin them out to enable enough water for the timber species but what I'd done  
**0:15:14-0:15:20:**  which most people don't do with nursemaid crops is I'd actually prune them and so when  
**0:15:20-0:15:26:**  we actually cut them out it actually because they're very fast growing it actually gave  
**0:15:26-0:15:35:**  me quite a number of saw logs and so we ended up with about 500 or 600 saw logs out of that  
**0:15:35-0:15:46:**  which we then milled and I've subsequently been able to sell and I've sold a lot recently  
**0:15:46-0:15:53:**  to there's a local group who have built a hut it's called the 21st century hut there's  
**0:15:53-0:16:04:**  a video on YouTube and I supplied all the timber for that for the flooring and for the  
**0:16:04-0:16:12:**  doors and I personally think it looks magnificent and even historically the black wattle tends  
**0:16:12-0:16:17:**  to have been overlooked as a species it was used a lot for tanning because it has a high  
**0:16:17-0:16:27:**  tonic tannin content in the bark and so traditionally used for tanning but it was never really used  
**0:16:27-0:16:35:**  as a timber tree and it's a beautiful tree it initially when you cut it it looks you  
**0:16:35-0:16:42:**  know it's like a milky white but then over the following three days as it oxidizes it  
**0:16:42-0:16:50:**  turns into a red and it has this wonderful reddish sheen to it it is magnificent and  
**0:16:50-0:16:56:**  it's quite quite a hard timber dense timber but yeah yeah that's definitely a two birds  
**0:16:56-0:17:00:**  with with one stone situation there because you're you're facilitating or making your  
**0:17:00-0:17:04:**  management easier whilst at the same time getting a harvest out of it is it the first  
**0:17:04-0:17:11:**  harvest from your forestry plots yeah correct correct so that was our first thinning probably  
**0:17:11-0:17:17:**  a little later than it should have been but part of the reason for that is that ironically  
**0:17:17-0:17:26:**  2002 was the start of the millennium drought and so we had record low rainfall for eight  
**0:17:26-0:17:33:**  successive years and as a result of that everything grew really slowly I'd have to say even my  
**0:17:33-0:17:41:**  olives the olives survived but they didn't really grow and they certainly didn't produce  
**0:17:41-0:17:51:**  and similarly with the forestry is that it didn't grow very quickly and so so yeah I  
**0:17:51-0:17:59:**  guess I when did we thin it we thinned it about five years ago I guess and is when we  
**0:17:59-0:18:07:**  took the all the all the black bottle out and yeah and and you know we sort of like  
**0:18:07-0:18:17:**  used a swing over saw and you know cut that into pieces which we could then use and quite  
**0:18:17-0:18:24:**  a lot of it we cut up because each each log you look at and say what's the best or most  
**0:18:24-0:18:31:**  timber I can get out of this and and so each log you know you get different dimension species  
**0:18:31-0:18:37:**  a different dimensioned blocks of timber but you need to be fairly consistent in terms  
**0:18:37-0:18:42:**  of otherwise you end up with a complete mismatch and it's unsaleable so you've got to think  
**0:18:42-0:18:48:**  okay what's the end use going to be and we anticipated that it could be a floral so we  
**0:18:48-0:18:55:**  actually cut a lot at flooring width okay and so this is you sold it to a local group  
**0:18:55-0:19:00:**  it was kind it's kind of like you didn't sell it to a cooperative that then sold it to that  
**0:19:00-0:19:05:**  group you you went to see that that company or that group I can't remember exactly what  
**0:19:05-0:19:11:**  it was directly correct you went to see them and okay yep so it was just locally sold in  
**0:19:11-0:19:19:**  a very short circuit circuit very very yeah and part of that you know around the whole  
**0:19:19-0:19:27:**  idea of the hut that they built was all about sourcing products as close as possible to  
**0:19:27-0:19:33:**  you know using local indigenous species and sourcing them as close as possible to the  
**0:19:33-0:19:41:**  hut itself and the huts about five kilometers from my place wow that's that's ideal that's  
**0:19:41-0:19:48:**  a quite a good sales opportunity yeah because I would expect small quantities like this  
**0:19:48-0:19:54:**  could be sometimes hard to sell am I am I mistaken no that's probably right there's  
**0:19:54-0:20:03:**  slowly becoming more opportunities but in many cases it is small private sales where  
**0:20:03-0:20:10:**  people see the end product and say yeah I'd really love a room of that or you know I'd  
**0:20:10-0:20:17:**  love a bench made out of that or a table or something like that and by knowing some of  
**0:20:17-0:20:24:**  the local artisans who are involved in that process then you know they can give me a call  
**0:20:24-0:20:30:**  and say look you know we've got this opportunity you interested in selling some of your timber  
**0:20:30-0:20:37:**  so so yeah it's a matter of you know local networks and rather than trying to sell it  
**0:20:37-0:20:46:**  into a much broader market where it becomes very difficult yeah because they I mean the  
**0:20:46-0:20:52:**  forestry companies and they're reaching economies of scale that yeah I can only imagine I don't  
**0:20:52-0:20:56:**  know what the case is like in Australia but the price of timber is just really low as  
**0:20:56-0:21:02:**  compared to to your costs on a smaller scale yeah absolutely you can never make that work  
**0:21:02-0:21:12:**  never so and and there's a whole lot of forests put in here which were actually put in they  
**0:21:12-0:21:19:**  grew blue gums and the whole purpose of growing them was for wood chips you know from to make  
**0:21:19-0:21:25:**  paper and you know it's it's sort of bizarre because it's wood chips is about the lowest  
**0:21:25-0:21:35:**  value product you can get out of timber and blue gums which is eucalyptus globulus is  
**0:21:35-0:21:42:**  a tremendous timber tree like yeah it's it can be used for a whole lot of structural  
**0:21:42-0:21:49:**  purposes it's very clear it's a clean growing timber and they just planted them really densely  
**0:21:49-0:21:56:**  and just chop them down for wood chips just like travesty in some respects that's interesting  
**0:21:56-0:22:01:**  it's the same case here in Portugal they've planted lots of eucalyptus globulus I'm actually  
**0:22:01-0:22:07:**  in Portugal right now that's why I'm saying here and they yeah it's just you know they  
**0:22:07-0:22:11:**  I can't remember exactly what the cycle is it may be after 10 years but you know they  
**0:22:11-0:22:16:**  harvest them they copies them and they do that after a few rounds and actually I went  
**0:22:16-0:22:23:**  to visit a farm a small farm just north of Lisbon once and they they took over land that  
**0:22:23-0:22:28:**  had been through a few of these cycles and they had a pH of four and they had so that  
**0:22:28-0:22:33:**  the soil was completely depleted of all of its cations and it was just it was very very  
**0:22:33-0:22:39:**  challenging condition yeah absolutely so you know it's interesting as well to see how that  
**0:22:39-0:22:50:**  affected the the soil capital there yep as a side note but I wanted to zoom out just  
**0:22:50-0:22:59:**  a tiny bit and looking at remaining inside the the topic of the farm forestry is or agroforestry  
**0:22:59-0:23:04:**  as you as you call it and I'm curious as to what were your main objectives with it why  
**0:23:04-0:23:12:**  did you you know you have 40 hectares of land and it's relatively small size of land why  
**0:23:12-0:23:17:**  did you decide to diversify with the forestry what were your main objectives there so part  
**0:23:17-0:23:25:**  of it was around to create some biodiversity is that yeah so a lot of the farms around  
**0:23:25-0:23:35:**  here a lot of them were were cleared they may have left one or two trees for stock bit  
**0:23:35-0:23:40:**  of shelter for the stock you know a bit of shade on a hot day maybe but you know only  
**0:23:40-0:23:46:**  a small amount number of the flock or herd could actually ever get underneath the tree  
**0:23:46-0:23:52:**  and then of course you get a whole lot of compaction because the stock always camp underneath  
**0:23:52-0:23:58:**  tree and eventually the tree dies and you can see lots of paddocks around here where  
**0:23:58-0:24:03:**  you know these magnificent old trees and they're all dead so you just get these skeletons just  
**0:24:03-0:24:15:**  standing out in the paddock so I was looking to you know regenerate the land and I saw  
**0:24:15-0:24:23:**  agroforestry as a great way to do that and I didn't really see myself as giving up a  
**0:24:23-0:24:31:**  huge amount in that okay for the first few years you don't get a whole lot of grass in  
**0:24:31-0:24:36:**  the understory but once you've done that first thinning you're getting a reasonable amount  
**0:24:36-0:24:44:**  of grass and a great deal of protection for stock so I can still run my sheep underneath  
**0:24:44-0:24:49:**  you know the agroforestry plots after the first thinning actually even ran them before  
**0:24:49-0:24:53:**  the first thinning but you know there's a reasonable amount of grass there after the  
**0:24:53-0:25:01:**  first thinning and you know a lot of shelter so you know whenever the weather turns bad  
**0:25:01-0:25:08:**  the sheep always move into the agroforestry blocks and so you know there's a whole lot  
**0:25:08-0:25:17:**  of benefits associated with having trees on farms and I think we really miss out on some  
**0:25:17-0:25:22:**  of those opportunities even for people who are just running livestock but there's all  
**0:25:22-0:25:28:**  these other opportunities that you have and in terms of yep you can get some value from  
**0:25:28-0:25:33:**  the timber that you're growing you also get a whole lot of biodiversity so you know we  
**0:25:33-0:25:40:**  have something like 76 bird species here which we see on a pretty regular basis which is  
**0:25:40-0:25:47:**  up quite a lot on what we used to have which is down in the 50s and so you know we're getting  
**0:25:47-0:25:55:**  a lot of wildlife coming back as a result of you know this biodiverse plantation and  
**0:25:55-0:26:00:**  then I'm still getting a whole lot of value from it so not only do I get the value from  
**0:26:00-0:26:09:**  the timber but you know the larger logs that are no good for timber I can turn into firewood  
**0:26:09-0:26:15:**  which is pretty low value I understand that and then the next size down I turn that I've  
**0:26:15-0:26:20:**  got a furnace and I turn that into biochar and then the smallest pieces I then run through  
**0:26:20-0:26:31:**  a chipper and you know through an 8 inch chipper and it'll turn those into small wood chips  
**0:26:31-0:26:40:**  and I either use that as mulch or more recently I've been using it to convert that into compost  
**0:26:40-0:26:47:**  using the Johnson Sue method I'm not sure if you're aware of it but that is a great  
**0:26:47-0:26:53:**  way it takes a bit of time but that is a great way to produce an outstanding compost and  
**0:26:53-0:27:03:**  then I use that as a compost extract to you know enhance the biological life on my soils  
**0:27:03-0:27:13:**  so you know I see a lot of products coming out of that to enable me and you know so like  
**0:27:13-0:27:20:**  not on a commercial basis I also have bees and you know if you have a diverse agroforestry  
**0:27:20-0:27:26:**  plot then you end up with trees flowering at different times of the year and so you  
**0:27:26-0:27:34:**  know you then get honey as another product that comes out of this biodiverse you know  
**0:27:34-0:27:37:**  essentially agroforestry plantation.  
**0:27:37-0:27:43:**  That's very interesting and I'm curious have you have you planted these agroforestry plots  
**0:27:43-0:27:48:**  in specific parts of the landscape based on kind of their ecological sensitivity or have  
**0:27:48-0:27:56:**  you sensibility sorry or have you been placing them how did the design unfold?  
**0:27:56-0:28:04:**  Yeah so the design unfolded depending on pretty much on the slope and how much sun each block  
**0:28:04-0:28:13:**  would get and so essentially the way we laid it out is we put the olives on the gentle  
**0:28:13-0:28:18:**  facing northern slopes and that then left us other areas okay what are we going to do  
**0:28:18-0:28:28:**  with these so we had a very quite a steep slope of face east it's quite dry and you  
**0:28:28-0:28:34:**  know to some extent too steep to get a harvester an olive harvester onto so we grew  
**0:28:34-0:28:43:**  you know some quite dry species in that area so none of them are indigenous they're all  
**0:28:43-0:28:51:**  native to Australia but they're not indigenous to this area and then we had some south facing  
**0:28:51-0:28:57:**  slopes which because we're in the southern hemisphere are wetter and so we grew a different  
**0:28:57-0:29:02:**  set of species really focused on that so you know to answer your question yeah absolutely  
**0:29:02-0:29:09:**  we looked at the slope and what sort of microclimate we were going to get in each of those areas  
**0:29:09-0:29:15:**  and then determined which trees that we're going to put into which area.  
**0:29:15-0:29:19:**  Nice okay so it was also making use of the more marginal areas of the land.  
**0:29:19-0:29:20:**  Correct.  
**0:29:20-0:29:24:**  The ones that were more challenging to cultivate olives on.  
**0:29:24-0:29:30:**  Yep yeah so you know again really trying to maximize the value out of the landscape that  
**0:29:30-0:29:36:**  you have but again it also generates a whole lot of generates more biodiversity that's  
**0:29:36-0:29:42:**  the other thing is that you end up with different species in different areas and that really  
**0:29:42-0:29:43:**  works as well.  
**0:29:43-0:29:49:**  It complements the ecological matrix of your land of your 40 hectares by creating a diverse  
**0:29:49-0:29:55:**  set of ecosystems which creates a diverse set of products a diverse set of organisms  
**0:29:55-0:30:00:**  that can live in it it's from my perspective and also from interviewing many  
**0:30:00-0:30:05:**  people that do agroforestry we can see that these situations they often create a lot more  
**0:30:05-0:30:11:**  complexity to manage but at the same time they create also a lot more opportunity.  
**0:30:11-0:30:16:**  Some people have even been using these types of plantations to create tourism opportunities  
**0:30:16-0:30:21:**  yet bird watching crews onto their land to you know there's so many different ways in  
**0:30:21-0:30:28:**  which we can we can kind of make that biodiversity have an economic sense for us in order to  
**0:30:28-0:30:33:**  do to maintain it and to care for it and to actually be motivated to plant it.  
**0:30:33-0:30:35:**  I don't know I'm curious to know what your take on that.  
**0:30:35-0:30:43:**  Yeah no I'm with you 100% but to me it's not just an economic outcome it's also a great  
**0:30:43-0:30:53:**  environment to live in to have you know that biodiverse areas in a sense the whole landscape  
**0:30:53-0:30:58:**  becomes biodiverse then that you end up with a lot of different species and it's just a  
**0:30:58-0:31:06:**  really nice place to really go and wander around and spend time in and you know how  
**0:31:06-0:31:12:**  do you put value on that is that you know I think we lose sight of the human spirit  
**0:31:12-0:31:21:**  like you know on our south facing slopes of trees is like really grown really tall and  
**0:31:21-0:31:26:**  sometimes when the sun is coming up I'm over there working it feels like you're in a cathedral  
**0:31:26-0:31:32:**  like you just have these massive trees that go straight up you know the sun coming in  
**0:31:32-0:31:38:**  it just you know you get that golden light it really is it's really uplifting to the  
**0:31:38-0:31:45:**  soul and yeah absolutely I'm not saying that there's not economic benefits associated with  
**0:31:45-0:31:52:**  that but I think we sometimes by bringing everything down to the dollar we sometimes  
**0:31:52-0:31:57:**  miss on some of the really really important things.  
**0:31:57-0:32:01:**  Yeah I find that very inspiring and you know on the podcast we're often thinking about  
**0:32:01-0:32:08:**  the economics and because it's something that it drives so many of our decisions nowadays  
**0:32:08-0:32:13:**  probably not just nowadays probably back in the days as well but you know we're often  
**0:32:13-0:32:18:**  trying to find the economic answers for farmers through the in the podcast by interviewing  
**0:32:18-0:32:25:**  people and we have to admit we can sometimes be ignoring or be not putting enough value  
**0:32:25-0:32:33:**  on the much more you know emotional or quality of life things that agroforestry and trees  
**0:32:33-0:32:37:**  and complex landscapes can provide to us so I'm very happy that here you're being an advocate  
**0:32:37-0:32:43:**  for that because it's necessary reminding me as well.  
**0:32:43-0:32:52:**  You know it's I think it's really important for us to live in landscapes that you know  
**0:32:52-0:32:59:**  we really enjoy and really feel connected to you know almost in a spiritual way and  
**0:32:59-0:33:08:**  you know we we like discount that at our peril you know does everyone want you know and to  
**0:33:08-0:33:13:**  some extent you've seen that in quite a few countries and in this one as well where you  
**0:33:13-0:33:19:**  know to get the GPS equipment to work and everything else they've taken out every single  
**0:33:19-0:33:24:**  thing you know corner to corner so that you know the GPS controlled tractor can just go  
**0:33:24-0:33:31:**  round and round and round and you know it's you know it's industrial agriculture it's  
**0:33:31-0:33:41:**  lost its soul it's and you know where does that place us in the future so I don't discount  
**0:33:41-0:33:47:**  that because again can you monetize that absolutely you can monetize that is that yeah you can  
**0:33:47-0:33:55:**  get people people come here and they're really they love the environment and so yeah could  
**0:33:55-0:34:01:**  I make money by running tours and all the rest of it absolutely and you know people  
**0:34:01-0:34:06:**  have run up and wanted to run weddings here and those sorts of things so yes you can monetize  
**0:34:06-0:34:15:**  it because people feel good in this environment but I think it's important to say you do it  
**0:34:15-0:34:20:**  because it's the right thing to do and okay if you need to monetize it afterwards then  
**0:34:20-0:34:26:**  so be it you just become innovative about how you're going to monetize that but to just  
**0:34:26-0:34:31:**  do things on the basis that well this is going to make me an extra dollar it's pretty soulless  
**0:34:31-0:34:38:**  yeah yeah yeah fully fully agree that's very interesting so what's the next tree that you're  
**0:34:38-0:34:47:**  going to harvest so yeah the next tree that's an interesting question I'll probably take  
**0:34:47-0:34:58:**  out I had put some light woods in which is a that's also an acacia it's a acacia inplexa  
**0:34:58-0:35:07:**  and they're all hickory wattle they grow quite well but I haven't been I was overly pleased  
**0:35:07-0:35:15:**  with them so I'll probably take some of those out and they'll make a very nice furniture  
**0:35:15-0:35:26:**  grade timber and I'll probably take out some sugar gums sugar gums eucalyptus cladecalyx  
**0:35:26-0:35:33:**  and very hard timber very dense timber actually originally came from a very small part of  
**0:35:33-0:35:45:**  Australia over in South Australia and they're but grow in much drier areas historically  
**0:35:45-0:35:55:**  than here and so they have grown amazingly well and so I think probably in the next five  
**0:35:55-0:36:00:**  years or so some of those will definitely be you know commercial grade in terms of be  
**0:36:00-0:36:12:**  able to take them out and use them for various uses the the only downside of sugar gums is  
**0:36:12-0:36:18:**  that it is a very heavy timber so for furniture you know if you're making furniture out of  
**0:36:18-0:36:24:**  it you end up with whatever you're making is really heavy like if you make if you make  
**0:36:24-0:36:30:**  a table out of it you know you need like three people to lift it so that's probably the only  
**0:36:30-0:36:39:**  downside otherwise you know I yeah to me I quite like a heavy table so but yeah sometimes  
**0:36:39-0:36:44:**  we will say oh you know that's a bit of a downside but you know it's a it's a class  
**0:36:44-0:36:51:**  one grade timber so you can you know use it use it in the ground if you want to use it  
**0:36:51-0:36:59:**  in the ground won't you've got a 50-year life in the ground so you know it has a huge number  
**0:36:59-0:37:05:**  of uses but you know I guess I'll be focusing on what are the high value uses I can get  
**0:37:05-0:37:14:**  out of it and yeah I think there's there's some some furniture possibilities definitely  
**0:37:14-0:37:19:**  so this would be to collaborate with local artisans again this would be you producing  
**0:37:19-0:37:26:**  the furniture yourself no no I'll and again depends on how we set it up depends on whether  
**0:37:26-0:37:36:**  I take it down and mill it certainly you know I think if you want a reasonable value for  
**0:37:36-0:37:44:**  your timber you've got to mill it if just selling selling logs selling logs on a small  
**0:37:44-0:37:51:**  scale yeah you'll never get that to work from a financial perspective so so you do have  
**0:37:51-0:38:00:**  to mill it and you know it's I have access to a swing blade saw so that's typically what  
**0:38:00-0:38:10:**  I use but for furniture grade timber possibly a bandsaw would be better but you know let's  
**0:38:10-0:38:17:**  not have that debate now because there's huge forums where people argue about one sort of  
**0:38:17-0:38:24:**  saw being better than another yeah and it's it's a bit beyond my mind I'm not super familiar  
**0:38:24-0:38:30:**  with the different ways of harvesting wood and actually even the forestry aspects this  
**0:38:30-0:38:34:**  is not so specialized in it I'm sure there's a lot of podcasts that are very specialized  
**0:38:34-0:38:38:**  in this though and there's some there could be some can maybe give a few recommendations  
**0:38:38-0:38:42:**  afterwards but you know for me I'm seeing it more from a strategic point of view when  
**0:38:42-0:38:46:**  you're telling me you know I need to get these saws you know and it's that means that you  
**0:38:46-0:38:51:**  need to have the infrastructure locally either on your farm which means you need to buy it  
**0:38:51-0:38:55:**  which may be a very high cost based on your small scale or you need to have it regionally  
**0:38:55-0:38:59:**  available so you can rent it or use it or you know take it off a mate or something in  
**0:38:59-0:39:05:**  order to so what's how are you managing that yourself do you have it on farm no I don't  
**0:39:05-0:39:14:**  have it on farm I borrow it from a mate who does a lot more of it than I do the yeah and  
**0:39:14-0:39:23:**  I think so yeah you don't have to own everything you know from my perspective I think from  
**0:39:23-0:39:28:**  from a farming perspective the things that you really need to own are those things that  
**0:39:28-0:39:35:**  are time urgent like you know really weather dependent and you know when it needs to be  
**0:39:35-0:39:42:**  done it needs to be done now sort of thing and you know in that situation contractors  
**0:39:42-0:39:46:**  are problematic because they're off doing a job somewhere else and you know you join  
**0:39:46-0:39:54:**  the queue and whatever so you end up with a suboptimal result and even typically in  
**0:39:54-0:39:58:**  an area you can't really borrow from someone else because if it's optimal time for you  
**0:39:58-0:40:05:**  it's optimal time for them as well so there's a small amount of equipment that I think you  
**0:40:05-0:40:12:**  have to have you have to own but other than that I think yeah particularly as the properties  
**0:40:12-0:40:19:**  as you probably get smaller it becomes difficult to justify that sort of expenditure yeah it  
**0:40:19-0:40:26:**  makes sense and so what about the the drying as well because I have I have read Rowan Reid's  
**0:40:26-0:40:35:**  book on on how to manage a high quality timber and it was very instructive for me as a very  
**0:40:35-0:40:40:**  having very basic knowledge on on on the subject and I and it was fascinating to see how he  
**0:40:40-0:40:46:**  the technicalities of drying wood right how everything seems to be able to go wrong yes  
**0:40:46-0:40:52:**  with drying wood so I'm curious do you also have a kiln do you how do you dry the wood  
**0:40:52-0:40:56:**  and maintain like you know the quality that you're that you're you're trying to get yeah  
**0:40:56-0:41:05:**  so I aired right so I don't kiln dry it so you probably end up with a bit more wastage  
**0:41:05-0:41:15:**  I was really surprised with the black wattle how little wastage we had is that so you know  
**0:41:15-0:41:23:**  we we ended up with very small amounts of end checking so that's cracking from the ends  
**0:41:23-0:41:35:**  and and dimensionally it was great in terms of you know when it dried it basically dried  
**0:41:35-0:41:44:**  in all the dimensions obviously you know it dries out faster radially than it does through  
**0:41:44-0:41:51:**  the ends but it dimensionally stayed very very stable and I'll be interested to see  
**0:41:51-0:41:58:**  what happens with some of my other trees I did mill up a brown stringy bark at the time  
**0:41:58-0:42:11:**  and it yeah it didn't perform particularly well and so if if it looks like and I'll do  
**0:42:11-0:42:17:**  the same thing again I'll just do a trial and if that works and I can get away with  
**0:42:17-0:42:25:**  air drying then I'll air dry if I can't air dry then there is a kiln which is about I  
**0:42:25-0:42:30:**  don't know 20 kilometers from me which is available commercially so you can actually  
**0:42:30-0:42:39:**  book time in it and I would do that yeah but you know if I can air dry I'll air dry yeah  
**0:42:39-0:42:45:**  so that it makes it means that it's quite it's quite easy for you to in terms of infrastructure  
**0:42:45-0:42:50:**  with the with the with the mill close by that you can you can rent off it's quite a it's  
**0:42:50-0:42:56:**  quite an easy condition for you to be able to process on farm and to be able to sell  
**0:42:56-0:43:01:**  directly to your local community around I guess the other advantage is that I'm very  
**0:43:01-0:43:07:**  close to a large population center and so you know one of one of the issues typically  
**0:43:07-0:43:12:**  associated with timber or any agricultural produce really is that you know if you're  
**0:43:12-0:43:20:**  a long way from the market then you know that then then you lose value essentially because  
**0:43:20-0:43:25:**  you've got to transport it and organize it and all the rest of it so being close to a  
**0:43:25-0:43:33:**  large population center is is pretty helpful do you also prune the the the trees do you  
**0:43:33-0:43:40:**  have to quite intimately manage them to be able to get some nice logs so yes yeah they  
**0:43:40-0:43:52:**  do require pruning and I high pruned three years ago to about six meters and I think  
**0:43:52-0:44:01:**  I'll go a bit higher I think I might even take it out to nine meters and and the the  
**0:44:01-0:44:08:**  the magic number about six of course is that our standard lumber dimension is six meters  
**0:44:08-0:44:16:**  fits into a 20-foot container it's probably pretty standard across the globe but I went  
**0:44:16-0:44:22:**  and visited someone who is very high pruning they were going they were hoping to get to  
**0:44:22-0:44:29:**  12 meters which would give them to six meter length but they they had quite a few trees  
**0:44:29-0:44:34:**  which were at nine meters which they were taking out and they said look a three meter  
**0:44:34-0:44:41:**  log is actually very very saleable and so because yeah there's a lot of things that  
**0:44:41-0:44:50:**  don't need something longer than three meters so you know what why why grow if you can grow  
**0:44:50-0:44:56:**  that extra three meters basically for a little bit of pruning effort then why wouldn't you  
**0:44:56-0:45:03:**  I recently had a conversation with last week actually with an Italian farmer who has also  
**0:45:03-0:45:12:**  30 hectares and he's planted five hectares of a specific forestry design which is called  
**0:45:12-0:45:17:**  polycyclic forestry and there's an organization in Italy that's developing this doing a lot  
**0:45:17-0:45:21:**  of research on it and it's basically mixing multiple species together and harvesting them  
**0:45:21-0:45:28:**  at specific times it's a diverse diverse forestry project with trees having multiple functions  
**0:45:28-0:45:34:**  right in terms of shaping the the more long-term species and you know self-prune helping them  
**0:45:34-0:45:40:**  to to have straight stems to prune to self-prune etc and what he was saying is you know he  
**0:45:40-0:45:45:**  was very happy with the profitability of it even though he was selling poplars to a company  
**0:45:45-0:45:49:**  that was just coming in and they were just harvesting a poplar it was one euro per centimeter  
**0:45:49-0:45:57:**  of diameter per poplar and the poplars were after 11 12 euros 11 12 years they were already  
**0:45:57-0:46:01:**  coming in to harvest them and he wants he wanted to grow his forestry and he wanted  
**0:46:01-0:46:06:**  to take over more of his land instead of having cereals having more and more forestry little  
**0:46:06-0:46:11:**  by little so I'm I'm curious of course different contexts different etc but I'm curious about  
**0:46:11-0:46:16:**  he was very happy about the profitability right and I'm curious in contrast to the conversation  
**0:46:16-0:46:20:**  we had a bit earlier on what what how do you how do you feel about the profitability of  
**0:46:20-0:46:24:**  your forestry is it something that you would say no this is a profitable enterprise or  
**0:46:24-0:46:29:**  is it something that you are doing for ecosystem services and for beauty and for for even just  
**0:46:29-0:46:33:**  different spiritual reasons that you that you brought up with a compliment an economic  
**0:46:33-0:46:40:**  compliment to try and cover some of the costs yeah but it's I think it's a bit of both you  
**0:46:40-0:46:47:**  know to some extent I was really pleased to get value out of the first pruning so the  
**0:46:47-0:46:57:**  first thing because for most people that's you know almost just the cost whereas I was  
**0:46:57-0:47:07:**  able to you know I've pretty much broke even so far and I still have six cubic meters of  
**0:47:07-0:47:14:**  timber to sell so you know for for you essentially for your first thinning to actually be able  
**0:47:14-0:47:20:**  to make money out of that I think that's that's a pretty good outcome now could I have I made  
**0:47:20-0:47:30:**  more out of the alternative use of that land probably but you know if I think about okay  
**0:47:30-0:47:40:**  for example running livestock I could have done more intensively but I think I got a  
**0:47:40-0:47:47:**  reasonable amount of livestock fodder out of those areas in any case and so I'd have  
**0:47:47-0:47:52:**  to weigh up the pros and cons and then there's the protection that they provide and therefore  
**0:47:52-0:48:02:**  your animals grow faster you know it's multifaceted and so you know I think I'm pleased with where  
**0:48:02-0:48:09:**  it is at the moment I think I think there'll be more value in the future as I get some  
**0:48:09-0:48:19:**  of these other timber species start coming online I've got some iron bark which is Eucalyptus  
**0:48:19-0:48:26:**  Tricarpa and I reckon they'll be ready for harvesting in about 10 years and another magnificent  
**0:48:26-0:48:33:**  timber very very hard you know you've got to drill it to be able to to nail it it's  
**0:48:33-0:48:42:**  it's but you know magnificent for you know outdoor decking outdoor furniture that sort  
**0:48:42-0:48:52:**  of thing because again it's a beautiful deep red colour so yeah it's you know it's it's  
**0:48:52-0:48:59:**  just like a natural for for outdoor furniture or you know an outdoor barbeque setting or  
**0:48:59-0:49:06:**  whatever and so I think again there will be a lot of value associated with that not just  
**0:49:06-0:49:13:**  selling the the tree as stumpage but okay let's you know talk with some of the people  
**0:49:13-0:49:18:**  who are going to produce the end products find out from them what sort of sized pieces  
**0:49:18-0:49:25:**  they're looking for and essentially you know milled to order and I think there'll be some  
**0:49:25-0:49:30:**  great value coming out of that. Interesting I like how you've also said that you know  
**0:49:30-0:49:35:**  it's multifaceted and it integrates the other activities of the farm right it integrates  
**0:49:35-0:49:40:**  the other also objectives your personal objectives the objectives of the farm it's it's a compliment  
**0:49:40-0:49:47:**  without being necessarily the an end in itself it's it's it's something that's it's part  
**0:49:47-0:49:51:**  of your ecosystem that you've created. And I think that's a good way to put it it is  
**0:49:51-0:49:58:**  part of the the ecosystem that we've created here and to some extent you know you can't  
**0:49:58-0:50:05:**  just pull out one piece and say well this is the value of that because you know it does  
**0:50:05-0:50:13:**  provide multiple benefits and and so it is it is more difficult to say oh well you know  
**0:50:13-0:50:17:**  this is the benefit from that because we got this piece of timber from it yeah but what  
**0:50:17-0:50:22:**  about all the other benefits that you got from that because you know it provides habitat  
**0:50:22-0:50:28:**  for eagles which then you know takes on the rabbits which means they don't create as big  
**0:50:28-0:50:33:**  a problem for your olive trees because they'll ring bark them and so you know how do you  
**0:50:33-0:50:40:**  put a value on that? I'm currently doing a masters in natural resource management and  
**0:50:40-0:50:44:**  but then it's basically an agroforestry masters at the University of Missouri and this is  
**0:50:44-0:50:48:**  what we're seeing right now is just you know how do you even just creating a scientific  
**0:50:48-0:50:54:**  study on agroforestry systems it costs 10 times more than a study comparing for this  
**0:50:54-0:50:59:**  type of fertilizer vs this type of fertilizer on a crop right or for example you know it's  
**0:50:59-0:51:07:**  it's it's a completely other type of of agricultural it's just very complex so they they have a  
**0:51:07-0:51:12:**  lot of problems to try and they they encounter a lot of of issues with you know trying to  
**0:51:12-0:51:19:**  create data on it it's quite it's quite challenging and it's just a parallel to what we're describing  
**0:51:19-0:51:25:**  here as well it's how do you put a value on on all of these these different services that  
**0:51:25-0:51:30:**  the trees provide but I'm zooming in a bit more now to the technical stuff you said you  
**0:51:30-0:51:34:**  had two types of plantations you had some of them that were on that were very close  
**0:51:34-0:51:38:**  together what did you say it was four by three yep and one of them which was eight by five  
**0:51:38-0:51:46:**  eight by five was olives and then I have what I call my tree crop area which is 15 by 15  
**0:51:46-0:51:54:**  so quite wide spacing and that's for timber production long term it'll be timber but I've  
**0:51:54-0:52:01:**  planted species there that it won't be my lifetime again I've planted them because they  
**0:52:01-0:52:10:**  produce multiple benefits even now so the sort of trees that are in there are oaks,  
**0:52:10-0:52:19:**  chestnuts, hazels just in defense amongst them and and some other exotics so pretty much  
**0:52:19-0:52:26:**  they're exotic species the advantage of that of course is that you know a lot of that is  
**0:52:26-0:52:34:**  really good pig food and so one of the opportunities I see is to run you know free-range organic  
**0:52:34-0:52:41:**  pigs and you know while the trees are growing and you know oaks are not known to to grow  
**0:52:41-0:52:50:**  quickly so yeah as I said we won't be milling them in my lifetime but I am managing them  
**0:52:50-0:52:58:**  on the basis that they'll be able to be harvested as timber at some point in the future so but  
**0:52:58-0:53:03:**  I get all these other products in the meantime yeah sorry you're not managing them for especially  
**0:53:03-0:53:09:**  nut production you're managing them more for timber production with the complement of chestnuts  
**0:53:09-0:53:15:**  or acorns hazels etc indeed although I have to say it depends a little bit on the tree  
**0:53:15-0:53:23:**  because the chestnut the chestnuts is a general rule yeah I really haven't lent themselves  
**0:53:23-0:53:30:**  to timber I have to say and so the oaks have the oaks of you know if you prune oaks that  
**0:53:30-0:53:36:**  yep they'll keep going up and I've got some sequoias and Himalayan cedars and things in  
**0:53:36-0:53:43:**  there as well but and they're definitely all being pruned for forestry timber production  
**0:53:43-0:53:52:**  at some point but you know again even those species produce great shade and habitat while  
**0:53:52-0:54:00:**  they're growing and the other advantages by high pruning is that it's really easy to get  
**0:54:00-0:54:04:**  equipment underneath so you know it's easy to run tractors and harvesters and that sort  
**0:54:04-0:54:13:**  of stuff because the branches are you know after a few years are well up so yeah it has  
**0:54:13-0:54:19:**  has multiple benefits associated with that and I have to say at that sort of spacing  
**0:54:19-0:54:28:**  you can't tell any downgrade in the amount of grass production that you get is that I  
**0:54:28-0:54:34:**  would say it's as much possibly more because you know you get all the mycorrhizal fungi  
**0:54:34-0:54:42:**  and other things happening symbiotic relationships and yeah so as a result it's almost like you  
**0:54:42-0:54:49:**  know it hasn't cost you anything in terms of production and yet you get all these other  
**0:54:49-0:54:55:**  benefits and it gives me the opportunity to you know potentially run pigs in the future  
**0:54:55-0:55:03:**  or whatever and then I can raise acorn or chestnut raised pigs so you know I think that  
**0:55:03-0:55:12:**  there's multiple opportunities there and you know chestnuts of course you can sell outright.  
**0:55:12-0:55:16:**  Wow that's fantastic you really make me want to visit your farm because I'm inviting myself  
**0:55:16-0:55:26:**  here if you'll notice because it's I regularly do that with guests.  
**0:55:26-0:55:30:**  I get too excited and I just tell people I want to come and visit them.  
**0:55:30-0:55:34:**  Yeah no absolutely I'd be happy to.  
**0:55:34-0:55:39:**  Because it looks so diverse it seems like there's so much to learn from that you know  
**0:55:39-0:55:44:**  especially this grass I mean when we're looking at the silver pastoral you know tending towards  
**0:55:44-0:55:47:**  more silver pastoral system as opposed to a more forestry system as we've discussed  
**0:55:47-0:55:51:**  before the interaction between the trees and the grass is absolutely fascinating.  
**0:55:51-0:55:57:**  I'm working in the context now where there's a so in Portugal in the montado which is these  
**0:55:57-0:56:06:**  very old large home and cork oak trees and they the grass underneath the oaks is much  
**0:56:06-0:56:12:**  like twice the size of the grass in the open and you know trying to understand the reasons  
**0:56:12-0:56:17:**  for that is interesting and there can be multiple and we're talking a lot about this with Francisco  
**0:56:17-0:56:23:**  who's also a guest from the podcast from before I think episode 26 and yeah it's you know  
**0:56:23-0:56:30:**  there is a real interaction with these native grasses there and the oak trees and grass  
**0:56:30-0:56:36:**  grows better after grazing the grass responds faster even when he's putting when there's  
**0:56:36-0:56:44:**  a lot of blackberries underneath the oaks and he puts the goats there is like twice  
**0:56:44-0:56:49:**  the recovery is twice as fast underneath the oak trees even though we could say competition  
**0:56:49-0:56:55:**  light water you have to share water between each other etc etc you know what you see is  
**0:56:55-0:57:03:**  you see a darker green grass larger stems you see taller grass and you see faster response  
**0:57:03-0:57:09:**  after grazing it's in a time of drought that's quite fascinating and the trees are some of  
**0:57:09-0:57:16:**  them are 200 years old 150 years old mostly so it's quite quite quite inspiring to see  
**0:57:16-0:57:20:**  and there's not many of them there's not too you know there's only about maybe of these  
**0:57:20-0:57:25:**  large tree maybe 20 per hectare you know yeah and yeah and of course some of the speed  
**0:57:25-0:57:32:**  species and I've noticed that particularly around you know some of the acacias because  
**0:57:32-0:57:41:**  they pump nitrogen into the soil because they're leguminous and yeah the grass just yeah if  
**0:57:41-0:57:46:**  there's enough moisture there the grass will grow really really well grows much faster  
**0:57:46-0:57:53:**  the sheep will preferentially eat it and yeah so again you gotta say well you know that's  
**0:57:53-0:57:58:**  basically free nitrogen that you're getting that's being incorporated into the soil and  
**0:57:58-0:58:04:**  so yeah there is a lot of a lot of benefits associated with that and interestingly you  
**0:58:04-0:58:15:**  know to your point is that you know the grass will like die off in it or dry off other parts  
**0:58:15-0:58:22:**  first and last underneath the trees and you know I've been thinking about that and you  
**0:58:22-0:58:26:**  know is it because they got better because you'd think that they'd be competing for the  
**0:58:26-0:58:31:**  water and everything is drying off so you sort of think well how come in an area where  
**0:58:31-0:58:37:**  you would think there'd be a lot more competition in terms of for water that is doing so much  
**0:58:37-0:58:45:**  better and you know I think there's a few things going on but I've noticed you know  
**0:58:45-0:58:53:**  that the grass drives off much less in the shade of the trees so certainly when you get  
**0:58:53-0:58:58:**  that harsh winter summer sun I actually think there's a drying effect so it's essentially  
**0:58:58-0:59:05:**  creating a microclimate and I personally think that's very very significant in terms of the  
**0:59:05-0:59:11:**  impact that slows the wind down so you don't get the same drying effect so you know I think  
**0:59:11-0:59:17:**  some of that has got to do with it as well. Yeah and there could be a multiple multitude  
**0:59:17-0:59:24:**  of other explanations in terms of hydraulic lift, improved organic matter and you know  
**0:59:24-0:59:34:**  soil moisture absorption yeah it's nearly too crazy to think about it hurts the brain  
**0:59:34-0:59:38:**  but it's amazing to observe because we just also need to we can observe the results and  
**0:59:38-0:59:42:**  we can take you know management decisions based on the results without understanding  
**0:59:42-0:59:47:**  all the mechanisms behind it we see greener grass, taller grass and we see longer periods  
**0:59:47-0:59:51:**  of time grass it's this is the observation we need to make decisions not necessarily  
**0:59:51-0:59:56:**  understanding all of the tiny little details underneath it as intellectually interesting  
**0:59:56-1:00:02:**  as that may be. Yeah and I think sometimes I think that's important as a practitioner  
**1:00:02-1:00:10:**  is that you observe something you can try and guess what is going on but at the end  
**1:00:10-1:00:16:**  of the day it doesn't really matter what matters is the outcome and so via observation  
**1:00:16-1:00:21:**  you say well this is the set of circumstances this is what happens and therefore we need  
**1:00:21-1:00:25:**  more of that. I mean I would like to talk a lot like we could talk a lot more about  
**1:00:25-1:00:30:**  this kind of silver partial system but I wanted to shift gear a bit because I really wanted  
**1:00:30-1:00:35:**  to talk to you about two more topics and one of them is the key line pattern that you used  
**1:00:35-1:00:41:**  in your olive orchard and the reason is that you know when we're looking at agroforestry  
**1:00:41-1:00:46:**  and planting trees one of the big topics is you know how do you orient trees you know  
**1:00:46-1:00:52:**  and how do you what direction and how do you organize the tree lines whether it be forestry  
**1:00:52-1:00:57:**  whether it be an orchard whether it be a silver pastoral system this is a key topic and actually  
**1:00:57-1:01:02:**  finding somebody that has done that and had 20 years of feedback on you know a key line  
**1:01:02-1:01:06:**  pattern or maybe it's less I'm not too sure when you planted the orchard exactly but that's  
**1:01:06-1:01:11:**  quite unique and special so I'm sure you have quite a bit of feedback to provide on that  
**1:01:11-1:01:18:**  and you know to kick it off maybe you could kind of explain to us how you came about planting  
**1:01:18-1:01:23:**  a key line pattern you know where did you get the idea from how did what's the story  
**1:01:23-1:01:32:**  behind the key line design yeah okay so I right back at the design stage I work closely  
**1:01:32-1:01:39:**  with a guy by the name of Darren Doherty who runs in our runs the Regerians platform but  
**1:01:39-1:01:46:**  this was way way before then and you know Darren would have to be one of the global  
**1:01:46-1:01:55:**  authorities on key line design and you know he's a bit of a master of water in the landscape  
**1:01:55-1:02:06:**  and you know essentially we worked on coming up with a design that would work on based  
**1:02:06-1:02:14:**  on key line principles and you know basically in terms of the practical implementation of  
**1:02:14-1:02:24:**  that is that you end up with your rows of trees just off contour yeah so and as a result  
**1:02:24-1:02:30:**  not only is that the olive grove but all the forestry was done on that basis and the silvopast  
**1:02:30-1:02:36:**  well the agroforestry in the silvopasture it's done exactly the same way and including  
**1:02:36-1:02:46:**  the home orchard so and it works it works well now I've seen some research that talks  
**1:02:46-1:02:55:**  about olive trees in terms of you know running the rows north south versus east west yeah  
**1:02:55-1:02:59:**  you know and if you run them north south and you know you get slightly higher production  
**1:02:59-1:03:07:**  than if you run them east west and yet ours because of the the landscape and the key line  
**1:03:07-1:03:14:**  system essentially ours run east west but you know I think you've got to be there's  
**1:03:14-1:03:19:**  research and there's research you really need to be careful about what people have actually  
**1:03:19-1:03:26:**  studied and get into the nitty-gritty to understand what the conclusions might mean yeah because  
**1:03:26-1:03:33:**  yeah most of the research that's been done in this area has been on high density irrigated  
**1:03:33-1:03:44:**  trees so you know very close spacing of rows so a lot more shading and as a result you  
**1:03:44-1:03:51:**  know if for example we'd gone to a five by five meter grid then you wouldn't know whether  
**1:03:51-1:03:57:**  it was north south or east west because it would look the same regardless so because  
**1:03:57-1:04:05:**  our rows are eight meters apart so it's an eight by five in actual fact we've overcompensated  
**1:04:05-1:04:11:**  potentially for the fact that you know the rows run east west and therefore will not  
**1:04:11-1:04:19:**  shade the subsequent row and you know because of the contours of the landscape I have some  
**1:04:19-1:04:28:**  trees which run fairly close to north south and those that run almost pure east west and  
**1:04:28-1:04:34:**  looked at the production over a period of time and I can't see a discernible difference  
**1:04:34-1:04:35:**  based on that.  
**1:04:35-1:04:39:**  No I just wanted to say to listeners because it can be quite confusing when we're talking  
**1:04:39-1:04:44:**  about key line pattern and etc I mean Campbell and I are familiar with it from the Regrarian's  
**1:04:44-1:04:49:**  platform which is by the way a fantastic resource for anything regenerative agriculture highly  
**1:04:49-1:04:55:**  advised people joining and checking out what's happening there but also go on Google and  
**1:04:55-1:04:59:**  type in key line pattern to get a bit of an understanding visually of what it is because  
**1:04:59-1:05:04:**  then you'll be able to visualize more the kind of pattern in which the olive trees of  
**1:05:04-1:05:08:**  Campbell are planted so it's definitely something very visual and you'll understand it much  
**1:05:08-1:05:13:**  more by just checking out one or two Google photos there so that's just a little notice  
**1:05:13-1:05:14:**  on the side.  
**1:05:14-1:05:17:**  Sorry for interrupting you Campbell.  
**1:05:17-1:05:22:**  No no not at all probably the only other thing I should talk about while we're talking about  
**1:05:22-1:05:30:**  key line design and the way in which we set the property up is that and this is something  
**1:05:30-1:05:36:**  that Darren would not do now because I've had subsequent conversations with him is that  
**1:05:36-1:05:45:**  we did actually deep rip and mound when we planted the olive trees and you know all the  
**1:05:45-1:05:56:**  agroforestry blocks and essentially and I subsequently put in a plot with without deep  
**1:05:56-1:06:08:**  ripping and mounding of eucalypts so I have a bit of a comparison and you know my experience  
**1:06:08-1:06:15:**  with the deep ripping is that yes it does help the trees establish early and therefore  
**1:06:15-1:06:19:**  they tend to grow faster at the start.  
**1:06:19-1:06:26:**  I reckon that's up to about five years at ten years very little difference.  
**1:06:26-1:06:34:**  Now everyone deep rips but you know and if you have a hard pan or a hard layer somewhere  
**1:06:34-1:06:39:**  in there you know that may be justified but I'd hate to think that people thought well  
**1:06:39-1:06:46:**  I'm not going to plant trees because you know I can't deep rip it for xyz reasons because  
**1:06:46-1:06:53:**  I think that given time and this is certainly with eucalypts at least they do tend to catch  
**1:06:53-1:06:59:**  up but yeah you get much faster establishment I have no doubt about that.  
**1:06:59-1:07:10:**  The other interesting question is around mounding or I think they call them swales in permaculture  
**1:07:10-1:07:15:**  is that and again Darren says that if he was doing this design now he wouldn't recommend  
**1:07:15-1:07:16:**  it.  
**1:07:16-1:07:22:**  From my point of view I think the jury's still out particularly where you've got a keyline  
**1:07:22-1:07:33:**  design and the reason I say that is that we're getting much more intense rainfall so even  
**1:07:33-1:07:41:**  if we end up with the same amount of rain is that when we get rain it is much more intense.  
**1:07:41-1:07:46:**  So we had a thunderstorm recently about a bit over a month ago because it hasn't rained  
**1:07:46-1:07:56:**  in the last month and we got 50 millimeters in 50 minutes and most of my soil I have to  
**1:07:56-1:08:01:**  say most of my soil has an infiltration rate greater than that so most of it will have  
**1:08:01-1:08:09:**  soaked in but I have some areas where the infiltration rate is lower than that and then  
**1:08:09-1:08:21:**  you end up with runoff and the advantage of having the mounds there is that it only runs  
**1:08:21-1:08:27:**  to the next row essentially and then it just slowly travels along the row and if you slow  
**1:08:27-1:08:29:**  it down it'll soak in.  
**1:08:29-1:08:38:**  So in that 50 millimeter event the only runoff I had was from hard standing areas.  
**1:08:38-1:08:44:**  Off the tree crops, off the olives, not a drop.  
**1:08:44-1:08:47:**  Interesting very interesting.  
**1:08:47-1:08:48:**  How big are the mounds?  
**1:08:48-1:08:57:**  So they're not large they're probably versus the adjacent area of course they've settled  
**1:08:57-1:09:09:**  over 20 years they're probably 100 mill 150 mill high so not particularly high but it's  
**1:09:09-1:09:12:**  enough it's just enough.  
**1:09:12-1:09:16:**  I wouldn't hardly consider that a mound because when you see the mounds that they're planting  
**1:09:16-1:09:22:**  in Europe for example in southern Europe I mean when just at planting so young trees  
**1:09:22-1:09:29:**  they're nearly 40 50 centimeter high or more sometimes like they really make them out.  
**1:09:29-1:09:37:**  Wow yeah yeah and I struggle to understand the reason for that and I'm still I'm investigating  
**1:09:37-1:09:42:**  and I'm gonna I'm gonna try work it out but is it for herbicide application it's just  
**1:09:42-1:09:47:**  easier to just spray on the sides to keep it clean is it you know we're talking about  
**1:09:47-1:09:54:**  super intensive conventional here so not the traditional plantation orchards so but I was  
**1:09:54-1:09:57:**  trying to understand the reason for the mounting but yeah so that mound is like it's a minimal  
**1:09:57-1:10:01:**  disturbance and it's also a minimal impact on you know applying mulch on the tree line  
**1:10:01-1:10:06:**  if that is a you know a technique so it's interesting.  
**1:10:06-1:10:15:**  For me when I think about key line and as a tree farmer it's having changes in the in  
**1:10:15-1:10:21:**  in straight instead of having a straight line having like a zigzag or curves just seems  
**1:10:21-1:10:29:**  to be challenging in terms of you know machinery driving the tractor any you know spraying  
**1:10:29-1:10:33:**  as well how do you feel about is it you know do you feel like it's worth it in terms of  
**1:10:33-1:10:38:**  the water management improvement in your context is it something that you would if you were  
**1:10:38-1:10:42:**  to do it again would you would you apply a once more a key line kind of pattern or would  
**1:10:42-1:10:46:**  you go with straight lines I'm very curious.  
**1:10:46-1:10:56:**  Yeah so the key line I would do a key line again I don't find it a big problem with the  
**1:10:56-1:11:02:**  tractor because you end up with parallel rows it's not as if the rows are not parallel and  
**1:11:02-1:11:12:**  I think that's fairly important and yeah I think the way Darren designed it is that you  
**1:11:12-1:11:17:**  know that you don't have the rows wandering all over the place doing their own thing is  
**1:11:17-1:11:25:**  that the rows are parallel yes they do contour around and but you know when you're spraying  
**1:11:25-1:11:34:**  or mulching or whatever if you've got parallel rows and you know you don't have tight turns  
**1:11:34-1:11:44:**  then it's it's not really an issue I think probably a bigger issue is things like fences  
**1:11:44-1:11:51:**  because they by definition almost they like to be strung in a straight line and you know  
**1:11:51-1:11:58:**  once you're putting lots of turns in them but I use a lot of temporary fencing electric  
**1:11:58-1:12:07:**  fencing so we're not straining up big distances of wire and in fact you know basically have  
**1:12:07-1:12:13:**  very few permanent fences on the place because yeah that just gives me the flexibility to  
**1:12:13-1:12:21:**  run the stock where I want to in the density that I want to so you know I think having  
**1:12:21-1:12:29:**  flexible fencing but I would have thought that would be a much bigger issue than you  
**1:12:29-1:12:36:**  know agricultural machinery the fact that you got parallel rows negates a lot of the  
**1:12:36-1:12:38:**  downsides.  
**1:12:38-1:12:44:**  That's interesting and you've seen a noticeable improvement in water infiltration especially  
**1:12:44-1:12:49:**  I mean the challenge is often in the first years when you're establishing the orchard  
**1:12:49-1:12:54:**  there's a lot of disturbance happening often you're starting with quite degraded soil so  
**1:12:54-1:12:59:**  less infiltration what's your feedback on what can you tell us on the impact on the  
**1:12:59-1:13:03:**  water management which is the original let's say that's the purpose of the technique right?  
**1:13:03-1:13:10:**  Yeah yeah absolutely and I think definitely at the start it was absolutely critical is  
**1:13:10-1:13:15:**  that I think I mentioned earlier is that you know the from the almost from the day that  
**1:13:15-1:13:22:**  we planted the trees we were into the millennium drought and didn't rain significantly for  
**1:13:22-1:13:28:**  about eight years and but again when we did get rain it was quite intense you'd end up  
**1:13:28-1:13:38:**  with a big thunderstorm and I actually think it was that key line design that actually  
**1:13:38-1:13:43:**  ensured that many of the trees survived I think many of them would not have survived  
**1:13:43-1:13:49:**  without that arrangement because yeah because the soil I have to say the soil was definitely  
**1:13:49-1:13:56:**  not optimal you know it was quite hard it had been hard packed it had been set stocked  
**1:13:56-1:14:02:**  you know really it wasn't in great condition and so now with with the infiltration that  
**1:14:02-1:14:08:**  we have now in most places yeah it probably it probably doesn't matter Darren is probably  
**1:14:08-1:14:15:**  right it probably doesn't matter and you know even having that small mound you could probably  
**1:14:15-1:14:23:**  do away with in some areas you'd probably still get some value from it but at the start  
**1:14:23-1:14:27:**  you know you haven't improved your soil you haven't built the soil depth you don't get  
**1:14:27-1:14:37:**  that sort of infiltration from day one and so you either spend three years probably really  
**1:14:37-1:14:44:**  improving your soil getting infiltration you know using some you know intensive grazing  
**1:14:44-1:14:51:**  moving often that sort of thing really setting your soil up and probably spending three years  
**1:14:51-1:14:58:**  in which to do that and then planting yep that that might be a viable alternative but  
**1:14:58-1:15:04:**  of course you've lost three years of growth if you're ultimately looking for you know  
**1:15:04-1:15:08:**  some sort of trade crop and I think also it's important to remember that there's context  
**1:15:08-1:15:15:**  and context a context with a bit more rainfall and a high a very poor infiltration soil you  
**1:15:15-1:15:21:**  may be reaping the benefits of a key line pattern plus mounds for example for many more  
**1:15:21-1:15:26:**  years as you are seeing with some of your more degraded areas where still you're seeing  
**1:15:26-1:15:31:**  that the mounds are holding back the water and are you know infiltrating or allowing  
**1:15:31-1:15:37:**  the water to infiltrate into the landscape slower and not run off so that's also it's  
**1:15:37-1:15:44:**  also an interesting observation what is the difference between in your opinion between  
**1:15:44-1:15:53:**  the using a mound and ripping for example you know using a let's say we use the the  
**1:15:53-1:15:59:**  ripper that is recommended by Darren the the key line plow and you would you would rip  
**1:15:59-1:16:06:**  in between the tree lines at strategic points you know at the start of the winter to allow  
**1:16:06-1:16:11:**  for infiltration maybe once a year twice a year as compared to a mound what's your what's  
**1:16:11-1:16:17:**  your take on this I think it would come back to the context in terms of that there's a  
**1:16:17-1:16:25:**  lot of things that are associated with ripping that you know there's potentially some downsides  
**1:16:25-1:16:33:**  associated with that but for those soils that have a compacted hard pan particularly if  
**1:16:33-1:16:41:**  they've been cropped for a long period of time then quite often you get both a chemical  
**1:16:41-1:16:50:**  and physical hard pan and yeah you can grow daikon radish and other plants that will eventually  
**1:16:50-1:16:57:**  break that up but I think it is a bit of a speed thing is that you can you know go through  
**1:16:57-1:17:07:**  with a key lime plow and get you know pretty much instant results but you know you've got  
**1:17:07-1:17:16:**  to follow that up with you know various approaches you know multi-species cropping or whatever  
**1:17:16-1:17:21:**  otherwise the soil will tend to tend to revert somewhat so you know it means that you've  
**1:17:21-1:17:27:**  got to keep doing it and ultimately I think you'd want to have your soil set up so that  
**1:17:27-1:17:32:**  you didn't have to keep doing it every time you do it you know you're disturbing your  
**1:17:32-1:17:38:**  mycorrhizal fungi and yeah and I know with the key line it's not a huge amount of disturbance  
**1:17:38-1:17:47:**  but underneath like you know it's your tines are like 30 or 60 centimetres apart so you  
**1:17:47-1:17:53:**  are ripping through those mycorrhizal threads every time you're doing that and you know  
**1:17:53-1:17:57:**  is that the best thing that you can be doing for your soil there's a lot worse things you  
**1:17:57-1:18:04:**  could be doing but again I think there's other ways of achieving that and you know right  
**1:18:04-1:18:12:**  at the start it may make sense to get back to your question is it better than doing mounds  
**1:18:12-1:18:18:**  possibly the advantage of mounds is that and you know I'm not necessarily a huge advocate  
**1:18:18-1:18:25:**  I think definitely context but I guess I have seen the benefits of them over a period of  
**1:18:25-1:18:26:**  time.  
**1:18:26-1:18:34:**  It seems like the mounds would be also a more sensitive soil sensitive approach to allowing  
**1:18:34-1:18:38:**  infiltration as compared to regularly ripping for 20 years.  
**1:18:38-1:18:44:**  Yeah and yeah and to some extent you know part of the reason we like mounded is that  
**1:18:44-1:18:54:**  and this wasn't a huge mound but you know again we wanted to you know provide a nice  
**1:18:54-1:19:02:**  bed for to plant the trees into and to stop some of that grass competition that you would  
**1:19:02-1:19:08:**  have when you're looking for establishment and so to some extent that's the advantage  
**1:19:08-1:19:13:**  of doing the mound is that you end up with you know a nice area to get your tree into  
**1:19:13-1:19:19:**  and get it established before it has to start competing with you know some of the allopathic  
**1:19:19-1:19:20:**  grasses.  
**1:19:20-1:19:26:**  Yeah I was watching some videos on raguerins of yours, no it wasn't it was on your Instagram  
**1:19:26-1:19:31:**  and it seemed that you are in quite a windy place like sometimes the olive trees are shaking  
**1:19:31-1:19:32:**  a lot.  
**1:19:32-1:19:37:**  I know as well on your on your land that you've got a lot of windbreaks and or at least a  
**1:19:37-1:19:41:**  few windbreaks and I wanted to discuss a bit with you your experience with these windbreaks.  
**1:19:41-1:19:51:**  Yeah so in terms of wind yes it is quite windy and you know partly evidenced by the fact  
**1:19:51-1:19:59:**  that we have five wind farms that are located probably within about five kilometers of us.  
**1:19:59-1:20:11:**  So yeah because we're in an elevated area we do get a fair amount of wind and that seems  
**1:20:11-1:20:22:**  to be increasing both in terms of probably wind speed more than anything and so you know  
**1:20:22-1:20:30:**  for example in the last six months our local power company has indicated that they believe  
**1:20:30-1:20:37:**  they've had two one in a hundred year events in the last six months.  
**1:20:37-1:20:44:**  Now so that's versus you know versus history.  
**1:20:44-1:20:49:**  Clearly they're not a one in a hundred year event if you get two in six months yet statistically  
**1:20:49-1:20:54:**  yes you can get two in six months and they both won in a hundred year events but it's  
**1:20:54-1:21:02:**  unlikely and so you know things are changing and so yeah our wind speed is increasing.  
**1:21:02-1:21:10:**  I have to say it was quite windy when we were here at the start and we actually grew quite  
**1:21:10-1:21:14:**  a lot of trees around the house and the sheds and those sorts of things just to reduce that  
**1:21:14-1:21:22:**  wind speed and that's been incredibly successful because we've got an anaerometer next to the  
**1:21:22-1:21:31:**  house and we had wind gusts here getting close to 140 kilometers an hour when we first got  
**1:21:31-1:21:42:**  here and we haven't had anything over about 75 kilometers an hour more recently and yet  
**1:21:42-1:21:49:**  the local power authority would say that you know we've had worse winds than some time  
**1:21:49-1:21:51:**  in the last hundred years.  
**1:21:51-1:21:58:**  So certainly the number of trees and the way in which we've placed them has significantly  
**1:21:58-1:22:02:**  decreased the wind speed on this property.  
**1:22:02-1:22:11:**  It doesn't mean that we don't have wind damage and you know we've lost quite a few trees  
**1:22:11-1:22:12:**  in the agroforestry.  
**1:22:12-1:22:21:**  To some extent soon after we thinned we had a bit of a windstorm come through and you  
**1:22:21-1:22:27:**  know you end up with tall spindly trees which are really exposed to the wind they are much  
**1:22:27-1:22:29:**  more likely to snap.  
**1:22:29-1:22:36:**  The dynamics of a tree with all the lower branches cut off it is much more likely to  
**1:22:36-1:22:42:**  snap and so we've lost quite a number I'd know maybe 20 or 30 brown stringy barks in  
**1:22:42-1:22:47:**  particular which seem to be quite prone to that.  
**1:22:47-1:22:55:**  But yeah the windbreaks that we've put in place again are a multi-species windbreak.  
**1:22:55-1:23:06:**  They typically have both larger trees and smaller trees right down to shrubs so and  
**1:23:06-1:23:12:**  you know we tried to get in as many places possible we'll get about three rows.  
**1:23:12-1:23:21:**  Ideally we'd have more but you know certainly at three rows you can get a really good mix  
**1:23:21-1:23:27:**  of species in there and really slow that wind down.  
**1:23:27-1:23:35:**  And you know I think windbreaks are a bit of a misconception is that you're not actually  
**1:23:35-1:23:36:**  trying to stop the wind.  
**1:23:36-1:23:43:**  You need about 40% of the wind to go through otherwise all you do is create turbulence  
**1:23:43-1:23:50:**  either around the sides or over the top and you actually increase the wind speed downwind  
**1:23:50-1:23:53:**  of the actual shelterbelt you've put in.  
**1:23:53-1:23:58:**  So you know without going into a huge amount of detail there is a bit in shelterbelt design  
**1:23:58-1:24:05:**  to make sure that you have some species in there that let the wind through but slow it  
**1:24:05-1:24:06:**  down.  
**1:24:06-1:24:12:**  And you know species that we've found really really helpful is casuarina.  
**1:24:12-1:24:21:**  They have been absolutely fantastic for you know really yeah they let the wind through  
**1:24:21-1:24:22:**  but they slow it down.  
**1:24:22-1:24:29:**  They've you know to some extent they've got leaves a bit like pine trees so they're needles  
**1:24:29-1:24:38:**  and been very very good for you know really slowing the wind down but not blocking it.  
**1:24:38-1:24:40:**  They've got fast growth as well don't they?  
**1:24:40-1:24:41:**  They do.  
**1:24:41-1:24:50:**  Again it comes back to you know how much water they can get but yeah they can grow very very  
**1:24:50-1:24:51:**  quickly.  
**1:24:51-1:24:57:**  They're often grown around vineyards and things like that because they grow very quickly,  
**1:24:57-1:25:06:**  they grow tall and they're great at slowing that wind down even as a single line of trees.  
**1:25:06-1:25:09:**  So how thick is your shelterbelt?  
**1:25:09-1:25:12:**  You said there's three lines and how far apart are the three lines?  
**1:25:12-1:25:15:**  Okay so they're four meters apart.  
**1:25:15-1:25:16:**  So that means you've got 12 meters.  
**1:25:16-1:25:20:**  Twelve meters and then you'd have some space to the fence.  
**1:25:20-1:25:24:**  I'd never recommend putting the trees right on the fence line.  
**1:25:24-1:25:29:**  So you want to give yourself some space there so you can access the fence, repair it, whatever.  
**1:25:29-1:25:32:**  So typically four meters there as well.  
**1:25:32-1:25:34:**  So you have four meters, four meters, four meters.  
**1:25:34-1:25:36:**  So yeah you're 12 meters.  
**1:25:36-1:25:39:**  Did you follow a specific design or did you just mix species together?  
**1:25:39-1:25:45:**  Was there some kind of one line of shrubs you know against the wind, then a medium tree,  
**1:25:45-1:25:47:**  then a taller tree?  
**1:25:47-1:25:50:**  Is there, do you have any more specifics that you could share with us?  
**1:25:50-1:25:58:**  Yeah so we didn't do it quite like that because depending on which shelterbelt we're talking  
**1:25:58-1:26:07:**  about but as a general rule although our prevailing wind direction comes out of the north, some  
**1:26:07-1:26:12:**  of these wind storms have actually come from other directions.  
**1:26:12-1:26:19:**  And so most of the shelterbelts actually have mixed species in each row.  
**1:26:19-1:26:25:**  So we really mixed it up in terms of what we wanted to reach row.  
**1:26:25-1:26:30:**  And I know you see classic textbooks which has the little shrubs on the outside and then  
**1:26:30-1:26:32:**  the bigger ones and then the tall trees.  
**1:26:32-1:26:36:**  That always assumes the wind's coming from exactly the same direction.  
**1:26:36-1:26:45:**  And I think yeah it looks great in a book but a farm's landscape is not a book and you  
**1:26:45-1:26:48:**  don't always have the wind blowing in the same direction.  
**1:26:48-1:26:56:**  And you know particularly those strong winds don't necessarily all come from the same direction.  
**1:26:56-1:27:01:**  Yeah we've got prominent northern winds in Greece but the strong winds come from the  
**1:27:01-1:27:02:**  south.  
**1:27:02-1:27:10:**  So the northern wind brings in salt that burns our trees, leaves, because it's in an island.  
**1:27:10-1:27:14:**  But the southern wind comes in with a lot of power and breaks branches.  
**1:27:14-1:27:19:**  So you've got to be working with both as an example to what you're seeing.  
**1:27:19-1:27:21:**  Yeah exactly, exactly.  
**1:27:21-1:27:30:**  So I think and given that particularly trees you're talking about a long term sort of once  
**1:27:30-1:27:35:**  you put it in it's not easy to change it sort of thing is that, unless you want to start  
**1:27:35-1:27:41:**  again, is that I think you've got to recognize that the climate changes, some of the things  
**1:27:41-1:27:45:**  that historically might have been true may not be true tomorrow.  
**1:27:45-1:27:54:**  And to build as much resilience into your system as you can and not assume that the  
**1:27:54-1:27:59:**  winds always gonna, the strong winds are always going to come from the same direction and  
**1:27:59-1:28:00:**  those sorts of things.  
**1:28:00-1:28:08:**  I think yeah we've got to recognize that the climate is changing and in ways in which we  
**1:28:08-1:28:13:**  don't understand and therefore the future is going to look different in ways which we  
**1:28:13-1:28:14:**  probably can't envisage.  
**1:28:14-1:28:20:**  And therefore I think building as much resilience into your systems as you can makes a lot of  
**1:28:20-1:28:21:**  sense.  
**1:28:21-1:28:25:**  Yeah for sure that makes a lot of sense.  
**1:28:25-1:28:28:**  I'm curious about the species that you chose for your windbreak.  
**1:28:28-1:28:32:**  Did you, what were the kind of the traits that you were trying to look for?  
**1:28:32-1:28:34:**  Was it fast growth?  
**1:28:34-1:28:35:**  Was it?  
**1:28:35-1:28:42:**  So part of that was around, really around a few different things is that again we're  
**1:28:42-1:28:49:**  looking for that diversity, that biodiversity.  
**1:28:49-1:28:58:**  So for example we've got some bursaries which is a really small spiky bush, has amazing  
**1:28:58-1:29:06:**  flowers quite heavily scented and it's just a magnet for butterflies for example and is  
**1:29:06-1:29:13:**  great for really good protection for small birds, wrens and those sorts of things.  
**1:29:13-1:29:21:**  So we had things, we wanted to have things like that that provided that sort of habitat.  
**1:29:21-1:29:24:**  We had some small spikier caches.  
**1:29:24-1:29:29:**  Again they didn't last terribly long, they only lasted about 10 years.  
**1:29:29-1:29:34:**  But again just providing that habitat and still some other stuff got up and growing.  
**1:29:34-1:29:43:**  So we had some fast growing acacias, not long lived just to give some initial protection  
**1:29:43-1:29:51:**  and then we had some taller trees, we even had some blue gums, so the old Eucalyptus  
**1:29:51-1:29:56:**  scolobulus, we had some of those, we have some of those in them.  
**1:29:56-1:30:01:**  So that really provides your height and your structure.  
**1:30:01-1:30:11:**  So again trying to get it to achieve multiple outcomes and so a lot of biodiversity there  
**1:30:11-1:30:17:**  and so a lot of different sorts of habitat for different sorts of bird species in particular  
**1:30:17-1:30:20:**  by doing that.  
**1:30:20-1:30:24:**  Very interesting, so there was definitely not just an objective of windbreak, there  
**1:30:24-1:30:31:**  was an objective of integrating functional biodiversity there and getting these to complement  
**1:30:31-1:30:33:**  your ecosystem.  
**1:30:33-1:30:40:**  Correct and again when you can do multiple things why would you just do something that's  
**1:30:40-1:30:41:**  only going to do one of them?  
**1:30:41-1:30:47:**  Is that there's a lot of different things you can achieve with this, why wouldn't you  
**1:30:47-1:30:48:**  try and maximize that?  
**1:30:48-1:30:54:**  So I expect that you and Darren were also connecting these shelter belts with the forestry  
**1:30:54-1:30:59:**  areas and creating a connected ecosystem matrix right?  
**1:30:59-1:31:03:**  I can only expect the best from both of you to be honest.  
**1:31:03-1:31:11:**  Yes so no absolutely is that just trying to connect everything up as much as possible  
**1:31:11-1:31:21:**  so that again it provides that biodiverse pathway that provides an environment for quite  
**1:31:21-1:31:24:**  a lot of your bird species in particular.  
**1:31:24-1:31:29:**  They don't have to cross a lot of open ground.  
**1:31:29-1:31:35:**  So yeah it's connecting it up in that way really makes a big difference.  
**1:31:35-1:31:40:**  And I think the other thing just in terms of diversity, the other thing is to think  
**1:31:40-1:31:46:**  about diversity like in terms of the sort of species that you're putting in because  
**1:31:46-1:31:51:**  to some extent you say well okay the logical thing to do would be to put in indigenous  
**1:31:51-1:31:59:**  species because then your indigenous birds and other wildlife are going to have something  
**1:31:59-1:32:04:**  which they can you know is part of their natural environment.  
**1:32:04-1:32:10:**  One of the interesting things that we saw during the millennium drought was that you  
**1:32:10-1:32:19:**  know quite a number of our narrowleaf peppermint gums, so that's Eucalyptus radiata, some  
**1:32:19-1:32:24:**  of them were over 200 years old and they died.  
**1:32:24-1:32:33:**  So you've got these indigenous species which will no longer survive in this environment  
**1:32:33-1:32:38:**  and so you've got to start thinking about well what is the environment going to look  
**1:32:38-1:32:50:**  like in 20, 30, 50 years time and will my whatever I'm planting survive in that environment?  
**1:32:50-1:32:56:**  And so your best choice may not be an indigenous plant.  
**1:32:56-1:33:03:**  And I know a lot of people get quite excited about planting indigenous plants and absolutely  
**1:33:03-1:33:11:**  it's appropriate but again just in terms of looking for that diversity and the resilience  
**1:33:11-1:33:17:**  of your landscape over time you just need to think about you know will some of these  
**1:33:17-1:33:20:**  species survive?  
**1:33:20-1:33:30:**  And yeah I was quite surprised is that we lost quite a number of you know trees that  
**1:33:30-1:33:38:**  had, yeah when I cut them up for firewood, you know there was a lot of rings there.  
**1:33:38-1:33:41:**  So they'd been around, they'd seen a lot of droughts, seen a lot of floods, they'd seen  
**1:33:41-1:33:44:**  a lot of stuff but they couldn't survive this one.  
**1:33:44-1:33:51:**  Typically they'll last 300 plus years so it wasn't as if they'd like reached the end of  
**1:33:51-1:33:57:**  their useful life it's just that the environment had changed and they could no longer survive  
**1:33:57-1:33:58:**  in the environment.  
**1:33:58-1:34:05:**  Another element to that conversation is also the treatment, the soil treatment that the  
**1:34:05-1:34:09:**  previous owner for example had created.  
**1:34:09-1:34:14:**  So for example by, we're seeing this a lot in the Montado, you've got very sensitive  
**1:34:14-1:34:18:**  environments to Mediterranean climate, it's brittle, it's sensitive.  
**1:34:18-1:34:22:**  You have then a lot of overgrazing because you have you know more animals than there  
**1:34:22-1:34:25:**  were before to have more productive systems.  
**1:34:25-1:34:31:**  You have hay now, you have feed that you can buy cheap so people put more animals on their  
**1:34:31-1:34:36:**  land, soil conditions deteriorate and then the oak trees they struggle.  
**1:34:36-1:34:40:**  Complement that with the more irregular rainfall, reduced rainfall etc, the pattern that we  
**1:34:40-1:34:45:**  see in the Mediterranean climate throughout and you get old trees that should be living  
**1:34:45-1:34:50:**  much longer that are starting to, the tips start to dry, you know they start to be, the  
**1:34:50-1:34:56:**  illnesses start to affect them and we see that kind of slow decline.  
**1:34:56-1:35:00:**  And yeah that's something that's important to take note of as well.  
**1:35:00-1:35:05:**  It's not just the climate it's also this recent intensification of management and the cost  
**1:35:05-1:35:06:**  on the soil.  
**1:35:06-1:35:11:**  Yeah and I think that's and that happens over a long period of time so the fact they actually  
**1:35:11-1:35:18:**  died on our watch doesn't necessarily mean it was the conditions right then.  
**1:35:18-1:35:24:**  Sure it was a dry period but yeah absolutely the soil being compacted over a long period  
**1:35:24-1:35:30:**  of time, yeah potentially overgrazed etc etc.  
**1:35:30-1:35:35:**  So yeah I take your point entirely.  
**1:35:35-1:35:41:**  But I think you know one of the other interviewees Rowan Reid, you know one of the things that  
**1:35:41-1:35:48:**  he's been talking about in terms of his agroforestry plots is that he is now planting through a  
**1:35:48-1:35:54:**  lot of trees that will survive under a lower rainfall environment and just because this  
**1:35:54-1:35:56:**  part of the world is going to be a lot drier.  
**1:35:56-1:36:02:**  And so you know again you need to think about that in terms of your shelterbelts, just the  
**1:36:02-1:36:12:**  sort of things that you do is you know am I planting a resilient structure here that's  
**1:36:12-1:36:16:**  you know going to last for the longer term particularly around trees because they last  
**1:36:16-1:36:18:**  a relatively long time.  
**1:36:18-1:36:22:**  Although having said that there's you know some of the grasses, we've got a riparian  
**1:36:22-1:36:31:**  zone and some of the grasses there like kangaroo grass which is you know it can live to be  
**1:36:31-1:36:33:**  100 years old.  
**1:36:33-1:36:42:**  So you know it's almost like a tree in that respect is that it's you know it's yeah yeah  
**1:36:42-1:36:49:**  so and you know it's so and there's some of that grassland that you know we've lost most  
**1:36:49-1:37:00:**  of it and you know so it's really important to maintain that biodiversity and keep some  
**1:37:00-1:37:07:**  of those species because it's interesting is that that particular species it's not just  
**1:37:07-1:37:12:**  indigenous to Australia or native to Australia it's also grows in Africa.  
**1:37:12-1:37:19:**  I think it's called red grass over there or Afrikaans as rural grass and you know it has  
**1:37:19-1:37:28:**  20% protein like it could be one of those plants that provides a huge amount of you  
**1:37:28-1:37:35:**  know feed for us as the climate dries out because you know kangaroo grass will survive  
**1:37:35-1:37:38:**  in both wet environments and dry environments.  
**1:37:38-1:37:44:**  It's very very good at that and so it's much more resilient grass than a lot of the ones  
**1:37:44-1:37:49:**  that you know like wheat notes and barley and rye and stuff.  
**1:37:49-1:37:57:**  So again you know it we really need to be careful that we don't lose some of these species  
**1:37:57-1:38:02:**  because we may ultimately depend on them for our survival.  
**1:38:02-1:38:07:**  Shifting a bit back to the multi-functionality of the landscape or of the shelterbelts, have  
**1:38:07-1:38:10:**  you expected to extract a product from there?  
**1:38:10-1:38:16:**  Are you expecting to harvest some kind of wood, timber, wood chips, anything from that  
**1:38:16-1:38:17:**  shelter belt?  
**1:38:17-1:38:24:**  Definitely so we planted some of the species there we planted because they're really good  
**1:38:24-1:38:33:**  for nectar so potential honey production and I would imagine that some of the blue gums  
**1:38:33-1:38:40:**  will take out from time to time and that'll be you know we'll just take one out one back  
**1:38:40-1:38:42:**  type stuff.  
**1:38:42-1:38:48:**  So they haven't been high pruned for timber but you know they've probably got four or  
**1:38:48-1:38:53:**  five meters to the first branch and because again a lot of you know a lot of the shrubs  
**1:38:53-1:39:00:**  and stuff force them to grow up and so essentially they self prune for the first four or five  
**1:39:00-1:39:07:**  meters and so you know I think we'll get some timber out of them as well.  
**1:39:07-1:39:17:**  So yeah it's we'll and interestingly some of the casuarina that we planted in there  
**1:39:17-1:39:24:**  so your bull oaks and those sorts of things you got a wonderful large seed and you know  
**1:39:24-1:39:32:**  you can use those give them a silver spray and they make great Christmas tree decorations.  
**1:39:32-1:39:39:**  So you know there's lots of things you can do with you know some of the plants that we  
**1:39:39-1:39:45:**  have in our shelter belts and you know the opportunities are there you just got to have  
**1:39:45-1:39:47:**  the time and resources to go ask them.  
**1:39:47-1:39:54:**  I have one final question about windbreaks and I think it's also one of the key things  
**1:39:54-1:39:59:**  that comes out with it it's you know how does the windbreak system interact with the olive  
**1:39:59-1:40:07:**  trees have you noticed a serious impact on olive tree productivity closer to the windbreak  
**1:40:07-1:40:15:**  due to either reduced wind speed microclimate or also competition between the windbreak  
**1:40:15-1:40:19:**  and the olive trees have you noticed that there is there is some kind of competitive  
**1:40:19-1:40:23:**  relationship going on and maybe in closer proximity.  
**1:40:23-1:40:28:**  I don't know I'm very curious about your observations with between the olive trees and the shelter  
**1:40:28-1:40:29:**  belts.  
**1:40:29-1:40:34:**  Yeah slowing the wind speed down has helped and typically that slows the wind speed down  
**1:40:34-1:40:36:**  for quite a number of rows.  
**1:40:36-1:40:43:**  The rows closest to the shelter belt we only have a couple of places where the rows are  
**1:40:43-1:40:53:**  almost parallel to the shelter belt and planted quite closely in actual fact and definitely  
**1:40:53-1:41:02:**  there is a production impact and not initially but as the olive trees grew up more.  
**1:41:02-1:41:10:**  Now in one case I have like two specific cases that come to mind in one case it's because  
**1:41:10-1:41:18:**  the shelter belt shades the olive trees and olive trees don't like to be shaded that definitely  
**1:41:18-1:41:24:**  affects production so because the shelter belt has grown a lot higher than the olive  
**1:41:24-1:41:31:**  trees and as a result the trees are in shade a lot more of the time that definitely has  
**1:41:31-1:41:35:**  an impact on production no question about it.  
**1:41:35-1:41:41:**  In the other case I think it might be a moisture issue although the trees are big and healthy  
**1:41:41-1:41:50:**  so that suggests not and I haven't actually really yeah the trees are probably as big  
**1:41:50-1:41:57:**  as any of them which suggests that it's not a water competition issue so it may be a pollination  
**1:41:57-1:42:07:**  issue is that the shelter belt because they're a wind pollinated tree and by definition the  
**1:42:07-1:42:13:**  shelter belt may in fact be you know slowing the wind speed down enough there's not enough  
**1:42:13-1:42:17:**  pollen in that particular area to pollinate the trees.  
**1:42:17-1:42:23:**  I'm not 100% sure I don't think it's a war even though it's quite dry underneath the  
**1:42:23-1:42:31:**  trees are really well grown so I don't I don't believe it's a water stress issue but yeah  
**1:42:31-1:42:38:**  it's interesting where they are quite close together like at one point yeah the shelter  
**1:42:38-1:42:45:**  belt probably gets within five meters of the olive trees and so yeah I'm hypothesizing  
**1:42:45-1:42:51:**  that maybe the shelter belt just slows the wind speed down too much that they're not  
**1:42:51-1:42:53:**  getting that pollination.  
**1:42:53-1:42:57:**  That's an effect that you're seeing just on the on the closest row or is that something  
**1:42:57-1:43:00:**  effect you're seeing throughout a few rows?  
**1:43:00-1:43:08:**  Yeah yeah absolutely interestingly the next row is one of my best rows so it's like it's  
**1:43:08-1:43:17:**  ones that are hard up against the actual shelter belt I actually do see an effect and as I  
**1:43:17-1:43:25:**  said it only runs parallel to it for a short period of time so it's probably 20 trees maybe  
**1:43:25-1:43:31:**  and those 20 trees definitely are affected from a production point of view.  
**1:43:31-1:43:35:**  It's amazing to be able to have these observations because also you know you're managing it's  
**1:43:35-1:43:40:**  still relatively big for an olive you know crop cultivation but you're intimately interacting  
**1:43:40-1:43:45:**  with most of those trees and that is quite some incredible feedback I wasn't expecting  
**1:43:45-1:43:53:**  such a detailed answer yeah it's amazing.  
**1:43:53-1:44:04:**  I think yeah really as a land manager that's our biggest single skill it's about observation  
**1:44:04-1:44:10:**  and so it's a matter of seeing things and I guess with that being intentionally curious  
**1:44:10-1:44:15:**  is that why is that happening why is it like that?  
**1:44:15-1:44:21:**  So yeah I think in terms of the windbreak and the observations what's really hard to  
**1:44:21-1:44:30:**  understand is the general impact of the forestry agroforestry shelter belts etc on the productivity  
**1:44:30-1:44:35:**  of your landscape because it can be small details where you know it's changes through  
**1:44:35-1:44:40:**  time that we can't observe we don't have a control which is like you know we're interacting  
**1:44:40-1:44:46:**  with so it's but we can only hypothesize and what I'm feeling from also the conversation  
**1:44:46-1:44:51:**  that we just had it's that you know you're really feeling you know you're seeing that  
**1:44:51-1:44:56:**  there is an ecosystem is created and with the different tree plantings that you've put  
**1:44:56-1:45:01:**  around the place you've managed to you are improving your production.  
**1:45:01-1:45:07:**  I think that's absolutely right I think there's it's synergistic in terms of the way in which  
**1:45:07-1:45:15:**  each of the parts work with each other and you know I think that overall you end up with  
**1:45:15-1:45:25:**  a better outcome as a result and it's difficult to quantify in terms of you know what those  
**1:45:25-1:45:32:**  sorts of things might be but you know one of those windstorms that came through is that  
**1:45:32-1:45:38:**  there was a property not far from here they had it was actually a forestry plot south  
**1:45:38-1:45:47:**  facing slope and they lost every single tree like every single tree got flattened and you  
**1:45:47-1:45:55:**  know what we lost one olive tree so you know it's almost like yeah it's pretty much the  
**1:45:55-1:46:08:**  same wind it was certainly howling and yet one we lost one tree so it's yeah I think  
**1:46:08-1:46:17:**  the various parts pull together to you know create an environment that is much more nurturing  
**1:46:17-1:46:22:**  and enables all the different parts to prosper.  
**1:46:22-1:46:26:**  I think that's a beautiful way to finish the interview yeah very good I'm very grateful  
**1:46:26-1:46:29:**  for your time it's really incredible thank you.  
**1:46:29-1:46:37:**  No not at all I was really happy to share my passion so no the joy was all mine.

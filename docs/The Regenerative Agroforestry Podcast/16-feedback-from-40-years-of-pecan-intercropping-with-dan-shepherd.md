### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sun, 21 Feb 2021 19:29:29)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:48:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:53:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we're going to be interviewing Dan Sheppard, owner of  
**0:00:53-0:01:01:**  a 300 acre pecan farm where he's been intercropping a variety of crops in between the tree lines.  
**0:01:01-0:01:04:**  This is a very special interview because we don't often speak to somebody that's done  
**0:01:04-0:01:06:**  this work on such scale.  
**0:01:06-0:01:09:**  So this was fascinating and I really hope you enjoy it.  
**0:01:09-0:01:12:**  Hi Dan, welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:12-0:01:14:**  Well thank you Dimitri.  
**0:01:14-0:01:20:**  To start off with it would be really good to have an understanding of you and your farm  
**0:01:20-0:01:23:**  and what you're producing at the moment.  
**0:01:23-0:01:29:**  Well first we're going to be talking about Sheppard Farms.  
**0:01:29-0:01:33:**  My family got into farming business in about 1969.  
**0:01:33-0:01:39:**  We bought a fairly decent sized farm and my father always wanted to raise pecans so actually  
**0:01:39-0:01:44:**  he bought 20 acres to begin with to plant some pecan trees on and then a farm right  
**0:01:44-0:01:51:**  next to it I remember climbing up on the levee to look out over this farm we own now also  
**0:01:51-0:01:56:**  that I, after my dad was showing me the 20 acres he bought I said gee pop you ought to  
**0:01:56-0:02:00:**  buy this place you could plant a lot of pecan trees and he said well it is for sale and  
**0:02:00-0:02:05:**  sure enough ended up a year or two later we end up buying the larger farm and per se we  
**0:02:05-0:02:12:**  never planted pecan trees on that little 20 acres there but we do now have about 300 acres  
**0:02:12-0:02:14:**  in pecan orchards.  
**0:02:14-0:02:19:**  Out of that there's about 200 of them acres of it that are in production.  
**0:02:19-0:02:25:**  Currently the farm has about 4,000 acres which means there's about 3,000 acres of row crop  
**0:02:25-0:02:31:**  which is mainly corn and soybean production and the problem with it is that I do not do  
**0:02:31-0:02:35:**  the 3,000 acre production on the farm of corn and soybeans.  
**0:02:35-0:02:41:**  It's a situation where I feel that I am too small to be a big farmer, too big to be a  
**0:02:41-0:02:46:**  small farmer so we have a share crop basis with another large farmer that takes care  
**0:02:46-0:02:49:**  of the other farming ground for us on that.  
**0:02:49-0:02:54:**  Mainly we are on the river bottoms here in northern Missouri.  
**0:02:54-0:02:58:**  It gets hot in the summertime and cold in the winter.  
**0:02:58-0:03:08:**  I don't really know what latitude and stuff we are at but we would be about the same as  
**0:03:08-0:03:11:**  northern France, northern Germany that sort of type of weather probably but we have a  
**0:03:11-0:03:14:**  little bit hotter summers than what you all have out there.  
**0:03:14-0:03:17:**  So that's a little bit about the farm.  
**0:03:17-0:03:20:**  Currently my main business is the pecan business.  
**0:03:20-0:03:23:**  It takes up about 80% of our time.  
**0:03:23-0:03:30:**  The rest of the 10-20% is taken up on care and maintenance of buildings, levees, yards,  
**0:03:30-0:03:31:**  roads.  
**0:03:31-0:03:38:**  A fairly good sized levee system that protects our row crop and pecan orchards from river  
**0:03:38-0:03:40:**  flooding.  
**0:03:40-0:03:43:**  My job is, I'm 65 years old, I'm the manager.  
**0:03:43-0:03:47:**  I have two full time employees plus my wife.  
**0:03:47-0:03:51:**  We have a small retail store on the farm.  
**0:03:51-0:03:57:**  We're open three months out of the year where we process and sell the pecans that we raise  
**0:03:57-0:04:01:**  so we're pretty well vertically integrated I guess you might say.  
**0:04:01-0:04:07:**  So it makes a good way where we can add value to our product and stuff and we can go into  
**0:04:07-0:04:08:**  that a little later if you want to.  
**0:04:08-0:04:12:**  Yeah, that would be great Tim.  
**0:04:12-0:04:13:**  And that's about it for the farm.  
**0:04:13-0:04:16:**  Right now we're in the process of pruning trees.  
**0:04:16-0:04:17:**  We're about to get that done.  
**0:04:17-0:04:20:**  The young trees we prune those every year.  
**0:04:20-0:04:24:**  Our older orchards, some of them are up to 40 years old now.  
**0:04:24-0:04:27:**  We try and prune those about once every 10 years to get rid of lower hanging limbs and  
**0:04:27-0:04:31:**  stuff to keep them out of the equipment and that sort of thing.  
**0:04:31-0:04:36:**  And also doing some thinning in the orchards, we're always thinning trees out.  
**0:04:36-0:04:37:**  Right now that's pretty what we're doing.  
**0:04:37-0:04:44:**  We just finished processing all the pecans that we raise plus we do a little custom processing  
**0:04:44-0:04:50:**  for a few other growers around, small growers that want to retail their pecans out also  
**0:04:50-0:04:55:**  but we go ahead and process them for them this time of year and we just finish that  
**0:04:55-0:05:02:**  up so as the weather turns bad and the snow comes and stuff, we'll start working on equipment,  
**0:05:02-0:05:08:**  tractors, mowers, all other equipment stuff plus all the process equipment will be pulled  
**0:05:08-0:05:13:**  in and worse painted, cleaned and all that sort of stuff.  
**0:05:13-0:05:15:**  That's about what we're doing right now.  
**0:05:15-0:05:17:**  Nice.  
**0:05:17-0:05:21:**  And could you tell me a bit more about how old your pecan orchards are?  
**0:05:21-0:05:29:**  Well, our main orchard we have was planted, the nuts in 81 so it's right at 40 years old  
**0:05:29-0:05:31:**  now.  
**0:05:31-0:05:37:**  We have an experimental orchard that was about 20 acres and that was planted in 71.  
**0:05:37-0:05:41:**  With us being just about as far north as you can raise a pecan, you really can't raise  
**0:05:41-0:05:43:**  it much farther north.  
**0:05:43-0:05:47:**  We don't have the heat units or the daylight time and stuff and so we're right there on  
**0:05:47-0:05:52:**  the very edge so the trees and the varieties that we have and we graft to are not the big  
**0:05:52-0:05:54:**  southern varieties like they have in the south.  
**0:05:54-0:06:02:**  So we have, my dad started an experimental orchard of known varieties and varieties of  
**0:06:02-0:06:06:**  native varieties around here that tend to be fairly well and from there we kind of decided  
**0:06:06-0:06:11:**  on what we wanted to put our other orchard into and graft it to.  
**0:06:11-0:06:17:**  Because all our trees are grafted, that way we know what our trees are going to produce.  
**0:06:17-0:06:19:**  So that was it.  
**0:06:19-0:06:22:**  The other orchard was planted in 81.  
**0:06:22-0:06:25:**  We planted the nuts where we wanted a tree.  
**0:06:25-0:06:32:**  In the process we've been thinning out and thinning, we've probably taken three-fourths  
**0:06:32-0:06:37:**  of the trees out that we've planted and probably within another 10 or 15 years we'll take half  
**0:06:37-0:06:40:**  those trees with another half of the orchard out.  
**0:06:40-0:06:42:**  So it works better.  
**0:06:42-0:06:47:**  You're thinning them because they're getting too big now and they're starting to, the crowns  
**0:06:47-0:06:50:**  are starting to touch or what's the reason?  
**0:06:50-0:06:51:**  That's true.  
**0:06:51-0:06:54:**  We have a rule we never want a pecan tree to touch another pecan tree.  
**0:06:54-0:06:57:**  Then we get plenty of lights, sunlight around the tree.  
**0:06:57-0:07:02:**  We also get a nice air movement and stuff where the trees tend to dry out in the mornings  
**0:07:02-0:07:09:**  after heavy dews and it helps hold down the fungus problems we have like scab and other  
**0:07:09-0:07:10:**  things.  
**0:07:10-0:07:13:**  Luckily we're not as bad as they are in the southeast like in Georgia and Florida where  
**0:07:13-0:07:16:**  they have a tremendous amount of trouble with what we call scab.  
**0:07:16-0:07:18:**  It's a fungus disease.  
**0:07:18-0:07:23:**  It gets on the leaves and the nuts and stuff and if you keep them thinned out and where  
**0:07:23-0:07:27:**  you get air movement it lessens your scab problems and stuff.  
**0:07:27-0:07:31:**  And I can tell people as you take half your orchard out you'll double your production  
**0:07:31-0:07:36:**  just because trees aren't fighting for sunlight and trees aren't fighting for water and nutrients  
**0:07:36-0:07:38:**  and that sort of stuff.  
**0:07:38-0:07:40:**  Pretty nice.  
**0:07:40-0:07:47:**  And just to give us a bit of a visual idea, how tall and how wide are your 40-year-old  
**0:07:47-0:07:50:**  trees that you planted in 81?  
**0:07:50-0:07:56:**  Our main rows and stuff, and I'm sorry I'm probably going to have to put this in feet  
**0:07:56-0:08:02:**  and stuff because I never really grew up with a metric system so you have to bear with me  
**0:08:02-0:08:04:**  on that.  
**0:08:04-0:08:09:**  We pretty well planted all our trees in 40-foot rows and the reason for that was because of  
**0:08:09-0:08:11:**  fertilizer.  
**0:08:11-0:08:16:**  We fertilized our trees fairly heavy for production reasons and stuff and also taking stuff off  
**0:08:16-0:08:19:**  and we were also farmed between them.  
**0:08:19-0:08:25:**  But that's what a fertilizer spreads is it was 40 feet.  
**0:08:25-0:08:30:**  Now fertilizer spreads 50 feet to 80 feet, whatever.  
**0:08:30-0:08:37:**  So spacing was not quite as critical now as maybe what it was back then because that's  
**0:08:37-0:08:42:**  just about what we could, fertility-wise, to spread the fertilizer on.  
**0:08:42-0:08:46:**  They couldn't really be much farther than 40 feet apart.  
**0:08:46-0:08:52:**  The orchards we do plant are also when the trees were 40 feet apart down the row, especially  
**0:08:52-0:08:54:**  all the new orchards we planted.  
**0:08:54-0:08:59:**  We planted where they're checked where we could farm east and west or north and south  
**0:08:59-0:09:01:**  or diagonal.  
**0:09:01-0:09:05:**  So the trees were spaced that way in the newer orchards.  
**0:09:05-0:09:11:**  The older orchards were just 40 feet apart and the trees were just stepped off down the  
**0:09:11-0:09:14:**  row of anywhere from 15 to 18 feet.  
**0:09:14-0:09:21:**  We planted some nuts in there so that's kind of an odd spacing but if I was doing it over  
**0:09:21-0:09:26:**  now on an agroforestry I'd probably go 60 feet and we could maybe get into some reasons  
**0:09:26-0:09:28:**  later on about that.  
**0:09:28-0:09:31:**  Niko Thelenovitch Okay, so when you started planting them in  
**0:09:31-0:09:37:**  the old orchards they were about 15 to 18 feet between the trees on the line.  
**0:09:37-0:09:38:**  What are they now?  
**0:09:38-0:09:41:**  What's the spacing now after having thinned three quarters?  
**0:09:41-0:09:47:**  Paul Most of them are at least probably 40 and  
**0:09:47-0:09:50:**  some of them are 60 or 80 feet apart.  
**0:09:50-0:09:55:**  Mainly 60, I'd probably say close to 60 feet is about average on them now.  
**0:09:55-0:09:59:**  Down the rows and the trees are 40 feet apart in the rows.  
**0:09:59-0:10:02:**  Niko Out of curiosity, how tall are they?  
**0:10:02-0:10:05:**  Paul Some of those trees are probably getting  
**0:10:05-0:10:07:**  up to 60 feet tall.  
**0:10:07-0:10:09:**  Niko Oh wow, nice.  
**0:10:09-0:10:10:**  That must be so beautiful.  
**0:10:10-0:10:19:**  Paul Yeah, it's kind of fooling people how tall  
**0:10:19-0:10:25:**  those trees really get but when you cut one down and lay him down, he's 50 or 60 feet  
**0:10:25-0:10:28:**  tall, it takes a while.  
**0:10:28-0:10:32:**  You want to knock him down or cut him when we're thinning on those trees.  
**0:10:32-0:10:37:**  We'll kind of be careful where you place it because it'll get in the trees pretty easy.  
**0:10:37-0:10:42:**  Niko And to kind of finish off the context of your  
**0:10:42-0:10:50:**  farm, the brief context of your farm I should say, what kind of fertilization and irrigation  
**0:10:50-0:10:52:**  do you do in your orchard?  
**0:10:52-0:10:56:**  Paul Okay, fertilizer and stuff, pecans tend to  
**0:10:56-0:11:02:**  be a fairly big user of nitrogen and it depends on what we're doing with the orchard.  
**0:11:02-0:11:09:**  If we're cutting hay off of it, we would probably go 100, about 100 units of nitrogen, about  
**0:11:09-0:11:21:**  30 units of potassium and about 50 use of phosphorus and stuff.  
**0:11:21-0:11:24:**  That's pretty well normal what we use.  
**0:11:24-0:11:30:**  Maybe that if we're cutting hay, we'll double up on the P and K but we still tend to put  
**0:11:30-0:11:35:**  about 120 to 140 units of nitrogen on.  
**0:11:35-0:11:37:**  That seems to be a lot.  
**0:11:37-0:11:42:**  As far as irrigation, in our part of the country, we have no irrigation water.  
**0:11:42-0:11:50:**  Number one is that we have no groundwater that we can irrigate with.  
**0:11:50-0:11:52:**  So that's the deal.  
**0:11:52-0:11:56:**  We could irrigate out of the river but normally when it gets really dry, the river quits running  
**0:11:56-0:12:00:**  so that really doesn't work very well.  
**0:12:00-0:12:08:**  We're in a situation where we normally get enough rainfall to raise our crop.  
**0:12:08-0:12:12:**  Mainly we'll have more trouble with too much water than not enough water.  
**0:12:12-0:12:16:**  So luckily we don't have the irrigations and all the work with the irrigation systems on  
**0:12:16-0:12:17:**  it.  
**0:12:17-0:12:18:**  Dario Interesting.  
**0:12:18-0:12:22:**  Is your soil quite deep?  
**0:12:22-0:12:26:**  Do the trees have access to groundwater throughout the season?  
**0:12:26-0:12:30:**  Or is it quite...  
**0:12:30-0:12:31:**  Tom It varies.  
**0:12:31-0:12:38:**  We can get some dry weather and stuff and ground gets fairly dry and stuff.  
**0:12:38-0:12:43:**  The main thing is that the pecan tree reefs are normally only about 12 to 18 inches below  
**0:12:43-0:12:45:**  the surface of the soil.  
**0:12:45-0:12:51:**  We do have like being in bottomland soil, the better the soil, the better the trees  
**0:12:51-0:12:55:**  does, the better the water holding capacity of it is.  
**0:12:55-0:13:01:**  In some spots in the orchard we have a fairly high clay content.  
**0:13:01-0:13:06:**  You can really tell the difference in the soil in a larger orchard where you have multiple  
**0:13:06-0:13:09:**  types of soil types out there.  
**0:13:09-0:13:14:**  The soils that are not quite as good, definitely the trees aren't quite as big, tall and production  
**0:13:14-0:13:19:**  is down compared to some of the soil that may be some of the very best in the orchard.  
**0:13:19-0:13:22:**  Those trees tend to do a lot, lot better.  
**0:13:22-0:13:26:**  Ben That makes a lot of sense.  
**0:13:26-0:13:32:**  Basically today what I wanted to do is build on with some of the interviews that you've  
**0:13:32-0:13:37:**  already given, especially with the Savannah Institute which I advise all our listeners  
**0:13:37-0:13:45:**  to go check out to have an in-depth understanding of what pecan production is like.  
**0:13:45-0:13:50:**  You talk a lot about the pecan tree, about the nut, how it's processed and etc.  
**0:13:50-0:13:58:**  What I wanted to try and do today is to really go into the agroforestry bits and by that  
**0:13:58-0:14:03:**  talking more detail about your experience with intercropping.  
**0:14:03-0:14:06:**  But also talking about the strategy of the farm because that's something that I think  
**0:14:06-0:14:11:**  would be really interesting to delve into with you.  
**0:14:11-0:14:16:**  Leading on from that, one of the first questions that I wanted to ask you is when you look  
**0:14:16-0:14:20:**  at your previous talks, you talk about a lot of different types of productions.  
**0:14:20-0:14:28:**  You're talking about you had buffalo at some point, you had the road crops of course at  
**0:14:28-0:14:35:**  the moment, 3,000 acres of that, you had cattle, you were also producing a type of grass seed.  
**0:14:35-0:14:40:**  So I'd love to know a bit more about why did you decide to diversify the farm so much?  
**0:14:40-0:14:47:**  Well, you know, I guess it comes back to my father, we always had a saying is that you  
**0:14:47-0:14:52:**  can make a little money doing what everybody else does, but you stand to make a lot more  
**0:14:52-0:14:54:**  doing what nobody else is doing.  
**0:14:54-0:15:01:**  We also liked the idea that we could set a price for our product where we could somewhat  
**0:15:01-0:15:07:**  pretty well guarantee us a profit instead of taking what somebody was to give us for  
**0:15:07-0:15:09:**  it.  
**0:15:09-0:15:19:**  You know, when you have livestock cattle, you know, or hogs or chickens or corn or soybeans,  
**0:15:19-0:15:24:**  you know, it depends on what somebody you know, on the market is what they're going  
**0:15:24-0:15:26:**  to give you for it.  
**0:15:26-0:15:30:**  Farming is completely backwards than any other business that I know of.  
**0:15:30-0:15:36:**  And so we tried to take that farm deal where we could, you know, sell our products on the  
**0:15:36-0:15:42:**  farm, whether it be Eastern gamma grass seed, we raised the seed, we were pretty well the  
**0:15:42-0:15:44:**  main growers of it in the nation.  
**0:15:44-0:15:50:**  Definitely the largest we could set our price exactly, you know, where we could do, we could  
**0:15:50-0:15:53:**  make a, you know, a nice, decent profit off of it.  
**0:15:53-0:15:57:**  The same way with the bison business of the American Buffalo.  
**0:15:57-0:15:59:**  We had store on a farm here.  
**0:15:59-0:16:00:**  We sold breeding stock.  
**0:16:00-0:16:02:**  We also sold meat and stuff.  
**0:16:02-0:16:06:**  That way we could, you know, set the price where we could prove a guarantee as a profit  
**0:16:06-0:16:08:**  on that sort of stuff.  
**0:16:08-0:16:12:**  The pecans worked out the same way with us retailing.  
**0:16:12-0:16:24:**  Our pecan crop, we can set a price on it where we can guarantee us a profit on it and a profit  
**0:16:24-0:16:25:**  profits a lot better than losses.  
**0:16:25-0:16:26:**  I agree with that.  
**0:16:26-0:16:32:**  It let you buy new equipment, new toys, new buildings, new concrete, whatever else you  
**0:16:32-0:16:33:**  want to buy.  
**0:16:33-0:16:40:**  So it makes it instead of having to struggle all the time and try to come up with, you  
**0:16:40-0:16:44:**  know, the funds to run the farm.  
**0:16:44-0:16:49:**  But if you're talking about, you know, setting the price, that means that what you are producing  
**0:16:49-0:16:54:**  and what you are producing, you're clearly not selling it on the wholesale commodity  
**0:16:54-0:16:56:**  markets, right?  
**0:16:56-0:16:57:**  That's correct.  
**0:16:57-0:17:02:**  You know, all the years we've been in the pecan business, a year ago we sold, we had  
**0:17:02-0:17:09:**  a tremendous crop year on pecans and, you know, we had to sell quite a bit of our pecan  
**0:17:09-0:17:15:**  crop to what we call shellers or accumulators that, you know, buy millions and millions  
**0:17:15-0:17:21:**  of pounds of pecans a year and they shell them and then make those through the, you  
**0:17:21-0:17:23:**  know, through the commercial markets and stuff.  
**0:17:23-0:17:28:**  Whereas my market is, is I sell directly to the consumer, to the little old lady that,  
**0:17:28-0:17:31:**  you know, make some of the best cookies in the world for our grandkids and stuff.  
**0:17:31-0:17:37:**  And she comes out and buys 20 or $30 worth of pecans from me and, and, and that sort  
**0:17:37-0:17:39:**  of thing, that sort of people.  
**0:17:39-0:17:42:**  And that, uh, that helps out a lot.  
**0:17:42-0:17:48:**  I also sell some to bulk food stores, you know, small independent grocery store sort  
**0:17:48-0:17:50:**  of things where they can reset them to there.  
**0:17:50-0:17:55:**  They get them a little cheaper price, but I move, uh, move quite a bit of product that  
**0:17:55-0:17:57:**  way, but it's not like selling just the whole pecans.  
**0:17:57-0:18:00:**  They're already processed pretty well for those sort of deals.  
**0:18:00-0:18:06:**  So we do the processing here, which in terms of, you know, we can add added value to it.  
**0:18:06-0:18:11:**  And that makes a lot of sense when you have so many different types of production.  
**0:18:11-0:18:17:**  Um, clearly it's, it seems at least that there would be, um, some challenges as well in terms  
**0:18:17-0:18:21:**  of, um, you know, the practicality of managing so many different enterprises at the same  
**0:18:21-0:18:22:**  time.  
**0:18:22-0:18:28:**  And, um, also, you know, on the workload, but also on knowledge, you know, having the  
**0:18:28-0:18:29:**  knowledge to be able to manage all of that.  
**0:18:29-0:18:34:**  And so I'm curious to know, you know, in time, in the history of the, throughout the history  
**0:18:34-0:18:38:**  of the farm and until now, how did you manage those, those challenges that we often see  
**0:18:38-0:18:41:**  with diversified operations?  
**0:18:41-0:18:47:**  Really it was really, it was really easy to, to do that for the well, because.  
**0:18:47-0:18:51:**  Yeah, the three main items we had, which was, was the American biflow with the, the, the  
**0:18:51-0:18:56:**  bison business, uh, the Eastern gamma grass seed, which is the native warm season grass  
**0:18:56-0:18:57:**  seed.  
**0:18:57-0:18:58:**  And then of course the pecans.  
**0:18:58-0:19:03:**  Um, the thing about it was, is, is that, uh, they all pretty well interacted well, and  
**0:19:03-0:19:07:**  it was a good way to keep my employees busy year round.  
**0:19:07-0:19:14:**  Uh, right now I'm a little, be a little over on, on employees, but, uh, since we're just  
**0:19:14-0:19:19:**  in the pecan businesses or the sort of it, but, uh, it worked out better because in the  
**0:19:19-0:19:22:**  summertime, there wasn't a whole lot to do to peak up with the bison business, Buffalo  
**0:19:22-0:19:23:**  business.  
**0:19:23-0:19:25:**  We put hay up for a couple of months.  
**0:19:25-0:19:29:**  Uh, then after that, we'd start, uh, rest of the summer moment, pastures, mowing orchards,  
**0:19:29-0:19:31:**  getting ready for that.  
**0:19:31-0:19:34:**  Then come fall, we would harvest pecans process.  
**0:19:34-0:19:39:**  Then the Buffalo pretty well took, uh, not a lot of care.  
**0:19:39-0:19:43:**  The gamma grass seed business came off in the middle of summer and it pretty well sat  
**0:19:43-0:19:49:**  down until about, uh, about this time of year, we started, uh, doing the seed business and  
**0:19:49-0:19:55:**  doing seed, which worked out real well for that, uh, pretty well that, and then ship  
**0:19:55-0:19:58:**  seed out normally to about the middle of June.  
**0:19:58-0:20:03:**  So it, a lot of different things going on, but it worked real well to keep the employees  
**0:20:03-0:20:04:**  busy year round.  
**0:20:04-0:20:07:**  Uh, we really never had a slack time, which was kind of nice.  
**0:20:07-0:20:12:**  Um, it was, uh, a situation I got out of the grass seed business.  
**0:20:12-0:20:13:**  We had a terrible flood.  
**0:20:13-0:20:15:**  I lost most of my seed fields.  
**0:20:15-0:20:19:**  Um, and I'll be truthfully, I was probably spending about 80% of my time with the grass  
**0:20:19-0:20:23:**  seed business, but it was a high profit part of the farm.  
**0:20:23-0:20:30:**  Uh, after spending about 20 years with a headset on sitting in a desk about 80% of my time,  
**0:20:30-0:20:36:**  uh, sewing and marketing the grass seed business, uh, uh, flood put me out.  
**0:20:36-0:20:37:**  I was really kind of burned out.  
**0:20:37-0:20:39:**  It was kind of glad to see that go.  
**0:20:39-0:20:43:**  We had another little situation about a couple of years later with the bison business and  
**0:20:43-0:20:48:**  the store business with the meat sales on something where we were under a federal meat  
**0:20:48-0:20:52:**  inspection, and then they changed the rules to state meat inspection, which really didn't  
**0:20:52-0:20:55:**  fit with our operation.  
**0:20:55-0:20:56:**  And uh, I'll be truthfully.  
**0:20:56-0:21:01:**  The, uh, you know, the livestock end of it, uh, was good.  
**0:21:01-0:21:05:**  The American buys was good, but, uh, I was going to have to spend a lot of money on,  
**0:21:05-0:21:07:**  on a new corral system and stuff.  
**0:21:07-0:21:09:**  And I started heck, just get out of it.  
**0:21:09-0:21:13:**  Then the pecans were really starting to kick on and really taking a lot more of our time  
**0:21:13-0:21:14:**  and stuff.  
**0:21:14-0:21:19:**  So we district, we just started doing pecans as far as the corn and soybeans at 3000 acres  
**0:21:19-0:21:20:**  of that.  
**0:21:20-0:21:22:**  I really don't have a lot to do with that.  
**0:21:22-0:21:29:**  So management part of that is not, not really, I have to do, um, like I'm 65 now.  
**0:21:29-0:21:33:**  Uh, I've slowed up a little bit to come out what I might call almost semi retired almost,  
**0:21:33-0:21:37:**  but not quite, uh, come to work every day.  
**0:21:37-0:21:43:**  And, and, and this, that and the other, but, uh, uh, not quite hitting as hard as I did  
**0:21:43-0:21:45:**  when I was 25.  
**0:21:45-0:21:46:**  Yeah.  
**0:21:46-0:21:55:**  Um, it's interesting to see how, as your pecans, um, have evolved and have grown into a significant  
**0:21:55-0:22:00:**  production line on your farm, you've been able to ease off the others.  
**0:22:00-0:22:04:**  I find that really interesting to see how there's also been, you know, as, as the trees  
**0:22:04-0:22:10:**  have gone through some kind of natural growth and succession, so has your business.  
**0:22:10-0:22:11:**  That's true.  
**0:22:11-0:22:12:**  And, and it's all been good.  
**0:22:12-0:22:15:**  I mean, we've had our good years and our bad years and stuff.  
**0:22:15-0:22:20:**  And I can remember, uh, you know, back 40 years ago, we're getting everything going  
**0:22:20-0:22:25:**  and, and, you know, uh, agriculture prices were, were really terrible.  
**0:22:25-0:22:30:**  Uh, interest rates were extremely high and it was some pretty tough years in there.  
**0:22:30-0:22:37:**  I mean, uh, uh, we kind of knew, uh, you know, well, if we can wait another couple of days,  
**0:22:37-0:22:42:**  we can get 30 day float on the feed or on the, on the fuel stuff on that, you know,  
**0:22:42-0:22:43:**  on that sort of deal.  
**0:22:43-0:22:46:**  So we didn't have to pay the interest that high interest rate on it.  
**0:22:46-0:22:51:**  So, you know, the things have changed a lot over the years and stuff like say that, you  
**0:22:51-0:22:56:**  know, uh, the farms out of debt, which is really nice, uh, and has been for a number  
**0:22:56-0:22:57:**  of years.  
**0:22:57-0:23:01:**  I don't know if I can say anything and say, once you get out of debt, uh, you know, there  
**0:23:01-0:23:06:**  seems to be all kinds of, of, of extra money around and profit around a lot better than  
**0:23:06-0:23:09:**  having to pay a lot of, a lot of debt off.  
**0:23:09-0:23:14:**  And, uh, that's kind of nice to say is that, that we are out of debt on the farm and it  
**0:23:14-0:23:16:**  makes life a lot easier.  
**0:23:16-0:23:22:**  Um, how did you manage, um, on a knowledge level to have all these different enterprises?  
**0:23:22-0:23:24:**  Well, mainly I grew up with it.  
**0:23:24-0:23:27:**  Uh, you know, we were in the Buffalo business for 42 years.  
**0:23:27-0:23:34:**  I, you know, we started Eastern Gama grass really in 1980 and, uh, you know, we're in  
**0:23:34-0:23:40:**  it for 30 years and, you know, my dad was, uh, you know, forward thinker, uh, kind of  
**0:23:40-0:23:44:**  figured out on, on, on what maybe we could do.  
**0:23:44-0:23:50:**  I took management of the farm in 78, uh, when I got out of college and between he and I  
**0:23:50-0:23:52:**  saw stuff, it kind of learned the hard way.  
**0:23:52-0:23:55:**  Most of that stuff out, there was nothing out there.  
**0:23:55-0:23:56:**  You could really learn.  
**0:23:56-0:24:00:**  Nobody really knew how to race pecans this far North of Missouri.  
**0:24:00-0:24:04:**  And as far as varieties and stuff to graft and stuff, and we made plenty of mistakes  
**0:24:04-0:24:05:**  and you learn by that.  
**0:24:05-0:24:12:**  And as far as in the Buffalo business, uh, livestock businesses, somewhat livestock business,  
**0:24:12-0:24:17:**  but somewhat it's, it's a little different too, but mainly is, is being a salesman.  
**0:24:17-0:24:24:**  I, uh, I really want to say is that, uh, you know, to be successful in life, you need to  
**0:24:24-0:24:25:**  be a salesman.  
**0:24:25-0:24:30:**  And my, my father was a salesman kind of taught me, uh, uh, you know, how to maybe to be a  
**0:24:30-0:24:36:**  salesman also, but, uh, uh, some of the most, uh, you know, the most successful people in  
**0:24:36-0:24:37:**  the world, I feel are salesmen.  
**0:24:37-0:24:42:**  You know, you talk about Bill Gates, maybe, you know, with Microsoft, I don't think he  
**0:24:42-0:24:47:**  had the best operating system, but he was able to sell IBM on his, uh, his operating  
**0:24:47-0:24:48:**  system.  
**0:24:48-0:24:52:**  And that became Microsoft and, uh, kind of how it worked.  
**0:24:52-0:24:56:**  And I thought a lot of people is if you're a successful, you're a salesman.  
**0:24:56-0:25:02:**  And that's my opinion, but, uh, but, but able to talk to people and, and to, uh, to, uh,  
**0:25:02-0:25:07:**  maybe move your product to sell your product, uh, sell your ideas is, is very important.  
**0:25:07-0:25:10:**  I think to be successful.  
**0:25:10-0:25:14:**  When you're talking about sales now, I'm, I'm still kind of, there's still a gap in  
**0:25:14-0:25:22:**  my understanding of how you manage to, to sell retail 300 or mostly retail, um, with  
**0:25:22-0:25:27:**  some shops, as you mentioned, 300 acres of pecan nuts.  
**0:25:27-0:25:29:**  I mean, that's, that's a, that's a lot of production, isn't it?  
**0:25:29-0:25:34:**  It is, you know, well, about 200, you know, and you know, we're on a major highway here  
**0:25:34-0:25:41:**  and, uh, we have a large sign up on the highway, uh, that, uh, down here, uh, do advertising  
**0:25:41-0:25:48:**  and that sort of thing also, but also we have a superior product and if you have a superior  
**0:25:48-0:25:56:**  product and you sell it for a reasonable price, um, you know, that, that makes a lot better  
**0:25:56-0:25:58:**  as far as I'm concerned.  
**0:25:58-0:26:01:**  And, uh, and, and we move a lot of becomes like that, but these are, we completely, we  
**0:26:01-0:26:05:**  shut them completely out where we're district. We saw in the nut meets, what we've done a  
**0:26:05-0:26:11:**  lot of is what we call a blown pecan is where we run these pecans through air crackers and  
**0:26:11-0:26:14:**  then through an air separator, which blows most of the shells out.  
**0:26:14-0:26:15:**  And then we bag them.  
**0:26:15-0:26:19:**  Whereas, uh, normally there may be five pounds of whole nuts, but time we get done with them,  
**0:26:19-0:26:22:**  there's only three pounds of product there.  
**0:26:22-0:26:26:**  So we've taken about two pounds of the shell and stuff out of them.  
**0:26:26-0:26:31:**  And so it leaves less than a half a pound of shell in the product or, or the stuff.  
**0:26:31-0:26:35:**  Some people just really end up just sorting them out and do a little hand labor and sort  
**0:26:35-0:26:37:**  them out instead of us doing it.  
**0:26:37-0:26:38:**  Uh, that's mainly how we sell.  
**0:26:38-0:26:42:**  Like I said, we sell a lot to, to other peddlers that people sell, you know, people come in  
**0:26:42-0:26:48:**  by, you know, two or 300 bags or whatever the product, and then they go and sell them,  
**0:26:48-0:26:51:**  you know, 40, 50, a hundred miles away.  
**0:26:51-0:26:57:**  Uh, we also do quite a bit of like bulk food stores and some grocery stores that, uh, they'll  
**0:26:57-0:27:02:**  come in and take, you know, two or, you know, a thousand, 2000 bags at a time.  
**0:27:02-0:27:06:**  And, uh, so, you know, we move a lot of product that way.  
**0:27:06-0:27:09:**  So then, you know, we go ahead and shells quite a bit too.  
**0:27:09-0:27:12:**  And we sell out of the store here stuff, not meats.  
**0:27:12-0:27:14:**  We also sell, you know, the blown pecans and stuff.  
**0:27:14-0:27:18:**  And like I said, we can do that and we sell at a reasonable price.  
**0:27:18-0:27:21:**  We don't get really expensive and stuff.  
**0:27:21-0:27:24:**  Uh, uh, but, uh, that's how we move the product to make it work.  
**0:27:24-0:27:26:**  You know, we used to sell sweet corn.  
**0:27:26-0:27:28:**  We used to raise sweet corn out here.  
**0:27:28-0:27:29:**  We had the Buffalo meat stuff.  
**0:27:29-0:27:35:**  The farm store was open 12 months out of the year, summertime with a pecan and equipment.  
**0:27:35-0:27:38:**  We had to listen really good ground and sprayers and stuff.  
**0:27:38-0:27:44:**  And the planters stuff, we raised sweet corn and we'd raise, uh, you know, 10 hectares  
**0:27:44-0:27:45:**  of sweet corn a year.  
**0:27:45-0:27:50:**  And, but we'd only have it like three different days a year.  
**0:27:50-0:27:55:**  And people would maybe, you know, sell sweet corn alongside the road and they may sell  
**0:27:55-0:27:59:**  a pickup load, which would maybe be a couple of thousand years.  
**0:27:59-0:28:04:**  Well, you know, for me, a sweet corn day sale is 40,000 years of sweet corn.  
**0:28:04-0:28:08:**  Um, people are selling it to maybe a $3 a dozen.  
**0:28:08-0:28:14:**  I was selling it for $2 a dozen people come in and buy one or two dozen from those people.  
**0:28:14-0:28:18:**  They come in and buy 20 or 30 or 40 dozen for me, you know, to put up and free.  
**0:28:18-0:28:22:**  So, you know, we made it on volume and that sort of thing.  
**0:28:22-0:28:23:**  And that worked out real well.  
**0:28:23-0:28:24:**  I've got people at the store.  
**0:28:24-0:28:28:**  I sold, get peaches shipped in from Southern part of the state and we'd sell peaches and  
**0:28:28-0:28:31:**  we had our Buffalo and pecans and that sort of thing.  
**0:28:31-0:28:37:**  Uh, you know, just to get people out and, and, and we kind of make it on volume a lot  
**0:28:37-0:28:41:**  better than sometimes in just a very high price specialty market, which you're dealing  
**0:28:41-0:28:43:**  with a very few people.  
**0:28:43-0:28:47:**  So it worked out better for us on how to market our pecans and other products and stuff we  
**0:28:47-0:28:49:**  sold here on the farm.  
**0:28:49-0:28:51:**  Matter of fact, yeah.  
**0:28:51-0:28:55:**  Like one other thing I'll tell you real quick is that, you know, pumpkins, uh, you know,  
**0:28:55-0:28:59:**  we used to raise pumpkins and stuff and I tried to sell pumpkins and you could always  
**0:28:59-0:29:03:**  sell a few pumpkins, but if you've ever raised pumpkins, either it's a pumpkin year, it's  
**0:29:03-0:29:04:**  not a pumpkin year.  
**0:29:04-0:29:08:**  Either you raise a lot of pumpkins or you don't raise hardly any at all.  
**0:29:08-0:29:11:**  And when everybody, when it's a pumpkin on year, everybody has pumpkins and you can't  
**0:29:11-0:29:13:**  hardly sell them.  
**0:29:13-0:29:15:**  So we advertise, give pumpkins away.  
**0:29:15-0:29:17:**  Everybody come to the farm, got a free pumpkin.  
**0:29:17-0:29:22:**  I made more giving a pumpkin away than I ever could have made by selling it because people  
**0:29:22-0:29:26:**  come to the store and they get a free pumpkin and they'd buy some meat and some pecans and  
**0:29:26-0:29:29:**  some jams and jellies and mixed nuts and that sort of stuff.  
**0:29:29-0:29:33:**  So, you know, just to, you know, draw stuff, uh, pumpkins pretty cheap to raise.  
**0:29:33-0:29:37:**  And like I say, it's, uh, we made more money giving pumpkins away than we ever could by  
**0:29:37-0:29:38:**  selling them.  
**0:29:38-0:29:39:**  Yeah.  
**0:29:39-0:29:40:**  Yeah.  
**0:29:40-0:29:43:**  It's a clearly not such a little thing apparently, but, uh, you're, you're bringing up a lot  
**0:29:43-0:29:45:**  of things I'd like to delve into.  
**0:29:45-0:29:53:**  Um, and, um, the first one is how does the quality of your pecans, um, differ from, from  
**0:29:53-0:29:54:**  others on the market?  
**0:29:54-0:29:58:**  You said you sell a higher quality product in what way is it in, is it in the processing  
**0:29:58-0:30:02:**  and the way it's presented as you mentioned, or is it in the actual quality of the nut?  
**0:30:02-0:30:07:**  Uh, a little bit of all, um, in our part of the country over here, there are, um, normally  
**0:30:07-0:30:09:**  about 20 miles West of me.  
**0:30:09-0:30:16:**  Uh, there's some, uh, quite a bit of a native pecan trees that, uh, the squirrels and nature  
**0:30:16-0:30:18:**  planted and stuff, and they are not grafted.  
**0:30:18-0:30:19:**  They tend to be quite a bit smaller.  
**0:30:19-0:30:23:**  They have a great flavored stuff, but they're fairly small and they're, they're hard to  
**0:30:23-0:30:25:**  pick out and stuff.  
**0:30:25-0:30:27:**  Um, all our trees are grafted.  
**0:30:27-0:30:32:**  So, uh, uh, we, uh, we know what each tree is going to produce or each rows, cause each  
**0:30:32-0:30:35:**  rows, uh, the same variety.  
**0:30:35-0:30:38:**  And there's a lot of difference there because we can go in and when we harvest, we harvest  
**0:30:38-0:30:44:**  by variety today, we're gonna, you know, we're gonna harvest this variety and when we get  
**0:30:44-0:30:47:**  done with it, then we'll start on a different variety, but we keep all those separate.  
**0:30:47-0:30:52:**  So when you go to process and clean, we can, you know, we can set our machines up for that  
**0:30:52-0:30:54:**  size nut, because some of them are bigger.  
**0:30:54-0:30:55:**  Some of them are smaller.  
**0:30:55-0:30:57:**  Some of them have real thin outside shells.  
**0:30:57-0:31:00:**  Some have real thick outside shells.  
**0:31:00-0:31:01:**  So all that's taken advantage.  
**0:31:01-0:31:07:**  And when you set a machine to, to take that, to crack that shell, if you have the, your  
**0:31:07-0:31:13:**  machine set to crack a, but kind of has a thick shell when it gets a pecan in that has  
**0:31:13-0:31:16:**  a thin shell, it tends to smash it to pieces and vice versa.  
**0:31:16-0:31:21:**  We can have the machine shut to set to, uh, maybe crack what I want to say, a real thin  
**0:31:21-0:31:25:**  shell and you put a hard shell in there and the machine won't crack it.  
**0:31:25-0:31:29:**  So that way we can get a good process on our pecan for most, all the pecans are cracked  
**0:31:29-0:31:30:**  and, and they shell out.  
**0:31:30-0:31:35:**  Well, uh, we've invested in a lot of equipment of expensive air crackers and stuff where  
**0:31:35-0:31:39:**  most everybody else is still kind of going along with the old style crackers.  
**0:31:39-0:31:44:**  Um, these new crackers really don't tend to work well with a really small thick shell  
**0:31:44-0:31:45:**  natives.  
**0:31:45-0:31:47:**  So that sort of thing.  
**0:31:47-0:31:51:**  And, and, and the graphic varieties are tend to be quite a bit larger and they look a lot  
**0:31:51-0:31:52:**  nicer.  
**0:31:52-0:31:53:**  They have the same flavor and stuff.  
**0:31:53-0:31:58:**  So that, uh, I say blowing the other shells and stuff out, uh, the normal procedure in  
**0:31:58-0:32:03:**  this part of the country is to put five pounds in a paper bag and staple it shut.  
**0:32:03-0:32:08:**  Uh, people can't see what they're buying, uh, and mine they're in a plastic bag, but  
**0:32:08-0:32:13:**  it, you know, that, uh, can, they can see pretty well the whole product in the bag.  
**0:32:13-0:32:16:**  It does have our labels and names and stuff all over and that sort of thing.  
**0:32:16-0:32:18:**  But you can also see what you exactly what you're buying.  
**0:32:18-0:32:22:**  So, and people like that, you know, they like to see what they're going to be buying.  
**0:32:22-0:32:27:**  Uh, you know, it's kind of like, uh, you know, selling like your apples and put them in a  
**0:32:27-0:32:29:**  brown bag and staple it shut.  
**0:32:29-0:32:31:**  It's a lot better to set them on the shelf.  
**0:32:31-0:32:35:**  So people can actually see what they're getting, uh, through the packaging or however.  
**0:32:35-0:32:42:**  So that that's, that's made a lot of difference in, in, in our part of marketing sort of situation  
**0:32:42-0:32:47:**  is also with being so far north of people come in instead of if they're going on to  
**0:32:47-0:32:50:**  the south to get the cons, we're kind of the first ones on the market on coming from the  
**0:32:50-0:32:52:**  north and also from the east.  
**0:32:52-0:32:54:**  So we catch a lot more people that way.  
**0:32:54-0:32:58:**  And I say, you know, we've people know our becomes now they know they're going to get  
**0:32:58-0:33:04:**  a quality pecan, uh, you know, that's been kept, it's not rancid, it's fresh.  
**0:33:04-0:33:05:**  You know, uh, cracked, right.  
**0:33:05-0:33:07:**  It's not going to mold on them, that sort of thing.  
**0:33:07-0:33:11:**  Uh, drive to the, you know, to the perfection that needs to be.  
**0:33:11-0:33:13:**  And I guess that all comes with, with work.  
**0:33:13-0:33:20:**  Uh, you know, I, pecan season and I love it because, uh, I always have to taste test and  
**0:33:20-0:33:21:**  quality check the pecans.  
**0:33:21-0:33:24:**  And so I get to eat a lot of pecans during the fall.  
**0:33:24-0:33:27:**  It seems like so, uh, which is not all bad at either.  
**0:33:27-0:33:28:**  So works out well.  
**0:33:28-0:33:31:**  And maybe that's just to check the moisture and stuff on them.  
**0:33:31-0:33:33:**  So whatever.  
**0:33:33-0:33:35:**  And there's something else that you're, you're bringing up.  
**0:33:35-0:33:42:**  It's um, how, um, you're managing also to produce a certain volume, which is clearly,  
**0:33:42-0:33:46:**  and it's the same thing for the, for what you were talking about them, um, about the  
**0:33:46-0:33:48:**  corn, uh, the sweet corn.  
**0:33:48-0:33:53:**  Um, you know, somehow you've got to have the mechanization as well.  
**0:33:53-0:33:57:**  And that's clearly something that you're investing in, if I understand correctly, um, in order  
**0:33:57-0:34:02:**  to, um, be able to sell at that quality, but also at that scale, right.  
**0:34:02-0:34:05:**  To be able to have a reasonable price or even undercut the price.  
**0:34:05-0:34:06:**  Is that, is that correct?  
**0:34:06-0:34:08:**  Is that something that you're focused on as well?  
**0:34:08-0:34:09:**  That's correct.  
**0:34:09-0:34:15:**  Um, you know, uh, it's, you know, raising it, uh, pecans is, is sort of a thing of scale.  
**0:34:15-0:34:20:**  And I see this so much with a lot of people in the pecan business and men, you know, they  
**0:34:20-0:34:25:**  go out and they're going to plant 10 acres of pecan orchards and which sounds like an  
**0:34:25-0:34:29:**  awful lot and it is, and it's kind of a hobby for them and they get them started.  
**0:34:29-0:34:34:**  But all of a sudden it takes, it's more than a hobby and it's more than you can do by hand  
**0:34:34-0:34:42:**  as far as, you know, harvesting or whatever, or, you know, uh, handling the disease problems  
**0:34:42-0:34:45:**  and insect problems with sprayers and store.  
**0:34:45-0:34:51:**  You know, you need a certain size orchard to afford to have the equipment to take care  
**0:34:51-0:34:52:**  of it.  
**0:34:52-0:34:58:**  If not, you've got a tremendous amount of hand labor and, uh, we don't have that labor  
**0:34:58-0:35:03:**  available in this part of the country to do that sort of thing very well.  
**0:35:03-0:35:08:**  And I'll be too few machines can harvest pecans a lot better than people can by picking up,  
**0:35:08-0:35:14:**  uh, that harvester out there, that pecan machine harvester picks up 98%, 99% of the pecans.  
**0:35:14-0:35:19:**  And probably some of the best people they can pick up by hand and maybe get 60 or 70%  
**0:35:19-0:35:20:**  of them.  
**0:35:20-0:35:22:**  So, you know, they're leaving a lot on the ground out there.  
**0:35:22-0:35:24:**  They just, you know, just can't find.  
**0:35:24-0:35:29:**  So it works better for us to use, uh, you know, be big enough that we can afford the  
**0:35:29-0:35:31:**  harvesters.  
**0:35:31-0:35:36:**  We can afford the cleaners, we can afford the crackers, uh, you know, and the processing  
**0:35:36-0:35:37:**  equipment, storage equipment stuff.  
**0:35:37-0:35:42:**  You know, I've got a large freezer here that we can store, you know, like 80,000 pounds  
**0:35:42-0:35:49:**  of whole nuts in, uh, the problem is, is that, uh, in the pecan business, we, uh, you know,  
**0:35:49-0:35:52:**  store, everybody wants pecans starting the first October.  
**0:35:52-0:35:54:**  And we have to supply that market.  
**0:35:54-0:35:58:**  The problem with is pecans don't start falling to the, about the first of November.  
**0:35:58-0:36:01:**  So we have a large freezer stuff and, you know, by this time of year, they would already  
**0:36:01-0:36:06:**  be, they're already in, in there and, and, uh, and freeze them, take them right on down  
**0:36:06-0:36:08:**  to zero and keep them there.  
**0:36:08-0:36:14:**  All rest of winter, spring, summer, and then in the, maybe in September, we start pulling  
**0:36:14-0:36:20:**  them out, uh, start processing them, uh, by the first October, then we're able to fill  
**0:36:20-0:36:24:**  a lot of our custom orders, our grocery store orders, our bulk food store orders, that sort  
**0:36:24-0:36:30:**  of stuff, and kind of get them taken up on that sort of pecan then run those through  
**0:36:30-0:36:31:**  till October.  
**0:36:31-0:36:34:**  Then we get busy in November, start harvesting.  
**0:36:34-0:36:37:**  That's normally about the time that we, uh, you know, we're pretty well emptied of the  
**0:36:37-0:36:43:**  year before pecans, and then we're able to start on, on, on, on that year's production  
**0:36:43-0:36:47:**  and start to, you know, processing those and moving those through the market.  
**0:36:47-0:36:51:**  That's a busy time of the year, you know, October and November are really super busy  
**0:36:51-0:36:55:**  for us because that's harvest season and we're processing and also on everything.  
**0:36:55-0:36:58:**  So we do hire a little extra help to, to help on that.  
**0:36:58-0:37:02:**  Maybe to run harvesters or to work back here where we're processed, we'll hire a couple  
**0:37:02-0:37:05:**  extra hands, uh, people, part-timers.  
**0:37:05-0:37:08:**  So it works out, works out well for everybody.  
**0:37:08-0:37:09:**  Yeah.  
**0:37:09-0:37:10:**  Yeah.  
**0:37:10-0:37:15:**  And so when you say that you're too big to be a small farmer and too small to be a big  
**0:37:15-0:37:21:**  farmer, that doesn't apply to your, um, that doesn't apply to the pecan orchard of 300  
**0:37:21-0:37:27:**  acres that applies to the whole farm or to the row crop, the corn and soybeans part of  
**0:37:27-0:37:30:**  it.  
**0:37:30-0:37:31:**  That's what that means.  
**0:37:31-0:37:36:**  Yeah, you know, and, and, you know, yeah, I mean, uh, I've got a cleaning plan here  
**0:37:36-0:37:39:**  on the farm that's really, it's pretty well made for a 600 acre orchard.  
**0:37:39-0:37:45:**  Um, I've got 300 acres, um, you know, I'm a little oversized on that, but you know,  
**0:37:45-0:37:47:**  I, that's the smallest they built.  
**0:37:47-0:37:48:**  Wow.  
**0:37:48-0:37:49:**  It's huge.  
**0:37:49-0:37:53:**  I just, it's just difficult to imagine.  
**0:37:53-0:37:56:**  And there's a separate building out there that's got all that equipment in, you know,  
**0:37:56-0:38:02:**  that we bring them in out of the fields and stuff with, with, uh, you know, dump trailers  
**0:38:02-0:38:03:**  and stuff and empty those.  
**0:38:03-0:38:08:**  And from there, they go up there and they, you know, it takes any of the holes and stuff  
**0:38:08-0:38:09:**  and takes those out.  
**0:38:09-0:38:14:**  It takes it as in the sticks out and any dirt clods and stuff out in the stick types out.  
**0:38:14-0:38:17:**  Uh, let me run through an aspirator sucks.  
**0:38:17-0:38:22:**  Anything that pecan maybe doesn't have not filled well, it takes those out.  
**0:38:22-0:38:26:**  And then from there, they go through a, you know, an I-Corps sorter sort of thing that,  
**0:38:26-0:38:30:**  you know, takes a picture of every nut that comes through there.  
**0:38:30-0:38:33:**  And you know, it'll do about 5,000 pounds of nuts an hour.  
**0:38:33-0:38:39:**  So you know, 70 nuts to the pound, you can, you know, 350,000 nuts an hour going through  
**0:38:39-0:38:40:**  there is taking a picture.  
**0:38:40-0:38:45:**  Every one of them decides whether it's a right color, the right texture and the right size.  
**0:38:45-0:38:47:**  And it a little shot of air blows that out.  
**0:38:47-0:38:52:**  And then they come down on a, on another table and stuff, a belt and stuff and a couple people  
**0:38:52-0:38:56:**  there that case it meets something out because those harvesters pick everything up out there.  
**0:38:56-0:39:02:**  That's the same size and weight as a pecan, whether it be a, you know, a rock or a, you  
**0:39:02-0:39:08:**  know, a dirt clod or a piece of stick or a, you know, maybe a shotgun hole or, or, or,  
**0:39:08-0:39:10:**  you know, a bone of some kind, who knows whatever's out there.  
**0:39:10-0:39:13:**  So all it has to be sorted out.  
**0:39:13-0:39:17:**  So, you know, and then they're put into thousand pound bulk bins that we can move around with  
**0:39:17-0:39:19:**  a forklift and dump and stack and store and stuff.  
**0:39:19-0:39:22:**  So that's how we handle those sorts of things.  
**0:39:22-0:39:23:**  So it works out well for us.  
**0:39:23-0:39:27:**  And I can say we're a little, maybe over mechanized, but labor's expensive in this part of the  
**0:39:27-0:39:28:**  country and it's hard to find.  
**0:39:28-0:39:34:**  And so the more we can do by, by machine, a lot better off we are.  
**0:39:34-0:39:40:**  So you've got room to expand your orchard in terms of, you know, the fixed costs would,  
**0:39:40-0:39:44:**  would be able to, to hold some more, some more production, right?  
**0:39:44-0:39:47:**  You could increase the size of your orchard if you, if you wanted to.  
**0:39:47-0:39:48:**  Correct.  
**0:39:48-0:39:51:**  You know, and I've thought about that for the past three or four years.  
**0:39:51-0:39:56:**  And I thought, well, you know, I, you know, I could, I could, you know, I got 40 acres  
**0:39:56-0:39:59:**  down here, man, it's definitely really raised some really nice pecans and it's a good place  
**0:39:59-0:40:00:**  to enter out and do that.  
**0:40:00-0:40:06:**  I think, you know, I'm 65 years old and it's going to take 15 years to get them in production  
**0:40:06-0:40:10:**  and you know, really full production, you know, I'm going to be 85 years old and do  
**0:40:10-0:40:17:**  I really want to, you know, you know, do that till then, I guess maybe I might, but I have  
**0:40:17-0:40:18:**  a commitment, pulled a trigger.  
**0:40:18-0:40:21:**  I mean, the last orchard we planted was about eight years ago.  
**0:40:21-0:40:27:**  So I'm about another 18 acres over there, but kind of in a nice spot.  
**0:40:27-0:40:31:**  But you know, as far as that, I'm, I'm pretty well maxed out.  
**0:40:31-0:40:38:**  I think as far as, you know, orchard I'd plant, I think.  
**0:40:38-0:40:45:**  Are you really going to think about planting?  
**0:40:45-0:40:49:**  I said, yeah, but nah, probably won't, you know, of course there's always an old saying,  
**0:40:49-0:40:52:**  you know, only old men plant trees.  
**0:40:52-0:40:55:**  And you know, I used to laugh about that.  
**0:40:55-0:40:58:**  And there's my dad wanted to plant trees all the time and stuff.  
**0:40:58-0:41:04:**  And he was an old man because I came along fairly late in life and, and, and that was  
**0:41:04-0:41:05:**  in his life.  
**0:41:05-0:41:09:**  And he, you know, wanted to plant pecan orchards and stuff.  
**0:41:09-0:41:11:**  So that was fine.  
**0:41:11-0:41:13:**  The thing about it is, is, you know, those saying old men plant trees.  
**0:41:13-0:41:17:**  It's not necessarily true because I planted an awful lot of tree when I was a kid, but  
**0:41:17-0:41:19:**  I had an old man out there making me plant them.  
**0:41:19-0:41:21:**  So I'm kind of glad he did.  
**0:41:21-0:41:26:**  I mean, it's a, it's kind of a nice business to have.  
**0:41:26-0:41:29:**  When I go to bed at night, you know, that tree is right there.  
**0:41:29-0:41:34:**  And when I get up in the morning, it's exactly where it was the night before, you know, and  
**0:41:34-0:41:37:**  I couldn't say the same thing with the beef cow.  
**0:41:37-0:41:38:**  Yeah.  
**0:41:38-0:41:43:**  I've never, I've never thought about it in that way when I was planting trees.  
**0:41:43-0:41:47:**  I don't have to build a fence around them to keep them in.  
**0:41:47-0:41:50:**  Well, we were in Greece, we had to build a fence to keep other things out.  
**0:41:50-0:41:54:**  So we still had to build a fence even if the trees weren't going to run away.  
**0:41:54-0:41:55:**  Yeah.  
**0:41:55-0:41:58:**  But we were farming on, it was 12 acres in this case.  
**0:41:58-0:42:02:**  So another kind of scale.  
**0:42:02-0:42:05:**  So probably our listeners right now are thinking to themselves, when are you going to start  
**0:42:05-0:42:13:**  talking about agroforestry and so I think it's, I'd love to know a bit about you know,  
**0:42:13-0:42:21:**  tell us a bit about the first or the why you started planting grains in between your row  
**0:42:21-0:42:23:**  of trees.  
**0:42:23-0:42:25:**  How did that decision go about?  
**0:42:25-0:42:27:**  Why did you decide to start doing this?  
**0:42:27-0:42:31:**  Tell us a bit about the history behind that part of your system.  
**0:42:31-0:42:32:**  Okay.  
**0:42:32-0:42:40:**  In 1981, we planted the, the, the, the larger orchard over there, about 200 acres in it,  
**0:42:40-0:42:41:**  180.  
**0:42:41-0:42:47:**  And it was in a bottom that, and that was a wheat field and it was all planted in wheat.  
**0:42:47-0:42:54:**  And then in the late winter, early spring, we went down there and set 12,000 flags on  
**0:42:54-0:42:56:**  that.  
**0:42:56-0:43:01:**  They were in 40 foot rows, about 15, 18 foot step down the road.  
**0:43:01-0:43:05:**  The rows were straight as in there, we set them off with a level, took about 10 days  
**0:43:05-0:43:07:**  to do that.  
**0:43:07-0:43:12:**  And to distill this day, it was called the flag farm because it was just a massive flag  
**0:43:12-0:43:17:**  farm and they were white flags on that pretty green wheat down there.  
**0:43:17-0:43:20:**  And so we put them there.  
**0:43:20-0:43:24:**  We went ahead and sprayed right down the row there to kill the wheat out and then planted  
**0:43:24-0:43:26:**  nuts in there.  
**0:43:26-0:43:28:**  And that was the kind of the start of their agroforestry.  
**0:43:28-0:43:35:**  We went ahead and combined the wheat that summer off that the next year, I think we  
**0:43:35-0:43:44:**  planted corn or soybeans and rotated a wheat, corn, soybean crop to there.  
**0:43:44-0:43:45:**  We did the wheat.  
**0:43:45-0:43:49:**  I had a neighbor that would farm and come in and farm between the rows.  
**0:43:49-0:43:54:**  Now you got to remember that's back in the, in the early eighties, mid eighties and early  
**0:43:54-0:43:58:**  nineties and farming was quite a bit different then.  
**0:43:58-0:44:02:**  Our equipment was quite a bit smaller.  
**0:44:02-0:44:11:**  Now my renter has a 65 foot field cultivator and his planters are 50, 80, 50, 60 feet wide.  
**0:44:11-0:44:14:**  But back then everybody was still planted with four and six row planters.  
**0:44:14-0:44:19:**  So we weren't very wide and we could get in there and plant and worked real well.  
**0:44:19-0:44:21:**  And we didn't call it agroforestry back then.  
**0:44:21-0:44:23:**  We just called it farming between the pecan trees.  
**0:44:23-0:44:28:**  Then they came up with this fancy name called agroforestry, which was fine.  
**0:44:28-0:44:34:**  And the whole idea was that we had all that room between the trees, between the rows at  
**0:44:34-0:44:38:**  40 feet that we weren't using, there was probably 30 feet there that wasn't being used.  
**0:44:38-0:44:42:**  So we cropped that and we cropped that in corn, beans, soybean for probably about 16  
**0:44:42-0:44:45:**  or 17 years, if I remember right.  
**0:44:45-0:44:47:**  And at least for 15.  
**0:44:47-0:44:52:**  And then as then we kept getting slow, we were planting 12 rows, then 10 rows, then  
**0:44:52-0:44:53:**  eight rows.  
**0:44:53-0:44:55:**  And then we finally got down to six rows.  
**0:44:55-0:44:59:**  And by the time the trees get to a certain size, the root system starts coming out and  
**0:44:59-0:45:02:**  really starts taking away from the crop out there.  
**0:45:02-0:45:06:**  So we got where it wasn't feasible to farm anymore as far as row crop.  
**0:45:06-0:45:07:**  So we seeded it down to grass.  
**0:45:07-0:45:11:**  And then in our part of the country, our orchards are all seeded down to grass.  
**0:45:11-0:45:14:**  And so we started cutting hay between it and that worked out well.  
**0:45:14-0:45:18:**  We put up a quite a bit of what we call baleage, which is where we go in there and mow the  
**0:45:18-0:45:23:**  hay and the grass in the morning and let it lay for two or three hours and rake it and  
**0:45:23-0:45:28:**  bale it into a small bale and then wrap it where it turns into hay litter or silage sort  
**0:45:28-0:45:29:**  of stuff.  
**0:45:29-0:45:32:**  And that worked out real well because of that, because the trees were getting big enough  
**0:45:32-0:45:37:**  it was starting to shade some, we could still get our hay put up without any problem.  
**0:45:37-0:45:41:**  You know, still have enough sunlight to get it dry as dry hay, or we could go with the  
**0:45:41-0:45:42:**  silage hay.  
**0:45:42-0:45:46:**  With us being in the American bison business or the Buffalo business, you know, we had  
**0:45:46-0:45:49:**  we could haul that and use that to feed our livestock and stuff.  
**0:45:49-0:45:53:**  And you know, when you got three or 400 head of Buffalo on the farm, it takes quite a bit  
**0:45:53-0:45:56:**  of hay in the wintertime and stuff.  
**0:45:56-0:46:01:**  And also we were in the cattle business, we, you know, buying cattle and stuff and we were  
**0:46:01-0:46:06:**  buying what I want to say, older cows that maybe mismanaged in the summer, they were  
**0:46:06-0:46:13:**  pretty thin come this time of year or fall, you know, December, January, we'd buy them,  
**0:46:13-0:46:19:**  order buyers out and buy them and buy them for, you know, a 750 pound cow for, you know,  
**0:46:19-0:46:25:**  $250 and, and, you know, 30 cents a pound, whatever.  
**0:46:25-0:46:30:**  We'd bring her home feed her this excellent hay of baleage or grass hay and start putting  
**0:46:30-0:46:35:**  weight on them, you know, then, you know, pasture them clear up to maybe about the middle  
**0:46:35-0:46:39:**  of June or first of June and then the hamburger market was going pretty good and we'd ship  
**0:46:39-0:46:41:**  them off off the market then.  
**0:46:41-0:46:46:**  Normally we could put about 500 pounds on them, almost double their size and then also  
**0:46:46-0:46:48:**  double the amount of money we got for him.  
**0:46:48-0:46:50:**  So that worked out pretty good payment too.  
**0:46:50-0:46:55:**  So we utilizing that grass between the trees in that situation.  
**0:46:55-0:47:01:**  When I got out of the Buffalo business and the livestock business, it was kind of nice.  
**0:47:01-0:47:04:**  As far as moving hay, I mean, I did sell the hay.  
**0:47:04-0:47:07:**  I had a friend that needed hay a lot.  
**0:47:07-0:47:12:**  He would come in and mow the orchard early in the spring or early part of the summer,  
**0:47:12-0:47:16:**  as soon as you could get in there, mow the hay off of it.  
**0:47:16-0:47:20:**  And then he would pay me for the amount of fertilizer, which was fairly easy to figure  
**0:47:20-0:47:21:**  out how many tons of hay he took off.  
**0:47:21-0:47:25:**  And he'd pay me to put the extra fertilizer back down on the orchard.  
**0:47:25-0:47:29:**  And that way it saved us a mowing of the orchard one morning, and then also keeping that dead  
**0:47:29-0:47:32:**  grass and stuff around.  
**0:47:32-0:47:33:**  That's the question is pretty well dropped now.  
**0:47:33-0:47:38:**  So we just go and keep mowing the orchard, the bigger orchard over there, and just keep  
**0:47:38-0:47:44:**  putting the grass clippings right back down to build up the organic matter of the soil  
**0:47:44-0:47:46:**  and probably help the pecans a little better.  
**0:47:46-0:47:49:**  My younger orchards, we're still mowing hay between them.  
**0:47:49-0:47:54:**  There's not a lot of money to be made selling hay, but I have a large barn we could stack  
**0:47:54-0:47:56:**  almost a thousand big round bales in.  
**0:47:56-0:48:03:**  So you're looking at probably 750 ton of hay I can hold in that barn.  
**0:48:03-0:48:09:**  And we just keep going, don't have a lot of hay, but we keep filling it up.  
**0:48:09-0:48:10:**  About every five years it's full.  
**0:48:10-0:48:14:**  And then that's about the time we have a drought and hay gets to be expensive and I sell it  
**0:48:14-0:48:15:**  then.  
**0:48:15-0:48:20:**  And I've built up a pretty good reputation of having some of the best hay in the country  
**0:48:20-0:48:26:**  and that if you want the very best, you come see Dan.  
**0:48:26-0:48:30:**  It's going to cost a lot of money, but you're going to get some of the best hay in the country.  
**0:48:30-0:48:34:**  You can feed your horses or you can feed your very best cows or whatever you want.  
**0:48:34-0:48:38:**  So that's kind of how we worked that and we built up a nice market of reputation, that  
**0:48:38-0:48:39:**  sort of thing.  
**0:48:39-0:48:45:**  And reputation is this, I have one rule, if I wouldn't eat it, I'm not going to sell it.  
**0:48:45-0:48:49:**  And if I don't like it, you're not going to like it.  
**0:48:49-0:48:54:**  And if you're not going to like it, you're going to tell 20 people you don't like it.  
**0:48:54-0:48:56:**  If you like it, you're only going to tell one person you like it.  
**0:48:56-0:49:00:**  So be real careful not to sell anything that's not up to par or up to snuff.  
**0:49:00-0:49:05:**  So that's been kind of one of our main deals.  
**0:49:05-0:49:08:**  I have one strict rule on the farm, come June 15th, if the hay is not put up, if we've had  
**0:49:08-0:49:11:**  bad weather, we don't put it up that year.  
**0:49:11-0:49:16:**  I mean, it just anytime I bale hay after the 15th of June, the quality goes way down on  
**0:49:16-0:49:19:**  it and I don't want to sell any bad quality hay.  
**0:49:19-0:49:21:**  I always want to sell the best.  
**0:49:21-0:49:27:**  Do you think that the trees have something to do with the quality of the hay as well?  
**0:49:27-0:49:31:**  I'm talking about the trees being there and maybe having an effect on the organic matter  
**0:49:31-0:49:36:**  of the soil or the shade also cooling down in the, I don't know, have you perceived something  
**0:49:36-0:49:37:**  like this?  
**0:49:37-0:49:38:**  I mean, I really noticed something.  
**0:49:38-0:49:40:**  I'm not saying it can happen.  
**0:49:40-0:49:45:**  The only thing about it is the tree gets bigger and if it gets maybe a little later into May,  
**0:49:45-0:49:48:**  the trees leaf out and it makes it hard to get the hay dry enough to bale.  
**0:49:48-0:49:50:**  And that's a problem.  
**0:49:50-0:49:54:**  When we were going with a bay which sort of thing, that worked out pretty well.  
**0:49:54-0:49:58:**  The only problem is it's hard to sell that you have to use that stuff up.  
**0:49:58-0:50:01:**  It's really not a saleable product like dry hay is.  
**0:50:01-0:50:03:**  So it's expensive to haul.  
**0:50:03-0:50:04:**  It's heavy.  
**0:50:04-0:50:08:**  It's got a lot of water in it, but it's excellent feed too.  
**0:50:08-0:50:14:**  So you weren't doing dry hay in your pecan orchard when it had roots?  
**0:50:14-0:50:15:**  I was doing both.  
**0:50:15-0:50:17:**  If I could put it up dry, I'd put it up dry.  
**0:50:17-0:50:20:**  If I could, I'd go ahead and bale it up as baleage.  
**0:50:20-0:50:25:**  So it depended on the climatic conditions at the time of dry hay?  
**0:50:25-0:50:26:**  The corn and beans worked out real well.  
**0:50:26-0:50:30:**  But like I say, finally it got to a situation that just wasn't working.  
**0:50:30-0:50:35:**  The problem with it now is that the chemicals that we used for weed control back in the  
**0:50:35-0:50:41:**  eighties was a lot different than the weed control we use now for soybeans and corn.  
**0:50:41-0:50:49:**  And the pretty well the same chemicals we use for weed control around the pecans was  
**0:50:49-0:50:51:**  the same thing we're using for corn and soybeans.  
**0:50:51-0:50:57:**  Well, like I say, now that's not the truth because Roundup and dicamba and all this other  
**0:50:57-0:50:59:**  kind of stuff is really detrimental to pecans.  
**0:50:59-0:51:00:**  They're real susceptible to it.  
**0:51:00-0:51:04:**  So it kind of limits you on what you can use as far as spray, unless you want to go back  
**0:51:04-0:51:08:**  to the old time stuff where we're cultivating and all that.  
**0:51:08-0:51:16:**  And mainly that's just not really very easy to do and to have equipment small enough to  
**0:51:16-0:51:17:**  get in there to do it.  
**0:51:17-0:51:25:**  Right now, the spray rigs and stuff that take care of weeds and they're spraying 80 foot  
**0:51:25-0:51:30:**  wide booms and it's kind of hard when you've got trees 40 feet apart.  
**0:51:30-0:51:32:**  You can't spray 80 feet wide.  
**0:51:32-0:51:36:**  Luckily though, the fertilizer I have that custom put on now and they do spread 80 feet,  
**0:51:36-0:51:38:**  but it's dry fertilizer.  
**0:51:38-0:51:43:**  So it slings past the trees and they drive down every other road to fertilize that way.  
**0:51:43-0:51:45:**  And that's one of the things I can work on pretty good.  
**0:51:45-0:51:48:**  They have got that where they can sling fertilizer stuff out 80 feet now.  
**0:51:48-0:51:51:**  So it helps out to the, to the just a 40.  
**0:51:51-0:51:54:**  Um, well, I'd say farm has changed a lot.  
**0:51:54-0:51:59:**  Um, you know, on a small Oregon, a small operation, you know, well, I could raise sweet corn or  
**0:51:59-0:52:02:**  I could raise some pumpkins in there and do things a little different, or, you know, maybe  
**0:52:02-0:52:08:**  some other kinds of small crops and stuff, but to do it on any kind of scale to have,  
**0:52:08-0:52:13:**  you know, a decent size pecan orchard, you know, you know, what are you gonna do with  
**0:52:13-0:52:14:**  200 acres of sweet corn?  
**0:52:14-0:52:15:**  That's a lot of sweet corn.  
**0:52:15-0:52:16:**  Yeah.  
**0:52:16-0:52:21:**  No, I can't move that much or, you know, or 200 acres of pumpkins or, or vice versa.  
**0:52:21-0:52:23:**  That's the problem I get into.  
**0:52:23-0:52:30:**  So, um, you know, for me, uh, I need scale to, to, to make it pencil out.  
**0:52:30-0:52:31:**  Yeah.  
**0:52:31-0:52:36:**  And that makes sense then to put the row crops in between your pecan orchard and back in  
**0:52:36-0:52:38:**  the days when you were doing it yourself, do it yourself.  
**0:52:38-0:52:42:**  But, um, nowadays the problem is that you've got to get other people to do it and they  
**0:52:42-0:52:45:**  have machinery that's not adapted.  
**0:52:45-0:52:47:**  And so that kind of creates some trouble, right?  
**0:52:47-0:52:48:**  That's right.  
**0:52:48-0:52:49:**  That's right.  
**0:52:49-0:52:51:**  And like I said, the whole, the whole farming thing has changed in the past 40 years.  
**0:52:51-0:52:57:**  You know, we're really, as far as I'm certain, it's not that conducive to, to, you know,  
**0:52:57-0:53:01:**  to agroforestry row cropping, but you know, per se between the trees and stuff.  
**0:53:01-0:53:06:**  Yeah, no, I was going to just keep going on, on, on what you were talking about with the  
**0:53:06-0:53:07:**  pesticides.  
**0:53:07-0:53:09:**  And that's one of the questions that I had.  
**0:53:09-0:53:12:**  And one of the things that in agroforestry we're trying to understand, it's the, you  
**0:53:12-0:53:19:**  know, the, the management issues, um, and you know, coordinating different management  
**0:53:19-0:53:21:**  regimes, different management needs.  
**0:53:21-0:53:24:**  When you have a row crop, for example, that needs to be weeded somehow.  
**0:53:24-0:53:29:**  And when you have, for example, a tree crop there, um, that suffers from the pesticides,  
**0:53:29-0:53:33:**  are there any other kind of big management problems that you were facing in the 16 years  
**0:53:33-0:53:36:**  that you were, you were into cropping?  
**0:53:36-0:53:41:**  I'm talking about, for example, past passing with, with machinery, compaction and damage  
**0:53:41-0:53:43:**  to potential damage to the roots of the trees.  
**0:53:43-0:53:47:**  Are there any things that you were, you were worried about, uh, with the interaction of  
**0:53:47-0:53:48:**  these two crops?  
**0:53:48-0:53:52:**  Well, I guess the main thing was, is that a lot of times, if you had crop down there  
**0:53:52-0:53:56:**  stuff in the early years, when we really needed to be down there working with the trees, there  
**0:53:56-0:54:00:**  was no way to get down there because, uh, the corn was growing in the fields and, you  
**0:54:00-0:54:04:**  know, how do you, you know, how do you get equipment down through there without knocking  
**0:54:04-0:54:05:**  all the corn stuff down?  
**0:54:05-0:54:07:**  So that was a kind of the problem too.  
**0:54:07-0:54:11:**  We found out and as the trees got bigger, you know, we kept getting a wider space and  
**0:54:11-0:54:15:**  then we wouldn't plant the in rows so we could go down and take care of our trees because  
**0:54:15-0:54:20:**  we were needed to spray them for, you know, for some sort of, you know, like folder or  
**0:54:20-0:54:25:**  bugs that would, you know, defoliate the trees and stuff, which was not good and that sort  
**0:54:25-0:54:26:**  of thing.  
**0:54:26-0:54:34:**  And, and then when they got to, you know, in, uh, into a production, you know, we definitely  
**0:54:34-0:54:36:**  have to drive down through there and stuff.  
**0:54:36-0:54:40:**  And if we had hay and there, you know, you kind of knocked all that down.  
**0:54:40-0:54:45:**  So it was kind of hard to figure around and stuff to, to when we had to spray or fertilizer  
**0:54:45-0:54:49:**  or do other stuff for work or grab those pecans when we spent a lot of time down in those  
**0:54:49-0:54:50:**  young trees.  
**0:54:50-0:54:58:**  So it was a, it was a little different situation on, on, on that as far as, you know, the width  
**0:54:58-0:55:02:**  and stuff on those trees as they got older, just a lot of different management.  
**0:55:02-0:55:08:**  Of course now, you know, we're, you know, we're in the orchard, uh, uh, mowing it.  
**0:55:08-0:55:12:**  We spray a little weed control right around the base of all the trees.  
**0:55:12-0:55:13:**  Trees are big enough.  
**0:55:13-0:55:15:**  We really don't need it, but mainly it keeps vines and stuff from wanting to grow up on  
**0:55:15-0:55:20:**  the trees, poison Ivy vines and, and, and Virginia creeper and trumpet vibes and stuff.  
**0:55:20-0:55:22:**  So it kind of keeps holds that stuff down.  
**0:55:22-0:55:27:**  Uh, being keeper orchards really main looked up like a park.  
**0:55:27-0:55:32:**  Uh, most people don't, uh, they maybe mow it once or twice, right before the year right  
**0:55:32-0:55:33:**  at the harvest.  
**0:55:33-0:55:34:**  That's it.  
**0:55:34-0:55:37:**  It's easier for us to keep the weeds and stuff and the grass down in search and deal and  
**0:55:37-0:55:38:**  keeps it up looking.  
**0:55:38-0:55:39:**  I'm right on a major highway.  
**0:55:39-0:55:45:**  My orchards are on a major highway and, and, uh, they have the, you know, the orchard looking  
**0:55:45-0:55:49:**  nice people think that, you know, if your orchard looks successful, they think you're  
**0:55:49-0:55:52:**  successful and then they want to buy your product.  
**0:55:52-0:55:57:**  And the same way, you know, we, uh, you know, we have a lot of highway right away.  
**0:55:57-0:56:01:**  We keep it all mowed up, looking real nice and everything else and looks on a farm, you  
**0:56:01-0:56:05:**  know, that really doesn't people don't think it pays, but it pays a tremendous amount in  
**0:56:05-0:56:06:**  the long run.  
**0:56:06-0:56:10:**  If the farm's neat and picked up and cleaned and not a lot of brush growing everywhere  
**0:56:10-0:56:13:**  and weeds and stuff, you know, people are more interested in buying from somebody.  
**0:56:13-0:56:19:**  I think he says successful than somebody that's kind of, Oh, you know, place maybe looks a  
**0:56:19-0:56:21:**  little trashy or something like that.  
**0:56:21-0:56:24:**  So, you know, it's part of the sales.  
**0:56:24-0:56:30:**  Matter of fact, one time, you know, we had some, uh, you know, we had a, uh, an Easter  
**0:56:30-0:56:37:**  freeze and, uh, we did not raise a pecan that year, not one pecan.  
**0:56:37-0:56:38:**  And we didn't even open the store that year.  
**0:56:38-0:56:42:**  It was a pretty, pretty sour deal.  
**0:56:42-0:56:46:**  And, uh, well, excuse me, we did open for, we had other stuff going, but we didn't raise  
**0:56:46-0:56:49:**  any because of our own stuff.  
**0:56:49-0:56:52:**  And I said, well, we don't have to harvest any pecans this year.  
**0:56:52-0:56:54:**  So we don't have to keep the orchard all mowed up.  
**0:56:54-0:56:58:**  And so we didn't do the last couple of moments and it got all, you know, got pretty tall  
**0:56:58-0:56:59:**  and stuff.  
**0:56:59-0:57:03:**  And people coming in the farm to buy some Buffalo meat or some champs and jellies and  
**0:57:03-0:57:06:**  other nuts and stuff is, Oh, you're, you're not in the book.  
**0:57:06-0:57:07:**  You're out of the pecan business now.  
**0:57:07-0:57:08:**  Huh?  
**0:57:08-0:57:09:**  And it's a rule.  
**0:57:09-0:57:10:**  No, we're selling pecan business.  
**0:57:10-0:57:12:**  Well, your orchards not all mowed up.  
**0:57:12-0:57:13:**  I thought y'all quit.  
**0:57:13-0:57:14:**  You know, we're out of the pecan business.  
**0:57:14-0:57:20:**  No, just no because there's no need to, to mow it, to pick the harvest of pecans.  
**0:57:20-0:57:25:**  And after, you know, the fourth or fifth person came in when a week's time, uh, told me that  
**0:57:25-0:57:27:**  that thought we were out of the pecan business.  
**0:57:27-0:57:28:**  The employees came in Monday morning.  
**0:57:28-0:57:32:**  I said, all right, guys, we took the mowers off, go back there and hook them on.  
**0:57:32-0:57:34:**  And you know, y'all going to go down and mow the orchard this week.  
**0:57:34-0:57:38:**  I said, at least definitely mow the part of it where they can see from the highway.  
**0:57:38-0:57:41:**  So everybody thinks we're still in the pecan business.  
**0:57:41-0:57:45:**  You know, it costs some money, but you know, it's part of the stuff you just had to do,  
**0:57:45-0:57:48:**  you know, to still stay in business.  
**0:57:48-0:57:52:**  I wonder what do, what did people say when they saw you, um, intercropping?  
**0:57:52-0:57:56:**  Well, I mean, it must've been, it's quite an uncommon, uncommon thing, especially back  
**0:57:56-0:57:57:**  in the days.  
**0:57:57-0:57:58:**  What did people think about that?  
**0:57:58-0:58:01:**  They thought we were crazier than heck.  
**0:58:01-0:58:02:**  Yeah.  
**0:58:02-0:58:03:**  Yeah.  
**0:58:03-0:58:04:**  Yeah.  
**0:58:04-0:58:05:**  Yeah.  
**0:58:05-0:58:06:**  It was kind of funny.  
**0:58:06-0:58:10:**  You, you walk into the, you know, to the restaurant, you know, for maybe breakfast in the morning  
**0:58:10-0:58:14:**  or something, and there's a community table sitting around there and, you know, eight  
**0:58:14-0:58:15:**  or 10 people.  
**0:58:15-0:58:19:**  And all of a sudden you walk in and man, all of a sudden the table just shuts up and stuff.  
**0:58:19-0:58:24:**  And I had an old gentleman with me and I said, I think they were talking about me.  
**0:58:24-0:58:25:**  What'd he said?  
**0:58:25-0:58:26:**  Dan, they talk about you every morning pretty well.  
**0:58:26-0:58:29:**  But he said, maybe this way, if they're not talking about you, you're not doing a damn  
**0:58:29-0:58:30:**  thing.  
**0:58:30-0:58:31:**  So, you know, let them talk.  
**0:58:31-0:58:32:**  That's good.  
**0:58:32-0:58:35:**  You know, if they're not talking about you, you're not doing anything.  
**0:58:35-0:58:40:**  So it was the thing you just do something different.  
**0:58:40-0:58:44:**  I mean, the same reason, you know, you make a little bit doing what everybody else doing,  
**0:58:44-0:58:47:**  but you stand to make a lot more doing what everybody else is not.  
**0:58:47-0:58:49:**  So do something different.  
**0:58:49-0:58:50:**  Yeah.  
**0:58:50-0:58:51:**  Do something different.  
**0:58:51-0:58:52:**  Be a trendsetter.  
**0:58:52-0:58:54:**  You know, some things haven't worked.  
**0:58:54-0:58:59:**  You know, we, we tried stuff that hadn't worked and, and, uh, you know, kind of got, you know,  
**0:58:59-0:59:01:**  we had heart nuts and stuff and they didn't work.  
**0:59:01-0:59:07:**  Dad planted a bunch of filberts and they don't work here in this part of the country.  
**0:59:07-0:59:09:**  We were in the Wiesen business, which is a European bison.  
**0:59:09-0:59:14:**  You know, we were at the largest privately owned herd of reasons in the world one time.  
**0:59:14-0:59:15:**  And that just never did work out.  
**0:59:15-0:59:17:**  So we got rid of them.  
**0:59:17-0:59:21:**  You know, we thought about getting in the deer business, the final deer business, raising  
**0:59:21-0:59:23:**  deer for meat and stuff.  
**0:59:23-0:59:26:**  And we decided either we had to get real big or get out.  
**0:59:26-0:59:30:**  So we got out of that, but, you know, I mean, there's a lot of things we've tried that haven't  
**0:59:30-0:59:34:**  worked and, and that'll, we've tried some things that have worked and, and you just  
**0:59:34-0:59:35:**  keep working through them.  
**0:59:35-0:59:39:**  Probably one of the main things I've seen as a lot of people as they try something and  
**0:59:39-0:59:42:**  they don't see it through, through the end.  
**0:59:42-0:59:46:**  And we found out that if you're going to try something normally, it takes about eight years  
**0:59:46-0:59:51:**  before you really come proficient and professional and economically successful with it.  
**0:59:51-0:59:56:**  And I've seen so many people start stuff in three or four years and they quit whether  
**0:59:56-0:59:59:**  they're almost there, but they quit and don't stick through it.  
**0:59:59-1:00:02:**  And, you know, agroforestry is a sort of seal.  
**1:00:02-1:00:03:**  It's a long-term deal.  
**1:00:03-1:00:06:**  I mean, it's, you know, if you're going to plant it, you need to figure out that you're  
**1:00:06-1:00:08:**  probably going to be there the rest of your life to mess with it.  
**1:00:08-1:00:13:**  So, you know, it's, that's something you're going to start and, you know, two or three  
**1:00:13-1:00:14:**  years probably move on.  
**1:00:14-1:00:17:**  If not, you know, you're not going to be in that business.  
**1:00:17-1:00:19:**  It's a long-term deal.  
**1:00:19-1:00:21:**  Like I say, every morning, you know, I get up, they're still there.  
**1:00:21-1:00:26:**  They haven't, I haven't had to build a fence around them.  
**1:00:26-1:00:32:**  I wanted to go back a bit to the intercropping kind of the details that we were delving into.  
**1:00:32-1:00:34:**  I had a few questions still about that.  
**1:00:34-1:00:35:**  Okay.  
**1:00:35-1:00:41:**  Just to understand, you stopped intercropping about when the trees started entering production,  
**1:00:41-1:00:42:**  right?  
**1:00:42-1:00:45:**  Then you started, then there started to be some logistical issues with, you know, crops  
**1:00:45-1:00:50:**  underneath and, or was it more that you had to change crops?  
**1:00:50-1:00:55:**  Did you start putting more winter wheat, for example, during, how did it work out at that  
**1:00:55-1:00:56:**  level?  
**1:00:56-1:00:57:**  Well, it worked out better for us.  
**1:00:57-1:01:00:**  I say we went corn and beans for about 15 years.  
**1:01:00-1:01:06:**  You know, we, the trees really kind of got maybe production about 20, but the, there  
**1:01:06-1:01:08:**  are five years there that we were in a hay business between them and we were cutting  
**1:01:08-1:01:10:**  hay off of them every year.  
**1:01:10-1:01:16:**  So that was still an agroforestry intercropping deal as far as I'm concerned.  
**1:01:16-1:01:20:**  After that, you know, the trees got in production.  
**1:01:20-1:01:23:**  You know, we still kept some hay between them and stuff, but you know, I forgot a lifestyle  
**1:01:23-1:01:25:**  business better off just to not mess with it.  
**1:01:25-1:01:31:**  And then we could go down and do, you know, take care of the orchard, you know, year round  
**1:01:31-1:01:35:**  all year long, especially anytime in the summer, you know, we didn't have to worry about any  
**1:01:35-1:01:36:**  other crop there.  
**1:01:36-1:01:40:**  We're strictly focusing on the McConnell, the nut crop.  
**1:01:40-1:01:43:**  And that's what we were really, you know, that's where the money was and that's what  
**1:01:43-1:01:44:**  we're after.  
**1:01:44-1:01:49:**  Uh, you know, the agroforestry deal worked out good, you know, did we make a lot of money  
**1:01:49-1:01:50:**  off doing it?  
**1:01:50-1:01:54:**  No, but it, it, it made enough money to pay for the land costs and the input costs and  
**1:01:54-1:01:56:**  everything else.  
**1:01:56-1:02:00:**  So that was real important for those establishment years, especially in the early Sam, because  
**1:02:00-1:02:03:**  we were getting a lot of row crop off of it.  
**1:02:03-1:02:06:**  And as we got down, we got narrow and narrow ones and less than left.  
**1:02:06-1:02:09:**  And then it got to a situation that really wasn't profitable farm anymore.  
**1:02:09-1:02:11:**  So when one probable farmer, then we had to go to his dirt, some third of the thing.  
**1:02:11-1:02:15:**  So we went to the grass situation and now we're still in the grass too.  
**1:02:15-1:02:20:**  So, uh, you know, but, uh, you know, anymore now we're just on the orchards and strictly  
**1:02:20-1:02:24:**  keeping them mowed down and, and then harvest the nuts in the fall.  
**1:02:24-1:02:29:**  But the time we're fertilizing twice a year, we're normally spraying about three times,  
**1:02:29-1:02:37:**  four times a year, uh, you know, Moen, you know, four times a year, you know, just, uh,  
**1:02:37-1:02:40:**  you know, or in the process of printing trees in a bigger orchard, we'll do that about every  
**1:02:40-1:02:44:**  10 years, the young orchards, the other a hundred acres over here, you know, we print  
**1:02:44-1:02:45:**  those every year.  
**1:02:45-1:02:49:**  We're still in the process of grafting some of them, uh, that sort of thing.  
**1:02:49-1:02:55:**  So, you know, it's a, it's a on and on and long, you know, there's always something to  
**1:02:55-1:02:56:**  do.  
**1:02:56-1:02:57:**  And that's the nice thing about it.  
**1:02:57-1:02:59:**  For sure.  
**1:02:59-1:03:03:**  Um, just, um, about, you just mentioned something now that brings up this question.  
**1:03:03-1:03:09:**  Um, you weren't able to, to spray the trees then very easily in the early stages when  
**1:03:09-1:03:10:**  there was a crop there, right?  
**1:03:10-1:03:11:**  I mean, you weren't able to pass.  
**1:03:11-1:03:12:**  Yeah.  
**1:03:12-1:03:15:**  So you hadn't kind of had to compromise there a bit if the trees needed some, but at some  
**1:03:15-1:03:20:**  point they were starting to have fungal infection, they needed some intervention, um, especially  
**1:03:20-1:03:21:**  when they're young.  
**1:03:21-1:03:22:**  I mean, they were getting established.  
**1:03:22-1:03:23:**  They can be quite weak.  
**1:03:23-1:03:26:**  Um, how would you manage, how were you managing that?  
**1:03:26-1:03:30:**  Well that, you know, sort of the big orchard spurs we've got now and stuff, we had a, you  
**1:03:30-1:03:34:**  know, sprayer on a small tractor, you know, hand sprayer and, you know, and going with  
**1:03:34-1:03:37:**  some, uh, malathion or some seven or whatever.  
**1:03:37-1:03:41:**  And mainly, you know, walnut caterpillars and that sort of thing.  
**1:03:41-1:03:43:**  That was a problem and stuff.  
**1:03:43-1:03:47:**  They could defoliate those young trees pretty fast and, and see on top of it took a long  
**1:03:47-1:03:51:**  time to do it, you know, with that, you know, because, uh, you know, earlier we were just  
**1:03:51-1:03:56:**  spraying them around with a, you know, with a small four-wheeler or three-wheeler and,  
**1:03:56-1:03:57:**  uh, uh, a small one.  
**1:03:57-1:04:01:**  Then we went to a smaller tractor and, you know, and to do that, but still, it took a  
**1:04:01-1:04:02:**  lot of time to do that.  
**1:04:02-1:04:08:**  And then was there when we finally got rid of the row crop part of it, then it was easier.  
**1:04:08-1:04:12:**  Then we could go with our, you know, purchase our regular orchard sprayers and stuff.  
**1:04:12-1:04:17:**  And now, you know, a couple of, three years ago, I put her to a very large orchard sprayer  
**1:04:17-1:04:21:**  because my trees were getting really big and tall or I needed that because.  
**1:04:21-1:04:24:**  You know, I don't like to spray.  
**1:04:24-1:04:25:**  I do the most of the spring.  
**1:04:25-1:04:29:**  We spray, let's spray most of the time at night.  
**1:04:29-1:04:32:**  And you know, when you go out at, to go to work at 10 o'clock at night and one till five  
**1:04:32-1:04:36:**  or six in the morning, you know, and then try to do something the next day.  
**1:04:36-1:04:37:**  And then the next night you got to do it.  
**1:04:37-1:04:42:**  It kind of makes for a long day and stuff and the in between there and it really messes  
**1:04:42-1:04:45:**  your sleep cycle up and stuff, but that's a good time to get those done.  
**1:04:45-1:04:51:**  I don't like to spray anymore than a half to it's expensive, but if we don't spray,  
**1:04:51-1:04:55:**  you know, we'll lose probably 80, 90% of our crop.  
**1:04:55-1:04:59:**  And I kind of tell people, I said, you know, and if you have one pecan tree in your yard,  
**1:04:59-1:05:02:**  you know, you probably don't have a lot of fungal disease.  
**1:05:02-1:05:06:**  You get a lot of air movement around it, you know, um, I don't get a whole lot of, you  
**1:05:06-1:05:13:**  know, uh, insect damage to speak of whatever, but it's kinda like a, you know, when these,  
**1:05:13-1:05:17:**  when you, but when you put thousands of these trees together, then it's a magnet for diseases  
**1:05:17-1:05:23:**  and insects and everything else, and, you know, uh, for, uh, you know, right now that  
**1:05:23-1:05:30:**  my main, uh, predator on pecans is, or crows and, and, you know, uh, a murderer crows can  
**1:05:30-1:05:35:**  come in and take a, they can take seven, 800,000 pounds and that's a day off of unit, you know,  
**1:05:35-1:05:40:**  two or $3 a pound that adds up pretty fast over, you know, a few weeks time.  
**1:05:40-1:05:44:**  So we're always, you know, trying to get rid of pests of some kind because everything loves  
**1:05:44-1:05:46:**  a pecan because they're good eating.  
**1:05:46-1:05:49:**  So, and these graft ones are really nice because they've got a thinner shed on them and these  
**1:05:49-1:05:53:**  animals can break them up and get them or insects and get in them a lot easier, you  
**1:05:53-1:05:54:**  know?  
**1:05:54-1:05:58:**  So, uh, you know, we have a spray program and this works pretty well.  
**1:05:58-1:06:02:**  We keep up with it so we don't get a heavy load of insects and stuff load that we have  
**1:06:02-1:06:03:**  to take care of.  
**1:06:03-1:06:07:**  And, you know, people don't want to, you know, buy a pecan and look in there and it's got  
**1:06:07-1:06:10:**  a worm in there, you know, just, you know, it's just not good.  
**1:06:10-1:06:11:**  Yeah.  
**1:06:11-1:06:14:**  It's not good for sales.  
**1:06:14-1:06:17:**  Um, what about, um, the fertility?  
**1:06:17-1:06:20:**  Because at some point you're also fertilizing the row crops.  
**1:06:20-1:06:25:**  Row crops may have, um, different needs, probably have different needs to the pecans.  
**1:06:25-1:06:32:**  Um, and so when you were fertilizing, um, at the beginning, um, at these early stages,  
**1:06:32-1:06:37:**  um, what did you see some kind of, were there some kind of decisions that needed to be made,  
**1:06:37-1:06:41:**  some compromises in terms of either you go for the row crop health, uh, or you go for  
**1:06:41-1:06:42:**  the tree health?  
**1:06:42-1:06:43:**  How did you manage that?  
**1:06:43-1:06:48:**  Normally when we were fertilizing for row crops, um, they were the pecan trees were  
**1:06:48-1:06:50:**  also benefiting from that.  
**1:06:50-1:06:55:**  So that, you know, and, and being a young tree, you know, I mean, uh, we were close  
**1:06:55-1:07:02:**  enough to be getting enough, you know, the fertility wasn't that important that, you  
**1:07:02-1:07:07:**  know, that precise that, you know, cause we're not just growing a tree and it was getting  
**1:07:07-1:07:10:**  plenty of fertilizer from also, you know, especially corn cause you've been a lot of  
**1:07:10-1:07:11:**  nitrogen down on corn.  
**1:07:11-1:07:14:**  And that was late, you know, it was getting in the root system of the young trees.  
**1:07:14-1:07:15:**  Now I'm not saying they're very young trees.  
**1:07:15-1:07:19:**  When they're real young, we went and fertilized them by hand for life to each one by hand,  
**1:07:19-1:07:21:**  because they weren't big enough to go out to get that.  
**1:07:21-1:07:27:**  But as they got larger stuff, uh, the row crop fertilizer took care of the pecan fertilization,  
**1:07:27-1:07:28:**  tree fertilization.  
**1:07:28-1:07:32:**  We went to grass, of course, you know, we went and started fertilizing the orchard and  
**1:07:32-1:07:34:**  the whole deal.  
**1:07:34-1:07:37:**  And Chris, the rat, the reach was pretty well going pretty well all the way across the rows.  
**1:07:37-1:07:43:**  So we're fertilizing the whole, the whole orchard out there, plus the hay crop we were  
**1:07:43-1:07:45:**  doing, which was taking care of that.  
**1:07:45-1:07:49:**  Uh, now we're, you know, where we're not, you know, we're strictly targeting the trees  
**1:07:49-1:07:50:**  and stuff.  
**1:07:50-1:07:55:**  Matter of fact, uh, they, uh, they did soil samples on all the orchards here this past  
**1:07:55-1:07:56:**  week.  
**1:07:56-1:07:57:**  She'd be getting results back here in a week or so.  
**1:07:57-1:08:03:**  And we'd like to do that about once every 10 years or so it's five, 10 years been on  
**1:08:03-1:08:04:**  what we're at.  
**1:08:04-1:08:09:**  Just kind of seeing where we are on our fertility of our soil and what trees might need to take  
**1:08:09-1:08:10:**  and stuff.  
**1:08:10-1:08:11:**  Um, so, uh, okay.  
**1:08:11-1:08:18:**  That's, uh, it would have been good to interview you in a week's time to have the results,  
**1:08:18-1:08:24:**  but I guess we'll just have to do another short five minute episode on the results.  
**1:08:24-1:08:25:**  Yeah.  
**1:08:25-1:08:30:**  So, you know, here probably next year we'll do a leaf sample, you know, and set that stuff  
**1:08:30-1:08:31:**  off and do that.  
**1:08:31-1:08:36:**  Um, you know, yeah, we're, you know, always cause fertility fertilizer is expensive, you  
**1:08:36-1:08:40:**  know, lime's expensive and stuff and keep everything up and then keep the pecan trees  
**1:08:40-1:08:41:**  going to the max.  
**1:08:41-1:08:45:**  You know, it's best to kind of keep seeing every once in a while where we're at and stuff.  
**1:08:45-1:08:50:**  So it makes sense for us.  
**1:08:50-1:08:57:**  And one of the big things in agroforestry is, is worry about competition, um, between  
**1:08:57-1:09:02:**  the row crop, um, including the hay here as well.  
**1:09:02-1:09:07:**  Considering this is obviously a part of an agroforestry practice, um, and, and the pecans.  
**1:09:07-1:09:14:**  Um, so, um, did you, did you see any big problems in terms of water competition?  
**1:09:14-1:09:19:**  I know that we can sometimes find observations where, um, you know, the, the, the, the, uh,  
**1:09:19-1:09:24:**  crops that are close to the trees are performing less well, or sometimes more well if the trees  
**1:09:24-1:09:29:**  has reduced stressed, um, because, you know, there's been some shading in hot summers and  
**1:09:29-1:09:35:**  et cetera in your 16 years or more, um, um, of experience with intercropping.  
**1:09:35-1:09:41:**  Have you noticed in terms of light and shades and water, any, any things that you maybe  
**1:09:41-1:09:42:**  like to share with us?  
**1:09:42-1:09:43:**  You bet.  
**1:09:43-1:09:45:**  Main thing is, you know, we get a dry season stuff.  
**1:09:45-1:09:49:**  You can, you can see exactly where the roots go and you know, you can see the perfect circle  
**1:09:49-1:09:53:**  around the trees that the roots have taken all the moisture out, you know, and the grass  
**1:09:53-1:09:56:**  is dead or not dead, but brown stuff and really show drought.  
**1:09:56-1:10:01:**  And we saw the same thing in, in, in, in corn and soybean production around each one of  
**1:10:01-1:10:05:**  the trees, especially after I got about 10, 12 years old through system, we're starting  
**1:10:05-1:10:06:**  to move out quite a ways and stuff.  
**1:10:06-1:10:11:**  And, uh, you know, definitely a reduction in yield on corn and soybeans.  
**1:10:11-1:10:17:**  Uh, and that's what kinda after that, you know, after about 15 years, it, it really,  
**1:10:17-1:10:19:**  the trees were taken so much from the crop.  
**1:10:19-1:10:24:**  It wasn't really, you know, profitable to keep farming between them.  
**1:10:24-1:10:28:**  Cause the tree just taken too much moisture away from them.  
**1:10:28-1:10:33:**  And I'm sure shading was somewhat of a problem too, because you know, when you got, you know,  
**1:10:33-1:10:36:**  crops growing right next to trees and mainly, I think it's mainly because the roots are  
**1:10:36-1:10:40:**  fighting for moisture and nutrients and also some shade too.  
**1:10:40-1:10:44:**  But like I say, after about 15 years, it pretty well decided that we were not going to be  
**1:10:44-1:10:45:**  in the row crop business anymore.  
**1:10:45-1:10:49:**  We were going to have to go to a hay business or something like that.  
**1:10:49-1:10:51:**  So it worked out better.  
**1:10:51-1:10:57:**  If you were planting soy and corn, how are you managing the interline and the soil in  
**1:10:57-1:10:58:**  the winter?  
**1:10:58-1:11:00:**  Were you leaving it bare or were you leaving it tilled up?  
**1:11:00-1:11:02:**  Were you planting cover crops?  
**1:11:02-1:11:03:**  How are you managing that?  
**1:11:03-1:11:08:**  Uh, normally with corn stalks or something like that, we'd come in in the fall and maybe  
**1:11:08-1:11:11:**  a light desk just to knock the stalks down.  
**1:11:11-1:11:16:**  Uh, you know, to give a ground cover and also, you know, where those, uh, corn roots and,  
**1:11:16-1:11:19:**  and, and corn stalks would maybe tend to start rotting.  
**1:11:19-1:11:25:**  Some come in in spring, you know, we did a lot of no till, uh, you know, back then, uh,  
**1:11:25-1:11:26:**  worked out pretty well.  
**1:11:26-1:11:34:**  Uh, um, you know, but mainly, mainly we probably was, was more conventional tillage because,  
**1:11:34-1:11:39:**  you know, you really can't spray a lot of Roundup down there, uh, on a, on a big situation.  
**1:11:39-1:11:43:**  So, uh, no till, you know, probably wasn't, was not, if I remember right, it was not a  
**1:11:43-1:11:47:**  big deal and it wasn't that big of a deal back then when we were doing that.  
**1:11:47-1:11:54:**  Um, like I say, uh, cover crops, uh, you know, we'd go beans and then get the beans off.  
**1:11:54-1:11:56:**  We had time, we'd go ahead and plant a crop of wheat in there.  
**1:11:56-1:11:59:**  So yeah, the wheat was a cover crop for the winter.  
**1:11:59-1:12:04:**  Uh, but, uh, mainly it was just pretty well, mainly farming practices.  
**1:12:04-1:12:08:**  Uh, it was in a situation, the bottom grounds, we weren't on Hill ground where we had to  
**1:12:08-1:12:10:**  worry about erosion and that sort of thing.  
**1:12:10-1:12:13:**  So, uh, we were pretty open on what we could do.  
**1:12:13-1:12:18:**  We never tried to raise, you know, corn after corn, but corn in, we could go beans for a  
**1:12:18-1:12:21:**  couple of three years, maybe a crop of wheat, then come back in with corn.  
**1:12:21-1:12:27:**  Uh, corn seemed to, to, uh, early years worked out pretty well, but as we got longer, the  
**1:12:27-1:12:31:**  trees tend to really, you know, start the corn in anywhere next to a tree.  
**1:12:31-1:12:35:**  So, uh, and corn was fairly expensive to put in also.  
**1:12:35-1:12:41:**  Um, did you notice a difference between the performance in the latest stages when the  
**1:12:41-1:12:45:**  trees had already established, you know, a strong canopy and a root system, et cetera.  
**1:12:45-1:12:48:**  Did you notice that the wheat was performing differently from the corn and the soy?  
**1:12:48-1:12:53:**  Um, you know, wheat was not, uh, you know, this didn't seem to really make a lot of difference  
**1:12:53-1:12:54:**  on the wheat.  
**1:12:54-1:12:57:**  Um, yeah, that's what we expected.  
**1:12:57-1:12:58:**  Yeah.  
**1:12:58-1:13:01:**  The wheat pretty well do, you know, and like I say, a lot of it's growing gets done before  
**1:13:01-1:13:02:**  the trees get leafed out.  
**1:13:02-1:13:08:**  And, and we did real well, the only problem is that the wheat was never a very profitable,  
**1:13:08-1:13:13:**  you know, it wasn't a lot of profit in wheat, you know, some years are, but a lot of years  
**1:13:13-1:13:15:**  is mainly just kind of a breakeven deal.  
**1:13:15-1:13:22:**  So, uh, you know, we raised some wheat to break stuff up or we could get it in and then  
**1:13:22-1:13:24:**  maybe we can double crop some beans in there.  
**1:13:24-1:13:29:**  But you know, uh, a lot of times it was trying to get the crop out in time to get the wheat  
**1:13:29-1:13:33:**  planted in the fall to, to do that because, uh, my renter, that was kind of the deal.  
**1:13:33-1:13:38:**  He was kind of a little different than hard to get in there and kind of the last thing  
**1:13:38-1:13:43:**  he farmed because, you know, I mean, you're running theoretically over, you know, 200  
**1:13:43-1:13:48:**  acres or, and you're only farming about 140 of it.  
**1:13:48-1:13:51:**  So there's a difference between the rows and stuff.  
**1:13:51-1:13:55:**  So it's a little different out there as far as, you know, you're still running up and  
**1:13:55-1:13:59:**  down the rows, but you're not farming the whole thing, but you're still, you're still  
**1:13:59-1:14:00:**  running up over it.  
**1:14:00-1:14:06:**  So we, you know, and it costs more to farm that way.  
**1:14:06-1:14:09:**  It costs more because of your fuel and planning and all that kind of stuff.  
**1:14:09-1:14:14:**  So it, uh, it was not quite as profitable.  
**1:14:14-1:14:17:**  Still a nice way to make a, you know, some extra money and help pay to establish the  
**1:14:17-1:14:21:**  pecan trees and paid the land payments and stuff off on that ground.  
**1:14:21-1:14:24:**  As far as putting a lot of money in our pockets, it really never did.  
**1:14:24-1:14:26:**  But like I said, it didn't cost us money.  
**1:14:26-1:14:33:**  That was the main thing because the, um, the management or the, the cultivation of the  
**1:14:33-1:14:38:**  wheat and of the soy and corn that also helped with, you know, managing the tree crops.  
**1:14:38-1:14:39:**  Right.  
**1:14:39-1:14:43:**  It helped with, you know, keeping the area clean, uh, managing for competition and et  
**1:14:43-1:14:44:**  cetera.  
**1:14:44-1:14:45:**  Right.  
**1:14:45-1:14:46:**  It was, there was an overlap in management costs.  
**1:14:46-1:14:47:**  Right.  
**1:14:47-1:14:48:**  Well, it's true.  
**1:14:48-1:14:52:**  You know, I say, you know, we have land cost every, you know, so much year for taxes and  
**1:14:52-1:14:55:**  for, you know, we were still paying the farm off and stuff.  
**1:14:55-1:14:57:**  We had loans on that ground.  
**1:14:57-1:15:05:**  So the corn and soybeans, we, they were helping, they were paying the taxes.  
**1:15:05-1:15:08:**  They were paying, you know, the expenses of putting the crop in and harvesting it.  
**1:15:08-1:15:13:**  And it was also paying the land cost off and sometimes put a little money in our extra  
**1:15:13-1:15:15:**  money in our pocket board.  
**1:15:15-1:15:19:**  Sometimes it was a break even and maybe a time or two, it would maybe a loss, but not  
**1:15:19-1:15:25:**  too bad, but what it did, it got us land use using that land, where we're getting the pecan  
**1:15:25-1:15:26:**  trees in production.  
**1:15:26-1:15:31:**  And as far as I'm concerned now, the pecan trees are the main crop, the main production  
**1:15:31-1:15:35:**  and, and, and to go after that, because, you know, when I can raise a thousand pounds and  
**1:15:35-1:15:42:**  that's the acre off there and me, you know, wholesale price out of, you know, after I  
**1:15:42-1:15:46:**  get that theory, I'm getting $2 a pound for my production.  
**1:15:46-1:15:50:**  And this year, you know, if I sold them to a shelter, I'd probably get 90 cents or 80  
**1:15:50-1:15:52:**  or 90 cents a pound.  
**1:15:52-1:15:55:**  So I'm making way more than twice as much what I normally would sell into a shelter  
**1:15:55-1:15:57:**  or something like that.  
**1:15:57-1:16:04:**  So it's very for me now just to, to say, yeah, I'm in agroforestry that orchard over there  
**1:16:04-1:16:08:**  is what I almost consider as a matured, you know, that 180 acres, 200 acres is a matured  
**1:16:08-1:16:10:**  agroforestry.  
**1:16:10-1:16:13:**  The other hundred I have are young trees and stuff.  
**1:16:13-1:16:17:**  We're cutting hay off of those instead of farming, but I'm being able to sell the hay  
**1:16:17-1:16:22:**  and storing it and selling it when I can finally make a decent, decent profit on it.  
**1:16:22-1:16:26:**  And you know, as far as I'm concerned, those still orchards are still under the agroforestry  
**1:16:26-1:16:30:**  sort of deal, you know, cause we're taking a double crop off, you know, some of these  
**1:16:30-1:16:33:**  orchards this year, next year, we'll be taking some nuts off of them.  
**1:16:33-1:16:37:**  So we'll be getting double duty out of them, but I see in probably another 10 years or  
**1:16:37-1:16:41:**  so those orchards will not be, you know, we'll probably stop paying them and we'll just strictly  
**1:16:41-1:16:45:**  be keeping them mowed and those trees will be in full production.  
**1:16:45-1:16:48:**  And, you know, we'll be rocking and rolling with those things.  
**1:16:48-1:16:54:**  So those are all different, you know, those are different to grafting to different varieties,  
**1:16:54-1:17:01:**  which are a lot better, a lot more, a lot better nut than what we, we grafted with,  
**1:17:01-1:17:03:**  you know, 30 years ago.  
**1:17:03-1:17:05:**  So right.  
**1:17:05-1:17:10:**  You obviously have a lot of constraints as well with your type of crops peaking, because  
**1:17:10-1:17:14:**  for example, the peaking, they drop on the floor and you have it in front of the floor.  
**1:17:14-1:17:16:**  You can't get animals involved.  
**1:17:16-1:17:21:**  You can't put animals around that are going to be, you know, spreading their manure around  
**1:17:21-1:17:23:**  the trees and that then going to get mixed up with the nuts.  
**1:17:23-1:17:24:**  Right.  
**1:17:24-1:17:25:**  That's a challenge for you.  
**1:17:25-1:17:26:**  That's true.  
**1:17:26-1:17:28:**  And for us, you know, a lot of people go ahead and, you know, pasture some of their native  
**1:17:28-1:17:30:**  orchards and stuff and that's fine.  
**1:17:30-1:17:35:**  But you know, in my situation down in that bottom, it's wet, you know, the livestock  
**1:17:35-1:17:39:**  and pop the soil and, you know, footprint in the mud and, you know, and that falls in  
**1:17:39-1:17:41:**  or I can't pick it up out of there.  
**1:17:41-1:17:42:**  So I'll lose a lot of that.  
**1:17:42-1:17:47:**  I can't fight the manure cause you know, there's enough probably manure down there anyway,  
**1:17:47-1:17:52:**  from the deer and the coyotes and the coons and the raccoons and the skunks and possums  
**1:17:52-1:17:55:**  and all the birds flying around and stuff.  
**1:17:55-1:17:59:**  Anyway, we go ahead and sanitize these pecans and stuff when we process them.  
**1:17:59-1:18:03:**  But any more than that, you know, I don't want livestock when they're in there plus  
**1:18:03-1:18:05:**  fencing and stuff.  
**1:18:05-1:18:10:**  Probably to have that 200 acres in there under there, I'd probably have to cross fence and  
**1:18:10-1:18:11:**  stuff.  
**1:18:11-1:18:16:**  But when I'm spraying at night, I don't want to get out of that tractor and open 25 gates,  
**1:18:16-1:18:22:**  you know, all night long, you know, and down through there, you know, especially on young  
**1:18:22-1:18:24:**  trees that livestock could be hard on them.  
**1:18:24-1:18:29:**  They love eating on the leaves and limbs and stuff and unrubbing on the trees and that  
**1:18:29-1:18:30:**  sort of thing.  
**1:18:30-1:18:34:**  So, you know, it really had to be a mature orchard before I could even pasture it anyway,  
**1:18:34-1:18:37:**  that it had to fence all the rows of the trees off.  
**1:18:37-1:18:42:**  And then, you know, you get a situation where you're, you know, just fenced everywhere and,  
**1:18:42-1:18:49:**  you know, no, it's better off just to run row, crop or cut hay than it is to put livestock  
**1:18:49-1:18:52:**  in there, as far as I'm concerned.  
**1:18:52-1:18:56:**  I don't know a whole lot of people, especially on young orchards that are running livestock  
**1:18:56-1:18:57:**  in there at all.  
**1:18:57-1:19:00:**  If they are, that's a really small orchard and they'd probably do that.  
**1:19:00-1:19:03:**  But on a large scale, it would be pretty tough to do.  
**1:19:03-1:19:07:**  And like I say, and to get the livestock to evenly graze it unless you, you know, you  
**1:19:07-1:19:12:**  cross fence it and make it into paddocks sort of deals where you could rotate your animals  
**1:19:12-1:19:15:**  every two or three days and stuff through there.  
**1:19:15-1:19:20:**  Easier and cheaper for me just to keep it mowed or, you know, bale for hay off of it  
**1:19:20-1:19:25:**  or whatever, than it is to try and run livestock.  
**1:19:25-1:19:30:**  You know, I get sheep, you know, but in our part of the country, we're too damp and sheep  
**1:19:30-1:19:33:**  tend to die.  
**1:19:33-1:19:41:**  It's not sheep country, you know, between the coyotes and the dogs and the, you know,  
**1:19:41-1:19:42:**  this is just not sheep country.  
**1:19:42-1:19:45:**  So it doesn't work very well.  
**1:19:45-1:19:46:**  Okay.  
**1:19:46-1:19:53:**  One of the other aspects that I think would be good to just get into a bit is, you know,  
**1:19:53-1:20:01:**  the management of the row, of the pecan row during the early stages of establishments.  
**1:20:01-1:20:08:**  I mean, during the stages in which you did agroforestry, how did you manage that row?  
**1:20:08-1:20:11:**  Were you using kind of, because I imagine the row was quite thin, it was difficult to  
**1:20:11-1:20:15:**  get into, and you're working at such scale that you've got to mechanize this.  
**1:20:15-1:20:21:**  How did you kind of, you know, get rid of the weeds on the row, do the minimum passage  
**1:20:21-1:20:23:**  of getting to the trees when needed?  
**1:20:23-1:20:24:**  How did you do that?  
**1:20:24-1:20:28:**  Well, we'd come in there, you know, when we first planted stuff, we'd come in and spray  
**1:20:28-1:20:31:**  that row over the top of the trees because the trees weren't, you know, we planted the  
**1:20:31-1:20:33:**  nuts and you planted a nut.  
**1:20:33-1:20:39:**  If you get a tree that grows six, eight inches the first year, you know, above ground growth,  
**1:20:39-1:20:43:**  of course, he's probably got five foot of below ground growth and probably 95% of his  
**1:20:43-1:20:46:**  growth is below ground and 5% is above ground.  
**1:20:46-1:20:52:**  For about three years or so, we went right over the top of those trees early, you know,  
**1:20:52-1:20:56:**  with some herbicide that kept the weeds down and stuff.  
**1:20:56-1:21:00:**  Then we'd come along in the late summer again and probably respray with some other stuff  
**1:21:00-1:21:01:**  to keep the weeds down.  
**1:21:01-1:21:05:**  You know, weed control was probably one of the most important things on young pecan or  
**1:21:05-1:21:06:**  establishment.  
**1:21:06-1:21:11:**  And if you control the weeds, you get the graft, the growth is about two or three times  
**1:21:11-1:21:15:**  as much growth as you do, unless you have, if you have a lot of weed pressure on it.  
**1:21:15-1:21:17:**  So it was really important to keep those down.  
**1:21:17-1:21:20:**  Then when it got to be about four years old, it was tall enough.  
**1:21:20-1:21:23:**  We couldn't spray over the top of many more.  
**1:21:23-1:21:30:**  So we would go around, uh, you know, in the early spring and spray around each tree, uh,  
**1:21:30-1:21:32:**  with a, you know, with a tractor and a hand sprayer.  
**1:21:32-1:21:36:**  And a lot of times we, you know, do two rows at once and just walk down through there and  
**1:21:36-1:21:41:**  just, just, you know, hand spray around and dry the tractor with a pump and everything  
**1:21:41-1:21:43:**  else, but with two hoses on them and do two rows at once.  
**1:21:43-1:21:47:**  It was a three man job, but, uh, that was before you implemented the crop.  
**1:21:47-1:21:48:**  Yeah.  
**1:21:48-1:21:51:**  Before the crops were planted and stuff, we do that and that would take care of the weed  
**1:21:51-1:21:52:**  control for that.  
**1:21:52-1:21:56:**  And then like I say, but then we'd start grafting and, you know, so we had to get it shortened  
**1:21:56-1:21:59:**  up enough where we could get a four-wheelers and stuff down.  
**1:21:59-1:22:05:**  So, you know, the, the row within was probably, you know, a good 10, 12 feet wide.  
**1:22:05-1:22:09:**  So we were taking up 12 feet of a, of a 40, 40 foot.  
**1:22:09-1:22:13:**  So we're down to 28 foot of row crop in there.  
**1:22:13-1:22:17:**  And, you know, we did that 20 foot of row crop for quite a while.  
**1:22:17-1:22:21:**  But then, you know, the tree started getting bigger and, you know, after about 10 years,  
**1:22:21-1:22:24:**  we were down to probably, you know, 24 foot.  
**1:22:24-1:22:30:**  And then at the end of 15 years, we were down to 20 foot, just farm a 20 foot of the 40,  
**1:22:30-1:22:32:**  just half the ground and not cat in the in rows.  
**1:22:32-1:22:35:**  And then after that, it was just going to have to go down and, you know, you just couldn't  
**1:22:35-1:22:37:**  get any equipment, any smaller than that, that would work.  
**1:22:37-1:22:42:**  And so, uh, it was a situation where you got down about 20 feet.  
**1:22:42-1:22:47:**  Then we had to switch to grass or to hay, but a lot of stuff in between are young, you  
**1:22:47-1:22:52:**  know, tying graphs up and, and pruning graphs and pruning trees because young trees need  
**1:22:52-1:22:55:**  a lot of pruning to keep them growing straight.  
**1:22:55-1:22:58:**  And especially when you graph mature wood onto them, because then they start wanting  
**1:22:58-1:22:59:**  to grow every which way.  
**1:22:59-1:23:04:**  And we always try to prune for a central leader to keep the tree growing straight.  
**1:23:04-1:23:09:**  So it was quite a bit of, quite a bit of labor and stuff on that sort of deal back then.  
**1:23:09-1:23:13:**  So we had, we had to have room to get down through there with the still there, the crops  
**1:23:13-1:23:14:**  growing.  
**1:23:14-1:23:16:**  For sure.  
**1:23:16-1:23:19:**  And then, uh, well again, during the pruning, you know, you had room to pass, you had room  
**1:23:19-1:23:23:**  to, to, to pass with the, with the, with the vehicle I imagine.  
**1:23:23-1:23:24:**  And it was the winter anyways.  
**1:23:24-1:23:25:**  Right.  
**1:23:25-1:23:29:**  So in the winter, you didn't have a crop there most times because you were planting corn  
**1:23:29-1:23:30:**  and soy.  
**1:23:30-1:23:32:**  And so there was easy passage, easy intervention.  
**1:23:32-1:23:34:**  Is that correct?  
**1:23:34-1:23:37:**  Some of it, you know, in the pruning stuff, yeah, we didn't have the crop in there, but  
**1:23:37-1:23:41:**  in the summertime of grafting and stuff, the crops are to grow and, and, you know, I'll  
**1:23:41-1:23:44:**  be truthfully here as we went later.  
**1:23:44-1:23:48:**  We didn't raise any corn because you're going to be down to orchard all day working and  
**1:23:48-1:23:50:**  you know, and you're in that corn right next to that corn.  
**1:23:50-1:23:54:**  You don't get much of a breeze blowing through there and they get pretty dang hot here in  
**1:23:54-1:23:56:**  the summertime.  
**1:23:56-1:24:00:**  The trees aren't giving any shade and you're not getting any breeze from that corn because  
**1:24:00-1:24:01:**  the corn standing there.  
**1:24:01-1:24:04:**  Uh, so, uh, you know, it, it tend to get a little hot in there.  
**1:24:04-1:24:08:**  So, you know, soybeans worked a lot better as far as if you were going to spend as much  
**1:24:08-1:24:11:**  time in the orchard back then taking care of those young trees when you had row crops  
**1:24:11-1:24:12:**  growing in there.  
**1:24:12-1:24:13:**  Okay, nice.  
**1:24:13-1:24:22:**  Well, listen, I'm not going to, um, go too much deeper into, into some of these interactions.  
**1:24:22-1:24:24:**  We've covered so much already.  
**1:24:24-1:24:25:**  It's been fascinating.  
**1:24:25-1:24:32:**  Uh, but one of the last questions that I had is, you know, and just looking at the agroforestry,  
**1:24:32-1:24:37:**  so zooming into those systems, um, that you had, uh, implemented for so long and that  
**1:24:37-1:24:39:**  you're still implementing in your younger orchards.  
**1:24:39-1:24:42:**  Um, what are some of the biggest mistakes that you did?  
**1:24:42-1:24:47:**  Um, and you know, if you were to redo it or when you did redo it with the younger orchards,  
**1:24:47-1:24:48:**  what did you change?  
**1:24:48-1:24:53:**  What did you learn that you could share with, with, um, people, listeners that are, that  
**1:24:53-1:24:56:**  are looking to implement similar systems?  
**1:24:56-1:25:00:**  Probably the main thing, you know, we've done since we planted the big orchard in is we've,  
**1:25:00-1:25:07:**  is when I say on it, we checked our fields where, you know, we're 40 foot this way, you  
**1:25:07-1:25:11:**  know, and the trees are 40 feet apart and every way you look, they're in line and stuff  
**1:25:11-1:25:13:**  that is really important.  
**1:25:13-1:25:17:**  And one of the probably most important things is, you know, it's not that hard to do.  
**1:25:17-1:25:20:**  It's fairly easy to do once you figure out how to do it.  
**1:25:20-1:25:21:**  And uh, you know, it's to check them.  
**1:25:21-1:25:25:**  And the reason for that, if you're going to be farming, when you farm in the same direction,  
**1:25:25-1:25:30:**  that same field, the same spot for 15 years in a row, you really mess the drainage up  
**1:25:30-1:25:34:**  and those farms, especially in the bottoms where drainage is so important to get the  
**1:25:34-1:25:36:**  surface water away from those trees, kind of mess that up.  
**1:25:36-1:25:39:**  And it's really kind of hard to straighten up after that.  
**1:25:39-1:25:43:**  If we were had, if we had checked that field, we get a farm to East and West this time and  
**1:25:43-1:25:46:**  North South the next time and stuff and, and done it.  
**1:25:46-1:25:51:**  And then we would have, you know, saved our, our, our, our land use drainage and stuff  
**1:25:51-1:25:53:**  and been a lot better.  
**1:25:53-1:25:57:**  So that's one thing I would mainly say, you know, number two thing, we were probably taking  
**1:25:57-1:26:01:**  the care, a little better care of our trees when we were younger than what we thought.  
**1:26:01-1:26:04:**  Back then we were busy with grass seed, we were busy with Buffalo and all that kind of  
**1:26:04-1:26:05:**  stuff.  
**1:26:05-1:26:08:**  And you know, the pecan trees kind of took a side set to that.  
**1:26:08-1:26:12:**  If any more, I would have probably done a lot more because you know, this, these pecans  
**1:26:12-1:26:16:**  are a, you know, once you haven't planted and graft and taken care of them, you know,  
**1:26:16-1:26:19:**  they're, they're pretty nice profit potential out there.  
**1:26:19-1:26:23:**  Um, you know, I wish we would have grafted different varieties, but back then we didn't  
**1:26:23-1:26:28:**  know what varieties to graft to and some of the varieties we put on just didn't work out.  
**1:26:28-1:26:33:**  So we're in a process of taking those trees out and, and regrafting those sort of things.  
**1:26:33-1:26:38:**  Um, probably the thing, main thing is, is not planting them any sooner.  
**1:26:38-1:26:43:**  I mean, uh, you know, the sooner you plant them, the, you know, the better off you are  
**1:26:43-1:26:46:**  and uh, he was, well, I'll do it next year.  
**1:26:46-1:26:48:**  Well, no, you should have done it the year before.  
**1:26:48-1:26:52:**  And yeah, that's probably the main thing is if you're thinking about it, just go ahead  
**1:26:52-1:26:54:**  and do it.  
**1:26:54-1:26:57:**  As far as orchard layout stuff, they've got some different orchard layouts and stuff where  
**1:26:57-1:27:02:**  they put them on 60 foot centers, which makes it a lot easier farming and stuff between  
**1:27:02-1:27:03:**  them.  
**1:27:03-1:27:07:**  Um, so, you know, I might look at a little different situation on that.  
**1:27:07-1:27:11:**  Probably put pecan trees on the very best ground that I have, you know, some grounds  
**1:27:11-1:27:13:**  better for pecans than others.  
**1:27:13-1:27:16:**  And I wish I'd been a little, I've got some pecans on some ground that's probably not  
**1:27:16-1:27:19:**  the best suited for pecan trees.  
**1:27:19-1:27:24:**  But uh, you know, that, uh, that's probably some of the other, other things that would  
**1:27:24-1:27:26:**  have done a little different.  
**1:27:26-1:27:29:**  Um, that's about it.  
**1:27:29-1:27:39:**  Uh, you know, as far as, as any other thing, uh, I don't know, pretty well about said it  
**1:27:39-1:27:40:**  all on that, I think.  
**1:27:40-1:27:43:**  That's already a lot involved.  
**1:27:43-1:27:45:**  The main thing is do it in scale.  
**1:27:45-1:27:48:**  And that's something, you know, I mean, you know, I've got 300 acres.  
**1:27:48-1:27:53:**  I got 200 acres in production and, and, you know, I could probably get by with a hundred  
**1:27:53-1:27:58:**  acres and still be profitable, but block into any less than a hundred acres.  
**1:27:58-1:28:02:**  And really, I really need 200 that really afford the big equipment and the harvesters  
**1:28:02-1:28:04:**  and the cleaners and all that kind of stuff.  
**1:28:04-1:28:09:**  And then also have enough production to sell, to make it profitable here, to keep the store  
**1:28:09-1:28:11:**  and stuff open.  
**1:28:11-1:28:14:**  And uh, you know, you know, everybody's the way I can have just a little orchard or I  
**1:28:14-1:28:17:**  can have a little thing and sell a few pecans off.  
**1:28:17-1:28:21:**  Well, you can, but you're really not going to make any money off doing that stuff.  
**1:28:21-1:28:23:**  And you're going to do a lot of hand labor and stuff.  
**1:28:23-1:28:27:**  And, you know, I know some guys that are pretty handy and they make some of their own equipment  
**1:28:27-1:28:30:**  stuff, but it's better off to go ahead and buy equipment.  
**1:28:30-1:28:36:**  I found that from companies that make equipment to do what you need to do, and, uh, you might  
**1:28:36-1:28:41:**  be able to save a little money, but I think on the long haul, you know, bought equipment  
**1:28:41-1:28:44:**  is a little better than a lot of homemade stuff.  
**1:28:44-1:28:46:**  Seems to do a better job.  
**1:28:46-1:28:47:**  Nice.  
**1:28:47-1:28:48:**  Nice.  
**1:28:48-1:28:49:**  Very interesting.  
**1:28:49-1:28:57:**  Would you, if you were to start again now plant another 200, 300 acres of with thousands  
**1:28:57-1:29:12:**  and thousands of white flags of, um, of pecan, would you intercrop with corn and soy again?  
**1:29:12-1:29:13:**  Probably not.  
**1:29:13-1:29:16:**  I had to think hard on that.  
**1:29:16-1:29:22:**  Um, like I say, the, the herbicides and stuff to use in the, in the weed pressure we have  
**1:29:22-1:29:32:**  now on, on, on corn and soybeans, you know, if I had to, to make the living, I probably  
**1:29:32-1:29:36:**  would, but if I didn't have to, to make a living off of it, I definitely wouldn't.  
**1:29:36-1:29:37:**  Okay.  
**1:29:37-1:29:39:**  Would you use other crops?  
**1:29:39-1:29:43:**  Would you replace corn and soy by, for example, like you're doing now, uh, just, uh, I'd use  
**1:29:43-1:29:47:**  graphs and then, then market that grass through some sort of an animal.  
**1:29:47-1:29:48:**  Okay.  
**1:29:48-1:29:50:**  That's what, very interesting.  
**1:29:50-1:29:51:**  Yeah.  
**1:29:51-1:29:57:**  I had to think long and hard on that Dimitri because, uh, yeah, I could farm, you know,  
**1:29:57-1:30:05:**  I could go ahead and farm small and, you know, I'd have to do the farming myself and, you  
**1:30:05-1:30:09:**  know, but you know, that, okay, I'm going to have to have my own sprayer and that's  
**1:30:09-1:30:15:**  just to farm 200 acres, which theoretically is only going to be 150 acres.  
**1:30:15-1:30:21:**  You know, even, you know, a planner, a small planner, a six row planner, eight row planner,  
**1:30:21-1:30:28:**  I'm going to have to have, you know, which is going to cost $80,000, you know, to farm  
**1:30:28-1:30:31:**  140 acres.  
**1:30:31-1:30:32:**  You see what I'm saying?  
**1:30:32-1:30:34:**  It gets to be a situation.  
**1:30:34-1:30:37:**  You know, you're going to have to think long and hard about it.  
**1:30:37-1:30:39:**  If that's all you're going to farm.  
**1:30:39-1:30:43:**  Goes back to what you were saying about, you know, the scale question that we talked about  
**1:30:43-1:30:44:**  a lot in this interview.  
**1:30:44-1:30:45:**  Yeah.  
**1:30:45-1:30:47:**  How big are you for it to make sense?  
**1:30:47-1:30:56:**  How much grain can you harvest from the inter crop for it to be a valuable and efficient  
**1:30:56-1:30:57:**  business?  
**1:30:57-1:31:01:**  Hey, you know, this 40 acres and a meal is just, you know, you know, may have worked  
**1:31:01-1:31:07:**  back in the, you know, the turn of the century, back in 1800, 19, early 1900s and stuff.  
**1:31:07-1:31:11:**  But you know, it doesn't it that this doesn't seem to work in 2021.  
**1:31:11-1:31:12:**  Super.  
**1:31:12-1:31:16:**  Well, listen, this is very, very interesting.  
**1:31:16-1:31:24:**  And there's not many people that are doing that have done at such scale, integrating  
**1:31:24-1:31:28:**  different crops with with nuts crop like you've done.  
**1:31:28-1:31:34:**  So thank you so much for taking the time now to share with us your your experience.  
**1:31:34-1:31:36:**  Well, Dimitri, it's been fun.  
**1:31:36-1:31:40:**  I have enjoyed the talk today and stuff.  
**1:31:40-1:31:45:**  Maybe I've maybe I've inspired some people.  
**1:31:45-1:31:46:**  Maybe I haven't.  
**1:31:46-1:31:47:**  I don't know.  
**1:31:47-1:31:50:**  Well, I guess they can decide that on their own.  
**1:31:50-1:31:51:**  Definitely.  
**1:31:51-1:31:53:**  I don't know everything for sure.  
**1:31:53-1:31:57:**  And maybe I look at things a little different than than a lot of people look at this sort  
**1:31:57-1:31:58:**  of thing.  
**1:31:58-1:32:04:**  But I'll be true if you know, I was I got in the farming business or in farming business  
**1:32:04-1:32:06:**  for doing it for a living.  
**1:32:06-1:32:09:**  And if I can't make any money, I can't make a living doing it.  
**1:32:09-1:32:15:**  So I have to figure out something to scale to make it, you know, to make a living out  
**1:32:15-1:32:19:**  of this sort of deal, but to, you know, to afford the toys that I like to have and do  
**1:32:19-1:32:25:**  some travel that I like to travel.  
**1:32:25-1:32:28:**  Thank you so much for making it this far in the episode.  
**1:32:28-1:32:34:**  And we really hope that you enjoyed it and that you learned as much as we did.  
**1:32:34-1:32:41:**  As always, you can find all of the links and all of the information below in the description.  
**1:32:41-1:32:58:**  And we look forward to seeing you next time.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Wed, 15 Sep 2021 17:52:51)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:45:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:47:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:54:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we have the huge pleasure to receive Jaime Elizondo.  
**0:00:54-0:00:56:**  The interview was extremely interesting.  
**0:00:56-0:01:02:**  Of course Jaime, for many of you, may not need an introduction but for others he has  
**0:01:02-0:01:09:**  more than 40 years of experience ranching, consulting and educating in regenerative agriculture.  
**0:01:09-0:01:16:**  And I have to admit that I've been quite surprised to hear how much enthusiasm he has for silvopasture  
**0:01:16-0:01:24:**  and for trees where he's been running quite a few tests on his operation in Florida.  
**0:01:24-0:01:28:**  So he's extremely happy with the results and he is planning on scaling these systems.  
**0:01:28-0:01:34:**  So yeah, I think it's quite interesting to get the point of view of somebody with his  
**0:01:34-0:01:42:**  experience and to understand why he is so interested in integrating trees and creating  
**0:01:42-0:01:45:**  silvopasture systems.  
**0:01:45-0:01:48:**  Hello Jaime and welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:48-0:01:50:**  Hey, hello Dimitri.  
**0:01:50-0:01:52:**  It's nice to be here.  
**0:01:52-0:01:54:**  Great.  
**0:01:54-0:02:03:**  I was thinking that we could maybe start this episode by looking at how you got interested  
**0:02:03-0:02:04:**  in silvopasture.  
**0:02:04-0:02:08:**  What was your first kind of contact with it?  
**0:02:08-0:02:17:**  Okay, that takes me back to 1982 when I was in Monterrey studying agronomy engineer and  
**0:02:17-0:02:22:**  I wanted to make our family ranch more productive.  
**0:02:22-0:02:25:**  I knew that legumes were needed.  
**0:02:25-0:02:30:**  So I was looking into legumes that would work in a tropical environment and there weren't  
**0:02:30-0:02:38:**  any that will really work in that high rainfall environment that got very hot.  
**0:02:38-0:02:43:**  It's a sea level environment in Veracruz state in Mexico.  
**0:02:43-0:02:49:**  So the only one that showed any promise was the Leucaena.  
**0:02:49-0:02:57:**  And the Leucaena ironically is native to Mexico, but most of what I could read because there  
**0:02:57-0:03:04:**  wasn't online back then, I had to read this serum, a publishing from Australia.  
**0:03:04-0:03:12:**  So most of research was done in Australia and not in Mexico.  
**0:03:12-0:03:18:**  And then to make things worse in Australia, they didn't have the special bacteria to digest  
**0:03:18-0:03:23:**  the mimosin in the Leucaena, which in Mexico was native.  
**0:03:23-0:03:29:**  So all the research pointed to that Leucaena was toxic to ruminants.  
**0:03:29-0:03:37:**  And in Mexico it wasn't, but nobody researched that in Mexico until a guy by the last name  
**0:03:37-0:03:45:**  of Jones did isolate the bacteria in Hawaii from goats.  
**0:03:45-0:03:50:**  And then they started to inoculate that bacteria in Australia.  
**0:03:50-0:03:56:**  And suddenly there was no mimosin problem, which in Mexico never was, but nobody wanted  
**0:03:56-0:04:01:**  to plant it, plant the Leucaena because of the research done in Australia.  
**0:04:01-0:04:02:**  Wow.  
**0:04:02-0:04:03:**  Okay.  
**0:04:03-0:04:04:**  That's interesting.  
**0:04:04-0:04:06:**  That's how it is.  
**0:04:06-0:04:07:**  Yeah.  
**0:04:07-0:04:08:**  Yeah.  
**0:04:08-0:04:11:**  That's very interesting.  
**0:04:11-0:04:17:**  And maybe you could tell us a bit more about the family ranch that you mentioned now.  
**0:04:17-0:04:19:**  Is this where you're still working at the moment?  
**0:04:19-0:04:21:**  No, no, no.  
**0:04:21-0:04:25:**  I have my own ranch that I bought in 19...  
**0:04:25-0:04:27:**  No, in two...  
**0:04:27-0:04:29:**  Let me see.  
**0:04:29-0:04:30:**  1990.  
**0:04:30-0:04:31:**  Okay.  
**0:04:31-0:04:35:**  And it's in a drier area, but it has irrigation.  
**0:04:35-0:04:37:**  And I have done silver pasture there.  
**0:04:37-0:04:41:**  I have planted rows of Leucaena.  
**0:04:41-0:04:49:**  First I started planting Leucaena every 90 centimeters rows to graze directly with cattle.  
**0:04:49-0:04:55:**  But then I switched to dairy, a graze dairy.  
**0:04:55-0:05:03:**  We milk 250 cows twice a day on 120 hectares plus the replacements in bulls.  
**0:05:03-0:05:10:**  So the tropical grass that we grow there, Bermuda, grows very fast.  
**0:05:10-0:05:14:**  And it's ready in the summer in 14 to 20 days.  
**0:05:14-0:05:17:**  If you wait longer, it will be over mature.  
**0:05:17-0:05:26:**  And Leucaena, being a tree, takes 35 to 45 days to be mature enough so you do not over  
**0:05:26-0:05:27:**  graze it.  
**0:05:27-0:05:33:**  Over graze is when you regraze the plant before it has fully replenished its reserves.  
**0:05:33-0:05:39:**  So I decided, okay, this is not working.  
**0:05:39-0:05:47:**  But I learned how to direct plant with a no-till drill Leucaena by seed into my paddocks without  
**0:05:47-0:05:54:**  having to plow the land or without having to transplant trees, which costs 30 times  
**0:05:54-0:05:57:**  more than direct planting.  
**0:05:57-0:06:01:**  So with direct planting, and then I heard that in France they are doing the same with  
**0:06:01-0:06:10:**  mulberry and with poplar and willow, you can plant cuttings.  
**0:06:10-0:06:11:**  So there are many ways.  
**0:06:11-0:06:15:**  Please do not try to transplant trees.  
**0:06:15-0:06:18:**  That's very expensive, unless they are very valuable trees.  
**0:06:18-0:06:28:**  Okay, so I started researching and I went into permaculture with Darren Doherty.  
**0:06:28-0:06:37:**  And by then I already had rows of trees, tall trees, every 33 meters to 40 meters in all  
**0:06:37-0:06:39:**  my farm.  
**0:06:39-0:06:50:**  So that created a micro environment that helped bring in more animal, insect and microbiology  
**0:06:50-0:06:53:**  species into my farm.  
**0:06:53-0:06:58:**  And as you know, every new species that you draw in brings another seven with it.  
**0:06:58-0:07:02:**  So that has made the farm more productive.  
**0:07:02-0:07:10:**  We do not use any insecticide, chemicals or fertilizers, and we are beyond organic.  
**0:07:10-0:07:17:**  We also have adapted genetics that can do more with less because they contain genes  
**0:07:17-0:07:19:**  from Africa.  
**0:07:19-0:07:22:**  Okay, very interesting.  
**0:07:22-0:07:24:**  When did you start planting the first trees?  
**0:07:24-0:07:27:**  Just to have an idea of the timeline.  
**0:07:27-0:07:35:**  Yeah, my first planting was in 1985 on my family ranch and the Leucaena grew very fast  
**0:07:35-0:07:42:**  and then it got attacked by a bacillate, an insect that lives near the coast and killed  
**0:07:42-0:07:43:**  it.  
**0:07:43-0:07:51:**  So when I bought my farm, it was further inland and doesn't get that as heavy.  
**0:07:51-0:07:56:**  So we can plant Leucaena and it grows like crazy there.  
**0:07:56-0:08:03:**  But I found that the best seeds were not the ones imported from Australia because Australia  
**0:08:03-0:08:05:**  is a different environment.  
**0:08:05-0:08:10:**  The best variety was the one growing by the side of the road.  
**0:08:10-0:08:16:**  So we started harvesting our own because when I planted the Leucaena that the seed came  
**0:08:16-0:08:26:**  from Australia varieties, the Taramba and another one I don't recall, they didn't work.  
**0:08:26-0:08:27:**  They didn't grow fast enough.  
**0:08:27-0:08:31:**  They got attacked by insects and they didn't thrive.  
**0:08:31-0:08:38:**  But the local one, and there were trees already growing in my farm, those are the best ones.  
**0:08:38-0:08:48:**  Then to inoculate the seed with the mycorrhiza and the nitrogen producing bacteria, I researched  
**0:08:48-0:08:55:**  and I found that the best way was to get soil from around the roots of mature trees that  
**0:08:55-0:08:57:**  were healthy.  
**0:08:57-0:09:07:**  Then you dry that soil and you add 1% to Leucaena seed after scarifying it with hot water and  
**0:09:07-0:09:10:**  then you plant it and it grows so much faster.  
**0:09:10-0:09:12:**  So that's another tip there.  
**0:09:12-0:09:17:**  Okay, that's great because we're getting decades of experience here.  
**0:09:17-0:09:18:**  40 years.  
**0:09:18-0:09:22:**  From you to the test and experiments and seeing what works best.  
**0:09:22-0:09:23:**  It's fascinating.  
**0:09:23-0:09:24:**  Yes.  
**0:09:24-0:09:28:**  So each experiment takes one year at least.  
**0:09:28-0:09:31:**  So it's 40 years experience there.  
**0:09:31-0:09:33:**  Yeah, amazing.  
**0:09:33-0:09:38:**  I mean, just to look a bit more at the big picture before we, of course, we'll zoom into  
**0:09:38-0:09:42:**  a lot of these details and unpack them.  
**0:09:42-0:09:45:**  What were your initial motivations to plant trees?  
**0:09:45-0:09:53:**  What was your objective with integrating trees on your farm?  
**0:09:53-0:09:55:**  To create a savanna effect.  
**0:09:55-0:10:03:**  When you look back on how grassland developed in high rainfall areas or tropical areas or  
**0:10:03-0:10:10:**  subtropical areas, it was by the action of large animals.  
**0:10:10-0:10:16:**  Mammut, mastodon and others that could fell trees.  
**0:10:16-0:10:23:**  So herbivores could graze the grasses in the North America.  
**0:10:23-0:10:31:**  You can find the tall grass prairie species, the big four, big bluestem, little bluestem,  
**0:10:31-0:10:38:**  india grass and switchgrass all along the migration of the bison.  
**0:10:38-0:10:41:**  So it goes from Manitoba, Canada.  
**0:10:41-0:10:48:**  I have seen the tall grass species there to the northern part of Mexico.  
**0:10:48-0:10:55:**  So I have found the same big bluestem grasses growing in Manitoba, Canada and in North near  
**0:10:55-0:10:58:**  Monterey city in Mexico.  
**0:10:58-0:11:03:**  So that tells me that that's how it was developed and maintained.  
**0:11:03-0:11:10:**  When men came into America, at least I'm talking about America, they killed the mastodons and  
**0:11:10-0:11:15:**  mammoths and all that, and they had to use fire to keep the savanna.  
**0:11:15-0:11:20:**  So those migrating herbivores will come in and they could hunt them.  
**0:11:20-0:11:29:**  So when white men came, they found that it was like a garden, but they had already degenerated  
**0:11:29-0:11:36:**  from what it was to where they found it so productive because it was so much better in  
**0:11:36-0:11:41:**  humus content mostly, but they had to burn it and when you burn, you know humus gets  
**0:11:41-0:11:43:**  burned.  
**0:11:43-0:11:47:**  So now we do have other ways to do it.  
**0:11:47-0:11:54:**  We have a caterpillars, bulldozers, and we have cattle that we can manage with the predator  
**0:11:54-0:11:57:**  effect.  
**0:11:57-0:12:02:**  We use elective fences for that and in a ranch, a big ranch that I have been consulting for  
**0:12:02-0:12:11:**  in North Florida and near Tallahassee, Florida, where you can still find the fossilized pollen  
**0:12:11-0:12:14:**  of what was there before.  
**0:12:14-0:12:20:**  Now it's all forest pine forest that they burn every year to keep it a clear brush,  
**0:12:20-0:12:26:**  but you can still find that the forest back then when mammoths were around was mostly  
**0:12:26-0:12:32:**  magnolia and light oak, almost no pine trees, and it wasn't burned every year.  
**0:12:32-0:12:35:**  When you burn every year, you kill those trees.  
**0:12:35-0:12:40:**  That's why we don't find them anymore, but they were there and by some, you can still  
**0:12:40-0:12:47:**  find the bones and the fossils when they were migrating there and when you manage the land  
**0:12:47-0:12:53:**  correctly, we're doing that with total grazing, which includes a non-selective grazing and  
**0:12:53-0:12:55:**  the fur paddock for a full year.  
**0:12:55-0:13:01:**  In those fur paddocks that we use for winter feed, that's where the little blue stem and  
**0:13:01-0:13:04:**  Indian grass is coming back.  
**0:13:04-0:13:10:**  They never knew they had it, but now it's coming back from seed that is more than 200  
**0:13:10-0:13:11:**  years old.  
**0:13:11-0:13:16:**  So that's how we need to manage.  
**0:13:16-0:13:19:**  So I know we need trees.  
**0:13:19-0:13:21:**  Trees recycle nutrients.  
**0:13:21-0:13:29:**  They lower the temperature under them, so when it's hot, you have a more efficient nitrogen  
**0:13:29-0:13:30:**  cycle.  
**0:13:30-0:13:37:**  At least the light bogs, they have a dense network of mycorrhiza that makes nutrients  
**0:13:37-0:13:41:**  available for grasses and other legumes.  
**0:13:41-0:13:48:**  And you have the shade effect, you have the edge effect for wildlife, you have a having  
**0:13:48-0:13:53:**  for small mammals and birds that can prey on your pests.  
**0:13:53-0:14:02:**  So it all works together to bring not only shade and windbreaks, but all of these advantages.  
**0:14:02-0:14:07:**  So we need trees, but we do not need too many trees.  
**0:14:07-0:14:15:**  When you see an industrial planting of pine trees, you don't see animals, you don't see  
**0:14:15-0:14:17:**  wildlife, you don't see many insects.  
**0:14:17-0:14:22:**  They burn it and burn it and burn it, and it becomes a desolate landscape.  
**0:14:22-0:14:26:**  Yeah, I'm very familiar with that type of landscape.  
**0:14:26-0:14:29:**  Everywhere there are these industrial timber systems.  
**0:14:29-0:14:37:**  Yeah, so there's going there to hide, but they need somewhere to browse and graze.  
**0:14:37-0:14:41:**  They don't live in the forest, they hide in the forest.  
**0:14:41-0:14:43:**  Just like cattle did long time ago.  
**0:14:43-0:14:44:**  It makes sense.  
**0:14:44-0:14:48:**  It makes a lot of sense.  
**0:14:48-0:14:55:**  So it comes from a place of biomimicry in a way and of imitating the natural processes  
**0:14:55-0:14:57:**  that you've been observing.  
**0:14:57-0:14:58:**  Absolutely.  
**0:14:58-0:15:00:**  We need to imitate nature.  
**0:15:00-0:15:05:**  When we go against nature, we're going to go broke and we're going to degrade the land  
**0:15:05-0:15:08:**  instead of regenerate the land.  
**0:15:08-0:15:13:**  People ask me, how high can the regenerating process go?  
**0:15:13-0:15:16:**  How high can the humans be?  
**0:15:16-0:15:20:**  How high can the biodiversity and productivity be?  
**0:15:20-0:15:23:**  And I say, I don't know, but it's going up every year.  
**0:15:23-0:15:25:**  That's enough for me.  
**0:15:25-0:15:29:**  I hope someone else continues after I'm gone, but it's going up every year.  
**0:15:29-0:15:30:**  It's improving.  
**0:15:30-0:15:33:**  There is no limit.  
**0:15:33-0:15:37:**  There must be a limit, but we haven't reached it by a long way.  
**0:15:37-0:15:38:**  Yeah, yeah.  
**0:15:38-0:15:42:**  Yeah, the potential could be great.  
**0:15:42-0:15:50:**  I wanted to delve into some of the practicalities of your system.  
**0:15:50-0:15:54:**  The first question that I have is, why Laokena, for example?  
**0:15:54-0:15:56:**  Why this species specifically?  
**0:15:56-0:16:00:**  Okay, for that environment is the one that works the best.  
**0:16:00-0:16:02:**  I try different others.  
**0:16:02-0:16:05:**  Well, there is another one that works equally as well.  
**0:16:05-0:16:12:**  That is Guacima, but it's not a legume.  
**0:16:12-0:16:17:**  When it's not a legume, that means there is no nitrogen fixing.  
**0:16:17-0:16:24:**  The air that we breathe is 78% nitrogen, but it needs to be converted into a nitrate or  
**0:16:24-0:16:28:**  a nitrate so the plants can use it.  
**0:16:28-0:16:32:**  For that, you need a good permeability in your soil.  
**0:16:32-0:16:41:**  For good gas interchange, the earth breaths in at dusk and breaths out at sunrise.  
**0:16:41-0:16:44:**  Then the bacteria can do their job.  
**0:16:44-0:16:51:**  But with Laokena, it has a very strong root and it's a legume tree, so it can fix up to  
**0:16:51-0:16:55:**  300 kilograms of nitrogen per year.  
**0:16:55-0:17:01:**  That equals a ton in some of commercial fertilizer.  
**0:17:01-0:17:04:**  So you've saved that money.  
**0:17:04-0:17:08:**  And if you look into the Mayan people, the native people of south of Mexico and Central  
**0:17:08-0:17:15:**  America, they use Laokena as their main fertilizer for corn crops.  
**0:17:15-0:17:22:**  They will plant alleys of Laokena in rows and in between the rows, the corn, and then  
**0:17:22-0:17:28:**  they will cut the Laokena branches with leaves and lay them in the rows of corn and that  
**0:17:28-0:17:33:**  will release the nitrogen for the corn, nitrogen and phosphorus and others.  
**0:17:33-0:17:42:**  Due to the Laokena being a perennial, their mycorrhiza system is strong and you can see  
**0:17:42-0:17:51:**  the grass growing much better, more than double the height and speed of when you go further  
**0:17:51-0:17:56:**  from the drip line of the Laokena tree.  
**0:17:56-0:18:01:**  So I plant Laokena in Laokena cannot take flooding.  
**0:18:01-0:18:07:**  So in the lower parts, the Guacima can take the flooding and cows love Guacima.  
**0:18:07-0:18:12:**  So I looked at other ranchers, older ranchers around me and some of them, because it's a  
**0:18:12-0:18:19:**  drought prone area, will have a whole paddock of Guacima, which they will cut with a chainsaw  
**0:18:19-0:18:22:**  for the cows in the event of a drought.  
**0:18:22-0:18:30:**  So I have been copying that and now we are pollarding our Laokena once a year for our  
**0:18:30-0:18:34:**  cows in the difficult time of the year when we don't have much forage.  
**0:18:34-0:18:36:**  Okay, nice.  
**0:18:36-0:18:40:**  I think we need to go a bit into that.  
**0:18:40-0:18:43:**  But before I wanted to understand the spacing.  
**0:18:43-0:18:47:**  You said you had it spaced between 35 and 40 meters.  
**0:18:47-0:18:48:**  Why so?  
**0:18:48-0:18:50:**  That's quite wide, for example.  
**0:18:50-0:18:53:**  And so I want to understand a bit why you chose that spacing.  
**0:18:53-0:18:55:**  Yeah, this is a learning process.  
**0:18:55-0:18:57:**  So that was a mistake.  
**0:18:57-0:19:05:**  But I did it because I wanted enough space between the rows so the air, when the wind  
**0:19:05-0:19:13:**  starts to blow, we could have enough space in between so the cows could cool themselves.  
**0:19:13-0:19:15:**  Back then I didn't have very adapted cows.  
**0:19:15-0:19:23:**  I had an Australian Frisian faggywool in hit Orlando and they cannot take the humid heat  
**0:19:23-0:19:24:**  well.  
**0:19:24-0:19:28:**  They come from areas that are much cooler.  
**0:19:28-0:19:32:**  When you hear about Australia being the tropics, yes and no.  
**0:19:32-0:19:38:**  It's in the tropics, but it's much cooler than sea level real tropics in Mexico.  
**0:19:38-0:19:43:**  The high heat index made me do it that way.  
**0:19:43-0:19:47:**  And so we could mow in between the rows and all that.  
**0:19:47-0:19:53:**  Now I am finding that that was a mistake and I'm going to remediate it even though I'm  
**0:19:53-0:19:57:**  60 years old now.  
**0:19:57-0:19:58:**  Why was that a mistake?  
**0:19:58-0:20:00:**  Would you have wanted them to be closer or?  
**0:20:00-0:20:08:**  Yes, because the grass that is further than three meters from the Leucaena trees doesn't  
**0:20:08-0:20:09:**  grow as well.  
**0:20:09-0:20:19:**  So I am reasoning if I can plant a row every 10 meters so I can polar the regrowth every  
**0:20:19-0:20:27:**  year, I will get a double production of the grass and I will get four times more Leucaena  
**0:20:27-0:20:30:**  cuttings than right now for the cows.  
**0:20:30-0:20:37:**  I can at least double my stocking rate and as we know, a stocking rate determines profitability  
**0:20:37-0:20:39:**  on a farm.  
**0:20:39-0:20:43:**  So your stocking rates would go from what to what?  
**0:20:43-0:20:50:**  Right now we are around two and a half, around three animal units per hectare.  
**0:20:50-0:20:54:**  I expect it to go to five or six.  
**0:20:54-0:20:57:**  And that will double profitability.  
**0:20:57-0:20:59:**  Okay.  
**0:20:59-0:21:01:**  That's quite exciting for anybody.  
**0:21:01-0:21:02:**  Very exciting.  
**0:21:02-0:21:05:**  And you are from planting Leucaena the right way.  
**0:21:05-0:21:07:**  Okay, nice.  
**0:21:07-0:21:12:**  So let's talk a bit about that.  
**0:21:12-0:21:18:**  You mentioned you're an expert in planting Leucaena without tilling the earth.  
**0:21:18-0:21:21:**  Could you tell us a bit about your process?  
**0:21:21-0:21:25:**  What's your optimum or optimal technique?  
**0:21:25-0:21:26:**  Yes.  
**0:21:26-0:21:28:**  First use a seed.  
**0:21:28-0:21:33:**  Well I'm going to talk about Leucaena, but I want to mention that in other environments,  
**0:21:33-0:21:36:**  mulberry may be better.  
**0:21:36-0:21:43:**  Mulberry can be planted by seed, harvesting the berries and putting them in a row with  
**0:21:43-0:21:48:**  mulch and protecting with electric wire on both sides, a high tensile.  
**0:21:48-0:21:52:**  So cows don't get in and kill it.  
**0:21:52-0:21:56:**  Then you have to take care of rabbits and deer or they may kill it.  
**0:21:56-0:22:03:**  That's why you need to plant a huge acreage, at least 20 hectares at a time, or they will  
**0:22:03-0:22:07:**  eat it and kill it when it's sprouting.  
**0:22:07-0:22:16:**  Most of the people that transplant little trees, they get the deer or the rabbits or  
**0:22:16-0:22:18:**  hares kill it.  
**0:22:18-0:22:20:**  And that is the reason.  
**0:22:20-0:22:23:**  And I learned that from Australia.  
**0:22:23-0:22:26:**  You need to plant a large acreage to be successful.  
**0:22:26-0:22:29:**  Okay, that's number one.  
**0:22:29-0:22:36:**  Number two, you can plant if it's very cold, poplar, or you can plant willows in England,  
**0:22:36-0:22:42:**  for example, or you can plant, there are many different varieties, black locust.  
**0:22:42-0:22:48:**  There is a tree that is called tree crops by Russell.  
**0:22:48-0:22:49:**  You need to read that book.  
**0:22:49-0:22:50:**  I've read it.  
**0:22:50-0:22:51:**  It's fantastic.  
**0:22:51-0:22:52:**  I advise it to all of our listeners.  
**0:22:52-0:22:53:**  Yeah.  
**0:22:53-0:22:58:**  Yeah, but he doesn't go into detail, but he tells you the possibilities and it's up to  
**0:22:58-0:23:00:**  us to figure it out.  
**0:23:00-0:23:03:**  So we need to figure it out and then communicate to other people.  
**0:23:03-0:23:07:**  So this goes way beyond Mexico and the United States.  
**0:23:07-0:23:09:**  This has to be done worldwide.  
**0:23:09-0:23:14:**  We need more and more trees and productive trees at that.  
**0:23:14-0:23:15:**  Okay.  
**0:23:15-0:23:20:**  So what I do, and I did many different ways.  
**0:23:20-0:23:26:**  One was to plant on agricultural land along with the milo that we were planting to plant  
**0:23:26-0:23:27:**  the Leucaena.  
**0:23:27-0:23:31:**  But that didn't work very well because the Leucaena cannot take competition when it's  
**0:23:31-0:23:32:**  young.  
**0:23:32-0:23:35:**  That's the main problem with the Leucaena.  
**0:23:35-0:23:40:**  It cannot take wheat and grass competition when it's young.  
**0:23:40-0:23:45:**  So whenever you till the ground, that wakes up the monster.  
**0:23:45-0:23:51:**  And the monster is all the seeds that are there of weeds and grasses, and they will  
**0:23:51-0:23:54:**  wake up and grow.  
**0:23:54-0:24:04:**  So now I do an all-till drill planting, but that's the only time in the life that I will  
**0:24:04-0:24:05:**  use a herbicide.  
**0:24:05-0:24:11:**  But you need to use a herbicide, but you can do it with wood vinegar.  
**0:24:11-0:24:19:**  I make biochar and I feed it to the cows and then the cows put it into dung.  
**0:24:19-0:24:24:**  And now it's fully loaded with microorganisms and nutrients and the dung beetles, which  
**0:24:24-0:24:30:**  we have a very high population, take it down into the soil where the biochar will last  
**0:24:30-0:24:33:**  for over a thousand years.  
**0:24:33-0:24:38:**  So I think that offsets the little amount of herbicide I'm going to tell you.  
**0:24:38-0:24:39:**  Okay.  
**0:24:39-0:24:42:**  So first you kill the grass with vinegar.  
**0:24:42-0:24:46:**  I use wood vinegar because it's a byproduct.  
**0:24:46-0:24:52:**  You kill it and then you no-till drill the leucaena seed, which has been scarified by  
**0:24:52-0:24:57:**  putting it in water that is 80 degrees for one minute.  
**0:24:57-0:25:04:**  And then you inoculate it with the ground, the soil, sifted soil that, and first, well,  
**0:25:04-0:25:11:**  after it's dried, the seed, you put a little milk so it will stick the soil to the seed.  
**0:25:11-0:25:19:**  And the sifted soil from the leucaena trees, you take the first 10 centimeters off, then  
**0:25:19-0:25:21:**  the next 10 centimeters, that's what you use.  
**0:25:21-0:25:28:**  At 1%, that's how you inoculate the seed.  
**0:25:28-0:25:36:**  Then you plant it every five centimeters, one seed in the row with the no-till drill.  
**0:25:36-0:25:40:**  I use a one row no-till drill.  
**0:25:40-0:25:41:**  Okay.  
**0:25:41-0:25:45:**  And then it starts to sprout like 15 days later.  
**0:25:45-0:25:46:**  Okay.  
**0:25:46-0:25:52:**  All of its germinates and that's when you have to pay attention.  
**0:25:52-0:26:02:**  Because if the grass that will regrow after you kill it with the vinegar, yeah, you need  
**0:26:02-0:26:04:**  to use one of those weed eaters.  
**0:26:04-0:26:10:**  I use a big one, a Honda, so we can keep it clean and do it very fast from the grass,  
**0:26:10-0:26:11:**  the competition.  
**0:26:11-0:26:18:**  If need be, that's where you can use a herbicide that only kills grasses, but not the goons.  
**0:26:18-0:26:22:**  But you have to use it at half the dose.  
**0:26:22-0:26:27:**  You don't want to kill them, you just want to slow their growth so leucaena can get one  
**0:26:27-0:26:29:**  meter high.  
**0:26:29-0:26:33:**  Once it's one meter high, you don't need to take care of it.  
**0:26:33-0:26:35:**  Otherwise you have to mow, right?  
**0:26:35-0:26:37:**  You were mentioning you have to mow it frequently.  
**0:26:37-0:26:40:**  Not the leucaena, the grass.  
**0:26:40-0:26:49:**  With this, it's a hand held that you go and you clean it by hand.  
**0:26:49-0:26:51:**  So it's a lot of work.  
**0:26:51-0:26:58:**  That's why I don't recommend anymore to plant every 90 centimeters because it gets so hot  
**0:26:58-0:27:02:**  in there when the leucaena grows.  
**0:27:02-0:27:06:**  And the cattle don't do well and the leucaena don't do well.  
**0:27:06-0:27:17:**  It does much better planted at every 10 meters and cut at one meter height, like if you are  
**0:27:17-0:27:21:**  pollarding with a chainsaw.  
**0:27:21-0:27:28:**  But in the chainsaw, instead of oil for the chain, you use vegetable oil for the chain  
**0:27:28-0:27:31:**  so you do not kill the leucaena.  
**0:27:31-0:27:38:**  Okay, that's a lot of stuff to digest here.  
**0:27:38-0:27:40:**  Let's just back up a bit.  
**0:27:40-0:27:44:**  You said you don't recommend planting every 90 centimeters.  
**0:27:44-0:27:50:**  Could you elaborate a bit more on that just to help us understand what it is?  
**0:27:50-0:27:55:**  The first time I planted the leucaena, I planted every 90 centimeters to get more leucaena  
**0:27:55-0:28:00:**  yield and more nitrogen fixing.  
**0:28:00-0:28:09:**  But when it gets hot and humid there in my ranch, it can get to 45 Celsius and 90 humidity.  
**0:28:09-0:28:12:**  And that kills people and cattle.  
**0:28:12-0:28:18:**  So they are not happy to be grazing during that time.  
**0:28:18-0:28:22:**  That's why I left some trees to grow tall to provide shade.  
**0:28:22-0:28:31:**  And now I want to have around 50 trees per hectare, mature trees that are up to seven,  
**0:28:31-0:28:34:**  eight meters tall.  
**0:28:34-0:28:40:**  And then equally distance one from the other.  
**0:28:40-0:28:47:**  And then the leucaena that's in the row in between those large trees, that will be pollarded  
**0:28:47-0:28:48:**  every year.  
**0:28:48-0:28:56:**  Okay, so you're putting very dense leucaena on a line, like every meter they come out  
**0:28:56-0:28:57:**  or something like this?  
**0:28:57-0:29:05:**  No, I planted every five centimeters because some of them will get killed by rabbits, some  
**0:29:05-0:29:09:**  by deer, some will die from disease.  
**0:29:09-0:29:16:**  So you want to end with one leucaena tree or brush every half a meter after years of  
**0:29:16-0:29:18:**  cutting it.  
**0:29:18-0:29:23:**  When you cut it, I went to France to teach a course area in for health care.  
**0:29:23-0:29:33:**  And I saw in a monastery, I saw mulberry trees that had been pollarded for the branches for  
**0:29:33-0:29:37:**  fieldworms every year for 300 years.  
**0:29:37-0:29:42:**  And they were healthy and produce a huge biomass.  
**0:29:42-0:29:43:**  Very interesting.  
**0:29:43-0:29:44:**  Yeah.  
**0:29:44-0:29:52:**  So then the way in which you manage it is, sorry, let's just maybe finish off the establishment.  
**0:29:52-0:29:58:**  So you've applied, either you've passed with a brush cutter or you've applied a herbicide,  
**0:29:58-0:29:59:**  the trees get to one meter?  
**0:29:59-0:30:04:**  No, no, you need to apply the herbicide because if you do it with a brush cutter, the grass  
**0:30:04-0:30:06:**  grows very fast.  
**0:30:06-0:30:09:**  Okay, so that's when you need the herbicide.  
**0:30:09-0:30:16:**  And then the, so you've kept the grass low, the leucaena reaches one meter.  
**0:30:16-0:30:18:**  And then after that, you're safe.  
**0:30:18-0:30:20:**  You can just let go.  
**0:30:20-0:30:21:**  That's correct.  
**0:30:21-0:30:26:**  And once it reaches like three meters, two and a half to three meters, you can start  
**0:30:26-0:30:28:**  pollarding it once a year.  
**0:30:28-0:30:34:**  But it's only for environments that don't get a frost very much because frost will make  
**0:30:34-0:30:36:**  the leaf drop.  
**0:30:36-0:30:39:**  So in other environments, you can use other species.  
**0:30:39-0:30:40:**  Naturally.  
**0:30:40-0:30:43:**  It makes a lot of sense.  
**0:30:43-0:30:47:**  But the competition between, I mean, I'm imagining in the tropics, the grass that you have is  
**0:30:47-0:30:48:**  very vigorous.  
**0:30:48-0:30:53:**  The competition between the grass and the leucaena, doesn't that, I mean, doesn't it  
**0:30:53-0:30:57:**  overpower the leucaena in the first few years?  
**0:30:57-0:31:02:**  For example, in our climate here, we usually protect trees for the first two, three years  
**0:31:02-0:31:03:**  to a certain extent.  
**0:31:03-0:31:09:**  Of course, wild trees are more resistant than non-wild, but yeah, that's why I choose the  
**0:31:09-0:31:12:**  leucaena, which is a legume tree.  
**0:31:12-0:31:15:**  Legume trees grow much faster than other trees.  
**0:31:15-0:31:18:**  Let me tell you what I found in Manitoba, Canada.  
**0:31:18-0:31:20:**  I say, why don't you plant trees here?  
**0:31:20-0:31:21:**  You need trees.  
**0:31:21-0:31:23:**  They didn't have any trees.  
**0:31:23-0:31:25:**  You could see miles and miles and no trees.  
**0:31:25-0:31:28:**  They say, oh, trees don't grow here.  
**0:31:28-0:31:29:**  And I said, what's that?  
**0:31:29-0:31:32:**  It was a, that's a windbreak.  
**0:31:32-0:31:33:**  A windbreak.  
**0:31:33-0:31:34:**  What tree is that?  
**0:31:34-0:31:38:**  Oh, that's a legume tree that they call the caragana.  
**0:31:38-0:31:43:**  That's a Siberian pea brush.  
**0:31:43-0:31:49:**  So we went to see it and it was grazed, browsed by the cows all the way so they could reach.  
**0:31:49-0:31:51:**  Why don't you plant this?  
**0:31:51-0:31:53:**  Oh, I don't know.  
**0:31:53-0:31:54:**  I don't know.  
**0:31:54-0:31:55:**  Okay.  
**0:31:55-0:31:59:**  So that's what they need to plant in places like that.  
**0:31:59-0:32:05:**  It grows like crazy and it's very palatable and it produces nitrogen and it will catch  
**0:32:05-0:32:14:**  the snow and prevent the cattle from drowning in snow and will catch the snow for moisture  
**0:32:14-0:32:20:**  because it doesn't rain much there, but it gets cold and provide very good feed.  
**0:32:20-0:32:23:**  So I don't understand people.  
**0:32:23-0:32:25:**  We need more trees.  
**0:32:25-0:32:30:**  Even in your place, there is one that they planted the Canary Island comes from Australia.  
**0:32:30-0:32:32:**  I don't recall the name.  
**0:32:32-0:32:33:**  Maybe you know it.  
**0:32:33-0:32:35:**  No, right now.  
**0:32:35-0:32:43:**  I think that's the best for Greece and it looks like Locaena, but it's not Locaena.  
**0:32:43-0:32:48:**  I think I have it in mind.  
**0:32:48-0:32:49:**  Doesn't come to me.  
**0:32:49-0:32:51:**  I think I've seen it in the south of Portugal.  
**0:32:51-0:32:56:**  Yeah, Liguim brush.  
**0:32:56-0:32:57:**  What's the name?  
**0:32:57-0:32:59:**  Do you recall it?  
**0:32:59-0:33:01:**  M something.  
**0:33:01-0:33:03:**  They do it.  
**0:33:03-0:33:05:**  M something you said?  
**0:33:05-0:33:06:**  Yeah.  
**0:33:06-0:33:14:**  I don't remember right now, but if you look at Liguim trees in Australia for cattle, that's  
**0:33:14-0:33:17:**  the one they use.  
**0:33:17-0:33:19:**  How much rainfall do you get?  
**0:33:19-0:33:25:**  We get about 600 millimeters on average, but just in the winter.  
**0:33:25-0:33:29:**  I mean, I'm talking now in Greece, where we are in Greece.  
**0:33:29-0:33:34:**  In the summer, we have six months of basically just maybe five millimeters rainfall.  
**0:33:34-0:33:35:**  Okay.  
**0:33:35-0:33:36:**  Then that's the one.  
**0:33:36-0:33:39:**  In Australia, it's also Mediterranean climate.  
**0:33:39-0:33:40:**  So winter rains.  
**0:33:40-0:33:42:**  So that's the tree you need.  
**0:33:42-0:33:46:**  I don't remember right now the name, but I will find it and send it to you.  
**0:33:46-0:33:48:**  I really appreciate it.  
**0:33:48-0:33:49:**  Thank you.  
**0:33:49-0:33:54:**  We've also planted lots of Acacia Salinia.  
**0:33:54-0:33:57:**  I saw some studies where they were giving it to sheep and they had some pretty good  
**0:33:57-0:33:58:**  results.  
**0:33:58-0:34:01:**  But again, these are just a few studies that I read here and there.  
**0:34:01-0:34:05:**  I don't have personal experience with it, but it's definitely in terms of a tree that  
**0:34:05-0:34:10:**  we planted for other reasons like windbreaks and biomass, it's so vigorous.  
**0:34:10-0:34:11:**  It's exceptional.  
**0:34:11-0:34:14:**  It just grows with nothing.  
**0:34:14-0:34:19:**  And that's the one you need because I always tell people don't try to kill who's trying  
**0:34:19-0:34:24:**  to live or grow and don't try to grow who's trying to die.  
**0:34:24-0:34:28:**  That means adapted species.  
**0:34:28-0:34:32:**  And actually also adapted genetics, as you mentioned for your cattle.  
**0:34:32-0:34:36:**  Maybe that's something we can discuss a bit because I think some of our listeners will  
**0:34:36-0:34:41:**  probably think, well, on my cattle, are they adapted to a silver pastoral system?  
**0:34:41-0:34:46:**  Are they adapted to eating tree fodder?  
**0:34:46-0:34:49:**  What could you advise them?  
**0:34:49-0:34:50:**  Okay.  
**0:34:50-0:34:57:**  Goats are the best ones for browsing, but they also kill trees when they peel the bark  
**0:34:57-0:34:58:**  off.  
**0:34:58-0:35:00:**  Then come sheep.  
**0:35:00-0:35:08:**  Sheep love browsing and they would do much better browsing than grazing, grasses, tropical  
**0:35:08-0:35:10:**  grasses, I mean.  
**0:35:10-0:35:12:**  And then cows.  
**0:35:12-0:35:21:**  Most cows that we use are European Bostauros, but some of them have African genes because  
**0:35:21-0:35:27:**  the Muslims invaded Spain and they brought their cattle from Africa.  
**0:35:27-0:35:36:**  And cattle from Africa are much more prone to browsing because they were domesticated  
**0:35:36-0:35:37:**  in Africa.  
**0:35:37-0:35:39:**  So they are African Bostauros.  
**0:35:39-0:35:44:**  I am not referring to Cebu or Indian Bostindigos.  
**0:35:44-0:35:48:**  I am talking about African Bostauros.  
**0:35:48-0:35:51:**  And we have the largest machona herd in Florida.  
**0:35:51-0:35:53:**  I am consulting for them.  
**0:35:53-0:35:59:**  And they are a pure African Bostauros native breed.  
**0:35:59-0:36:05:**  And we have been able to browse exactly the same as with goats, but this cattle, they  
**0:36:05-0:36:07:**  can reach higher.  
**0:36:07-0:36:11:**  So we have goats in the machona.  
**0:36:11-0:36:15:**  And the machona do the same job as the goats.  
**0:36:15-0:36:20:**  So there is a lot of variability in cattle breeds.  
**0:36:20-0:36:21:**  Maybe you have a native breed.  
**0:36:21-0:36:28:**  The more native the breed is in cattle, the more African Bostauros genes they have.  
**0:36:28-0:36:34:**  I have found some very good ones in Portugal, in Sicily, in Spain, and in France.  
**0:36:34-0:36:36:**  No, not in France.  
**0:36:36-0:36:37:**  Okay.  
**0:36:37-0:36:38:**  Interesting.  
**0:36:38-0:36:39:**  Yeah.  
**0:36:39-0:36:40:**  We are in the southern countries, closer to Africa.  
**0:36:40-0:36:42:**  It makes sense.  
**0:36:42-0:36:43:**  Yeah.  
**0:36:43-0:36:44:**  Okay.  
**0:36:44-0:36:49:**  And so because the problem would be, as you said, molecules like mimazine inside the locaena,  
**0:36:49-0:36:51:**  which can be poisonous, right?  
**0:36:51-0:36:57:**  So is this something that really happens in many species, in many trees that we have to  
**0:36:57-0:36:58:**  be careful of?  
**0:36:58-0:37:00:**  Locaena is very easy to fix.  
**0:37:00-0:37:05:**  You just bring the bacteria and you put it in the water trough and they drink it and  
**0:37:05-0:37:08:**  then everybody has it and once in your life, that's it.  
**0:37:08-0:37:12:**  Then they pass it from one cow to the other very fast.  
**0:37:12-0:37:17:**  But the main problem with trees is tannins.  
**0:37:17-0:37:26:**  When wildlife go to browse trees and brush, they communicate like avatar through the underground  
**0:37:26-0:37:31:**  system of mycorrhiza and their tannin levels go up.  
**0:37:31-0:37:35:**  After half an hour of grazing, tannin levels go up.  
**0:37:35-0:37:44:**  So you need the cows to browse a break, a new break in less than half an hour.  
**0:37:44-0:37:45:**  Or you do what I do.  
**0:37:45-0:37:47:**  You pollard the trees.  
**0:37:47-0:37:50:**  Then that doesn't happen.  
**0:37:50-0:38:00:**  Or you find a low tannin species or you use a polyethylene glycol supplement so it will  
**0:38:00-0:38:04:**  trap the tannins in the rumens so they will not do so much harm.  
**0:38:04-0:38:09:**  Okay, so there's some techniques available, some indications there for our listeners.  
**0:38:09-0:38:17:**  But it brings up the question for me, in your low forage production, I guess it's the dry  
**0:38:17-0:38:18:**  winter period, right?  
**0:38:18-0:38:23:**  In your case.  
**0:38:23-0:38:29:**  How much does the locaena represent in terms of food intake?  
**0:38:29-0:38:31:**  What's the percentage?  
**0:38:31-0:38:37:**  I think what you want to know is how much in percentage rate of inclusion the locaena  
**0:38:37-0:38:40:**  can be of the whole intake, right?  
**0:38:40-0:38:44:**  I have done some research.  
**0:38:44-0:38:47:**  In mine they go to 30-50%.  
**0:38:47-0:38:54:**  But I have seen research in Australia after feeding the unecid bacteria that degrades  
**0:38:54-0:39:02:**  the mimosin up to 100% with no problem, 100% locaena.  
**0:39:02-0:39:08:**  You see the locaena has around 22-25% protein.  
**0:39:08-0:39:11:**  So it may be too much protein.  
**0:39:11-0:39:15:**  But the good part is that you do not have to feed protein because protein is very expensive  
**0:39:15-0:39:17:**  nowadays with soybean meal so high.  
**0:39:17-0:39:26:**  So it's a good way to survive through these hard economic times and be more resilient  
**0:39:26-0:39:29:**  by producing your own protein with trees.  
**0:39:29-0:39:33:**  It makes sense and it actually represents quite a big proportion.  
**0:39:33-0:39:36:**  I mean we're talking about quite high percentages.  
**0:39:36-0:39:40:**  It's not just nibbling a bit over here and a bit over there.  
**0:39:40-0:39:47:**  So when I planted every 90 cm my idea was, oh I can go very high in stocking rate, five  
**0:39:47-0:39:56:**  times higher and then if I don't have enough grass I can feed them straw or milo stalks.  
**0:39:56-0:39:58:**  No problem because the protein is in the locaena.  
**0:39:58-0:40:03:**  Well surprise surprise it doesn't grow as well so close together.  
**0:40:03-0:40:06:**  Yeah, okay interesting.  
**0:40:06-0:40:11:**  And actually I had a question earlier on that came up.  
**0:40:11-0:40:15:**  When you're looking at your system you mentioned that you're pollarding them at about a meter  
**0:40:15-0:40:24:**  height but obviously that means quite a certain labour requirement to go in there and to do  
**0:40:24-0:40:30:**  that especially for a big herd as you have and for big acreage.  
**0:40:30-0:40:33:**  And I mean we're talking about a quite significant scale here.  
**0:40:33-0:40:41:**  And so why not do an alternative, a potential alternative of browsing directly on the tree?  
**0:40:41-0:40:45:**  Is that something you've tested and that hasn't worked out at all?  
**0:40:45-0:40:51:**  Yes that didn't work out because if you do not protect the tree the cows will bend the  
**0:40:51-0:40:58:**  branches and consume the leaves and then come back and peel off the bark.  
**0:40:58-0:41:03:**  And when you peel off the bark you kill the locaena.  
**0:41:03-0:41:10:**  The washi they do not peel the bark but it's not flexible so they break the branches.  
**0:41:10-0:41:15:**  And it's the same as if you cut it but cheaper of course.  
**0:41:15-0:41:21:**  And it takes only two persons one hour a day to feed the 250 cows.  
**0:41:21-0:41:23:**  Using the pollarding technique.  
**0:41:23-0:41:27:**  And when you pollard you are certain that the trees don't die.  
**0:41:27-0:41:34:**  When you graze them you're always in some percentage die every year so after 10 or 20  
**0:41:34-0:41:37:**  years you will end with nothing.  
**0:41:37-0:41:38:**  And I don't want to replant.  
**0:41:38-0:41:42:**  I want to do it once in my lifetime and I'm over, I'm finished.  
**0:41:42-0:41:47:**  So by pollarding I had seen it, I told you in France, 300 years old trees.  
**0:41:47-0:41:50:**  Yeah, it makes sense.  
**0:41:50-0:41:52:**  And what do you do with the branches afterwards?  
**0:41:52-0:41:56:**  I mean you've pollarded them, the branches are everywhere, that must be some kind of  
**0:41:56-0:41:57:**  a problem.  
**0:41:57-0:42:03:**  Yes, here comes the nice part about using the yume trees in the tropics.  
**0:42:03-0:42:09:**  If the branches are not thick enough and you cut them every year they will degrade very  
**0:42:09-0:42:13:**  fast and be integrated into the soil.  
**0:42:13-0:42:19:**  This first year that we cut them and they were very thick like up to four inches, the  
**0:42:19-0:42:20:**  branches.  
**0:42:20-0:42:25:**  What we did is after they got all the leaves off and they left the skeletons we cut those  
**0:42:25-0:42:30:**  skeletons and put them inside the fence in the row so they will decompose and add to  
**0:42:30-0:42:32:**  the organic matter for the trees.  
**0:42:32-0:42:33:**  Okay.  
**0:42:33-0:42:37:**  But next year I'm going to be certain to cut them every year.  
**0:42:37-0:42:43:**  Right now, six to seven months old, rig road is around two to three meters high.  
**0:42:43-0:42:44:**  Yeah.  
**0:42:44-0:42:48:**  And so then you can just leave it on the floor and it gets eaten up.  
**0:42:48-0:42:56:**  That's the idea because when I was a young boy, 12 years old, I will make forts out of  
**0:42:56-0:43:02:**  the ukulele branches and I couldn't cut the big ones so they were very slender and they  
**0:43:02-0:43:04:**  will decompose in a few months.  
**0:43:04-0:43:09:**  They will be turned into dirt.  
**0:43:09-0:43:17:**  And I guess also going back a bit to the pollarding vs browsing directly, as the grazier, you  
**0:43:17-0:43:20:**  have more control over how much the animals eat, right?  
**0:43:20-0:43:23:**  So you can kind of play with your nitrogen content.  
**0:43:23-0:43:27:**  You can decide how many branches to cut down, how much to provide.  
**0:43:27-0:43:28:**  Yes.  
**0:43:28-0:43:32:**  And how many trees to let grow for shade.  
**0:43:32-0:43:38:**  Another idea I had a long time ago was to plant, let's say 30% of the paddock, but at  
**0:43:38-0:43:44:**  the end of the rectangular paddock, 30% and then I could open the gate so they could browse  
**0:43:44-0:43:47:**  it every time I want it.  
**0:43:47-0:43:53:**  But the problem with that is that you do not get the benefit from the mycorrhiza and nitrogen  
**0:43:53-0:43:58:**  fixing life in the in the locaena to the whole paddock.  
**0:43:58-0:44:03:**  And I have since, I sent you a video, you can see that three meters on each side of  
**0:44:03-0:44:07:**  the row, it grows double the size than further away.  
**0:44:07-0:44:12:**  Yeah, yeah, it's a fantastic, really interesting.  
**0:44:12-0:44:17:**  So that's why we need trees all around with not only in certain parts of the paddock,  
**0:44:17-0:44:19:**  we need them all around.  
**0:44:19-0:44:20:**  But how are you going to manage fencing?  
**0:44:20-0:44:23:**  Because already, I mean, what's your current fencing situation?  
**0:44:23-0:44:29:**  You've got a wire there throughout the year and then you just connect the electricity  
**0:44:29-0:44:30:**  when the...  
**0:44:30-0:44:37:**  Yeah, it's there year round, it's with PVC posts, three quarters of an inch thick, and  
**0:44:37-0:44:40:**  they are scheduled 40.  
**0:44:40-0:44:41:**  That's important.  
**0:44:41-0:44:42:**  So they last a long time.  
**0:44:42-0:44:48:**  And then because they are, they will be, right now they are 40 meters apart.  
**0:44:48-0:44:49:**  So no problem.  
**0:44:49-0:44:50:**  Yeah.  
**0:44:50-0:44:53:**  And we make them every 10 meters.  
**0:44:53-0:44:59:**  I already ordered the post, we have the seat ready.  
**0:44:59-0:45:05:**  We need to leave in the rows, breaks so the cows can go through those breaks and not have  
**0:45:05-0:45:10:**  to go to the end of the row to go to the next open area.  
**0:45:10-0:45:17:**  So doing it that way, I hope we can get a better forest utilization of the grass and  
**0:45:17-0:45:27:**  more forest produced by the Leucaena effect and more Leucaena to be pollard in our winter.  
**0:45:27-0:45:33:**  And so that seems like quite a big infrastructure cost, but your math shows that it's worth  
**0:45:33-0:45:34:**  it.  
**0:45:34-0:45:40:**  I'm going to tell you why it's worth it because we are irrigating with a low pressure system  
**0:45:40-0:45:43:**  overhead that lends itself to trees.  
**0:45:43-0:45:47:**  You cannot use a center pivot with trees, right?  
**0:45:47-0:45:49:**  Because the trees get in the way.  
**0:45:49-0:45:57:**  So I found a way to do it in a low cost, initial cost and low maintenance and low pressure,  
**0:45:57-0:46:01:**  big drops so they don't get carried by the wind.  
**0:46:01-0:46:09:**  And that way we can irrigate one hectare with very low labor and investment.  
**0:46:09-0:46:16:**  Now to put the fences to that one hectare, it costs like 50 times less than to buy another  
**0:46:16-0:46:17:**  hectare.  
**0:46:17-0:46:24:**  Another hectare to produce double the amount cost you 50 to a hundred times more than putting  
**0:46:24-0:46:27:**  the fences and planting the Leucaena.  
**0:46:27-0:46:34:**  So I prefer to keep the money in my pocket and make a better future investment that will  
**0:46:34-0:46:37:**  continue to improve every year.  
**0:46:37-0:46:45:**  So it's instead of scaling, you're going through the process of really improving the biomass  
**0:46:45-0:46:50:**  and feed potential of the current hectares that you have.  
**0:46:50-0:46:52:**  And that's cheaper for you.  
**0:46:52-0:46:58:**  It makes more sense because with the same people, same management, same investment,  
**0:46:58-0:47:03:**  you can double your production and your profit or triple.  
**0:47:03-0:47:09:**  So that's what I like about this regenerative, achievable pasture systems.  
**0:47:09-0:47:13:**  And another thing, once you have the Leucaena growing, because it gets so hot there and  
**0:47:13-0:47:20:**  with the irrigation, you can start planting other species that grow taller and produce  
**0:47:20-0:47:21:**  fruit.  
**0:47:21-0:47:26:**  And in those places where the cows don't get in, though, because it's a one meter on each  
**0:47:26-0:47:34:**  side, two meter wide swat for the row growth, you can plant vines that produce trees like  
**0:47:34-0:47:35:**  dragon fruit.  
**0:47:35-0:47:36:**  It grows well.  
**0:47:36-0:47:43:**  So you could diversify even further and then be selling dragon fruit, for example.  
**0:47:43-0:47:44:**  Yes.  
**0:47:44-0:47:46:**  Or for our own consumption.  
**0:47:46-0:47:47:**  Yeah.  
**0:47:47-0:47:51:**  I have planted orange trees, mango trees, avocado trees.  
**0:47:51-0:47:55:**  We can plant so many different species.  
**0:47:55-0:47:59:**  You could also, I guess, especially in the tropics, but also in other places, start looking  
**0:47:59-0:48:05:**  at timber as not as necessarily as a viable, not like could be, but I'm not saying just  
**0:48:05-0:48:12:**  necessarily as a full on enterprise, but as an extra thing where in 2013 years down the  
**0:48:12-0:48:16:**  line, it could be huge capital gain for the next generation that's going to pick up the  
**0:48:16-0:48:17:**  farm, for example.  
**0:48:17-0:48:18:**  Yes.  
**0:48:18-0:48:23:**  The species that grow very well there for timber is a thick, thick wood.  
**0:48:23-0:48:25:**  They grow very well there.  
**0:48:25-0:48:29:**  I already planted other for wood that is called a Juana cussely.  
**0:48:29-0:48:33:**  It's a very nice wood for furniture.  
**0:48:33-0:48:36:**  So yes, you can do that.  
**0:48:36-0:48:42:**  We want to have a three levels pasture, the brush to cut, and then a taller tree.  
**0:48:42-0:48:43:**  Yeah.  
**0:48:43-0:48:44:**  Yeah.  
**0:48:44-0:48:48:**  So, I mean, you mentioned we don't want too many trees.  
**0:48:48-0:48:54:**  And one of the reasons I expect is, as you mentioned, sorry, one of the reasons that  
**0:48:54-0:49:00:**  you mentioned already is the airflow that you want to have some movement of air on the  
**0:49:00-0:49:01:**  farm.  
**0:49:01-0:49:02:**  That is one.  
**0:49:02-0:49:08:**  Another one is excessive shade, like in a pine tree forest and nothing grows under it.  
**0:49:08-0:49:09:**  You do not want that.  
**0:49:09-0:49:14:**  You need sunlight to reach the floor so you can have a biodiversity.  
**0:49:14-0:49:17:**  Yeah, yeah, natural.  
**0:49:17-0:49:20:**  Or the wildlife tribe.  
**0:49:20-0:49:25:**  Wildlife tribe in the edge effect where the forest meets the pasture.  
**0:49:25-0:49:31:**  So by doing this, we are creating the most hurt effect areas you can.  
**0:49:31-0:49:33:**  Interesting.  
**0:49:33-0:49:35:**  But what about competition?  
**0:49:35-0:49:39:**  I mean, do you ever, you know, what we're seeing in other circumstances is when there's  
**0:49:39-0:49:43:**  enough water, there's a positive effect on the grass.  
**0:49:43-0:49:49:**  But when there's a drought, then suddenly the species can have a tendency to be selfish  
**0:49:49-0:49:55:**  and then the tree is efficient and is absorbing a lot of the water and therefore the pasture  
**0:49:55-0:49:57:**  takes a hit, for example.  
**0:49:57-0:50:01:**  That's a great observation and one that most people believe.  
**0:50:01-0:50:07:**  But I have consulted in many areas, for example, in Chihuahua, in desert areas, the places  
**0:50:07-0:50:12:**  where the grass grows better is under shrubs and trees.  
**0:50:12-0:50:19:**  In the mountains, when they say, oh, we want to cut all these live oaks, they're shrubs.  
**0:50:19-0:50:26:**  They don't grow tall because they get 12 to 14 inches per year in the summer, in the late  
**0:50:26-0:50:27:**  summer.  
**0:50:27-0:50:31:**  But we told them, look, where is the grass growing better?  
**0:50:31-0:50:33:**  Oh, under the trees.  
**0:50:33-0:50:34:**  And you want to cut them?  
**0:50:34-0:50:36:**  Oh, no.  
**0:50:36-0:50:39:**  The owner immediately said, stop cutting them, stop cutting them.  
**0:50:39-0:50:44:**  But in truth, that's where the grass grows best.  
**0:50:44-0:50:46:**  And it's because of the nutrient recycling.  
**0:50:46-0:50:54:**  The trees are a nutrient pump with deeper roots because of the less temperature, because  
**0:50:54-0:50:56:**  of the diffuse shade.  
**0:50:56-0:51:02:**  We want diffuse shade that you get by spacing of the trees and selecting your species.  
**0:51:02-0:51:11:**  And because of the mycorrhiza, live oaks and leucaena have very good mycorrhiza to bring  
**0:51:11-0:51:14:**  life back to the soil.  
**0:51:14-0:51:19:**  So you don't believe there's a context in which, you know, there will be, you'll have  
**0:51:19-0:51:24:**  to choose between pasture and trees or trees.  
**0:51:24-0:51:26:**  I haven't seen that yet.  
**0:51:26-0:51:33:**  I have seen in desert areas where the trees started to die off, invasive trees like with  
**0:51:33-0:51:41:**  such a mesquite, they will start to die off because the grass being a shallower rooted  
**0:51:41-0:51:48:**  will consume the moisture with higher humus after doing the total grazing process.  
**0:51:48-0:51:51:**  The humus increases.  
**0:51:51-0:51:58:**  You know, 1% organic matter holds at 25,000 gallons per acre of moisture.  
**0:51:58-0:52:04:**  So it doesn't go deep enough for the tree roots and they start to die off.  
**0:52:04-0:52:06:**  That's in desert area.  
**0:52:06-0:52:10:**  So you need management always.  
**0:52:10-0:52:11:**  But you need the trees.  
**0:52:11-0:52:12:**  Don't kill them off.  
**0:52:12-0:52:13:**  Yeah.  
**0:52:13-0:52:19:**  And actually, I mean, this is also what we're trying to investigate here is to understand,  
**0:52:19-0:52:21:**  you know, where does it work and where not.  
**0:52:21-0:52:27:**  Observation, observation, go and look at them and see where the grass grows better.  
**0:52:27-0:52:28:**  Yeah.  
**0:52:28-0:52:29:**  Yeah.  
**0:52:29-0:52:34:**  I mean, talking about this, I just recently posted on our social media of the podcast  
**0:52:34-0:52:37:**  observations from the farm where I'm at at the moment.  
**0:52:37-0:52:43:**  And you'll see where we have tree lines, fruit tree lines that are five meter apart after  
**0:52:43-0:52:46:**  three weeks of drought on the sandy soil.  
**0:52:46-0:52:51:**  The green, the pasture was green and coming back.  
**0:52:51-0:52:56:**  Places where we had about 10 to 15 meters apart in between the tree lines, it was yellow.  
**0:52:56-0:53:01:**  The only thing sticking out was alfalfa and it was 10, 15 meters tall, spotted around,  
**0:53:01-0:53:03:**  but pretty much yellow.  
**0:53:03-0:53:07:**  And it's a pattern the farmer where I'm working, he's seeing this year on year.  
**0:53:07-0:53:10:**  Just one example, we see it in other places.  
**0:53:10-0:53:12:**  That means you need them closer.  
**0:53:12-0:53:13:**  Yeah.  
**0:53:13-0:53:14:**  Yeah.  
**0:53:14-0:53:15:**  That's it.  
**0:53:15-0:53:20:**  And to me, I found we have been observing, observing and every 40 meters is too far apart.  
**0:53:20-0:53:22:**  We need them closer.  
**0:53:22-0:53:24:**  Yeah.  
**0:53:24-0:53:26:**  That's fantastic.  
**0:53:26-0:53:35:**  One of the things that can be confusing with this type of system is the cycles of rotation,  
**0:53:35-0:53:41:**  because one thing is grazing with silver pasture, but of course what you're specialized in is  
**0:53:41-0:53:49:**  non-selective grazing and getting and creating a mobile predator imitating.  
**0:53:49-0:53:53:**  You could describe it much better than I can, but I wanted to understand how that works  
**0:53:53-0:53:55:**  with your silver pasture systems.  
**0:53:55-0:53:59:**  Did you meet any big challenges with having to move the animals regularly?  
**0:53:59-0:54:04:**  I mean, how does that fit in with dynamic rotational systems?  
**0:54:04-0:54:05:**  Oh yeah.  
**0:54:05-0:54:06:**  It's not a problem.  
**0:54:06-0:54:12:**  You see, we need to do non-selective grazing followed by a long enough rest period so they  
**0:54:12-0:54:18:**  replenish fully their energy reserves because we need fat roots.  
**0:54:18-0:54:26:**  Fat roots leads to fat soil, which means high in human content and fat soil leads to fat  
**0:54:26-0:54:35:**  cattle and fat cattle can give you a fat wallet, but it all starts with fat roots.  
**0:54:35-0:54:38:**  So how do we create fat roots?  
**0:54:38-0:54:48:**  Well, what creates energy is photosynthesis and what consumes energy in a plant is respiring.  
**0:54:48-0:54:53:**  The stems respire, the leaves produce photosynthesis energy.  
**0:54:53-0:55:00:**  So the difference between the production of energy and the consumption of energy is what's  
**0:55:00-0:55:07:**  left for production and what's left after production is returned to the soil, to the  
**0:55:07-0:55:13:**  rhizospora as exudates to feed the soil microorganisms.  
**0:55:13-0:55:22:**  When the plant roots get fat, the soil microorganisms get fat and when they get fat, they are converted  
**0:55:22-0:55:29:**  into humus after many digestions by other generations of microorganisms with the final  
**0:55:29-0:55:33:**  digestion being carried out by fungi.  
**0:55:33-0:55:39:**  And then after a process like maturing, a process of humification, it's converted into  
**0:55:39-0:55:45:**  humus, which is the stable fraction of organic matter that lasts for over a hundred years  
**0:55:45-0:55:52:**  in your soil and gives it a dark brown color and it's good earthy smell.  
**0:55:52-0:55:59:**  So that's how you create humus and trees play an important part in this.  
**0:55:59-0:56:05:**  Now what makes a highly productive grass or forest plant?  
**0:56:05-0:56:07:**  The leaves to stem ratio.  
**0:56:07-0:56:09:**  That's what you said.  
**0:56:09-0:56:15:**  So the leaves to stem ratio is directly influenced by the type of grazing.  
**0:56:15-0:56:23:**  If it's a selective grazing where they take the leaves and leave the stems, that means  
**0:56:23-0:56:27:**  lower energy plant with lower humus formation.  
**0:56:27-0:56:31:**  If you do a non-selective grazing, what comes up?  
**0:56:31-0:56:32:**  Leaves.  
**0:56:32-0:56:38:**  When you mow your lawn, you get a high leaves to stem ratio in your regrowth.  
**0:56:38-0:56:39:**  How do you keep it there?  
**0:56:39-0:56:43:**  The high leaves to stem ratio all the way into stockpile.  
**0:56:43-0:56:53:**  Well, by doing a non-selective grazing after the grass plant has fully replenished its  
**0:56:53-0:57:01:**  reserves and then you allow it to stockpile and it will keep growing the size of its leaves  
**0:57:01-0:57:06:**  without producing seed heads and increase humus.  
**0:57:06-0:57:12:**  And this is a virtuous spiral that will go up and up every year because we stockpile  
**0:57:12-0:57:16:**  half of the property, not the whole of the property.  
**0:57:16-0:57:17:**  Every year.  
**0:57:17-0:57:19:**  And then we alternate these areas.  
**0:57:19-0:57:21:**  Okay, nice.  
**0:57:21-0:57:30:**  So that's the basis of having a healthy pasture system with a lot of pasture.  
**0:57:30-0:57:37:**  That's also why pollarding is much better than browsing because you take the stems off.  
**0:57:37-0:57:40:**  That's why the regrowth is so much faster.  
**0:57:40-0:57:47:**  So even though it's more labor than just browsing it off, it's much more productive and stable.  
**0:57:47-0:57:48:**  Yeah.  
**0:57:48-0:57:49:**  It's important.  
**0:57:49-0:57:51:**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**0:57:51-0:57:52:**  It makes sense.  
**0:57:52-0:57:56:**  It's clearly an important part of your system there.  
**0:57:56-0:57:58:**  And they're pollarded every year, right?  
**0:57:58-0:58:00:**  Each tree gets pollarded every year.  
**0:58:00-0:58:01:**  Yes.  
**0:58:01-0:58:06:**  With 50 per hectare left to grow mature and not touched.  
**0:58:06-0:58:07:**  Interesting.  
**0:58:07-0:58:08:**  Okay.  
**0:58:08-0:58:09:**  Very nice.  
**0:58:09-0:58:21:**  Listen, for me, you've been very clear at answering the questions and you've defined  
**0:58:21-0:58:30:**  for us quite a basic introduction to the functioning of your system, which somehow seems very elegant.  
**0:58:30-0:58:36:**  And especially the way you're explaining it, it's simply elegant.  
**0:58:36-0:58:40:**  I love elegant simplicity, like a paperclip.  
**0:58:40-0:58:44:**  That's elegant simplicity or a ballpoint pen.  
**0:58:44-0:58:45:**  I love those things.  
**0:58:45-0:58:51:**  So I try to do it very simple, easy to manage and easy to explain.  
**0:58:51-0:58:52:**  That's fantastic.  
**0:58:52-0:58:57:**  And actually, maybe we can finish off by you explaining a bit your recent course that I  
**0:58:57-0:59:02:**  think it just started or it's about to start, but maybe you can present to our readers some  
**0:59:02-0:59:07:**  of your educational work if they're interested to look further into your work and your techniques.  
**0:59:07-0:59:08:**  Yes.  
**0:59:08-0:59:17:**  You can find my website, it's www.rwranching.com.  
**0:59:17-0:59:24:**  And I am YouTube under RealWealth Ranching on Facebook also.  
**0:59:24-0:59:30:**  And the course that is coming out in Spanish on August the 2nd is called Pastoreo Total.  
**0:59:30-0:59:38:**  And then in September or October, we're going to come out with a total grazing maximizer,  
**0:59:38-0:59:43:**  which includes adapted genetics and selection guidelines with total grazing.  
**0:59:43-0:59:45:**  It's two courses in one.  
**0:59:45-0:59:46:**  Okay.  
**0:59:46-0:59:48:**  So you need to sign up.  
**0:59:48-0:59:55:**  You can go there to the Facebook group or the webpage and sign in and you will get my  
**0:59:55-1:00:03:**  weekly blogs, which are also posted on Instagram and on Facebook and on YouTube.  
**1:00:03-1:00:08:**  But you'll get it to your email and you will get the announcement on when the next opening  
**1:00:08-1:00:11:**  will be for the next course.  
**1:00:11-1:00:12:**  Fantastic.  
**1:00:12-1:00:13:**  Fantastic.  
**1:00:13-1:00:21:**  Well, Jaime, thank you so much for coming on the podcast and for sharing with us your  
**1:00:21-1:00:24:**  large experience on the topic.  
**1:00:24-1:00:28:**  Well, you know how it is.  
**1:00:28-1:00:33:**  Experience comes from poor decisions and good decisions come from experience.  
**1:00:33-1:00:55:**  So I have made a lot of mistakes.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (2021-09-15)  

**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  our soils and ecosystems?  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:54:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we have the huge pleasure to receive Jaime Elizondo.  The interview was extremely interesting.  Of course Jaime, for many of you, may not need an introduction but for others he has  
**0:01:02-0:01:09:**  more than 40 years of experience ranching, consulting and educating in regenerative agriculture.  And I have to admit that I've been quite surprised to hear how much enthusiasm he has for silvopasture  and for trees where he's been running quite a few tests on his operation in Florida.  
**0:01:24-0:01:28:**  So he's extremely happy with the results and he is planning on scaling these systems.  So yeah, I think it's quite interesting to get the point of view of somebody with his  experience and to understand why he is so interested in integrating trees and creating  
**0:01:42-0:01:45:**  silvopasture systems.  Hello Jaime and welcome on the podcast.  Hey, hello Dimitri.  
**0:01:50-0:01:52:**  It's nice to be here.  Great.  I was thinking that we could maybe start this episode by looking at how you got interested  
**0:02:03-0:02:04:**  in silvopasture.  What was your first kind of contact with it?  Okay, that takes me back to 1982 when I was in Monterrey studying agronomy engineer and  
**0:02:17-0:02:22:**  I wanted to make our family ranch more productive.  I knew that legumes were needed.  So I was looking into legumes that would work in a tropical environment and there weren't  
**0:02:30-0:02:38:**  any that will really work in that high rainfall environment that got very hot.  It's a sea level environment in Veracruz state in Mexico.  So the only one that showed any promise was the Leucaena.  
**0:02:49-0:02:57:**  And the Leucaena ironically is native to Mexico, but most of what I could read because there  wasn't online back then, I had to read this serum, a publishing from Australia.  So most of research was done in Australia and not in Mexico.  
**0:03:12-0:03:18:**  And then to make things worse in Australia, they didn't have the special bacteria to digest  the mimosin in the Leucaena, which in Mexico was native.  So all the research pointed to that Leucaena was toxic to ruminants.  
**0:03:29-0:03:37:**  And in Mexico it wasn't, but nobody researched that in Mexico until a guy by the last name  of Jones did isolate the bacteria in Hawaii from goats.  And then they started to inoculate that bacteria in Australia.  
**0:03:50-0:03:56:**  And suddenly there was no mimosin problem, which in Mexico never was, but nobody wanted  to plant it, plant the Leucaena because of the research done in Australia.  Wow.  
**0:04:02-0:04:03:**  Okay.  That's interesting.  That's how it is.  
**0:04:06-0:04:07:**  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's very interesting.  
**0:04:11-0:04:17:**  And maybe you could tell us a bit more about the family ranch that you mentioned now.  Is this where you're still working at the moment?  No, no, no.  
**0:04:21-0:04:25:**  I have my own ranch that I bought in 19...  No, in two...  Let me see.  
**0:04:29-0:04:30:**  1990.  Okay.  And it's in a drier area, but it has irrigation.  
**0:04:35-0:04:37:**  And I have done silver pasture there.  I have planted rows of Leucaena.  First I started planting Leucaena every 90 centimeters rows to graze directly with cattle.  
**0:04:49-0:04:55:**  But then I switched to dairy, a graze dairy.  We milk 250 cows twice a day on 120 hectares plus the replacements in bulls.  So the tropical grass that we grow there, Bermuda, grows very fast.  
**0:05:10-0:05:14:**  And it's ready in the summer in 14 to 20 days.  If you wait longer, it will be over mature.  And Leucaena, being a tree, takes 35 to 45 days to be mature enough so you do not over  
**0:05:26-0:05:27:**  graze it.  Over graze is when you regraze the plant before it has fully replenished its reserves.  So I decided, okay, this is not working.  
**0:05:39-0:05:47:**  But I learned how to direct plant with a no-till drill Leucaena by seed into my paddocks without  having to plow the land or without having to transplant trees, which costs 30 times  more than direct planting.  
**0:05:57-0:06:01:**  So with direct planting, and then I heard that in France they are doing the same with  mulberry and with poplar and willow, you can plant cuttings.  So there are many ways.  
**0:06:11-0:06:15:**  Please do not try to transplant trees.  That's very expensive, unless they are very valuable trees.  Okay, so I started researching and I went into permaculture with Darren Doherty.  
**0:06:28-0:06:37:**  And by then I already had rows of trees, tall trees, every 33 meters to 40 meters in all  my farm.  So that created a micro environment that helped bring in more animal, insect and microbiology  
**0:06:50-0:06:53:**  species into my farm.  And as you know, every new species that you draw in brings another seven with it.  So that has made the farm more productive.  
**0:07:02-0:07:10:**  We do not use any insecticide, chemicals or fertilizers, and we are beyond organic.  We also have adapted genetics that can do more with less because they contain genes  from Africa.  
**0:07:19-0:07:22:**  Okay, very interesting.  When did you start planting the first trees?  Just to have an idea of the timeline.  
**0:07:27-0:07:35:**  Yeah, my first planting was in 1985 on my family ranch and the Leucaena grew very fast  and then it got attacked by a bacillate, an insect that lives near the coast and killed  it.  
**0:07:43-0:07:51:**  So when I bought my farm, it was further inland and doesn't get that as heavy.  So we can plant Leucaena and it grows like crazy there.  But I found that the best seeds were not the ones imported from Australia because Australia  
**0:08:03-0:08:05:**  is a different environment.  The best variety was the one growing by the side of the road.  So we started harvesting our own because when I planted the Leucaena that the seed came  
**0:08:16-0:08:26:**  from Australia varieties, the Taramba and another one I don't recall, they didn't work.  They didn't grow fast enough.  They got attacked by insects and they didn't thrive.  
**0:08:31-0:08:38:**  But the local one, and there were trees already growing in my farm, those are the best ones.  Then to inoculate the seed with the mycorrhiza and the nitrogen producing bacteria, I researched  and I found that the best way was to get soil from around the roots of mature trees that  
**0:08:55-0:08:57:**  were healthy.  Then you dry that soil and you add 1% to Leucaena seed after scarifying it with hot water and  then you plant it and it grows so much faster.  
**0:09:10-0:09:12:**  So that's another tip there.  Okay, that's great because we're getting decades of experience here.  40 years.  
**0:09:18-0:09:22:**  From you to the test and experiments and seeing what works best.  It's fascinating.  Yes.  
**0:09:24-0:09:28:**  So each experiment takes one year at least.  So it's 40 years experience there.  Yeah, amazing.  
**0:09:33-0:09:38:**  I mean, just to look a bit more at the big picture before we, of course, we'll zoom into  a lot of these details and unpack them.  What were your initial motivations to plant trees?  
**0:09:45-0:09:53:**  What was your objective with integrating trees on your farm?  To create a savanna effect.  When you look back on how grassland developed in high rainfall areas or tropical areas or  
**0:10:03-0:10:10:**  subtropical areas, it was by the action of large animals.  Mammut, mastodon and others that could fell trees.  So herbivores could graze the grasses in the North America.  
**0:10:23-0:10:31:**  You can find the tall grass prairie species, the big four, big bluestem, little bluestem,  india grass and switchgrass all along the migration of the bison.  So it goes from Manitoba, Canada.  
**0:10:41-0:10:48:**  I have seen the tall grass species there to the northern part of Mexico.  So I have found the same big bluestem grasses growing in Manitoba, Canada and in North near  Monterey city in Mexico.  
**0:10:58-0:11:03:**  So that tells me that that's how it was developed and maintained.  When men came into America, at least I'm talking about America, they killed the mastodons and  mammoths and all that, and they had to use fire to keep the savanna.  
**0:11:15-0:11:20:**  So those migrating herbivores will come in and they could hunt them.  So when white men came, they found that it was like a garden, but they had already degenerated  from what it was to where they found it so productive because it was so much better in  
**0:11:36-0:11:41:**  humus content mostly, but they had to burn it and when you burn, you know humus gets  burned.  So now we do have other ways to do it.  
**0:11:47-0:11:54:**  We have a caterpillars, bulldozers, and we have cattle that we can manage with the predator  effect.  We use elective fences for that and in a ranch, a big ranch that I have been consulting for  
**0:12:02-0:12:11:**  in North Florida and near Tallahassee, Florida, where you can still find the fossilized pollen  of what was there before.  Now it's all forest pine forest that they burn every year to keep it a clear brush,  
**0:12:20-0:12:26:**  but you can still find that the forest back then when mammoths were around was mostly  magnolia and light oak, almost no pine trees, and it wasn't burned every year.  When you burn every year, you kill those trees.  
**0:12:35-0:12:40:**  That's why we don't find them anymore, but they were there and by some, you can still  find the bones and the fossils when they were migrating there and when you manage the land  correctly, we're doing that with total grazing, which includes a non-selective grazing and  
**0:12:53-0:12:55:**  the fur paddock for a full year.  In those fur paddocks that we use for winter feed, that's where the little blue stem and  Indian grass is coming back.  
**0:13:04-0:13:10:**  They never knew they had it, but now it's coming back from seed that is more than 200  years old.  So that's how we need to manage.  
**0:13:16-0:13:19:**  So I know we need trees.  Trees recycle nutrients.  They lower the temperature under them, so when it's hot, you have a more efficient nitrogen  
**0:13:29-0:13:30:**  cycle.  At least the light bogs, they have a dense network of mycorrhiza that makes nutrients  available for grasses and other legumes.  
**0:13:41-0:13:48:**  And you have the shade effect, you have the edge effect for wildlife, you have a having  for small mammals and birds that can prey on your pests.  So it all works together to bring not only shade and windbreaks, but all of these advantages.  
**0:14:02-0:14:07:**  So we need trees, but we do not need too many trees.  When you see an industrial planting of pine trees, you don't see animals, you don't see  wildlife, you don't see many insects.  
**0:14:17-0:14:22:**  They burn it and burn it and burn it, and it becomes a desolate landscape.  Yeah, I'm very familiar with that type of landscape.  Everywhere there are these industrial timber systems.  
**0:14:29-0:14:37:**  Yeah, so there's going there to hide, but they need somewhere to browse and graze.  They don't live in the forest, they hide in the forest.  Just like cattle did long time ago.  
**0:14:43-0:14:44:**  It makes sense.  It makes a lot of sense.  So it comes from a place of biomimicry in a way and of imitating the natural processes  
**0:14:55-0:14:57:**  that you've been observing.  Absolutely.  We need to imitate nature.  
**0:15:00-0:15:05:**  When we go against nature, we're going to go broke and we're going to degrade the land  instead of regenerate the land.  People ask me, how high can the regenerating process go?  
**0:15:13-0:15:16:**  How high can the humans be?  How high can the biodiversity and productivity be?  And I say, I don't know, but it's going up every year.  
**0:15:23-0:15:25:**  That's enough for me.  I hope someone else continues after I'm gone, but it's going up every year.  It's improving.  
**0:15:30-0:15:33:**  There is no limit.  There must be a limit, but we haven't reached it by a long way.  Yeah, yeah.  
**0:15:38-0:15:42:**  Yeah, the potential could be great.  I wanted to delve into some of the practicalities of your system.  The first question that I have is, why Laokena, for example?  
**0:15:54-0:15:56:**  Why this species specifically?  Okay, for that environment is the one that works the best.  I try different others.  
**0:16:02-0:16:05:**  Well, there is another one that works equally as well.  That is Guacima, but it's not a legume.  When it's not a legume, that means there is no nitrogen fixing.  
**0:16:17-0:16:24:**  The air that we breathe is 78% nitrogen, but it needs to be converted into a nitrate or  a nitrate so the plants can use it.  For that, you need a good permeability in your soil.  
**0:16:32-0:16:41:**  For good gas interchange, the earth breaths in at dusk and breaths out at sunrise.  Then the bacteria can do their job.  But with Laokena, it has a very strong root and it's a legume tree, so it can fix up to  
**0:16:51-0:16:55:**  300 kilograms of nitrogen per year.  That equals a ton in some of commercial fertilizer.  So you've saved that money.  
**0:17:04-0:17:08:**  And if you look into the Mayan people, the native people of south of Mexico and Central  America, they use Laokena as their main fertilizer for corn crops.  They will plant alleys of Laokena in rows and in between the rows, the corn, and then  
**0:17:22-0:17:28:**  they will cut the Laokena branches with leaves and lay them in the rows of corn and that  will release the nitrogen for the corn, nitrogen and phosphorus and others.  Due to the Laokena being a perennial, their mycorrhiza system is strong and you can see  
**0:17:42-0:17:51:**  the grass growing much better, more than double the height and speed of when you go further  from the drip line of the Laokena tree.  So I plant Laokena in Laokena cannot take flooding.  
**0:18:01-0:18:07:**  So in the lower parts, the Guacima can take the flooding and cows love Guacima.  So I looked at other ranchers, older ranchers around me and some of them, because it's a  drought prone area, will have a whole paddock of Guacima, which they will cut with a chainsaw  
**0:18:19-0:18:22:**  for the cows in the event of a drought.  So I have been copying that and now we are pollarding our Laokena once a year for our  cows in the difficult time of the year when we don't have much forage.  
**0:18:34-0:18:36:**  Okay, nice.  I think we need to go a bit into that.  But before I wanted to understand the spacing.  
**0:18:43-0:18:47:**  You said you had it spaced between 35 and 40 meters.  Why so?  That's quite wide, for example.  
**0:18:50-0:18:53:**  And so I want to understand a bit why you chose that spacing.  Yeah, this is a learning process.  So that was a mistake.  
**0:18:57-0:19:05:**  But I did it because I wanted enough space between the rows so the air, when the wind  starts to blow, we could have enough space in between so the cows could cool themselves.  Back then I didn't have very adapted cows.  
**0:19:15-0:19:23:**  I had an Australian Frisian faggywool in hit Orlando and they cannot take the humid heat  well.  They come from areas that are much cooler.  
**0:19:28-0:19:32:**  When you hear about Australia being the tropics, yes and no.  It's in the tropics, but it's much cooler than sea level real tropics in Mexico.  The high heat index made me do it that way.  
**0:19:43-0:19:47:**  And so we could mow in between the rows and all that.  Now I am finding that that was a mistake and I'm going to remediate it even though I'm  60 years old now.  
**0:19:57-0:19:58:**  Why was that a mistake?  Would you have wanted them to be closer or?  Yes, because the grass that is further than three meters from the Leucaena trees doesn't  
**0:20:08-0:20:09:**  grow as well.  So I am reasoning if I can plant a row every 10 meters so I can polar the regrowth every  year, I will get a double production of the grass and I will get four times more Leucaena  
**0:20:27-0:20:30:**  cuttings than right now for the cows.  I can at least double my stocking rate and as we know, a stocking rate determines profitability  on a farm.  
**0:20:39-0:20:43:**  So your stocking rates would go from what to what?  Right now we are around two and a half, around three animal units per hectare.  I expect it to go to five or six.  
**0:20:54-0:20:57:**  And that will double profitability.  Okay.  That's quite exciting for anybody.  
**0:21:01-0:21:02:**  Very exciting.  And you are from planting Leucaena the right way.  Okay, nice.  
**0:21:07-0:21:12:**  So let's talk a bit about that.  You mentioned you're an expert in planting Leucaena without tilling the earth.  Could you tell us a bit about your process?  
**0:21:21-0:21:25:**  What's your optimum or optimal technique?  Yes.  First use a seed.  
**0:21:28-0:21:33:**  Well I'm going to talk about Leucaena, but I want to mention that in other environments,  mulberry may be better.  Mulberry can be planted by seed, harvesting the berries and putting them in a row with  
**0:21:43-0:21:48:**  mulch and protecting with electric wire on both sides, a high tensile.  So cows don't get in and kill it.  Then you have to take care of rabbits and deer or they may kill it.  
**0:21:56-0:22:03:**  That's why you need to plant a huge acreage, at least 20 hectares at a time, or they will  eat it and kill it when it's sprouting.  Most of the people that transplant little trees, they get the deer or the rabbits or  
**0:22:16-0:22:18:**  hares kill it.  And that is the reason.  And I learned that from Australia.  
**0:22:23-0:22:26:**  You need to plant a large acreage to be successful.  Okay, that's number one.  Number two, you can plant if it's very cold, poplar, or you can plant willows in England,  
**0:22:36-0:22:42:**  for example, or you can plant, there are many different varieties, black locust.  There is a tree that is called tree crops by Russell.  You need to read that book.  
**0:22:49-0:22:50:**  I've read it.  It's fantastic.  I advise it to all of our listeners.  
**0:22:52-0:22:53:**  Yeah.  Yeah, but he doesn't go into detail, but he tells you the possibilities and it's up to  us to figure it out.  
**0:23:00-0:23:03:**  So we need to figure it out and then communicate to other people.  So this goes way beyond Mexico and the United States.  This has to be done worldwide.  
**0:23:09-0:23:14:**  We need more and more trees and productive trees at that.  Okay.  So what I do, and I did many different ways.  
**0:23:20-0:23:26:**  One was to plant on agricultural land along with the milo that we were planting to plant  the Leucaena.  But that didn't work very well because the Leucaena cannot take competition when it's  
**0:23:31-0:23:32:**  young.  That's the main problem with the Leucaena.  It cannot take wheat and grass competition when it's young.  
**0:23:40-0:23:45:**  So whenever you till the ground, that wakes up the monster.  And the monster is all the seeds that are there of weeds and grasses, and they will  wake up and grow.  
**0:23:54-0:24:04:**  So now I do an all-till drill planting, but that's the only time in the life that I will  use a herbicide.  But you need to use a herbicide, but you can do it with wood vinegar.  
**0:24:11-0:24:19:**  I make biochar and I feed it to the cows and then the cows put it into dung.  And now it's fully loaded with microorganisms and nutrients and the dung beetles, which  we have a very high population, take it down into the soil where the biochar will last  
**0:24:30-0:24:33:**  for over a thousand years.  So I think that offsets the little amount of herbicide I'm going to tell you.  Okay.  
**0:24:39-0:24:42:**  So first you kill the grass with vinegar.  I use wood vinegar because it's a byproduct.  You kill it and then you no-till drill the leucaena seed, which has been scarified by  
**0:24:52-0:24:57:**  putting it in water that is 80 degrees for one minute.  And then you inoculate it with the ground, the soil, sifted soil that, and first, well,  after it's dried, the seed, you put a little milk so it will stick the soil to the seed.  
**0:25:11-0:25:19:**  And the sifted soil from the leucaena trees, you take the first 10 centimeters off, then  the next 10 centimeters, that's what you use.  At 1%, that's how you inoculate the seed.  
**0:25:28-0:25:36:**  Then you plant it every five centimeters, one seed in the row with the no-till drill.  I use a one row no-till drill.  Okay.  
**0:25:41-0:25:45:**  And then it starts to sprout like 15 days later.  Okay.  All of its germinates and that's when you have to pay attention.  
**0:25:52-0:26:02:**  Because if the grass that will regrow after you kill it with the vinegar, yeah, you need  to use one of those weed eaters.  I use a big one, a Honda, so we can keep it clean and do it very fast from the grass,  
**0:26:10-0:26:11:**  the competition.  If need be, that's where you can use a herbicide that only kills grasses, but not the goons.  But you have to use it at half the dose.  
**0:26:22-0:26:27:**  You don't want to kill them, you just want to slow their growth so leucaena can get one  meter high.  Once it's one meter high, you don't need to take care of it.  
**0:26:33-0:26:35:**  Otherwise you have to mow, right?  You were mentioning you have to mow it frequently.  Not the leucaena, the grass.  
**0:26:40-0:26:49:**  With this, it's a hand held that you go and you clean it by hand.  So it's a lot of work.  That's why I don't recommend anymore to plant every 90 centimeters because it gets so hot  
**0:26:58-0:27:02:**  in there when the leucaena grows.  And the cattle don't do well and the leucaena don't do well.  It does much better planted at every 10 meters and cut at one meter height, like if you are  
**0:27:17-0:27:21:**  pollarding with a chainsaw.  But in the chainsaw, instead of oil for the chain, you use vegetable oil for the chain  so you do not kill the leucaena.  
**0:27:31-0:27:38:**  Okay, that's a lot of stuff to digest here.  Let's just back up a bit.  You said you don't recommend planting every 90 centimeters.  
**0:27:44-0:27:50:**  Could you elaborate a bit more on that just to help us understand what it is?  The first time I planted the leucaena, I planted every 90 centimeters to get more leucaena  yield and more nitrogen fixing.  
**0:28:00-0:28:09:**  But when it gets hot and humid there in my ranch, it can get to 45 Celsius and 90 humidity.  And that kills people and cattle.  So they are not happy to be grazing during that time.  
**0:28:18-0:28:22:**  That's why I left some trees to grow tall to provide shade.  And now I want to have around 50 trees per hectare, mature trees that are up to seven,  eight meters tall.  
**0:28:34-0:28:40:**  And then equally distance one from the other.  And then the leucaena that's in the row in between those large trees, that will be pollarded  every year.  
**0:28:48-0:28:56:**  Okay, so you're putting very dense leucaena on a line, like every meter they come out  or something like this?  No, I planted every five centimeters because some of them will get killed by rabbits, some  
**0:29:05-0:29:09:**  by deer, some will die from disease.  So you want to end with one leucaena tree or brush every half a meter after years of  cutting it.  
**0:29:18-0:29:23:**  When you cut it, I went to France to teach a course area in for health care.  And I saw in a monastery, I saw mulberry trees that had been pollarded for the branches for  fieldworms every year for 300 years.  
**0:29:37-0:29:42:**  And they were healthy and produce a huge biomass.  Very interesting.  Yeah.  
**0:29:44-0:29:52:**  So then the way in which you manage it is, sorry, let's just maybe finish off the establishment.  So you've applied, either you've passed with a brush cutter or you've applied a herbicide,  the trees get to one meter?  
**0:29:59-0:30:04:**  No, no, you need to apply the herbicide because if you do it with a brush cutter, the grass  grows very fast.  Okay, so that's when you need the herbicide.  
**0:30:09-0:30:16:**  And then the, so you've kept the grass low, the leucaena reaches one meter.  And then after that, you're safe.  You can just let go.  
**0:30:20-0:30:21:**  That's correct.  And once it reaches like three meters, two and a half to three meters, you can start  pollarding it once a year.  
**0:30:28-0:30:34:**  But it's only for environments that don't get a frost very much because frost will make  the leaf drop.  So in other environments, you can use other species.  
**0:30:39-0:30:40:**  Naturally.  It makes a lot of sense.  But the competition between, I mean, I'm imagining in the tropics, the grass that you have is  
**0:30:47-0:30:48:**  very vigorous.  The competition between the grass and the leucaena, doesn't that, I mean, doesn't it  overpower the leucaena in the first few years?  
**0:30:57-0:31:02:**  For example, in our climate here, we usually protect trees for the first two, three years  to a certain extent.  Of course, wild trees are more resistant than non-wild, but yeah, that's why I choose the  
**0:31:09-0:31:12:**  leucaena, which is a legume tree.  Legume trees grow much faster than other trees.  Let me tell you what I found in Manitoba, Canada.  
**0:31:18-0:31:20:**  I say, why don't you plant trees here?  You need trees.  They didn't have any trees.  
**0:31:23-0:31:25:**  You could see miles and miles and no trees.  They say, oh, trees don't grow here.  And I said, what's that?  
**0:31:29-0:31:32:**  It was a, that's a windbreak.  A windbreak.  What tree is that?  
**0:31:34-0:31:38:**  Oh, that's a legume tree that they call the caragana.  That's a Siberian pea brush.  So we went to see it and it was grazed, browsed by the cows all the way so they could reach.  
**0:31:49-0:31:51:**  Why don't you plant this?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  
**0:31:54-0:31:55:**  Okay.  So that's what they need to plant in places like that.  It grows like crazy and it's very palatable and it produces nitrogen and it will catch  
**0:32:05-0:32:14:**  the snow and prevent the cattle from drowning in snow and will catch the snow for moisture  because it doesn't rain much there, but it gets cold and provide very good feed.  So I don't understand people.  
**0:32:23-0:32:25:**  We need more trees.  Even in your place, there is one that they planted the Canary Island comes from Australia.  I don't recall the name.  
**0:32:32-0:32:33:**  Maybe you know it.  No, right now.  I think that's the best for Greece and it looks like Locaena, but it's not Locaena.  
**0:32:43-0:32:48:**  I think I have it in mind.  Doesn't come to me.  I think I've seen it in the south of Portugal.  
**0:32:51-0:32:56:**  Yeah, Liguim brush.  What's the name?  Do you recall it?  
**0:32:59-0:33:01:**  M something.  They do it.  M something you said?  
**0:33:05-0:33:06:**  Yeah.  I don't remember right now, but if you look at Liguim trees in Australia for cattle, that's  the one they use.  
**0:33:17-0:33:19:**  How much rainfall do you get?  We get about 600 millimeters on average, but just in the winter.  I mean, I'm talking now in Greece, where we are in Greece.  
**0:33:29-0:33:34:**  In the summer, we have six months of basically just maybe five millimeters rainfall.  Okay.  Then that's the one.  
**0:33:36-0:33:39:**  In Australia, it's also Mediterranean climate.  So winter rains.  So that's the tree you need.  
**0:33:42-0:33:46:**  I don't remember right now the name, but I will find it and send it to you.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you.  
**0:33:49-0:33:54:**  We've also planted lots of Acacia Salinia.  I saw some studies where they were giving it to sheep and they had some pretty good  results.  
**0:33:58-0:34:01:**  But again, these are just a few studies that I read here and there.  I don't have personal experience with it, but it's definitely in terms of a tree that  we planted for other reasons like windbreaks and biomass, it's so vigorous.  
**0:34:10-0:34:11:**  It's exceptional.  It just grows with nothing.  And that's the one you need because I always tell people don't try to kill who's trying  
**0:34:19-0:34:24:**  to live or grow and don't try to grow who's trying to die.  That means adapted species.  And actually also adapted genetics, as you mentioned for your cattle.  
**0:34:32-0:34:36:**  Maybe that's something we can discuss a bit because I think some of our listeners will  probably think, well, on my cattle, are they adapted to a silver pastoral system?  Are they adapted to eating tree fodder?  
**0:34:46-0:34:49:**  What could you advise them?  Okay.  Goats are the best ones for browsing, but they also kill trees when they peel the bark  
**0:34:57-0:34:58:**  off.  Then come sheep.  Sheep love browsing and they would do much better browsing than grazing, grasses, tropical  
**0:35:08-0:35:10:**  grasses, I mean.  And then cows.  Most cows that we use are European Bostauros, but some of them have African genes because  
**0:35:21-0:35:27:**  the Muslims invaded Spain and they brought their cattle from Africa.  And cattle from Africa are much more prone to browsing because they were domesticated  in Africa.  
**0:35:37-0:35:39:**  So they are African Bostauros.  I am not referring to Cebu or Indian Bostindigos.  I am talking about African Bostauros.  
**0:35:48-0:35:51:**  And we have the largest machona herd in Florida.  I am consulting for them.  And they are a pure African Bostauros native breed.  
**0:35:59-0:36:05:**  And we have been able to browse exactly the same as with goats, but this cattle, they  can reach higher.  So we have goats in the machona.  
**0:36:11-0:36:15:**  And the machona do the same job as the goats.  So there is a lot of variability in cattle breeds.  Maybe you have a native breed.  
**0:36:21-0:36:28:**  The more native the breed is in cattle, the more African Bostauros genes they have.  I have found some very good ones in Portugal, in Sicily, in Spain, and in France.  No, not in France.  
**0:36:36-0:36:37:**  Okay.  Interesting.  Yeah.  
**0:36:39-0:36:40:**  We are in the southern countries, closer to Africa.  It makes sense.  Yeah.  
**0:36:43-0:36:44:**  Okay.  And so because the problem would be, as you said, molecules like mimazine inside the locaena,  which can be poisonous, right?  
**0:36:51-0:36:57:**  So is this something that really happens in many species, in many trees that we have to  be careful of?  Locaena is very easy to fix.  
**0:37:00-0:37:05:**  You just bring the bacteria and you put it in the water trough and they drink it and  then everybody has it and once in your life, that's it.  Then they pass it from one cow to the other very fast.  
**0:37:12-0:37:17:**  But the main problem with trees is tannins.  When wildlife go to browse trees and brush, they communicate like avatar through the underground  system of mycorrhiza and their tannin levels go up.  
**0:37:31-0:37:35:**  After half an hour of grazing, tannin levels go up.  So you need the cows to browse a break, a new break in less than half an hour.  Or you do what I do.  
**0:37:45-0:37:47:**  You pollard the trees.  Then that doesn't happen.  Or you find a low tannin species or you use a polyethylene glycol supplement so it will  
**0:38:00-0:38:04:**  trap the tannins in the rumens so they will not do so much harm.  Okay, so there's some techniques available, some indications there for our listeners.  But it brings up the question for me, in your low forage production, I guess it's the dry  
**0:38:17-0:38:18:**  winter period, right?  In your case.  How much does the locaena represent in terms of food intake?  
**0:38:29-0:38:31:**  What's the percentage?  I think what you want to know is how much in percentage rate of inclusion the locaena  can be of the whole intake, right?  
**0:38:40-0:38:44:**  I have done some research.  In mine they go to 30-50%.  But I have seen research in Australia after feeding the unecid bacteria that degrades  
**0:38:54-0:39:02:**  the mimosin up to 100% with no problem, 100% locaena.  You see the locaena has around 22-25% protein.  So it may be too much protein.  
**0:39:11-0:39:15:**  But the good part is that you do not have to feed protein because protein is very expensive  nowadays with soybean meal so high.  So it's a good way to survive through these hard economic times and be more resilient  
**0:39:26-0:39:29:**  by producing your own protein with trees.  It makes sense and it actually represents quite a big proportion.  I mean we're talking about quite high percentages.  
**0:39:36-0:39:40:**  It's not just nibbling a bit over here and a bit over there.  So when I planted every 90 cm my idea was, oh I can go very high in stocking rate, five  times higher and then if I don't have enough grass I can feed them straw or milo stalks.  
**0:39:56-0:39:58:**  No problem because the protein is in the locaena.  Well surprise surprise it doesn't grow as well so close together.  Yeah, okay interesting.  
**0:40:06-0:40:11:**  And actually I had a question earlier on that came up.  When you're looking at your system you mentioned that you're pollarding them at about a meter  height but obviously that means quite a certain labour requirement to go in there and to do  
**0:40:24-0:40:30:**  that especially for a big herd as you have and for big acreage.  And I mean we're talking about a quite significant scale here.  And so why not do an alternative, a potential alternative of browsing directly on the tree?  
**0:40:41-0:40:45:**  Is that something you've tested and that hasn't worked out at all?  Yes that didn't work out because if you do not protect the tree the cows will bend the  branches and consume the leaves and then come back and peel off the bark.  
**0:40:58-0:41:03:**  And when you peel off the bark you kill the locaena.  The washi they do not peel the bark but it's not flexible so they break the branches.  And it's the same as if you cut it but cheaper of course.  
**0:41:15-0:41:21:**  And it takes only two persons one hour a day to feed the 250 cows.  Using the pollarding technique.  And when you pollard you are certain that the trees don't die.  
**0:41:27-0:41:34:**  When you graze them you're always in some percentage die every year so after 10 or 20  years you will end with nothing.  And I don't want to replant.  
**0:41:38-0:41:42:**  I want to do it once in my lifetime and I'm over, I'm finished.  So by pollarding I had seen it, I told you in France, 300 years old trees.  Yeah, it makes sense.  
**0:41:50-0:41:52:**  And what do you do with the branches afterwards?  I mean you've pollarded them, the branches are everywhere, that must be some kind of  a problem.  
**0:41:57-0:42:03:**  Yes, here comes the nice part about using the yume trees in the tropics.  If the branches are not thick enough and you cut them every year they will degrade very  fast and be integrated into the soil.  
**0:42:13-0:42:19:**  This first year that we cut them and they were very thick like up to four inches, the  branches.  What we did is after they got all the leaves off and they left the skeletons we cut those  
**0:42:25-0:42:30:**  skeletons and put them inside the fence in the row so they will decompose and add to  the organic matter for the trees.  Okay.  
**0:42:33-0:42:37:**  But next year I'm going to be certain to cut them every year.  Right now, six to seven months old, rig road is around two to three meters high.  Yeah.  
**0:42:44-0:42:48:**  And so then you can just leave it on the floor and it gets eaten up.  That's the idea because when I was a young boy, 12 years old, I will make forts out of  the ukulele branches and I couldn't cut the big ones so they were very slender and they  
**0:43:02-0:43:04:**  will decompose in a few months.  They will be turned into dirt.  And I guess also going back a bit to the pollarding vs browsing directly, as the grazier, you  
**0:43:17-0:43:20:**  have more control over how much the animals eat, right?  So you can kind of play with your nitrogen content.  You can decide how many branches to cut down, how much to provide.  
**0:43:27-0:43:28:**  Yes.  And how many trees to let grow for shade.  Another idea I had a long time ago was to plant, let's say 30% of the paddock, but at  
**0:43:38-0:43:44:**  the end of the rectangular paddock, 30% and then I could open the gate so they could browse  it every time I want it.  But the problem with that is that you do not get the benefit from the mycorrhiza and nitrogen  
**0:43:53-0:43:58:**  fixing life in the in the locaena to the whole paddock.  And I have since, I sent you a video, you can see that three meters on each side of  the row, it grows double the size than further away.  
**0:44:07-0:44:12:**  Yeah, yeah, it's a fantastic, really interesting.  So that's why we need trees all around with not only in certain parts of the paddock,  we need them all around.  
**0:44:19-0:44:20:**  But how are you going to manage fencing?  Because already, I mean, what's your current fencing situation?  You've got a wire there throughout the year and then you just connect the electricity  
**0:44:29-0:44:30:**  when the...  Yeah, it's there year round, it's with PVC posts, three quarters of an inch thick, and  they are scheduled 40.  
**0:44:40-0:44:41:**  That's important.  So they last a long time.  And then because they are, they will be, right now they are 40 meters apart.  
**0:44:48-0:44:49:**  So no problem.  Yeah.  And we make them every 10 meters.  
**0:44:53-0:44:59:**  I already ordered the post, we have the seat ready.  We need to leave in the rows, breaks so the cows can go through those breaks and not have  to go to the end of the row to go to the next open area.  
**0:45:10-0:45:17:**  So doing it that way, I hope we can get a better forest utilization of the grass and  more forest produced by the Leucaena effect and more Leucaena to be pollard in our winter.  And so that seems like quite a big infrastructure cost, but your math shows that it's worth  
**0:45:33-0:45:34:**  it.  I'm going to tell you why it's worth it because we are irrigating with a low pressure system  overhead that lends itself to trees.  
**0:45:43-0:45:47:**  You cannot use a center pivot with trees, right?  Because the trees get in the way.  So I found a way to do it in a low cost, initial cost and low maintenance and low pressure,  
**0:45:57-0:46:01:**  big drops so they don't get carried by the wind.  And that way we can irrigate one hectare with very low labor and investment.  Now to put the fences to that one hectare, it costs like 50 times less than to buy another  
**0:46:16-0:46:17:**  hectare.  Another hectare to produce double the amount cost you 50 to a hundred times more than putting  the fences and planting the Leucaena.  
**0:46:27-0:46:34:**  So I prefer to keep the money in my pocket and make a better future investment that will  continue to improve every year.  So it's instead of scaling, you're going through the process of really improving the biomass  
**0:46:45-0:46:50:**  and feed potential of the current hectares that you have.  And that's cheaper for you.  It makes more sense because with the same people, same management, same investment,  
**0:46:58-0:47:03:**  you can double your production and your profit or triple.  So that's what I like about this regenerative, achievable pasture systems.  And another thing, once you have the Leucaena growing, because it gets so hot there and  
**0:47:13-0:47:20:**  with the irrigation, you can start planting other species that grow taller and produce  fruit.  And in those places where the cows don't get in, though, because it's a one meter on each  
**0:47:26-0:47:34:**  side, two meter wide swat for the row growth, you can plant vines that produce trees like  dragon fruit.  It grows well.  
**0:47:36-0:47:43:**  So you could diversify even further and then be selling dragon fruit, for example.  Yes.  Or for our own consumption.  
**0:47:46-0:47:47:**  Yeah.  I have planted orange trees, mango trees, avocado trees.  We can plant so many different species.  
**0:47:55-0:47:59:**  You could also, I guess, especially in the tropics, but also in other places, start looking  at timber as not as necessarily as a viable, not like could be, but I'm not saying just  necessarily as a full on enterprise, but as an extra thing where in 2013 years down the  
**0:48:12-0:48:16:**  line, it could be huge capital gain for the next generation that's going to pick up the  farm, for example.  Yes.  
**0:48:18-0:48:23:**  The species that grow very well there for timber is a thick, thick wood.  They grow very well there.  I already planted other for wood that is called a Juana cussely.  
**0:48:29-0:48:33:**  It's a very nice wood for furniture.  So yes, you can do that.  We want to have a three levels pasture, the brush to cut, and then a taller tree.  
**0:48:42-0:48:43:**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I mean, you mentioned we don't want too many trees.  
**0:48:48-0:48:54:**  And one of the reasons I expect is, as you mentioned, sorry, one of the reasons that  you mentioned already is the airflow that you want to have some movement of air on the  farm.  
**0:49:01-0:49:02:**  That is one.  Another one is excessive shade, like in a pine tree forest and nothing grows under it.  You do not want that.  
**0:49:09-0:49:14:**  You need sunlight to reach the floor so you can have a biodiversity.  Yeah, yeah, natural.  Or the wildlife tribe.  
**0:49:20-0:49:25:**  Wildlife tribe in the edge effect where the forest meets the pasture.  So by doing this, we are creating the most hurt effect areas you can.  Interesting.  
**0:49:33-0:49:35:**  But what about competition?  I mean, do you ever, you know, what we're seeing in other circumstances is when there's  enough water, there's a positive effect on the grass.  
**0:49:43-0:49:49:**  But when there's a drought, then suddenly the species can have a tendency to be selfish  and then the tree is efficient and is absorbing a lot of the water and therefore the pasture  takes a hit, for example.  
**0:49:57-0:50:01:**  That's a great observation and one that most people believe.  But I have consulted in many areas, for example, in Chihuahua, in desert areas, the places  where the grass grows better is under shrubs and trees.  
**0:50:12-0:50:19:**  In the mountains, when they say, oh, we want to cut all these live oaks, they're shrubs.  They don't grow tall because they get 12 to 14 inches per year in the summer, in the late  summer.  
**0:50:27-0:50:31:**  But we told them, look, where is the grass growing better?  Oh, under the trees.  And you want to cut them?  
**0:50:34-0:50:36:**  Oh, no.  The owner immediately said, stop cutting them, stop cutting them.  But in truth, that's where the grass grows best.  
**0:50:44-0:50:46:**  And it's because of the nutrient recycling.  The trees are a nutrient pump with deeper roots because of the less temperature, because  of the diffuse shade.  
**0:50:56-0:51:02:**  We want diffuse shade that you get by spacing of the trees and selecting your species.  And because of the mycorrhiza, live oaks and leucaena have very good mycorrhiza to bring  life back to the soil.  
**0:51:14-0:51:19:**  So you don't believe there's a context in which, you know, there will be, you'll have  to choose between pasture and trees or trees.  I haven't seen that yet.  
**0:51:26-0:51:33:**  I have seen in desert areas where the trees started to die off, invasive trees like with  such a mesquite, they will start to die off because the grass being a shallower rooted  will consume the moisture with higher humus after doing the total grazing process.  
**0:51:48-0:51:51:**  The humus increases.  You know, 1% organic matter holds at 25,000 gallons per acre of moisture.  So it doesn't go deep enough for the tree roots and they start to die off.  
**0:52:04-0:52:06:**  That's in desert area.  So you need management always.  But you need the trees.  
**0:52:11-0:52:12:**  Don't kill them off.  Yeah.  And actually, I mean, this is also what we're trying to investigate here is to understand,  
**0:52:19-0:52:21:**  you know, where does it work and where not.  Observation, observation, go and look at them and see where the grass grows better.  Yeah.  
**0:52:28-0:52:29:**  Yeah.  I mean, talking about this, I just recently posted on our social media of the podcast  observations from the farm where I'm at at the moment.  
**0:52:37-0:52:43:**  And you'll see where we have tree lines, fruit tree lines that are five meter apart after  three weeks of drought on the sandy soil.  The green, the pasture was green and coming back.  
**0:52:51-0:52:56:**  Places where we had about 10 to 15 meters apart in between the tree lines, it was yellow.  The only thing sticking out was alfalfa and it was 10, 15 meters tall, spotted around,  but pretty much yellow.  
**0:53:03-0:53:07:**  And it's a pattern the farmer where I'm working, he's seeing this year on year.  Just one example, we see it in other places.  That means you need them closer.  
**0:53:12-0:53:13:**  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  
**0:53:15-0:53:20:**  And to me, I found we have been observing, observing and every 40 meters is too far apart.  We need them closer.  Yeah.  
**0:53:24-0:53:26:**  That's fantastic.  One of the things that can be confusing with this type of system is the cycles of rotation,  because one thing is grazing with silver pasture, but of course what you're specialized in is  
**0:53:41-0:53:49:**  non-selective grazing and getting and creating a mobile predator imitating.  You could describe it much better than I can, but I wanted to understand how that works  with your silver pasture systems.  
**0:53:55-0:53:59:**  Did you meet any big challenges with having to move the animals regularly?  I mean, how does that fit in with dynamic rotational systems?  Oh yeah.  
**0:54:05-0:54:06:**  It's not a problem.  You see, we need to do non-selective grazing followed by a long enough rest period so they  replenish fully their energy reserves because we need fat roots.  
**0:54:18-0:54:26:**  Fat roots leads to fat soil, which means high in human content and fat soil leads to fat  cattle and fat cattle can give you a fat wallet, but it all starts with fat roots.  So how do we create fat roots?  
**0:54:38-0:54:48:**  Well, what creates energy is photosynthesis and what consumes energy in a plant is respiring.  The stems respire, the leaves produce photosynthesis energy.  So the difference between the production of energy and the consumption of energy is what's  
**0:55:00-0:55:07:**  left for production and what's left after production is returned to the soil, to the  rhizospora as exudates to feed the soil microorganisms.  When the plant roots get fat, the soil microorganisms get fat and when they get fat, they are converted  
**0:55:22-0:55:29:**  into humus after many digestions by other generations of microorganisms with the final  digestion being carried out by fungi.  And then after a process like maturing, a process of humification, it's converted into  
**0:55:39-0:55:45:**  humus, which is the stable fraction of organic matter that lasts for over a hundred years  in your soil and gives it a dark brown color and it's good earthy smell.  So that's how you create humus and trees play an important part in this.  
**0:55:59-0:56:05:**  Now what makes a highly productive grass or forest plant?  The leaves to stem ratio.  That's what you said.  
**0:56:09-0:56:15:**  So the leaves to stem ratio is directly influenced by the type of grazing.  If it's a selective grazing where they take the leaves and leave the stems, that means  lower energy plant with lower humus formation.  
**0:56:27-0:56:31:**  If you do a non-selective grazing, what comes up?  Leaves.  When you mow your lawn, you get a high leaves to stem ratio in your regrowth.  
**0:56:38-0:56:39:**  How do you keep it there?  The high leaves to stem ratio all the way into stockpile.  Well, by doing a non-selective grazing after the grass plant has fully replenished its  
**0:56:53-0:57:01:**  reserves and then you allow it to stockpile and it will keep growing the size of its leaves  without producing seed heads and increase humus.  And this is a virtuous spiral that will go up and up every year because we stockpile  
**0:57:12-0:57:16:**  half of the property, not the whole of the property.  Every year.  And then we alternate these areas.  
**0:57:19-0:57:21:**  Okay, nice.  So that's the basis of having a healthy pasture system with a lot of pasture.  That's also why pollarding is much better than browsing because you take the stems off.  
**0:57:37-0:57:40:**  That's why the regrowth is so much faster.  So even though it's more labor than just browsing it off, it's much more productive and stable.  Yeah.  
**0:57:48-0:57:49:**  It's important.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It makes sense.  
**0:57:52-0:57:56:**  It's clearly an important part of your system there.  And they're pollarded every year, right?  Each tree gets pollarded every year.  
**0:58:00-0:58:01:**  Yes.  With 50 per hectare left to grow mature and not touched.  Interesting.  
**0:58:07-0:58:08:**  Okay.  Very nice.  Listen, for me, you've been very clear at answering the questions and you've defined  
**0:58:21-0:58:30:**  for us quite a basic introduction to the functioning of your system, which somehow seems very elegant.  And especially the way you're explaining it, it's simply elegant.  I love elegant simplicity, like a paperclip.  
**0:58:40-0:58:44:**  That's elegant simplicity or a ballpoint pen.  I love those things.  So I try to do it very simple, easy to manage and easy to explain.  
**0:58:51-0:58:52:**  That's fantastic.  And actually, maybe we can finish off by you explaining a bit your recent course that I  think it just started or it's about to start, but maybe you can present to our readers some  
**0:59:02-0:59:07:**  of your educational work if they're interested to look further into your work and your techniques.  Yes.  You can find my website, it's www.rwranching.com.  
**0:59:17-0:59:24:**  And I am YouTube under RealWealth Ranching on Facebook also.  And the course that is coming out in Spanish on August the 2nd is called Pastoreo Total.  And then in September or October, we're going to come out with a total grazing maximizer,  
**0:59:38-0:59:43:**  which includes adapted genetics and selection guidelines with total grazing.  It's two courses in one.  Okay.  
**0:59:46-0:59:48:**  So you need to sign up.  You can go there to the Facebook group or the webpage and sign in and you will get my  weekly blogs, which are also posted on Instagram and on Facebook and on YouTube.  
**1:00:03-1:00:08:**  But you'll get it to your email and you will get the announcement on when the next opening  will be for the next course.  Fantastic.  
**1:00:12-1:00:13:**  Fantastic.  Well, Jaime, thank you so much for coming on the podcast and for sharing with us your  large experience on the topic.  
**1:00:24-1:00:28:**  Well, you know how it is.  Experience comes from poor decisions and good decisions come from experience.  So I have made a lot of mistakes.

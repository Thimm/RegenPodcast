### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Fri, 28 Oct 2022 14:35:23)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:45:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:49:**  Hi and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:49-0:00:51:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:51-0:00:55:**  I'm today with Richard Perkins from Richdale Farm in Sweden.  
**0:00:55-0:01:01:**  We discuss the tree systems he has planted on his farm and more specifically the opportunity  
**0:01:01-0:01:08:**  of integrating trees to market gardening and pastured poultry, two of his key enterprises.  
**0:01:08-0:01:13:**  Richard is also an educator with the mission of helping farmers to build and manage successful  
**0:01:13-0:01:16:**  small scale farms.  
**0:01:16-0:01:20:**  He is therefore the ideal guest to have a conversation on how to make small scale agroforestry  
**0:01:20-0:01:24:**  systems viable and their place in the farm strategy.  
**0:01:24-0:01:26:**  I hope you enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:26-0:01:28:**  Hi Richard, welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:28-0:01:29:**  Great, thanks for having me.  
**0:01:29-0:01:31:**  It's a pleasure to be here.  
**0:01:31-0:01:33:**  Yeah, we're really, really happy to have you.  
**0:01:33-0:01:39:**  Could you just start by giving a bit of context on your project, how you work on farming and  
**0:01:39-0:01:41:**  how you got to farming?  
**0:01:41-0:01:42:**  Sure.  
**0:01:42-0:01:45:**  I went to agriculture school when I was 18.  
**0:01:45-0:01:51:**  I actually went into agriculture studying organic horticulture crop production and spent  
**0:01:51-0:01:58:**  my late teens, early twenties working on organic vegetable productions in the UK where I'm  
**0:01:58-0:01:59:**  from.  
**0:01:59-0:02:06:**  And I got a bit disheartened with that because I worked backbreaking jobs, very low pay,  
**0:02:06-0:02:12:**  built up a lot of skill base and experiences, but I left on a journey to study other forms  
**0:02:12-0:02:17:**  of agriculture, particularly animal and perennial based, tree based agriculture, which took  
**0:02:17-0:02:20:**  me on journeys around the world.  
**0:02:20-0:02:28:**  And that's a whole big story in itself, but it led me to, yeah, I guess a holistic approach  
**0:02:28-0:02:36:**  to diversified mixed farming, which is what European agriculture always was for thousands  
**0:02:36-0:02:37:**  of years.  
**0:02:37-0:02:38:**  You could say.  
**0:02:38-0:02:42:**  I ended up moving to 59 degrees north in Sweden.  
**0:02:42-0:02:49:**  I never expected to live this far north in a cold, expensive, pretty harsh regulatory  
**0:02:49-0:02:53:**  environment, but it has a lot of benefits too.  
**0:02:53-0:02:56:**  And I've come to really love the climate here.  
**0:02:56-0:03:04:**  I think anyone anywhere in the world has easily can put together problems that they have with  
**0:03:04-0:03:09:**  their particular climate or context, but that's kind of the way farmers work.  
**0:03:09-0:03:14:**  There's always a problem with the weather or the landscape in some way, but there's  
**0:03:14-0:03:16:**  pros and cons to every landscape.  
**0:03:16-0:03:22:**  So I set about to design a farm that would be fueled on perennial crops, pasture and  
**0:03:22-0:03:27:**  tree crops, but those things don't pay returns quickly.  
**0:03:27-0:03:32:**  And so I've been, I guess, not only a big proponent of mixed farming, but my work's  
**0:03:32-0:03:38:**  really centered on educating people coming into farming, how to get started with low  
**0:03:38-0:03:45:**  cost means with enterprises that are modular, scalable, pay off the investment costs immediately  
**0:03:45-0:03:47:**  and start making money.  
**0:03:47-0:03:52:**  And I think any of your listeners will be well aware that farms are bottomless pits  
**0:03:52-0:03:55:**  that you can pour money into.  
**0:03:55-0:03:56:**  So we need to be pragmatic.  
**0:03:56-0:04:03:**  And a lot of us excited about these topics are coming with some degree of idealism, you  
**0:04:03-0:04:04:**  could say.  
**0:04:04-0:04:12:**  And, you know, usually with a deep pins interest and passion for whole systems and ecology,  
**0:04:12-0:04:17:**  and that's often what fuels the sort of passion that can make these small farms work, you  
**0:04:17-0:04:21:**  know, in terms of relationship marketing, et cetera.  
**0:04:21-0:04:29:**  But I very quickly focused on two or three enterprises that are profitable immediately.  
**0:04:29-0:04:32:**  In our case, it was market gardening and pastured poultry.  
**0:04:32-0:04:37:**  We're a very small farm, it's 13 hectare farm.  
**0:04:37-0:04:39:**  So larger animals are out of the question.  
**0:04:39-0:04:43:**  And things like tree crops take a long time to pay back.  
**0:04:43-0:04:48:**  So those systems that we implemented very early in the farm, as things are very slow  
**0:04:48-0:04:54:**  growing up here, this far north, we have a three month cross free growing season.  
**0:04:54-0:04:57:**  And so we prioritize putting those systems in.  
**0:04:57-0:05:03:**  But in order to pay for those, we needed enterprises that were very profitable and lucrative.  
**0:05:03-0:05:08:**  And for small farms, that's things like poultry, always going to be the things that can pay  
**0:05:08-0:05:13:**  the bills and scale easily with the market base.  
**0:05:13-0:05:18:**  So this farms had a two prong approach where, you know, we set out with wanting to grow  
**0:05:18-0:05:24:**  all our own food, as well as make a living from our land.  
**0:05:24-0:05:29:**  But we also wanted to document that process, do a lot of data collection and facilitate  
**0:05:29-0:05:35:**  a whole new generation of farmers to get started on the land in the smart way too.  
**0:05:35-0:05:37:**  So that's what we've been doing up here.  
**0:05:37-0:05:42:**  I'm curious, just to have a bit more of a clearer picture of the perennial systems you've  
**0:05:42-0:05:46:**  put into place, what are kind of the main systems you've designed and implemented?  
**0:05:46-0:05:48:**  There's a few different things going on.  
**0:05:48-0:05:51:**  So half of the farm is actually forestry.  
**0:05:51-0:05:56:**  And when I say forestry, I'm saying that in air quotes, because in Sweden, 90% of all  
**0:05:56-0:06:01:**  the trees are monocultural spruce.  
**0:06:01-0:06:04:**  And that's what most of the Swedish landscape is made up of.  
**0:06:04-0:06:08:**  Most coming to Sweden often talk about the magical Swedish forest, but it's a bit of  
**0:06:08-0:06:12:**  a travesty because these are what I would call vertical deserts.  
**0:06:12-0:06:15:**  There's a diversity of one.  
**0:06:15-0:06:22:**  And it's a really damaging industry that's involved in major clear cutting.  
**0:06:22-0:06:27:**  And the sort of big machinery that runs that industry is only profitable if it's, I think  
**0:06:27-0:06:32:**  the figure is something like the harvesters have to be cutting trees down every 40 seconds  
**0:06:32-0:06:34:**  to be making money.  
**0:06:34-0:06:40:**  And so timber, the quality of timber has decreased even in my short lifetime.  
**0:06:40-0:06:45:**  Timber is being cut year round, which is not the best for the timber quality.  
**0:06:45-0:06:51:**  It's shorter life cycles and kiln dried faster, faster cycles all the time.  
**0:06:51-0:06:56:**  And it causes major hydrological problems with the clear cutting on marginal ground  
**0:06:56-0:06:58:**  where the forestry tends to be placed.  
**0:06:58-0:07:05:**  So I'm sure most of your listeners are aware trees belong in certain places in the landscape.  
**0:07:05-0:07:11:**  And that's typically on the tops of ridges where the soil is poor, shallow, dry, not  
**0:07:11-0:07:18:**  suitable for pasture or tillage operations or in the sort of eroding valley basins where  
**0:07:18-0:07:22:**  perennial roots are needed to protect the hydrological cycle.  
**0:07:22-0:07:28:**  The trouble is, excuse me, the trouble is in Sweden, it's very young soils.  
**0:07:28-0:07:31:**  It was underwater here 10,000 years ago.  
**0:07:31-0:07:35:**  And so it's extremely poor and very variable soils.  
**0:07:35-0:07:40:**  So when they cut clear cuts here, it creates major devastation in the landscapes and the  
**0:07:40-0:07:43:**  water cycles.  
**0:07:43-0:07:47:**  So half of the farm was monocultural spruce.  
**0:07:47-0:07:54:**  And so I've been working the most of the forestry work I've been doing is actually converting  
**0:07:54-0:08:02:**  monocultural spruce back to broadleaf mixed species and running pastures or forest raised  
**0:08:02-0:08:10:**  pigs as a way to cashflow that process with a broad, diverse leaf tree forest being the  
**0:08:10-0:08:14:**  corollary, the sort of happy consequence of that process.  
**0:08:14-0:08:19:**  I did a lot of economy and I'll talk about the other systems we've put in more intentionally  
**0:08:19-0:08:24:**  shortly, but it's very fascinating from an economic standpoint.  
**0:08:24-0:08:31:**  So large monocultural forestry only works at scale in the industry model.  
**0:08:31-0:08:39:**  The forestry here, I cut down the last portion of it because my land is tied with access  
**0:08:39-0:08:41:**  rights with my neighbor.  
**0:08:41-0:08:44:**  So my neighbor and I were in negotiation.  
**0:08:44-0:08:48:**  We had to cut it at some point because he would have to come and cut his anyway.  
**0:08:48-0:08:52:**  I was kind of inclined to keep the forest there and find a different way to make it  
**0:08:52-0:08:56:**  pay to keep the forest there, but we had to cut it.  
**0:08:56-0:08:59:**  But this is on a 70 year cycle, right?  
**0:08:59-0:09:06:**  So those trees, they give a large cash sum, but it equates to about 140 euros per hectare  
**0:09:06-0:09:12:**  per year because of the long cycle for harvesting.  
**0:09:12-0:09:14:**  And that's really poor economics.  
**0:09:14-0:09:20:**  For example, my pastured layers or pastured boilers, they both generate 150 times more  
**0:09:20-0:09:23:**  profit than that per hectare per year.  
**0:09:23-0:09:29:**  I mean 150 times, like when we're talking about farming, we're talking about creating  
**0:09:29-0:09:35:**  energy efficiencies using tools that double our speed or quadruple our speed, but factors  
**0:09:35-0:09:39:**  of 150 are just off the charts.  
**0:09:39-0:09:42:**  So I played with different models with that.  
**0:09:42-0:09:47:**  And one would be, I built a tree house up in the forestry before, because if I rent  
**0:09:47-0:09:54:**  out a tree house for three weekends a year, it's more valuable to keep that forest in  
**0:09:54-0:09:57:**  place and more profitable too.  
**0:09:57-0:10:00:**  But we've also been running pastured pigs under the forest.  
**0:10:00-0:10:03:**  Now that's a very lucrative enterprise.  
**0:10:03-0:10:06:**  It's 50 times more profitable than the forestry.  
**0:10:06-0:10:14:**  And if you do that very carefully with close observation and timing, pigs are the climatic  
**0:10:14-0:10:16:**  trigger for our forest systems.  
**0:10:16-0:10:22:**  So what we see in ecology is all ecosystems are governed by patchy intermittent disturbances  
**0:10:22-0:10:26:**  and wild boar would be the European proxy.  
**0:10:26-0:10:34:**  So we're using old heritage breed pigs to turn the soil, but in a very careful timed  
**0:10:34-0:10:35:**  way.  
**0:10:35-0:10:42:**  So they're constantly moving within half hectopadics, but they're in smaller portions of land within  
**0:10:42-0:10:43:**  that.  
**0:10:43-0:10:44:**  And allowing that ground to recover.  
**0:10:44-0:10:50:**  And what we see is the tree species that come back of a higher diversity than you find anywhere  
**0:10:50-0:10:52:**  in the landscape around us.  
**0:10:52-0:10:57:**  And it's something I've been documenting on our YouTube channel over the years, because  
**0:10:57-0:11:02:**  there's a beautiful comparative study where the neighbors had cut their forestry at the  
**0:11:02-0:11:06:**  same time and have done nothing with it since.  
**0:11:06-0:11:09:**  And it's a totally different species complex, much lower diversity.  
**0:11:09-0:11:14:**  All the brash wood still lies on the ground six, seven years later, whereas ours has been  
**0:11:14-0:11:16:**  incorporated and broken down.  
**0:11:16-0:11:21:**  But we've also timed these interactions with cows and sheep from our pastures to bring  
**0:11:21-0:11:25:**  in the gut flora and fauna from the pasture.  
**0:11:25-0:11:33:**  So now we have high value grazing with trees of large diversity with species that you don't  
**0:11:33-0:11:34:**  see in the landscape around us.  
**0:11:34-0:11:37:**  We have something like 50 Oaks per hectare.  
**0:11:37-0:11:42:**  And there are no full grown Oaks except for two large ones outside my house and one outside  
**0:11:42-0:11:43:**  my neighbor's house.  
**0:11:43-0:11:49:**  But in a 20 kilometer radius of the farm, you don't see broad leaf mature trees except  
**0:11:49-0:11:51:**  in garden plantings.  
**0:11:51-0:11:56:**  And I think Swedish people don't really know what the natural forest assemblies look like  
**0:11:56-0:12:03:**  because there aren't any, or in very small pockets in nature reserves around the country.  
**0:12:03-0:12:08:**  So this is really interesting to me because I see in the face of global weirding, climate  
**0:12:08-0:12:15:**  weirding, whatever's happening in 60, 70, 80 years time, I'm going to have a full stand  
**0:12:15-0:12:22:**  of Oak, Ash, Tilia, all these wonderful hardwoods that are worth something whatever the world  
**0:12:22-0:12:23:**  economy is doing.  
**0:12:23-0:12:29:**  But in the meantime, I've 50 X the income of that land producing nutrient dense food  
**0:12:29-0:12:33:**  with animals in their correct habitat at the same time.  
**0:12:33-0:12:38:**  So that's a really, it's something I don't talk about so much because most people are  
**0:12:38-0:12:44:**  interested in implementing agroforestry systems like silver pastures, silver arable systems.  
**0:12:44-0:12:49:**  But there's a lot of work to do in many parts of the US, Canada, etcetera with taking these  
**0:12:49-0:12:54:**  monocultural plantations and extracting a bit more juice while restoring the ecology  
**0:12:54-0:12:57:**  and habitat there too.  
**0:12:57-0:13:03:**  Other systems we've put in are primarily silver pasture systems.  
**0:13:03-0:13:10:**  And we're so far north, it's been my priority to stick to standard fruits and berries that  
**0:13:10-0:13:11:**  we actually eat.  
**0:13:11-0:13:18:**  So it's all centered around apple pear, plum, cherry, there's hazel and there's our potent  
**0:13:18-0:13:23:**  berry fruits like black currants, white currants, red currants, gooseberries, aronia.  
**0:13:23-0:13:27:**  These are like the superfoods of this part of the world up here at this latitude where  
**0:13:27-0:13:33:**  you get such long sunlight in the summer, you get the development of a lot more riboflavins  
**0:13:33-0:13:37:**  and nutrient density that those berries are literally superfoods.  
**0:13:37-0:13:45:**  And so we've got about a little shy of two kilometers of these perennial rows sitting  
**0:13:45-0:13:52:**  on different spacings up above the pasture dependent on the orientation of those fields.  
**0:13:52-0:13:58:**  And there's about 30,000 euros of produce sitting up above the field, not taking up  
**0:13:58-0:14:03:**  very much space, intelligently planned in that it's not in the way of all the field  
**0:14:03-0:14:08:**  operations and it's fairly low maintenance.  
**0:14:08-0:14:10:**  And then we've got other orchard plantings.  
**0:14:10-0:14:16:**  We grow a lot of like riparian crops like American elder and Saskatoon, things that  
**0:14:16-0:14:21:**  we make like nutrient dense things for our own needs.  
**0:14:21-0:14:28:**  As I said before, we're a farm that produces food for ourselves primarily first and then  
**0:14:28-0:14:31:**  produces other things for sale.  
**0:14:31-0:14:33:**  And so our tree crops fit into that category.  
**0:14:33-0:14:38:**  We have about 10,000 meals served every year in our summer training.  
**0:14:38-0:14:44:**  So we are selling our produce directly to our consumers in that way, you could say.  
**0:14:44-0:14:50:**  So we have fresh berries every day of the year and then we do sell surpluses.  
**0:14:50-0:14:55:**  So we sell jams, we'll include them in vegetable baskets, et cetera.  
**0:14:55-0:15:02:**  We've done that in different ways in the past, but for us, the scale is not big enough that  
**0:15:02-0:15:07:**  it's an important part of the economy compared to our primary enterprises.  
**0:15:07-0:15:15:**  And so we've always had these ancillary enterprises like the pork, fruits, berries, wild mushrooms  
**0:15:15-0:15:16:**  that we harvest.  
**0:15:16-0:15:21:**  There's things that we'll do that make up a significant amount of revenue, but they're  
**0:15:21-0:15:25:**  not significant compared to our primary enterprises.  
**0:15:25-0:15:26:**  You could say.  
**0:15:26-0:15:32:**  You laid out very clearly on the forestry side, the vision on the long term.  
**0:15:32-0:15:37:**  And as you started, you were presenting these poultry or market gardening enterprises as  
**0:15:37-0:15:43:**  ways of getting a quick cash flow and getting profit quite quickly in.  
**0:15:43-0:15:45:**  And I'm wondering, what does that mean for the long term vision?  
**0:15:45-0:15:50:**  Would it be that you always keep these enterprises because they're actually the ones that pay  
**0:15:50-0:15:52:**  and just have a supplement of the tree crops?  
**0:15:52-0:15:56:**  Or is there a succession in your business as well where you see, well, as we go later  
**0:15:56-0:16:01:**  on, I can lay off from these enterprises that are high return, but also a lot of work maybe  
**0:16:01-0:16:04:**  or high inputs and go on the perennials?  
**0:16:04-0:16:08:**  How do you see this evolving throughout the time as these perennial systems mature?  
**0:16:08-0:16:12:**  Well, I think you can look at that in a couple of ways.  
**0:16:12-0:16:18:**  That's obviously going to be totally down to the context of whoever's planning that.  
**0:16:18-0:16:25:**  I think there's a whole scope for successional planning within farms.  
**0:16:25-0:16:30:**  For example, here, we didn't take on a lot of loan and we planned, we made a business  
**0:16:30-0:16:35:**  plan to pay off all debt in the first five years, which we achieved.  
**0:16:35-0:16:41:**  And there is some scope to then bring back in some idealism.  
**0:16:41-0:16:49:**  Now, in a more immediate way for me, one of the ways I think about that was with the past  
**0:16:49-0:16:51:**  in boiler operation.  
**0:16:51-0:16:56:**  I've been very clear about singing the praises of that enterprise, but also highlighting  
**0:16:56-0:16:57:**  the flaws.  
**0:16:57-0:17:03:**  The flaws being we're relying on industry genetics for these hybrid, fast growing birds.  
**0:17:03-0:17:08:**  I've got nothing against hybrid, fast growing birds, but the holistic context of the company  
**0:17:08-0:17:12:**  that owns the genetics is perhaps dubious.  
**0:17:12-0:17:18:**  And we're relying on a lot of important grains and that's becoming increasingly expensive.  
**0:17:18-0:17:23:**  I think that's going to rise in prices again next year when all of the fertilizer bills  
**0:17:23-0:17:26:**  from this year start kicking in.  
**0:17:26-0:17:28:**  And so that's a problem.  
**0:17:28-0:17:34:**  And I planned that enterprise and made the investment to build a slaughter facility on  
**0:17:34-0:17:43:**  the farm, knowing that I could take some time to steer my customer base towards more truly  
**0:17:43-0:17:47:**  pasture raised animals like geese or rabbits, for example.  
**0:17:47-0:17:49:**  But that's a long educational process.  
**0:17:49-0:17:55:**  I think the way that we see society moves is that people will not change their habits  
**0:17:55-0:17:57:**  dramatically until they're forced to.  
**0:17:57-0:18:05:**  There's only a couple of cases in history I can see where people in very adverse circumstances  
**0:18:05-0:18:14:**  actually creatively and co-creatively chose to adapt their ways of living for mutual benefit.  
**0:18:14-0:18:24:**  It's more likely looking at history that we go back to our patterns, patriarchal tendencies,  
**0:18:24-0:18:25:**  you could say.  
**0:18:25-0:18:30:**  So the reason I'm saying these things is that I planned that enterprise invested in this  
**0:18:30-0:18:39:**  slaughter because it would give me the ability to slowly pivot to these more idealistic enterprises  
**0:18:39-0:18:45:**  at a time when we might be forced to due to change in climate, feed costs, et cetera,  
**0:18:45-0:18:51:**  where people become more pliable to change their habits, but also where I wasn't in debt  
**0:18:51-0:18:55:**  that I could afford to drop the revenue significantly.  
**0:18:55-0:18:59:**  And so you could apply that same thinking to the tree systems.  
**0:18:59-0:19:05:**  If I'm producing all of my family's food and I've paid off my debts, then I can afford  
**0:19:05-0:19:10:**  to cut out enterprises and shift towards those tree crops.  
**0:19:10-0:19:16:**  Now in my case, I was never intending to fully cut out those enterprises.  
**0:19:16-0:19:20:**  I eat a lot of meat and I enjoy working with animals.  
**0:19:20-0:19:26:**  And the benefits of animals in an ecosystem are profound in terms of habitat creation,  
**0:19:26-0:19:27:**  soil regeneration.  
**0:19:27-0:19:32:**  It's really animals that drive those fertility loops in our climates.  
**0:19:32-0:19:37:**  So for me, it's never about completely leaving those enterprises.  
**0:19:37-0:19:46:**  It will be more a case of I can afford to not use these hybrid meat birds and take a  
**0:19:46-0:19:54:**  more robust heritage-based bird and still make the business work in my context by utilizing  
**0:19:54-0:19:56:**  those tree crops, et cetera.  
**0:19:56-0:19:58:**  I think it comes down to scale, right?  
**0:19:58-0:20:05:**  You could easily design an agroforestry farm that over a certain number of years was planted  
**0:20:05-0:20:12:**  at a density and designed primarily to take over the economy at some point.  
**0:20:12-0:20:13:**  Of course you can do that.  
**0:20:13-0:20:21:**  But it's a very different starting point and it requires a lot of intimate knowledge and  
**0:20:21-0:20:27:**  visioning that I think someone coming new to this would not possess probably.  
**0:20:27-0:20:32:**  And using animals or some other enterprise to cashflow that or even other perennial crops  
**0:20:32-0:20:37:**  like strawberries, high value cash crops while the system sort of fills in and takes over.  
**0:20:37-0:20:41:**  But the bottom line is that it's got to be done at the correct scale.  
**0:20:41-0:20:46:**  I think a big part of my book, Regenerative Agriculture, was trying to introduce people  
**0:20:46-0:20:49:**  coming into the farming world about critical mass and scale.  
**0:20:49-0:20:54:**  It's like, yeah, you can make a living doing this or this or this, but you've got to be  
**0:20:54-0:20:59:**  thinking at the right scale or no, you can't.  
**0:20:59-0:21:02:**  That made me think like in addition to the scale, there's a real issue about skills and  
**0:21:02-0:21:08:**  you must realize that because you're training a lot of new farmers lacking experience and  
**0:21:08-0:21:12:**  actually managing to design at the same time a profitable enterprise, even let's say just  
**0:21:12-0:21:18:**  focusing on poultry and starting a business, which is already a big challenge in itself.  
**0:21:18-0:21:23:**  And at the same time, having the capacity to plan perennial systems that are going to  
**0:21:23-0:21:26:**  be in the right place are not going to be a hindrance that you're going to be able to  
**0:21:26-0:21:28:**  technically master.  
**0:21:28-0:21:30:**  That's quite a massive challenge, isn't it?  
**0:21:30-0:21:32:**  Yeah, I think so.  
**0:21:32-0:21:36:**  And I think like you've got to decide early on, am I going to be an orchardist?  
**0:21:36-0:21:40:**  Am I going to be a, you know, am I a tree farm or am I an animal farm?  
**0:21:40-0:21:49:**  And I think that the model I set out here is partly influenced by the educational aspirations  
**0:21:49-0:21:50:**  for this place.  
**0:21:50-0:21:56:**  Like I knew this would be a hub for people coming to train.  
**0:21:56-0:22:02:**  So it's not at a scale where I, you know, I could certainly double down on those plantings.  
**0:22:02-0:22:08:**  I was thinking about this last winter, if I did this whole thing again, I would probably  
**0:22:08-0:22:12:**  double or triple the intensity of tree planning.  
**0:22:12-0:22:20:**  And I think if someone wants, you know, it's aspiring to go towards tree crops being the  
**0:22:20-0:22:27:**  long term primary enterprise base, then you've got a design for that intensity to start with.  
**0:22:27-0:22:34:**  And I think what you're saying, it speaks to, you know, it's a bit of our cultural condition.  
**0:22:34-0:22:40:**  It's like everyone wants to be setting their own thing up, doing their own thing.  
**0:22:40-0:22:47:**  There's a lot more scope for a lot more networks expertise in Europe.  
**0:22:47-0:22:53:**  I think the cultural nuances, the market differences make it very complex here.  
**0:22:53-0:23:00:**  And there's a big need for the sharing of skills and knowledge like regionally bringing  
**0:23:00-0:23:02:**  other people into your farm plan.  
**0:23:02-0:23:06:**  Like if you're new to farming, and you're starting up a small business that you've never  
**0:23:06-0:23:11:**  run a business before, that's, as I would call it, the steepest learning curve you could  
**0:23:11-0:23:12:**  possibly have.  
**0:23:12-0:23:17:**  I mean, it's very hard to make any business work, just buying coffee beans, serving coffee,  
**0:23:17-0:23:21:**  paying the rent is hard to make work, you know, but setting up an agricultural company  
**0:23:21-0:23:23:**  is really tough.  
**0:23:23-0:23:31:**  And I think a lot of the passionate, wonderful people that can make this stuff work could  
**0:23:31-0:23:36:**  use a lot more thorough education coming into the field.  
**0:23:36-0:23:43:**  I think it's very easy in today's world with social media to get caught up on the wrong  
**0:23:43-0:23:44:**  aspects.  
**0:23:44-0:23:50:**  And I think that's something that's been a key focus here with my educational work is  
**0:23:50-0:23:57:**  hammering the background, financial planning, time and motion analysis, decision making  
**0:23:57-0:24:02:**  inside that's what makes farming work, not these wonderful pictures of trees in the sunset  
**0:24:02-0:24:04:**  and chickens running around.  
**0:24:04-0:24:09:**  So that's relatively easy compared to making it work as a business.  
**0:24:09-0:24:16:**  So I think people have to get very clear about the scale and the market base and also their  
**0:24:16-0:24:21:**  skills and take a lot more training or buy expertise in.  
**0:24:21-0:24:29:**  You know, you've got a lot of young people fueled with passion, not a lot of cash, usually  
**0:24:29-0:24:36:**  trying very hard to do everything for themselves, often not putting any money into marketing,  
**0:24:36-0:24:41:**  and often trying to master five new skills at the same time.  
**0:24:41-0:24:45:**  And there's no other industry that you would even attempt to do that in.  
**0:24:45-0:24:48:**  You know, it's a lot of idealism still.  
**0:24:48-0:24:49:**  And it's beautiful.  
**0:24:49-0:24:51:**  And it needs that passion injection.  
**0:24:51-0:24:54:**  That's what makes business work.  
**0:24:54-0:24:58:**  And I think a lot of people are invested in this as a lifestyle also, you know, they want  
**0:24:58-0:25:01:**  to learn and they want to know for themselves.  
**0:25:01-0:25:02:**  And that's, that's great.  
**0:25:02-0:25:08:**  But I think, as you point out, rightly, like these are big skill sets, and you've got to  
**0:25:08-0:25:13:**  decide like, is this the sideline thing that I can afford to run a bit loosely?  
**0:25:13-0:25:18:**  Or is this my primary enterprise that I need to put my time and focus into?  
**0:25:18-0:25:23:**  We also mentioned quite like that kind of extreme scenario where you're actually the  
**0:25:23-0:25:28:**  trees you're including, you're actually planning as a tree crops and high value crops and high  
**0:25:28-0:25:31:**  management and high skill sets.  
**0:25:31-0:25:36:**  But we could also imagine much lower, you know, work input systems much simpler, turned  
**0:25:36-0:25:38:**  around biomass or just ecosystem services.  
**0:25:38-0:25:43:**  If we take the case of your poultry enterprises, you know, you could just be saying I'm planting  
**0:25:43-0:25:50:**  trees for for chickens, you know, and then that, you know, kind of simplifies a lot your  
**0:25:50-0:25:54:**  your design and also reduces what you're expecting to get out of it.  
**0:25:54-0:25:57:**  Yeah, you're not expecting a significant income out of it.  
**0:25:57-0:26:01:**  But that can be like a simpler way of designing trees and maybe a bit more realistic than  
**0:26:01-0:26:06:**  thinking you're also going to be a full time orchardist and have productive, beautiful  
**0:26:06-0:26:07:**  systems as well.  
**0:26:07-0:26:08:**  Sure.  
**0:26:08-0:26:14:**  Yeah, well, as you know, I've always said there's pretty much room for trees in every  
**0:26:14-0:26:19:**  farm I've ever been to, except perhaps the cremator hough, where they're actually cutting  
**0:26:19-0:26:21:**  their trees out now.  
**0:26:21-0:26:27:**  But most trees could benefit from trees for their ecosystem services, or utilizing bits  
**0:26:27-0:26:29:**  of land that aren't useful.  
**0:26:29-0:26:34:**  You know, there's all these different patterns that we can apply trees to landscapes.  
**0:26:34-0:26:39:**  And some of the most overlooked are things like windbreaks, hedgerows, riparians, these  
**0:26:39-0:26:45:**  are all highly productive systems that don't require large amounts of management.  
**0:26:45-0:26:51:**  And as you say, simple things like biomass plantings, like shelter belts within the fields,  
**0:26:51-0:26:58:**  pretty much no maintenance and can be providing all of those same ecosystem services without  
**0:26:58-0:27:01:**  any pressure to yield.  
**0:27:01-0:27:04:**  And those systems don't need to be high cost at all.  
**0:27:04-0:27:10:**  You know, there's in Europe now you're buying whips for hedgerow planning for like 10 cents  
**0:27:10-0:27:11:**  a tree.  
**0:27:11-0:27:12:**  I mean, this is not super high cost.  
**0:27:12-0:27:18:**  It's a one time labor input that can be mechanized that it takes virtually no effort at a time  
**0:27:18-0:27:23:**  of year when you're not doing much else anyway, typically, and certainly in the cool temper  
**0:27:23-0:27:25:**  climates.  
**0:27:25-0:27:31:**  And so there's there's no reason not to plan trees in I think it's just important as you  
**0:27:31-0:27:39:**  point out to really define in in your unique time, place and circumstance, what sense of  
**0:27:39-0:27:44:**  production you need and what time allocation you're going to put on it.  
**0:27:44-0:27:49:**  And I think it's something I've always been really careful to try and explore with people  
**0:27:49-0:27:54:**  certainly coming into my farm is like, Hey, look, I would not set this farm up in this  
**0:27:54-0:27:56:**  way.  
**0:27:56-0:28:00:**  If I was just trying to produce an income for my family.  
**0:28:00-0:28:04:**  I would just run boilers or I just run layers or I just run a market garden.  
**0:28:04-0:28:11:**  I'm specifically doing a lot of different things here because I was setting out to create  
**0:28:11-0:28:16:**  a place that could provide educational perspectives that didn't exist.  
**0:28:16-0:28:21:**  And it's what I wish I'd seen when I was learning.  
**0:28:21-0:28:27:**  But I think that's a thing that I certainly on my longer term trainings, I've managed  
**0:28:27-0:28:31:**  to bash out of the heads of people is like, don't try and do too much at once.  
**0:28:31-0:28:36:**  Like there's no benefit to that you'll burn out and it'll cost too much and you won't  
**0:28:36-0:28:37:**  look after any of it.  
**0:28:37-0:28:41:**  Well, it's like do one or two things well.  
**0:28:41-0:28:45:**  But I would always plan all those other things in from the beginning.  
**0:28:45-0:28:50:**  Like in terms of farm design, I would lay it all out start with, but focus on things  
**0:28:50-0:28:51:**  that bring money.  
**0:28:51-0:28:57:**  Primarily, if you've got the capital, then put it in trees and water systems and things  
**0:28:57-0:29:02:**  that are going to be creating a thriving habitat.  
**0:29:02-0:29:08:**  And at the same time, you can't underestimate the benefits of integrating trees.  
**0:29:08-0:29:13:**  I mean, Europe's got some of the longest running data collection of integrating trees into  
**0:29:13-0:29:16:**  pasture and arable crops.  
**0:29:16-0:29:20:**  And it's undeniable what benefits are there.  
**0:29:20-0:29:25:**  So I think it's I like the idea of like trying to create some pattern language within that  
**0:29:25-0:29:30:**  it's like, okay, here's like 10 patterns of applying trees to farm landscapes.  
**0:29:30-0:29:35:**  And now let's unpack them kind of like I did with regenerative agriculture, try and make  
**0:29:35-0:29:43:**  a like matrix of cost, time input, ecosystem benefit, profitability, to help people like  
**0:29:43-0:29:45:**  navigate that maybe someone's already done that.  
**0:29:45-0:29:46:**  I don't know.  
**0:29:46-0:29:53:**  But I think it needs like a deep understanding of the subject and it needs really analytical  
**0:29:53-0:29:57:**  thinking because there's such long term systems.  
**0:29:57-0:30:03:**  But I'm curious because, of course, you know, your farm isn't as you mentioned, I mean,  
**0:30:03-0:30:04:**  it's not exactly like a normal farm.  
**0:30:04-0:30:10:**  Like the choices you've made have been guided by providing an educational and demonstration.  
**0:30:10-0:30:14:**  But if we had a thought experiment for a second and we're imagining, you know, you're advising  
**0:30:14-0:30:19:**  a young farmer that's just about to start one enterprise, do you think it's a good idea  
**0:30:19-0:30:22:**  to integrate trees into that enterprise?  
**0:30:22-0:30:23:**  So let's give an example.  
**0:30:23-0:30:26:**  You know, you're going to start on market gardening.  
**0:30:26-0:30:29:**  Does it make sense to do agroforestry market gardening and alley cropping?  
**0:30:29-0:30:34:**  Because again, that goes back to the idea that it's not for nothing that conventional  
**0:30:34-0:30:40:**  farming simplified landscapes, not justifying it, but it is because it is easier to manage  
**0:30:40-0:30:43:**  and you're removing a layer of complexity that just makes it easier to manage in some  
**0:30:43-0:30:44:**  way.  
**0:30:44-0:30:50:**  So where I'm trying to get is balancing this, where I'm trying to get is balancing this,  
**0:30:50-0:30:53:**  you know, need for complexifying landscapes.  
**0:30:53-0:30:56:**  But also that's hard, you know, and it's not for nothing that they were simplified and  
**0:30:56-0:31:00:**  having the skills to follow that as a young farmer.  
**0:31:00-0:31:02:**  Well, it's a balanced thing, right?  
**0:31:02-0:31:10:**  Because that simplification has led to massive problems with habitat, soil, water cycles,  
**0:31:10-0:31:11:**  carbon cycles, etc.  
**0:31:11-0:31:17:**  So that's obviously too simplistic, to the point that it's debt based mechanistic, and  
**0:31:17-0:31:23:**  it's an extractive way of managing land.  
**0:31:23-0:31:24:**  That doesn't work.  
**0:31:24-0:31:25:**  We know that.  
**0:31:25-0:31:31:**  And I think it's a valid point you bring up, it's like, it doesn't have to be too complex.  
**0:31:31-0:31:37:**  So I've been advocating for many years, like my idealized market garden setup would include  
**0:31:37-0:31:38:**  trees.  
**0:31:38-0:31:43:**  And I've seen at least a dozen of my students actually implement that, but I don't know  
**0:31:43-0:31:50:**  if they've taken all of the parts of that to heart.  
**0:31:50-0:31:55:**  I didn't put trees into my market garden because I started it on the neighbor's land and so  
**0:31:55-0:31:59:**  I wasn't allowed to put trees in.  
**0:31:59-0:32:04:**  But I think there's a lot of scope for partial shading.  
**0:32:04-0:32:08:**  Certainly as you go further south in Europe, I would definitely grow vegetables in that  
**0:32:08-0:32:11:**  way, instead of using shade net.  
**0:32:11-0:32:17:**  But I would do it here, but I would, I mean, we're working on a very small intensive scale  
**0:32:17-0:32:18:**  there.  
**0:32:18-0:32:23:**  So I would be looking at traditional modern or not traditional standard modern orchards,  
**0:32:23-0:32:29:**  I'd be using super dwarfing trees, high density, to get that production out because we're talking  
**0:32:29-0:32:35:**  about highly fertile beds, high levels of management, daily visual inspections.  
**0:32:35-0:32:41:**  That's where it would be suitable if it was at a scale, you know, when we're talking about  
**0:32:41-0:32:46:**  a couple of thousand square meters of intensive market garden beds, there you can start to  
**0:32:46-0:32:52:**  get quite a decent economy from intensive apples that you sell to that existing customer  
**0:32:52-0:32:55:**  base or juice or whatever it is.  
**0:32:55-0:33:02:**  So I think it's got to be at the right intensity, like planting standard trees randomly in the  
**0:33:02-0:33:03:**  middle of beds is not going to work.  
**0:33:03-0:33:07:**  But I think it doesn't have to look any particular way.  
**0:33:07-0:33:14:**  I think there's a lot more scope for perennial crops in market garden settings, like things,  
**0:33:14-0:33:21:**  simple things like strawberries, asparagus, a lot of market gardeners already doing.  
**0:33:21-0:33:26:**  And maybe the simplest way to approach it is just thinking of hedgerows.  
**0:33:26-0:33:29:**  You need windbreak around your market garden anyway.  
**0:33:29-0:33:38:**  So bringing a bit of biological diversity is profoundly beneficial to crop protection.  
**0:33:38-0:33:45:**  We've been pretty blessed up here with very low instances of crop problems in the market  
**0:33:45-0:33:46:**  garden.  
**0:33:46-0:33:51:**  I would say primarily from the no dig approach that we have, which I think is optimizing  
**0:33:51-0:33:52:**  soil care.  
**0:33:52-0:33:58:**  But the sheer diversity means that we've got a massive population of small birds and insect  
**0:33:58-0:34:04:**  life that you can see that nature's complexity is creating resilience.  
**0:34:04-0:34:09:**  In ecological terms, diversity is resilient.  
**0:34:09-0:34:15:**  When I first moved to Sweden about 10 years ago now, I came to this farm and there were  
**0:34:15-0:34:18:**  no small songbirds.  
**0:34:18-0:34:21:**  And it's loud here now in the spring.  
**0:34:21-0:34:26:**  It's like the neighbors and elderly man has been every year, he says there's more and  
**0:34:26-0:34:28:**  more birds every year.  
**0:34:28-0:34:30:**  And it's like, yeah, I'm not surprised.  
**0:34:30-0:34:38:**  We're making this diverse island that's worth landing on, essentially.  
**0:34:38-0:34:48:**  But I think people have to have a realistic appraisal of the skill sets, the market demands.  
**0:34:48-0:34:50:**  But there's no reason not to bring that diversity in.  
**0:34:50-0:34:57:**  But you can simplify it by putting in hedgerows or just berry production, raspberry production,  
**0:34:57-0:34:58:**  something simple.  
**0:34:58-0:35:03:**  There's scope for all those things without making it overly complex.  
**0:35:03-0:35:07:**  And I think a lot of that is a spill off from the market, sorry, from the forest garden  
**0:35:07-0:35:13:**  world, where people getting excited about 400 varieties of things they've never seen  
**0:35:13-0:35:16:**  before, let alone know how to harvest or eat.  
**0:35:16-0:35:17:**  And that's not useful.  
**0:35:17-0:35:22:**  I've always sort of taken the approach of why don't we try and integrate the things  
**0:35:22-0:35:28:**  we actually eat in a simple, robust, linear way that's easy to harvest and practical to  
**0:35:28-0:35:30:**  maintain or whatever.  
**0:35:30-0:35:35:**  But like, for example, including, you know, apple trees in your market garden, you're  
**0:35:35-0:35:40:**  confident that you could still keep a high level of efficiency in the way you move around  
**0:35:40-0:35:44:**  and harvest and also not like make your life more complicated with root competition, for  
**0:35:44-0:35:48:**  example, or anything else like that's something you would happily do.  
**0:35:48-0:35:50:**  Yeah, I think so.  
**0:35:50-0:35:56:**  Like I would take in my climate up here, I would take like, say a block of 10 standardized  
**0:35:56-0:36:02:**  market garden beds, which, for the sake of it, let's say they're gonna be 75 centimeters  
**0:36:02-0:36:04:**  wide with a 30 centimeter path.  
**0:36:04-0:36:08:**  That's what most market gardeners are going to be going for.  
**0:36:08-0:36:14:**  Then I would take blocks of five or 10 beds and put in tree systems happily in between  
**0:36:14-0:36:15:**  those.  
**0:36:15-0:36:22:**  So high intensity dwarfing trees are going to benefit a lot from the fertile place they  
**0:36:22-0:36:26:**  find themselves in, but they're not exactly strong rooted plants.  
**0:36:26-0:36:29:**  So they're not trying to grow out across the market garden.  
**0:36:29-0:36:34:**  I think the choice of plant is pretty important.  
**0:36:34-0:36:37:**  I mean, those dwarfing trees, you've got to work quite hard to keep them alive typically,  
**0:36:37-0:36:40:**  because they're not invested in rooting.  
**0:36:40-0:36:45:**  So I think appropriate plant choice is really important.  
**0:36:45-0:36:52:**  But yeah, in a sensible layout where you have adequate pathways at the end of blocks, then  
**0:36:52-0:36:57:**  it's posing no problem to daily operations at all.  
**0:36:57-0:36:59:**  Same with silver pastures, silver arable crops.  
**0:36:59-0:37:05:**  If you design in proper headlands and appropriate spacing, they're not influencing field operations  
**0:37:05-0:37:06:**  at all.  
**0:37:06-0:37:07:**  Great.  
**0:37:07-0:37:11:**  Yeah, because that was going to be like my other thought experiment was applying this  
**0:37:11-0:37:19:**  to someone taking one of your enterprises being poultry, they're laying hens or broilers.  
**0:37:19-0:37:23:**  It's fairly easy because you have this movement in the landscape to actually just put in alley  
**0:37:23-0:37:25:**  cropping systems.  
**0:37:25-0:37:29:**  And then either, as we said, if you're highly ambitious, go for like high value crops that  
**0:37:29-0:37:34:**  are going to need a bit more expertise or otherwise, go for a more extensive approach.  
**0:37:34-0:37:42:**  Yeah, I think if you've got, like on the extensive end, you're going to have standard trees that  
**0:37:42-0:37:48:**  don't require so much maintenance and other than the sort of formative years and your  
**0:37:48-0:37:56:**  basic pruning regimes or like, however you decide you're going to manage those down to  
**0:37:56-0:38:02:**  more intensive, smaller scale, using the same stock as modern orchards do.  
**0:38:02-0:38:09:**  I think like, you know, the overwhelming research is that tree rows in pasture or arable crops  
**0:38:09-0:38:16:**  between say eight and 26 meters is where you find those optimal interactions with pasture  
**0:38:16-0:38:18:**  or arable crop.  
**0:38:18-0:38:23:**  And on small farms, if you want to make that economic, you're going to have to start going  
**0:38:23-0:38:31:**  down to eight meter center rows with intensive animals in between to run the numbers and  
**0:38:31-0:38:35:**  see what sort of production you can eke out of that.  
**0:38:35-0:38:42:**  I mean, if I take the silver pasture systems that I've put in here, there's no pressure  
**0:38:42-0:38:50:**  on those economically that it's, they have been, they're always, poor trees, they're  
**0:38:50-0:38:53:**  always like the lowest in priority.  
**0:38:53-0:38:59:**  When you've got animals in the system, high value produce that you've also got an animal  
**0:38:59-0:39:03:**  welfare issue, you know, trees have to take the back seat as it were.  
**0:39:03-0:39:11:**  So I definitely haven't taken care of my systems in the way that you could, but I haven't had  
**0:39:11-0:39:13:**  the pressure to do that either.  
**0:39:13-0:39:16:**  So that's, that works for me.  
**0:39:16-0:39:23:**  But if I was trying to optimize the leverage to it, I think in the early years of this  
**0:39:23-0:39:29:**  farm, I was excited to keep pushing and see how far can we push this system?  
**0:39:29-0:39:33:**  How much could we produce off this little landscape?  
**0:39:33-0:39:39:**  But then you start running into like a scaling issue with employees.  
**0:39:39-0:39:43:**  You know, this farm is designed around like four full time working in the seven months  
**0:39:43-0:39:45:**  production season.  
**0:39:45-0:39:50:**  But if you start to add that tree enterprise as a functional unit economically, then you  
**0:39:50-0:39:53:**  need a whole nother employee for that.  
**0:39:53-0:39:58:**  So that's, it's got a scale in those relative terms.  
**0:39:58-0:40:04:**  So I've always designed things around multiples of three meters, because that's the width  
**0:40:04-0:40:08:**  of a boiler pen, which is a strong enterprise for me.  
**0:40:08-0:40:13:**  And so I would think in those terms, but you know, go down to even six meters.  
**0:40:13-0:40:21:**  So you're basically now stretching out a modern intensive orchard, just with wider rows for  
**0:40:21-0:40:24:**  poultry production in between.  
**0:40:24-0:40:26:**  And that can work very well.  
**0:40:26-0:40:32:**  I've seen that being used in, you know, vineyards and existing orchards, but it would probably  
**0:40:32-0:40:36:**  function even better if it was designed that way from the beginning, because you would  
**0:40:36-0:40:42:**  be able to scale the poultry who are going to be making most of the income.  
**0:40:42-0:40:45:**  And you know, we touched upon it, but I think it's important to go back to this idea of  
**0:40:45-0:40:51:**  scale, because so much of the economic viability is going to depend on scale.  
**0:40:51-0:40:57:**  And the challenge, of course, for small scale farms is how do you make, you know, tree crops  
**0:40:57-0:41:01:**  or even, you know, if it's not a crop, even if it's harvesting wood or biomass, how do  
**0:41:01-0:41:05:**  you make that economically viable when you can't benefit from economies of scale that  
**0:41:05-0:41:07:**  bigger players are going to have?  
**0:41:07-0:41:10:**  Well, I mean, there's so many layers to those things.  
**0:41:10-0:41:13:**  I mean, you can rent machinery, right?  
**0:41:13-0:41:18:**  So I've seen farms that power their entire heating and hot water systems for the entire  
**0:41:18-0:41:27:**  farm off biomass coppice rows that are harvested alternately once a year, put through a chipper  
**0:41:27-0:41:31:**  and run through like Scandinavian wood chip boilers.  
**0:41:31-0:41:36:**  It's very common here in Sweden to have a wood chip boiler that powers central heating  
**0:41:36-0:41:44:**  and people heat their huge warehouses to, you know, keep machines warm over the cold winter here.  
**0:41:44-0:41:48:**  So you don't need to go out and buy woodchippers, you can rent a wood chipper for a weekend  
**0:41:48-0:41:52:**  and ship enough fuel for the entire farm for the winter.  
**0:41:52-0:41:55:**  So you don't need to go and buy stuff necessarily.  
**0:41:55-0:42:03:**  I think that small farms viability relies on relationship marketing, where you can out  
**0:42:03-0:42:12:**  compete the industry on three points, which is freshness, localness, quality, hopefully.  
**0:42:12-0:42:18:**  So well, then you got to say, I'm definitely fresher, and I'm definitely more local, but  
**0:42:18-0:42:19:**  am I better quality?  
**0:42:19-0:42:24:**  So then you got to know what you know, and know what you don't know, because anyone can  
**0:42:24-0:42:27:**  set up a market garden and grow vegetables.  
**0:42:27-0:42:30:**  But it's like, do you know the quality the chefs need?  
**0:42:30-0:42:33:**  You know, do you know how uniform they need these things?  
**0:42:33-0:42:36:**  It's, there's different levels to all of these things.  
**0:42:36-0:42:43:**  So we can command that high price because we're selling direct to consumer.  
**0:42:43-0:42:46:**  That's like the obvious part of that.  
**0:42:46-0:42:49:**  But you still got to produce quality.  
**0:42:49-0:42:52:**  So you need to know like what you're working with.  
**0:42:52-0:42:55:**  That's the same for any enterprise and any business.  
**0:42:55-0:42:58:**  But you can command that high price.  
**0:42:58-0:43:04:**  Now, most people I've seen using tree crops are complementing other products.  
**0:43:04-0:43:10:**  And I think, you know, certainly, if it's, it's usually I would guess because people  
**0:43:10-0:43:16:**  are not working at a scale where they're now primarily a tree crop producer, which is very  
**0:43:16-0:43:22:**  hard to do on a small to medium scale because of the globalized market.  
**0:43:22-0:43:27:**  So you could just set out with using it as an ancillary crop.  
**0:43:27-0:43:34:**  It's probably more sensible because you need to cash flow everything.  
**0:43:34-0:43:41:**  And so I think I can't imagine anyone setting out a new tree planting based farm unless  
**0:43:41-0:43:47:**  it was intensive modern approach because it's not going to work economically.  
**0:43:47-0:43:52:**  But if we are selling on top of other products, then you can command that high price because  
**0:43:52-0:44:00:**  there's some artisanal quality or some value created by bringing the kids onto the farm,  
**0:44:00-0:44:02:**  like picking your own, these kind of things.  
**0:44:02-0:44:08:**  It's like you're not just selling produce, you're selling the service at the same time.  
**0:44:08-0:44:14:**  I was thinking about also economics and funding those trees in the beginning, because as we've  
**0:44:14-0:44:17:**  often mentioned, in the first few years, you've got a lot on your plate.  
**0:44:17-0:44:23:**  And also, you're already having to cash flow your enterprise that's generating your income.  
**0:44:23-0:44:27:**  And yeah, what kind of possibilities or funding models have you seen that work well for young  
**0:44:27-0:44:31:**  farmers to start out and already being able to invest in those tree plantations right  
**0:44:31-0:44:32:**  from the start?  
**0:44:32-0:44:38:**  Well, there's a whole range of, you know, like one thing is to generate the nursery  
**0:44:38-0:44:39:**  stock yourself.  
**0:44:39-0:44:47:**  Like for people that don't have many funds, you know, grafting and creating seeding beds,  
**0:44:47-0:44:51:**  that's a way to produce for very little cost.  
**0:44:51-0:44:59:**  And all the way through to funding, like I've been working with Ecosia to help fund new  
**0:44:59-0:45:04:**  farmers that want to plant trees specifically, I think they have something like 3 million  
**0:45:04-0:45:08:**  euros a year to give out to new farms.  
**0:45:08-0:45:16:**  And that whole program came about because the Ecosia folks came to one of our trainings  
**0:45:16-0:45:22:**  and they were talking one evening about Ecosia and presenting how the model works.  
**0:45:22-0:45:28:**  And it struck me that, you know, they were focused on planting trees in developing countries  
**0:45:28-0:45:32:**  where they get more trees planted per dollar.  
**0:45:32-0:45:36:**  And it's like, well, hang on a minute, like, we just run through this training and it's,  
**0:45:36-0:45:42:**  there are places for trees in landscapes, you know, is it good planting trees in prime  
**0:45:42-0:45:44:**  agricultural land on the other side of the world?  
**0:45:44-0:45:45:**  Is that useful?  
**0:45:45-0:45:51:**  It's like, is that, you know, there's a danger for people coming into that space who have  
**0:45:51-0:45:59:**  huge capital resources to invest but don't have technical or ecosystem knowledge to know  
**0:45:59-0:46:03:**  how to use that in the most beneficial way.  
**0:46:03-0:46:11:**  So I sort of convinced them to run a pilot to fund new startups, mixed farms or any type  
**0:46:11-0:46:17:**  of farm that specifically had to be planting trees as part of their model to fit the Ecosia  
**0:46:17-0:46:19:**  bill.  
**0:46:19-0:46:21:**  And so that fund has developed over time.  
**0:46:21-0:46:28:**  It's, you know, it's there for people in Europe at this time, but they have a huge amount  
**0:46:28-0:46:33:**  of capital to, they have to invest in as the social enterprise.  
**0:46:33-0:46:35:**  So but it's a low cost loan.  
**0:46:35-0:46:36:**  It's a low risk loan, let's say.  
**0:46:36-0:46:37:**  It's still a loan.  
**0:46:37-0:46:43:**  So it's, you know, you would still need to be very diligent with your planning if you're  
**0:46:43-0:46:53:**  interested in putting out tree crops, but you couldn't find a better source of capital  
**0:46:53-0:46:56:**  in that way, other than like crowdsourcing.  
**0:46:56-0:47:01:**  And, you know, I know a lot of farms have run successful campaigns on social media to  
**0:47:01-0:47:06:**  get people to invest upfront for tree planting and things like that.  
**0:47:06-0:47:11:**  But that's obviously going to require, you know, some presence and ability to put your  
**0:47:11-0:47:14:**  message out to an audience.  
**0:47:14-0:47:20:**  And our government grants are not up to date on, you know, sort of EU funding for tree  
**0:47:20-0:47:22:**  planting at the moment.  
**0:47:22-0:47:24:**  So I don't know the status of that.  
**0:47:24-0:47:28:**  To wrap up this interview, it's a bit going back to design, but I think we've touched  
**0:47:28-0:47:29:**  upon it a few times.  
**0:47:29-0:47:33:**  So I'm really curious to see your thoughts like, you know, you could see like you've  
**0:47:33-0:47:37:**  mentioned the space for trees in the landscape, which can be on like marginal areas, riparian  
**0:47:37-0:47:39:**  zones on top of hills.  
**0:47:39-0:47:43:**  Do you really see like, do we have to integrate trees within plots?  
**0:47:43-0:47:46:**  Or is that making our lives a bit too complex?  
**0:47:46-0:47:49:**  Because I'll just give you an example to make it at the moment.  
**0:47:49-0:47:53:**  I'm, you know, I'm a livestock farmer now and I'm thinking of where should I bring my  
**0:47:53-0:47:54:**  trees?  
**0:47:54-0:47:58:**  And actually, like, I don't really know because I'm, I'm kind of learning my landscape.  
**0:47:58-0:48:01:**  I'm learning also my my skill.  
**0:48:01-0:48:05:**  I'm cutting hay so I don't want to put trees in the middle of everywhere because I'm moving  
**0:48:05-0:48:06:**  around with machinery.  
**0:48:06-0:48:11:**  I don't want to make it too complicated because as soon as you have a tree you have like some  
**0:48:11-0:48:14:**  shadows coming in and that means hay is going to dry at a different speed.  
**0:48:14-0:48:17:**  Like you're you're bringing in complexity that can be a bit too much.  
**0:48:17-0:48:22:**  So at the moment, I'm just thinking, okay, I'll just focus on areas where like hedges  
**0:48:22-0:48:28:**  already and little little areas and I'm not going too ambitious on integrating it within.  
**0:48:28-0:48:32:**  And yeah, I'm just thinking of your of your thoughts because you could also argue that,  
**0:48:32-0:48:36:**  okay, well, you know, let's already put trees in all the areas where they can be beneficial  
**0:48:36-0:48:41:**  right next to without necessarily necessarily bringing them into the field.  
**0:48:41-0:48:42:**  Yeah, of course.  
**0:48:42-0:48:45:**  It doesn't have to look any particular way.  
**0:48:45-0:48:48:**  And I think people get stuck on trends.  
**0:48:48-0:48:53:**  There's certainly within this field, there's a lot of trends that fly around year to year  
**0:48:53-0:48:54:**  and get picked up.  
**0:48:54-0:49:00:**  And people need to develop rigorous analytical thought, you know, that's something to say,  
**0:49:00-0:49:02:**  but it doesn't have to look anyway.  
**0:49:02-0:49:06:**  If it doesn't fit the context, then why would you do that?  
**0:49:06-0:49:12:**  You know, and what works for me here might not work 100 kilometers south or whatever,  
**0:49:12-0:49:15:**  you know.  
**0:49:15-0:49:25:**  And on the flip side, I think we also need to put back this like, you know, that there's  
**0:49:25-0:49:33:**  a responsibility to land to managing landscapes that we need to tap back into a couple of  
**0:49:33-0:49:35:**  100 year perspective.  
**0:49:35-0:49:41:**  And that's something that's very hard to do anyway, but it's becoming, you know, we live  
**0:49:41-0:49:48:**  in a throwaway world where people, especially younger generations, don't know what longevity  
**0:49:48-0:49:49:**  means.  
**0:49:49-0:49:55:**  You know, we buy furniture that is made to last a few years or digital devices that break  
**0:49:55-0:49:56:**  down very fast.  
**0:49:56-0:50:03:**  It's, you know, it's, if you're born in the last 25 years, and you've probably never likely  
**0:50:03-0:50:09:**  been exposed to like, how things used to be, and we're losing that in society.  
**0:50:09-0:50:16:**  And that's a big problem because, you know, I'm planting a tree that lives 1000 years.  
**0:50:16-0:50:22:**  So of course, it's got to be in the right place in the landscape.  
**0:50:22-0:50:31:**  But the ecosystem services that I've witnessed through the management here is unbelievable  
**0:50:31-0:50:34:**  and undeniable.  
**0:50:34-0:50:40:**  And that's both in pastures, but also the surrounding like for me, I look at the trees  
**0:50:40-0:50:47:**  as a way to break up the landscape into smaller and smaller portions of land to maximize the  
**0:50:47-0:50:52:**  amount of photons that I'm capturing in our short growing season.  
**0:50:52-0:50:57:**  People here would typically plant things further apart because there's less light, but that's  
**0:50:57-0:50:59:**  the complete opposite way around for me.  
**0:50:59-0:51:05:**  It's like if light is a limiting factor, then catch every bit of it you can.  
**0:51:05-0:51:08:**  And I can't separate these things out.  
**0:51:08-0:51:13:**  It's like trees to me are integral part of pasture systems.  
**0:51:13-0:51:19:**  You know, our oldest forms of grazing systems around Europe were trees over pastures, more  
**0:51:19-0:51:23:**  like woodland grazing.  
**0:51:23-0:51:31:**  And those benefits are powerful and palpable when you see an ecosystem start humming with  
**0:51:31-0:51:32:**  life.  
**0:51:32-0:51:33:**  It's, it's something else.  
**0:51:33-0:51:39:**  It's there's a level of resilience going on that I can't put it down to trees, but trees  
**0:51:39-0:51:42:**  are integral to it.  
**0:51:42-0:51:47:**  We don't suffer the typical wet spots that people have in their pastures here.  
**0:51:47-0:51:50:**  We have zero mosses and sedges here.  
**0:51:50-0:51:52:**  We don't suffer drought.  
**0:51:52-0:51:57:**  We went through the 2018 drought with zero loss of production when people were selling  
**0:51:57-0:52:00:**  off half their herds in June.  
**0:52:00-0:52:05:**  And now that's from the soil building we've done through intensive animal management with  
**0:52:05-0:52:08:**  holistic plant grazing using key lime, flower, et cetera.  
**0:52:08-0:52:14:**  But it's also partly to do with effective wind breaking and intensive tree plantings  
**0:52:14-0:52:17:**  with their nutrient cycling and water cycling, et cetera.  
**0:52:17-0:52:20:**  It's like it's all part of the same piece.  
**0:52:20-0:52:23:**  So for me in the context, I've put them into the landscape here.  
**0:52:23-0:52:26:**  I can't separate those.  
**0:52:26-0:52:28:**  They're part of an integral whole.  
**0:52:28-0:52:34:**  And this ecosystem started humming a couple of years ago where there is three pairs of  
**0:52:34-0:52:36:**  nesting raptors on the farm.  
**0:52:36-0:52:42:**  This is a 13 hectare farm and there's three apex predators moved into that little space  
**0:52:42-0:52:45:**  because it's a haven of activity.  
**0:52:45-0:52:51:**  And there's a balance going on in the ecosystem that's something to behold.  
**0:52:51-0:52:55:**  And that's the sort of thing that I wanted to create.  
**0:52:55-0:53:01:**  And that's the sort of ecosystem I want to hand down as a land steward.  
**0:53:01-0:53:08:**  So I think we're teetering on a double edged sword there because the desire to simplify  
**0:53:08-0:53:15:**  and mechanize, make them more efficient leads one direction and it's not regenerative.  
**0:53:15-0:53:17:**  Is it even sustainable?  
**0:53:17-0:53:20:**  I don't know.  
**0:53:20-0:53:24:**  But don't have to stick trees in your pasture.  
**0:53:24-0:53:26:**  You don't have to do anything.  
**0:53:26-0:53:31:**  You need to start from the basis of planning where you want to end up.  
**0:53:31-0:53:37:**  And planning where you want to end up, of course it needs to work economically primarily.  
**0:53:37-0:53:42:**  And it's got to work for the benefit of your customers in terms of nutrient density.  
**0:53:42-0:53:48:**  And I think that is a whole field that's going to become forefront in terms of customer choices,  
**0:53:48-0:53:51:**  et cetera, in the coming years.  
**0:53:51-0:53:59:**  But it's got to work from ecosystem process perspectives too.  
**0:53:59-0:54:04:**  There's a lot of broken farmland with broken nutrient cycles and water cycles and trees  
**0:54:04-0:54:07:**  are an integral part of fixing that.  
**0:54:07-0:54:08:**  We know flooding is going to increase.  
**0:54:08-0:54:14:**  We know droughts are going to increase in most parts of Europe and elsewhere.  
**0:54:14-0:54:17:**  And trees are a very important part of mitigating that.  
**0:54:17-0:54:25:**  So I think rather than simplifying landscapes by taking these things out is, hey, simplify  
**0:54:25-0:54:29:**  your ideas and put easy to manage systems in the right place.  
**0:54:29-0:54:37:**  There's no reason not to put certain types of trees into any field cropping situation  
**0:54:37-0:54:41:**  without affecting yields of other crops.  
**0:54:41-0:54:44:**  In fact, it's going to benefit other crops.  
**0:54:44-0:54:47:**  And there's a lot of research to back that up.  
**0:54:47-0:54:52:**  So of course, it's got to be designed for your specific context.  
**0:54:52-0:54:54:**  And it's good.  
**0:54:54-0:54:59:**  You obviously know and have exposed yourself to enough to be able to clarify what your  
**0:54:59-0:55:03:**  specific context is with the operations you've got in mind.  
**0:55:03-0:55:05:**  But that's what everyone's got to do.  
**0:55:05-0:55:06:**  There's no magic bullet.  
**0:55:06-0:55:07:**  There's no...  
**0:55:07-0:55:17:**  I was very cautious writing my book to put formulaic recipes to things because they don't  
**0:55:17-0:55:19:**  exist.  
**0:55:19-0:55:26:**  But I did it very carefully in a way that I also know people need some kind of standardization  
**0:55:26-0:55:31:**  to work with because that's how our brains are conditioned to thinking.  
**0:55:31-0:55:34:**  But of course, there's no standardized solutions in farming.  
**0:55:34-0:55:40:**  It doesn't work like that, but I would always still advocate for tree systems.  
**0:55:40-0:55:50:**  But I think the key insight here is to really plan down to detail what the time and skill  
**0:55:50-0:55:56:**  levels involved are and what the economic inputs and outputs are going to be.  
**0:55:56-0:56:03:**  And there's a lot to be said for the non-edible crops like biomass and timber.  
**0:56:03-0:56:08:**  We've seen the price increases of these materials massively this year.  
**0:56:08-0:56:10:**  That's not going to decrease.  
**0:56:10-0:56:16:**  We've got major problems here up in Scandinavia, which is a major producer of building lumber,  
**0:56:16-0:56:22:**  where we've got the bark beetles and we've started having forest fires where we didn't  
**0:56:22-0:56:26:**  even have enough Swedish knowledge of how to fight forest fires.  
**0:56:26-0:56:30:**  So they flew Canadians in to fight the forest fires.  
**0:56:30-0:56:34:**  These problems are just going to be exacerbated in years to come.  
**0:56:34-0:56:36:**  So timber prices are going to continue to increase.  
**0:56:36-0:56:43:**  So a lot of the plantings on my farm, I've got avenue plantings along the roads that  
**0:56:43-0:56:48:**  could not really be used for anything else, but they're usually places that exist on every  
**0:56:48-0:56:52:**  farm all over the world.  
**0:56:52-0:56:56:**  They're not economic from my perspective, but they're definitely going to be economic  
**0:56:56-0:57:01:**  from my kids or grandkids perspective, because there's going to be a couple of hundred oak,  
**0:57:01-0:57:08:**  straight pruned oak logs that can build a house that will last another 500 years.  
**0:57:08-0:57:12:**  So same goes with biomass for heating, et cetera.  
**0:57:12-0:57:17:**  Heating bills, people are, Germany might not have any gas this winter.  
**0:57:17-0:57:20:**  So what are you going to do then?  
**0:57:20-0:57:26:**  That energy cost is like, who knows where those prices are going, but it doesn't look  
**0:57:26-0:57:27:**  good.  
**0:57:27-0:57:34:**  And if you can be producing on farm in a closed cycle, your energy needs like that.  
**0:57:34-0:57:37:**  I mean, that's vastly economic.  
**0:57:37-0:57:40:**  It's just hard to put those things into numbers.  
**0:57:40-0:57:45:**  I think one thing I've noticed working with people coming into farming is people are very  
**0:57:45-0:57:49:**  bad at valuing their own time.  
**0:57:49-0:57:59:**  And they're often not accustomed to valuing things outside of the financial realm.  
**0:57:59-0:58:01:**  Natural capital is like, how do you put a price on that?  
**0:58:01-0:58:08:**  It's difficult, but I'm very happy swapping financial capital for natural capital.  
**0:58:08-0:58:13:**  We're building reserves that see us through problems that give us resilience.  
**0:58:13-0:58:20:**  When I saw the drought, that cemented something in my brain that's unshakable.  
**0:58:20-0:58:25:**  I can remember I put up videos on YouTube, aerial footage of all the farms around us,  
**0:58:25-0:58:29:**  yellow, the grasses have stunted out at knee height.  
**0:58:29-0:58:34:**  And we've got grasses, same species up to my face in full photosynthesis.  
**0:58:34-0:58:40:**  Soil moisture is still present because there's a deep thick layer of trample grasses in between  
**0:58:40-0:58:41:**  these tight tree rows.  
**0:58:41-0:58:44:**  Wind isn't taking moisture away, sunlight's not hitting the ground.  
**0:58:44-0:58:47:**  There's still soil activity.  
**0:58:47-0:58:51:**  At a time when I walk 20 meters through my windbreak to the neighbor's field and it's  
**0:58:51-0:58:55:**  cracked clay with very sparse grasses, no life at all.  
**0:58:55-0:58:58:**  So it's like, well, what value do you put on that?  
**0:58:58-0:59:02:**  It's like in that drought year that's going to come more and more regularly, I can produce  
**0:59:02-0:59:05:**  a full production across the farm.  
**0:59:05-0:59:10:**  So time's up by 10 years and you've got millions of euros.  
**0:59:10-0:59:18:**  It's got to be put into, I've always been sharing the work of Ethan Rowland and Gregory  
**0:59:18-0:59:20:**  Landa, the eight forms of capital.  
**0:59:20-0:59:25:**  I think that's a great piece for people to really reflect on in their little short book,  
**0:59:25-0:59:27:**  Regenerative Enterprises.  
**0:59:27-0:59:33:**  We need to have a way of relating to these different forms of capital because it's not  
**0:59:33-0:59:35:**  just about straight numbers.  
**0:59:35-0:59:40:**  Of course, those economic numbers are vital, but there's much better enterprises to cashflow  
**0:59:40-0:59:43:**  farms than trees.  
**0:59:43-0:59:46:**  That's just a period, there's no debate about that.  
**0:59:46-0:59:55:**  So I think it circles all the way back to integration and to run a farm landscape is  
**0:59:55-0:59:58:**  a diversified landscape.  
**0:59:58-1:00:03:**  And it doesn't mean everyone has to do a bit of everything, but we can be doing more than  
**1:00:03-1:00:04:**  one thing on a field.  
**1:00:04-1:00:07:**  There's no progression in that kind of model.  
**1:00:07-1:00:12:**  Just to conclude, could you tell us where our listeners can find your resources, your  
**1:00:12-1:00:16:**  books, anything you produce and get out there?  
**1:00:16-1:00:22:**  Yeah, easiest way is one of my websites, richardperkins.co.  
**1:00:22-1:00:28:**  And from there you can find links to my books, Regenerative Agriculture, which is a whole  
**1:00:28-1:00:35:**  systems manual of how we set up and run this farm, the economies and putting together a  
**1:00:35-1:00:40:**  sort of comparative analysis of all these different farm enterprises to give people  
**1:00:40-1:00:48:**  a strategic way to plan and design their enterprise and scale it to make it work for their needs.  
**1:00:48-1:00:53:**  And as Richdale Farm builds, it's kind of like an Ikea manual for people that want to  
**1:00:53-1:00:58:**  know how to build an eggmobile or a boiler pen, it's cut this and dimension so that people  
**1:00:58-1:01:01:**  can just take that and run with that.  
**1:01:01-1:01:06:**  And we have various different things, YouTube, etc, that people can find from there as well.  
**1:01:06-1:01:07:**  Cool.  
**1:01:07-1:01:08:**  Great.  
**1:01:08-1:01:09:**  Thank you so much, Rich.  
**1:01:09-1:01:10:**  Yeah, no worries.  
**1:01:10-1:01:24:**  Thanks for having me, I'll spend time with you.

### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 17:53:36)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:46:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:46-0:00:49:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:49-0:00:55:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today I interviewed Garrett Miller from the Good Life Farm.  
**0:00:55-0:01:00:**  As you probably worked out by now, one of our favourite topics on the podcast is diversity  
**0:01:00-0:01:05:**  and how we can integrate it on our farms in an economically viable way.  
**0:01:05-0:01:09:**  It so happens that Garrett has been doing this to an extraordinary degree for the past  
**0:01:09-0:01:11:**  ten years.  
**0:01:11-0:01:15:**  His business goes beyond what we think of as a farm, producing too much diversity for  
**0:01:15-0:01:21:**  me to really get my hand around with a crew of 12 people year round.  
**0:01:21-0:01:27:**  We had a fantastic conversation on how he runs his diverse business and we then focused  
**0:01:27-0:01:31:**  on how and why he is integrating turkeys in his orchard.  
**0:01:31-0:01:36:**  For us agroforestry isn't just about planting timber trees in agricultural settings, but  
**0:01:36-0:01:41:**  also how we can integrate different elements in a way that improves the quantity and quality  
**0:01:41-0:01:43:**  of overall production.  
**0:01:43-0:01:46:**  Garrett has been doing a great job on his farm and I hope you enjoy this episode as  
**0:01:46-0:01:49:**  much as I did.  
**0:01:49-0:01:52:**  Okay Garrett, welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:52-0:01:55:**  Yeah thanks for having me.  
**0:01:55-0:02:03:**  Cool, so it would be really great to start with a description of yourself, how you got  
**0:02:03-0:02:10:**  started in agriculture and how you started the Good Life Farm.  
**0:02:10-0:02:15:**  Yeah I'll do my best to remember here.  
**0:02:15-0:02:21:**  It feels like it's been a lifetime ago and also really, really brief.  
**0:02:21-0:02:28:**  We started this business probably almost 13 years ago now, maybe 12 years ago.  
**0:02:28-0:02:36:**  And we're in New York State, here in the central part of the state in the Finger Lakes region.  
**0:02:36-0:02:45:**  So it's an area I grew up in and then moved back to as a young adult and it kind of chose  
**0:02:45-0:02:50:**  this as a place that I really wanted to get set up in life for a bunch of different reasons.  
**0:02:50-0:02:53:**  But I identified this as the place to get started.  
**0:02:53-0:02:56:**  So I got started relatively young with the business here.  
**0:02:56-0:03:03:**  I was 22 at the time and didn't have nearly enough experience or background to be doing  
**0:03:03-0:03:12:**  what we wanted to take on but that had the energy and attitude so I went for it and have  
**0:03:12-0:03:15:**  kind of paid for our education along the way.  
**0:03:15-0:03:21:**  But definitely started out as a really relatively inexperienced farmer and land manager and  
**0:03:21-0:03:30:**  have kind of gone the road of paying for our own education and learning things the hard  
**0:03:30-0:03:32:**  way often.  
**0:03:32-0:03:39:**  Got started the business with my partner at the time, life partner, business partner,  
**0:03:39-0:03:44:**  got married along the way, got divorced along the way and still running the business now  
**0:03:44-0:03:49:**  as a solo entrepreneur but our team has grown dramatically.  
**0:03:49-0:03:55:**  So kind of the trajectory has been two people starting a farm from scratch here in the Finger  
**0:03:55-0:04:02:**  Lakes on a piece of vacant land, a land with no buildings, no water, no infrastructure,  
**0:04:02-0:04:09:**  no plants, really no soil life, no biodiversity, kind of an intensively managed cornfield for  
**0:04:09-0:04:17:**  the last 50 years and setting up to try to make a go of a diversified small farm, a sort  
**0:04:17-0:04:22:**  of a thriving ecosystem, something that would leave the land a little better than we found  
**0:04:22-0:04:23:**  it.  
**0:04:23-0:04:33:**  So have just been on a 12 year journey trying to learn how to make that possible and we  
**0:04:33-0:04:38:**  can get into all the details later I guess but have grown a wide array of crops, annuals  
**0:04:38-0:04:43:**  and animals and planted perennials along the way, primarily fruit trees.  
**0:04:43-0:04:50:**  About halfway through that trajectory we started a second business that's a farm winery, so  
**0:04:50-0:04:57:**  it's called the Finger Lakes Cider House and it's our customer facing agritourism value  
**0:04:57-0:05:06:**  added business that makes a whole lot of products and primarily ciders and now wines and interfaces  
**0:05:06-0:05:13:**  with customers about the farm and since that point the business has grown pretty dramatically  
**0:05:13-0:05:15:**  and has involved a lot more people now.  
**0:05:15-0:05:20:**  It used to be two people doing it kind of part time figuring out how to make ends meet  
**0:05:20-0:05:27:**  and now there's probably 12 people full time on staff and seasonally double that and we  
**0:05:27-0:05:33:**  kind of are just figuring out where we can take this thing as far as connecting people  
**0:05:33-0:05:40:**  to agriculture and producing interesting products from a land that hopefully is getting healthier  
**0:05:40-0:05:43:**  every year than the year before.  
**0:05:43-0:05:46:**  Okay, nice.  
**0:05:46-0:05:51:**  And how did you, like when you were 22, how did you decide to get into agriculture?  
**0:05:51-0:05:54:**  What was the inspiration for you?  
**0:05:54-0:05:59:**  Yeah, I have a kind of a weird educational background.  
**0:05:59-0:06:04:**  I guess I dropped out of high school as a pretty young person just finding it not to  
**0:06:04-0:06:05:**  be a good fit for me.  
**0:06:05-0:06:10:**  I was interested in other things that weren't schooling related, primarily like the trades  
**0:06:10-0:06:15:**  I was interested in carpentry and building and in agriculture and public schools weren't  
**0:06:15-0:06:17:**  the best place to be learning that.  
**0:06:17-0:06:24:**  So I tried a bunch of different self education things and other school options for a couple  
**0:06:24-0:06:31:**  of years and then found some awesome mentors that inspired me to get into agriculture.  
**0:06:31-0:06:38:**  One of those was Mark Shepherd in Wisconsin, New Forest Farm, a place where we went and  
**0:06:38-0:06:48:**  lived and sort of apprenticed is a loose word, but was mentored by Mark in broad acre agroforestry  
**0:06:48-0:06:53:**  and kind of permaculture type principles and was very much inspired by work he was doing.  
**0:06:53-0:06:58:**  That was something we did just before launching the project here.  
**0:06:58-0:07:03:**  And I had also done an apprenticeship at a very unusual place in North Carolina called  
**0:07:03-0:07:07:**  Turtle Island that was also probably a formative and inspiring thing that helped me feel confident  
**0:07:07-0:07:13:**  to take on building a land based project from scratch.  
**0:07:13-0:07:18:**  It was sort of a wilderness apprenticeship thing for a year or so with a crazy outfit  
**0:07:18-0:07:21:**  down in North Carolina.  
**0:07:21-0:07:22:**  Okay.  
**0:07:22-0:07:23:**  Yeah.  
**0:07:23-0:07:30:**  So eclectic background, but a few good mentors and a lot of good mentors since then.  
**0:07:30-0:07:36:**  Since we started with this kind of big idea and ambition, we ended up finding ourselves  
**0:07:36-0:07:41:**  in a really good community of people who were very generous with information and willing  
**0:07:41-0:07:42:**  to help us get started.  
**0:07:42-0:07:44:**  So we've had lots of mentors since then.  
**0:07:44-0:07:49:**  So it's been like a bit of a blessing to find ourselves where we are.  
**0:07:49-0:07:51:**  Yeah, that's amazing.  
**0:07:51-0:07:57:**  I mean, I can't help to feel impressed that starting a business like the one you set up  
**0:07:57-0:08:06:**  at 22 from scratch, starting with a white piece of paper and building everything that  
**0:08:06-0:08:07:**  you've built.  
**0:08:07-0:08:12:**  I mean, I invite all of our listeners to go check out your website and Instagram and just  
**0:08:12-0:08:18:**  to see what seems to be a thriving system with so much going on.  
**0:08:18-0:08:19:**  Yeah.  
**0:08:19-0:08:21:**  Yeah, I appreciate that.  
**0:08:21-0:08:28:**  It definitely could have been a lot easier, a lot less expensive and yeah.  
**0:08:28-0:08:34:**  But yeah, totally a lot of luck along the way too for the location in particular has  
**0:08:34-0:08:37:**  helped us out more than we could have imagined.  
**0:08:37-0:08:42:**  The physical side, the community, all that has helped us get started.  
**0:08:42-0:08:46:**  And at the beginning, certainly didn't realize what we were starting or what we were trying  
**0:08:46-0:08:47:**  to do.  
**0:08:47-0:08:49:**  And so probably at this moment still don't really understand.  
**0:08:49-0:08:54:**  We have a little bit better of an idea, but the trajectory has changed and I'm open to  
**0:08:54-0:08:59:**  like 10 years from now being in a place we never expected.  
**0:08:59-0:09:03:**  That's kind of where we find ourselves today is a place we hadn't expected.  
**0:09:03-0:09:08:**  But the underpinning principles are the same about land management.  
**0:09:08-0:09:10:**  Okay.  
**0:09:10-0:09:17:**  We like to give our audience a bit of a context of the physical context that you're in.  
**0:09:17-0:09:21:**  Could you tell us a bit about the acreage that you're farming on?  
**0:09:21-0:09:22:**  What's the soil like?  
**0:09:22-0:09:24:**  The rainfall, the slope?  
**0:09:24-0:09:25:**  Sure.  
**0:09:25-0:09:26:**  Yeah.  
**0:09:26-0:09:27:**  Yeah.  
**0:09:27-0:09:31:**  I'm sitting in my office right now looking out the window.  
**0:09:31-0:09:34:**  At the time of this recording, I guess it is the very beginning of March.  
**0:09:34-0:09:42:**  So the ground is still covered in snow or I have 43 degrees latitude here and it's generally  
**0:09:42-0:09:49:**  have long wet winters where near this beautiful geological phenomenon called the finger lakes,  
**0:09:49-0:09:53:**  which are these super deep glacial lakes that are in the center of New York state, kind  
**0:09:53-0:09:55:**  of near the great lakes.  
**0:09:55-0:09:56:**  So we're near a ton of fresh water.  
**0:09:56-0:10:02:**  I think it's like 7% of the world's fresh water is in our sort of bio region of the  
**0:10:02-0:10:03:**  great lakes here.  
**0:10:03-0:10:05:**  And the finger lakes are a big part of that.  
**0:10:05-0:10:08:**  So we're near a ton of fresh water.  
**0:10:08-0:10:16:**  So the landscape is pretty abundant with water and we're on a beautiful east facing slope.  
**0:10:16-0:10:20:**  It's probably about mostly 8% slope down to Cayuga Lake.  
**0:10:20-0:10:21:**  We're probably about a mile.  
**0:10:21-0:10:26:**  I'm sorry if I have this upstate New York accent, but that yeah, Cayuga Lake is the  
**0:10:26-0:10:32:**  lake that we're near and it's really good agricultural soil in this region in general.  
**0:10:32-0:10:38:**  The finger lakes you'll see from aerial maps that a lot of southern New York is forested.  
**0:10:38-0:10:42:**  When you start to get to these areas, a satellite map unfortunately ends up usually looking  
**0:10:42-0:10:46:**  like a desert because there's a lot of huge cropping happening in this area, but it's  
**0:10:46-0:10:50:**  good soil and so farming is still thriving and alive.  
**0:10:50-0:10:56:**  So we moved to this area because land was both affordable at that time becoming a little  
**0:10:56-0:11:00:**  bit less so now, but definitely affordable and it was very high quality land for lots  
**0:11:00-0:11:02:**  of different farming enterprises.  
**0:11:02-0:11:08:**  So it's largely a corn and soy and wheat growing area, but also there's New York's  
**0:11:08-0:11:11:**  biggest grape industry activities happen up here.  
**0:11:11-0:11:15:**  So there's a wine region that we're part of.  
**0:11:15-0:11:17:**  So these sites are very good for wine grape growing.  
**0:11:17-0:11:24:**  Little temperature buffers, high quality soils, good mineral subsoil base and decent water  
**0:11:24-0:11:26:**  resources.  
**0:11:26-0:11:34:**  We have typically a wet spring and a dry couple months in the summer and then moisture returning  
**0:11:34-0:11:40:**  as the fall rolls around and usually good ripening for fruit crops, tree fruit and grapes  
**0:11:40-0:11:41:**  and all sorts of stuff.  
**0:11:41-0:11:46:**  So pretty abundant growing zone.  
**0:11:46-0:11:50:**  Not as great as some other parts of America, but it's up there.  
**0:11:50-0:11:54:**  Better than many parts of the world, that's for sure.  
**0:11:54-0:11:57:**  Based on your description, so it seems like there's a lot of potential.  
**0:11:57-0:12:01:**  Yeah, and definitely some of the sites are getting degraded here because they're hillside  
**0:12:01-0:12:06:**  sites and erosion just like everywhere in the world is a huge problem.  
**0:12:06-0:12:11:**  This site has been heavily eroded over probably the last hundred years and there's a lot  
**0:12:11-0:12:17:**  less soil on this site than there recently was and it's mostly in the lake, which is  
**0:12:17-0:12:20:**  unfortunate because it's not coming back.  
**0:12:20-0:12:24:**  But that's one of the bigger hurdles with these sites is the soil is getting degraded  
**0:12:24-0:12:30:**  more rapidly.  
**0:12:30-0:12:37:**  Just as we had talked about in our previous call, it would be great for you to tell us  
**0:12:37-0:12:40:**  everything that you produce on the farm.  
**0:12:40-0:12:47:**  Also in terms of your activities, but especially looking at the agricultural produce.  
**0:12:47-0:12:50:**  There was even more than what you had mentioned when I looked at your Instagram, so it's  
**0:12:50-0:12:51:**  kind of surprising.  
**0:12:51-0:12:56:**  I'd love for our listeners also to have an idea of what are you producing there.  
**0:12:56-0:13:02:**  Yeah, it's ebbed and flowed over time.  
**0:13:02-0:13:08:**  Currently it's a mix of annuals, perennials, and a little bit of livestock.  
**0:13:08-0:13:14:**  We've dialed back on the livestock a little bit for complexity reasons recently.  
**0:13:14-0:13:18:**  In chronological seasonal order, I guess it's an easy way to think about it.  
**0:13:18-0:13:24:**  We'll start harvesting asparagus soon in usually the end of April, sort of the first crop that's  
**0:13:24-0:13:27:**  coming off the farm.  
**0:13:27-0:13:31:**  So we've had a 12 year old asparagus planting.  
**0:13:31-0:13:35:**  We now have a Yup'ik strawberry planting that's thriving and healthy.  
**0:13:35-0:13:38:**  I should mention, I guess our farm is certified organic, so a lot of our management practices  
**0:13:38-0:13:44:**  around the fruit in particular are very focused around that concept of being certified or  
**0:13:44-0:13:47:**  organic.  
**0:13:47-0:13:49:**  So we have a good strawberry crop.  
**0:13:49-0:13:56:**  We have a growing seed garlic planting, so an annual crop that we harvest for scapes  
**0:13:56-0:14:03:**  and bulbs that go to seed stock for other producers in the Northeast primarily.  
**0:14:03-0:14:09:**  And I'm sure I'm already forgetting stuff, but we grow peaches and Asian pears and a  
**0:14:09-0:14:13:**  diversity of apples, both for fresh eating and specifically for cider making.  
**0:14:13-0:14:17:**  In the fall, we'll also harvest a ginger crop that we grow.  
**0:14:17-0:14:23:**  We've been maybe growing ginger for eight or nine years in our high tunnels where we  
**0:14:23-0:14:29:**  also produce specialty salad green mixes in the spring and in the winter, kind of the  
**0:14:29-0:14:34:**  no heat, hearty greens concept.  
**0:14:34-0:14:42:**  So I guess also in there is raising turkeys primarily for Thanksgiving, but also for value  
**0:14:42-0:14:47:**  added processing is sort of the main animal activity on the farm at the moment.  
**0:14:47-0:14:54:**  We've raised chickens and had beef, herd of beef cows in the past and farmed with draft  
**0:14:54-0:15:00:**  horses for the better part of a decade and have dialed that back recently.  
**0:15:00-0:15:06:**  There'll be a few more animal activities coming in the coming year, but this season looks  
**0:15:06-0:15:12:**  like probably just we'll stick with our turkey system to have that be that energy fertility  
**0:15:12-0:15:13:**  driver.  
**0:15:13-0:15:14:**  Okay, nice.  
**0:15:14-0:15:19:**  So that's a quick rundown and then there's a ton happening on the cider house side with  
**0:15:19-0:15:23:**  products, value added products, but that's a whole other bag.  
**0:15:23-0:15:24:**  Yeah.  
**0:15:24-0:15:27:**  Well actually it would be great to know what are these value added products?  
**0:15:27-0:15:29:**  You mentioned cider, right?  
**0:15:29-0:15:34:**  What else are you, just a quick overview, what else are you transforming there?  
**0:15:34-0:15:41:**  Yeah, so we, we'd probably make 30 different labels of cider of different types of alcoholic  
**0:15:41-0:15:42:**  cider.  
**0:15:42-0:15:46:**  Um, kind of made like make like one would make sparkling wine.  
**0:15:46-0:15:52:**  We now also make a few different types of sparkling wine made from grapes grown from  
**0:15:52-0:15:53:**  our neighbors farms here.  
**0:15:53-0:15:57:**  There's a lot of vinafore grapes growing nearby, so we're working with those.  
**0:15:57-0:16:01:**  We turn our cider into vinegar and vinegar based products.  
**0:16:01-0:16:07:**  So that would be like, um, things like shrubs we make these that are cocktail mixer, uh,  
**0:16:07-0:16:09:**  fruit infused vinegar type products.  
**0:16:09-0:16:14:**  And we have a lot of different cider vinegar products and we have some sparkling nonalcoholic  
**0:16:14-0:16:18:**  beverages that we make both out of vinegar and out of ginger.  
**0:16:18-0:16:24:**  So we make some sort of fresh, uh, ginger style sodas for people who don't drink alcohol.  
**0:16:24-0:16:33:**  Um, and we do some other sort of fruit preserves and things like that, canned products, jams  
**0:16:33-0:16:39:**  and sauces and things like that as well as sourcing a tremendous amount.  
**0:16:39-0:16:44:**  We probably, I don't know, we spend, we probably spend $100,000 this last year purchasing in  
**0:16:44-0:16:50:**  products from other farms to turn into food, uh, ready to eat meals.  
**0:16:50-0:16:52:**  Like we have a small cafe on the farm.  
**0:16:52-0:16:57:**  Uh, people will come and eat lunch here and do a little dinner events and things like  
**0:16:57-0:16:58:**  that.  
**0:16:58-0:17:02:**  So we're sourcing food from our farm and primarily from the neighboring farms to supply all those  
**0:17:02-0:17:03:**  needs.  
**0:17:03-0:17:08:**  That's overwhelming the amount of diversity you're having to deal with.  
**0:17:08-0:17:12:**  And this is something that, you know, obviously we're going to, we're going to get into is  
**0:17:12-0:17:21:**  managing that complexity, but let's just hold up a bit now because, uh, you know, um, I  
**0:17:21-0:17:26:**  mean, it seems to be to this kind of diversity of production seems to can just imagine an  
**0:17:26-0:17:30:**  amazing, very beautiful and diverse farm.  
**0:17:30-0:17:34:**  And, and this is something that, you know, in agroecology, there's a lot of talk about  
**0:17:34-0:17:40:**  it, you know, diversifying our farms and, you know, creating, um, um, small and diverse  
**0:17:40-0:17:41:**  systems.  
**0:17:41-0:17:45:**  Um, and so, or big and diverse systems, but diversity is becoming more something that  
**0:17:45-0:17:46:**  we hear more and more about.  
**0:17:46-0:17:51:**  But of course, this, this comes with a challenge, which is selling it, right.  
**0:17:51-0:17:56:**  That one of the pillars of the farm is to be able to, to sell and distribute, uh, and,  
**0:17:56-0:17:57:**  and create value from this diversity.  
**0:17:57-0:18:02:**  And that's often one of the big challenges that we hear about with farmers that are,  
**0:18:02-0:18:03:**  that are diversifying.  
**0:18:03-0:18:06:**  And one of the things that we're concerned about with, you know, on the podcast with  
**0:18:06-0:18:11:**  agroforestry, because agroforestry often means bringing in more complexity and diversity  
**0:18:11-0:18:14:**  into a farm system with the tree layer, for example.  
**0:18:14-0:18:19:**  But you know, stepping away from the agroforestry now specifically, um, and looking more at  
**0:18:19-0:18:23:**  the diversity of products that you have to manage and to sell, I'm really curious about  
**0:18:23-0:18:28:**  how you, how you manage to do that, you know, has this diversity come in like little by  
**0:18:28-0:18:32:**  little through the years, or did you start with a huge diversity from the, from the get-go?  
**0:18:32-0:18:39:**  Um, it definitely didn't start all, you know, all, all, all at once like that has incrementally  
**0:18:39-0:18:42:**  increased over time.  
**0:18:42-0:18:48:**  And we, I think my personality lends towards like, uh, complexity a little bit.  
**0:18:48-0:18:54:**  Like I am interested in a lot of different, uh, things that can be produced from food  
**0:18:54-0:18:56:**  products, from soil, from land.  
**0:18:56-0:19:01:**  And so probably tend toward over complexity oftentimes and have to get dialed back by  
**0:19:01-0:19:03:**  the team that surrounds me.  
**0:19:03-0:19:08:**  I have some awesome people around me who are, uh, very balancing outlooks and help me dial  
**0:19:08-0:19:12:**  back in some of that complexity because it can be a big, uh, it can sometimes be a burden  
**0:19:12-0:19:14:**  or a risk.  
**0:19:14-0:19:19:**  So we have added over time and haven't been afraid to subtract things here and there.  
**0:19:19-0:19:24:**  Um, we currently don't raise beef cattle or farm with draft horses and we certainly have  
**0:19:24-0:19:28:**  made products that maybe were a little bit of a flop and we've dialed them back.  
**0:19:28-0:19:35:**  Um, almost all of our marketing, I would say 90% of our income, maybe 80% is direct to  
**0:19:35-0:19:36:**  consumer.  
**0:19:36-0:19:44:**  So, and so that has allowed us to really market complexity because consumers are, seem like  
**0:19:44-0:19:46:**  they're often really embracing that story.  
**0:19:46-0:19:51:**  They want something that has a lot of, um, nuance and depth and things that they can  
**0:19:51-0:19:55:**  come back to and revisit and find out more things and feel connected to a space that  
**0:19:55-0:19:58:**  is providing for a number of their needs.  
**0:19:58-0:20:04:**  So that has really helped the direct to marketing.  
**0:20:04-0:20:08:**  And I think we've sort of been very fortunate in finding ourselves in a location that allows  
**0:20:08-0:20:12:**  for direct marketing off our premise.  
**0:20:12-0:20:18:**  So people come to our site, we're open 360 days a year and see tens of thousands of people  
**0:20:18-0:20:19:**  now coming.  
**0:20:19-0:20:23:**  I'm watching a car drive down the driveway right now as we're talking that someone who's  
**0:20:23-0:20:28:**  coming to visit the cider house and do, I don't know, a drink cider, have lunch maybe.  
**0:20:28-0:20:31:**  Um, and maybe leave with some produce as well, right?  
**0:20:31-0:20:32:**  Yes.  
**0:20:32-0:20:33:**  Yeah.  
**0:20:33-0:20:35:**  Um, frozen food items at this point.  
**0:20:35-0:20:38:**  Soon we'll have our spring salad mixes again.  
**0:20:38-0:20:39:**  Okay.  
**0:20:39-0:20:42:**  And we're certainly processing local foods all the time.  
**0:20:42-0:20:50:**  So the on premise visitation place, a sense of place that like people can come and feel  
**0:20:50-0:20:55:**  like it's one of their places that they can go to has been a huge ability to sell the  
**0:20:55-0:20:56:**  diversity.  
**0:20:56-0:21:03:**  So, um, at this point we're looking for what kind of diversity makes sense for this physical  
**0:21:03-0:21:07:**  site and what's, what's putting too much pressure on the system and what's just like a really  
**0:21:07-0:21:09:**  solid fit for the ecosystem.  
**0:21:09-0:21:10:**  Okay.  
**0:21:10-0:21:14:**  Delving a bit more into the, into the, your sales approach.  
**0:21:14-0:21:18:**  Cause you know, that's the key to, as you described that, that direct selling is the  
**0:21:18-0:21:20:**  key to being able to distribute diversity.  
**0:21:20-0:21:29:**  Um, but do you have a, um, a shop on the farm and is that where you sell most of your products?  
**0:21:29-0:21:34:**  Also do you also go out to markets and go sell produce to local shops?  
**0:21:34-0:21:37:**  Um, you know, what, what, if we could give some proportions.  
**0:21:37-0:21:46:**  Yeah, I would say 80% of our products are sold or income, um, is, is coming from on  
**0:21:46-0:21:47:**  farm sales.  
**0:21:47-0:21:48:**  Okay.  
**0:21:48-0:21:55:**  And the other percentage is, is to either online where we're shipping product or to  
**0:21:55-0:22:01:**  local accounts within probably 20 miles of here, maybe 30 miles of here where we will  
**0:22:01-0:22:03:**  deliver product to.  
**0:22:03-0:22:13:**  Um, and it varies product type, um, how we distribute it, but primarily, um, primarily  
**0:22:13-0:22:15:**  off site here we are onsite.  
**0:22:15-0:22:17:**  Here's where we sell.  
**0:22:17-0:22:18:**  Um, yeah.  
**0:22:18-0:22:23:**  Trying to think how to, how to break it down a little bit.  
**0:22:23-0:22:31:**  Um, the more I'm a pretty introverted person and like to like to stay here and be here  
**0:22:31-0:22:36:**  on this, on the farm and I'm happy on days when I don't have to like get my car and go  
**0:22:36-0:22:37:**  anywhere.  
**0:22:37-0:22:41:**  Um, so I, I'm inclined to, I'm not a very good sales person and I'm inclined to not  
**0:22:41-0:22:43:**  go out and develop new accounts.  
**0:22:43-0:22:48:**  So I'm usually trying to figure out how we can get more people to come here and purchase  
**0:22:48-0:22:50:**  products directly from here.  
**0:22:50-0:22:58:**  So we do have a storefront that's open, um, you know, seven to nine hours a day year round  
**0:22:58-0:23:04:**  and people can come in and meet with one of the farm staff to either buy products from  
**0:23:04-0:23:11:**  our little shop or do a, um, kind of a, of hub style experience where they're drinking  
**0:23:11-0:23:14:**  various local beverages and eating local foods.  
**0:23:14-0:23:20:**  Um, we do a lot of online marketing to, um, let people know when there's things that they  
**0:23:20-0:23:21:**  can come pick off the farm.  
**0:23:21-0:23:25:**  So we do you pick, we let them know they can sign up for Thanksgiving turkeys and come  
**0:23:25-0:23:27:**  at a certain date and pick them up.  
**0:23:27-0:23:34:**  Um, but when things can't be sold here, we will definitely get in our little, um, Scooby  
**0:23:34-0:23:39:**  Doo delivery vehicle and drive 30 miles to our near town and often and drop off a lot  
**0:23:39-0:23:40:**  of products.  
**0:23:40-0:23:42:**  And that's probably 20% of the income.  
**0:23:42-0:23:43:**  Okay.  
**0:23:43-0:23:45:**  And then drop off products directly to the consumers again.  
**0:23:45-0:23:48:**  Uh, no, that's often being dropped off to a retailer.  
**0:23:48-0:23:49:**  Yep.  
**0:23:49-0:23:57:**  To a local co-ops and a few little restaurant accounts and wine shops and things like that.  
**0:23:57-0:24:01:**  And do you see that as an interesting sales strategy as well?  
**0:24:01-0:24:05:**  Are you, what's, I mean, what's the future prospects of, of your approach now this 80  
**0:24:05-0:24:10:**  20 approach, if we can call it a direct setting on the farm vs retailing, are you imagining  
**0:24:10-0:24:14:**  to, to, to, to increase that retail opportunity?  
**0:24:14-0:24:19:**  Um, or how, how are you seeing this evolve in the future?  
**0:24:19-0:24:24:**  I'm not that inclined to develop more off farm retail accounts.  
**0:24:24-0:24:29:**  I think the finding the direct to consumer marketing to be really resilient, like even,  
**0:24:29-0:24:34:**  you know, especially during the pandemic and other, all sorts of other situations I can  
**0:24:34-0:24:40:**  imagine when you have a customer base of tens of thousands of people versus maybe five accounts  
**0:24:40-0:24:44:**  that or it's been, you know, especially in say the wine world where you might have one  
**0:24:44-0:24:48:**  distributor or two distributors, if they, if they change their business model, if two  
**0:24:48-0:24:52:**  people change their mind, your whole sales channel has fallen apart and which is the  
**0:24:52-0:24:55:**  driver of your whole kind of vision and business.  
**0:24:55-0:25:00:**  But it's unlikely that 20 to 40,000 people will all change their mind at the same time  
**0:25:00-0:25:02:**  and decide that they don't want your stuff anymore.  
**0:25:02-0:25:08:**  Um, so we have a lot of resilience with a lot of people and the internet has pretty  
**0:25:08-0:25:14:**  much made that possible to connect with that many people because they can view your platform,  
**0:25:14-0:25:21:**  they can see, um, you know, they can just kind of follow you on all the different social  
**0:25:21-0:25:24:**  medias and review sites and kind of get a sense of what you're doing.  
**0:25:24-0:25:26:**  We have newsletters that go out, they connect with people in that way.  
**0:25:26-0:25:30:**  It's a lot to keep up with and we don't keep up with it nearly as well as we should, but  
**0:25:30-0:25:32:**  it's, it's, um, functional.  
**0:25:32-0:25:36:**  It's allowing us to climb in stability and sales.  
**0:25:36-0:25:45:**  So I think if we do do, um, expand in a market opportunity, it will be, um, both getting  
**0:25:45-0:25:51:**  more people here for more reasons and to stay in longer and do more, but also, um, trying  
**0:25:51-0:25:55:**  to ship our products to people who have visited us and connected and want to stay in touch.  
**0:25:55-0:26:00:**  And I know there's, you know, there's drawbacks and an energetic cost of moving product around  
**0:26:00-0:26:01:**  the country.  
**0:26:01-0:26:08:**  Both, um, you know, primarily right now it's shelf stable products like ciders and wines.  
**0:26:08-0:26:13:**  Um, we hope to be able to ship other products eventually, value added shelf stable products  
**0:26:13-0:26:15:**  or frozen meats and things like that.  
**0:26:15-0:26:25:**  But, um, it's an awesome way to, to scale sales without scaling the, like climbing the,  
**0:26:25-0:26:30:**  uh, scaling the farm beyond its, uh, maybe it's beyond its means here.  
**0:26:30-0:26:34:**  So we're chasing sort of higher return sales without having to hugely increase your infrastructure  
**0:26:34-0:26:38:**  as well, having to put, put up shops in different places and et cetera.  
**0:26:38-0:26:42:**  You've got one base, but you can just, you know, use the kind of postage system to, to  
**0:26:42-0:26:46:**  get product out to, to other people in different parts of the country.  
**0:26:46-0:26:47:**  Okay.  
**0:26:47-0:26:48:**  It's interesting.  
**0:26:48-0:26:51:**  I mean, as a little anecdote, I think is quite interesting to share here.  
**0:26:51-0:26:54:**  I'm working with a farmer now who was doing wholesale farming.  
**0:26:54-0:26:56:**  He's got 10 hectares of apples.  
**0:26:56-0:27:00:**  And um, at some point he tried to, he tried to direct sell, you know, and he started,  
**0:27:00-0:27:04:**  started producing some apricots and he tried to direct sell apricots, put a small quantity,  
**0:27:04-0:27:06:**  um, and some of his apples, of course.  
**0:27:06-0:27:12:**  Um, but it didn't work out for him because, um, he didn't, he wasn't able to, you know,  
**0:27:12-0:27:16:**  people, um, they, they want to, if they're going to buy produce, they want convenience.  
**0:27:16-0:27:17:**  This is what he was saying, right?  
**0:27:17-0:27:21:**  So they want to go to the supermarket where everything is kind of accessible.  
**0:27:21-0:27:25:**  So he was, what's different between you and him here and which is very clear, your farm  
**0:27:25-0:27:30:**  and his operation is, is that you're, you're able to attract many people and to come onto  
**0:27:30-0:27:35:**  the farm through the side house and through also, uh, I can imagine people are very interested  
**0:27:35-0:27:41:**  in seeing what a, uh, you know, a diverse, um, um, um, innovative farm looks like.  
**0:27:41-0:27:45:**  And this is something that I think would, is key to get these people here, get them  
**0:27:45-0:27:49:**  interested, share the story, get them to see the, you know, see the, the, the, the people  
**0:27:49-0:27:53:**  that work there as well, your crew and, and then be able to get an emotional attachment  
**0:27:53-0:27:54:**  in a way.  
**0:27:54-0:27:55:**  Right.  
**0:27:55-0:27:57:**  And so this is interesting, I think though, because I made, it made me think a lot, you  
**0:27:57-0:28:01:**  know, we're always thinking diversity, uh, sorry, direct selling.  
**0:28:01-0:28:03:**  That's a key, but it's not always accessible for everybody.  
**0:28:03-0:28:08:**  And you've managed to kind of crack it there and to get, I mean, you're talking about tens  
**0:28:08-0:28:11:**  to 20,000 people visiting your farm.  
**0:28:11-0:28:12:**  That's a huge amount of people coming in.  
**0:28:12-0:28:14:**  Yeah.  
**0:28:14-0:28:19:**  And I, I, sometimes it definitely feels too complex and it is getting a little easier  
**0:28:19-0:28:26:**  each year, but I do think it's the burden to direct sell is, is definitely not for everyone.  
**0:28:26-0:28:31:**  And I think there, yeah, the other models have their own challenges, but the support  
**0:28:31-0:28:35:**  need to be developed because it's, it's maybe not a realistic expectation for a lot of people  
**0:28:35-0:28:40:**  to, to do what it takes to direct sell in the way, especially the way we are.  
**0:28:40-0:28:45:**  I mean, we're there, you do a ton of things that are not farming.  
**0:28:45-0:28:49:**  You primarily do things I would say as the business owner that are not farming.  
**0:28:49-0:28:56:**  Um, so if your goal and your talents are really in farming, then, um, running a business that  
**0:28:56-0:29:02:**  is a farm that directs markets is probably not, uh, uh, maybe, uh, it'd be something  
**0:29:02-0:29:04:**  you should look at closely before jumping into it.  
**0:29:04-0:29:06:**  There's so much on that.  
**0:29:06-0:29:12:**  Um, the marketing side and sort of human resources side usually requires more people.  
**0:29:12-0:29:17:**  So there's more staff management and, um, yeah.  
**0:29:17-0:29:20:**  Just the financial management end.  
**0:29:20-0:29:24:**  Um, and so for one person to be good at all those things, it's just like too burdensome.  
**0:29:24-0:29:30:**  So the enterprise usually ends up being bigger and then, um, that becomes a different kind  
**0:29:30-0:29:34:**  of business when it's like a, when there's 10 people and there's some, uh, division of  
**0:29:34-0:29:36:**  labor and role division.  
**0:29:36-0:29:40:**  So that, that wasn't really on my radar getting started is now, and we kind of lucked out  
**0:29:40-0:29:43:**  in that I enjoy that kind of work.  
**0:29:43-0:29:48:**  So it's a decent fit for me, even though I find myself doing less of the things I was  
**0:29:48-0:29:50:**  doing when we started.  
**0:29:50-0:29:51:**  Yeah.  
**0:29:51-0:29:52:**  Hmm.  
**0:29:52-0:29:53:**  Interesting.  
**0:29:53-0:29:58:**  I like how you nuance the whole, um, direct selling thing of, you know, it's might not  
**0:29:58-0:29:59:**  be adapted to everybody.  
**0:29:59-0:30:04:**  I think that's really important to take into account and important consideration when you're  
**0:30:04-0:30:08:**  doing your holistic context, trying to work out what your farm is going to look like.  
**0:30:08-0:30:12:**  Um, but you know, one of the, when, when, when I looked on your website and I saw you  
**0:30:12-0:30:17:**  like one of the first things that crossed my mind is, um, you know, now I'm seeing where  
**0:30:17-0:30:19:**  I'm working, for example, and how sensitive the trees are.  
**0:30:19-0:30:21:**  You know, you don't want to want to be careful.  
**0:30:21-0:30:24:**  You don't want to break the spurs of the apple trees.  
**0:30:24-0:30:31:**  You want to, um, I mean, how do you manage with having possibly hundreds or maybe thousands,  
**0:30:31-0:30:35:**  I don't know, of people walking through your farm and harvesting themselves, people who  
**0:30:35-0:30:40:**  don't necessarily have a lot of experience with, uh, agriculture with, with farming that  
**0:30:40-0:30:42:**  don't necessarily, you know, are you not worried that you get.  
**0:30:42-0:30:43:**  Do you get damaged?  
**0:30:43-0:30:44:**  Do you, do you get damaged?  
**0:30:44-0:30:47:**  And I mean, how's that going for you?  
**0:30:47-0:30:55:**  Yeah, I, I mean, we're, we're only several years in and with you pick stuff and the numbers  
**0:30:55-0:30:58:**  are a little bit lower as far as the volume of people that are out there right now as  
**0:30:58-0:31:01:**  we're developing more crops and new plantings.  
**0:31:01-0:31:04:**  Um, so I'm assuming that complexity will increase over time.  
**0:31:04-0:31:09:**  Like some of these multi-generational farms or farms that have been doing it for a couple  
**0:31:09-0:31:13:**  of decades and there's a big word of mouth and there's a ton of influx of people.  
**0:31:13-0:31:18:**  Um, so we have, we've had to go to ramp up a little bit more slowly through this and  
**0:31:18-0:31:24:**  troubleshoot, but it is, it's a little bit of a, um, you know, and letting go and of  
**0:31:24-0:31:28:**  like if you're meticulous in nature of exactly how you want your crops to be up to know that  
**0:31:28-0:31:31:**  you're sharing them with everybody and stuff's going to happen.  
**0:31:31-0:31:35:**  Um, people are gonna, they're going to break some branches.  
**0:31:35-0:31:38:**  They're gonna eat some fruit and throw it on the ground.  
**0:31:38-0:31:41:**  And if that drives you crazy, it's probably not a good fit for you.  
**0:31:41-0:31:42:**  Um, okay.  
**0:31:42-0:31:44:**  We charge a reasonable amount.  
**0:31:44-0:31:49:**  We kind of charge a little bit less than the retail value of the fruit.  
**0:31:49-0:31:56:**  Um, but we don't have to obviously pick, pack, wash, distribute, um, and get a lower price  
**0:31:56-0:31:57:**  anyway.  
**0:31:57-0:32:03:**  Um, so the pricing helps definitely offset, um, some of those challenges of welcoming  
**0:32:03-0:32:09:**  people onto the farm and extra costs to direct them and communicate with them.  
**0:32:09-0:32:12:**  Um, so it's definitely worth it for us.  
**0:32:12-0:32:19:**  And it is, um, also wholesale like, um, the other option when you start to have more and  
**0:32:19-0:32:24:**  more product, they become less and less attractive often at sort of a medium scale, like the  
**0:32:24-0:32:29:**  ability to sell a couple of thousand bushels of apples locally is not very good.  
**0:32:29-0:32:32:**  Um, there's a lot of apple producers in this area.  
**0:32:32-0:32:37:**  So you have to be doing something incredibly unique or you end up selling to the lowest  
**0:32:37-0:32:42:**  cost processing endpoint, which is like these died juice and sauce plants that are near  
**0:32:42-0:32:44:**  near us in New York.  
**0:32:44-0:32:50:**  Um, so without being so small that all you have is, you know, a handful of bushes you  
**0:32:50-0:32:55:**  bring to the farmer's market and the far end being these processing plants, you are looking  
**0:32:55-0:32:56:**  for that.  
**0:32:56-0:33:00:**  Um, there's a big squishy middle in there where you have to figure out something that  
**0:33:00-0:33:05:**  fits with your specific model, your personality, your land base to have more than, you know,  
**0:33:05-0:33:07:**  to not be in one of those extremes.  
**0:33:07-0:33:09:**  I mean, don't get me wrong.  
**0:33:09-0:33:12:**  I realize now that my comment may have been a bit negative because I mean, there's, it's  
**0:33:12-0:33:16:**  very, I mean, it's, it's, it looks amazing to have such a beautiful interaction with  
**0:33:16-0:33:17:**  your local community.  
**0:33:17-0:33:20:**  You know, they come on your farm, they interact with your trees, they interact with your farming  
**0:33:20-0:33:23:**  practices, the positive side, right?  
**0:33:23-0:33:27:**  There's, there's a, there's a beautiful connection between the farm and which, which is completely  
**0:33:27-0:33:31:**  opposite to a wholesale farm that's selling to a cooperative that nobody enters.  
**0:33:31-0:33:36:**  And, you know, and just to, just to finish off on this, on this sales, um, kind of topic  
**0:33:36-0:33:38:**  before we move on to agroforestry.  
**0:33:38-0:33:42:**  And again, everybody's probably telling, thinking that we should, they want to move on to agroforestry  
**0:33:42-0:33:43:**  as soon as possible.  
**0:33:43-0:33:48:**  But, um, um, you know, apparently transformation, uh, in, for example, of your apples into cider  
**0:33:48-0:33:50:**  is a big part of your strategy as well.  
**0:33:50-0:33:54:**  And I'd love to have some to know some of your thoughts about this, you know, how, how  
**0:33:54-0:33:55:**  did that come about?  
**0:33:55-0:34:00:**  And, and what's your feeling about this transformation thing, which is again, something that we hear  
**0:34:00-0:34:04:**  a lot about to create value, to be able to, you know, try to make an operation profitable  
**0:34:04-0:34:06:**  and, um, and a business sustainable.  
**0:34:06-0:34:07:**  Absolutely.  
**0:34:07-0:34:08:**  Yeah.  
**0:34:08-0:34:09:**  That's been key.  
**0:34:09-0:34:13:**  Um, totally core part of our business model and I love it.  
**0:34:13-0:34:14:**  It's good.  
**0:34:14-0:34:15:**  We're going to keep doing it.  
**0:34:15-0:34:21:**  Um, like for example, when you're harvesting a ton of apples, you have a great bumper crop.  
**0:34:21-0:34:24:**  Almost everyone else also has a great bumper crop at that same time.  
**0:34:24-0:34:28:**  But if you're all selling to the same markets, it becomes sort of a race to the bottom and  
**0:34:28-0:34:29:**  pricing.  
**0:34:29-0:34:34:**  It's like a, you know, kind of a challenge and you're competing in a way you don't necessarily  
**0:34:34-0:34:36:**  want to compete with your neighbors.  
**0:34:36-0:34:42:**  And, um, it's the nature of that sort of multi tiered food system where you're not connected  
**0:34:42-0:34:48:**  to customers and the value kind of chain often will collapse with these great abundant yields.  
**0:34:48-0:34:54:**  Um, so when you're, uh, the value adding, particularly with making something shelf stable  
**0:34:54-0:34:56:**  is really a powerful tool for us.  
**0:34:56-0:35:01:**  Um, alcohol production is, you know, kind of one of the most shelf stable things that  
**0:35:01-0:35:03:**  you can make out of a product.  
**0:35:03-0:35:08:**  You know, it's kind of crazy that you can make a product that gains value as it gets  
**0:35:08-0:35:12:**  older, even if you haven't done anything to it, just the fact that it gets older, some  
**0:35:12-0:35:14:**  of those products will gain value.  
**0:35:14-0:35:19:**  Um, so in the kind of the far end of that extreme would probably be distilling products,  
**0:35:19-0:35:20:**  right?  
**0:35:20-0:35:22:**  Distilling things deals with bumper crops.  
**0:35:22-0:35:26:**  So when you have a good year, you make a lot of spirits or alcohol.  
**0:35:26-0:35:30:**  And when you have the bad years that eventually roll around for your farm, you still have  
**0:35:30-0:35:34:**  something that is self stable that you can sell and spread out the inevitable bad years.  
**0:35:34-0:35:40:**  Or you can work with another producer who had a good year to purchase in their products  
**0:35:40-0:35:45:**  and add value if you are having a bad year.  
**0:35:45-0:35:51:**  And the ability to ship those products is very powerful because there's that connection  
**0:35:51-0:35:56:**  of agriculture then to people who are in areas maybe where they can't get connected to a  
**0:35:56-0:36:01:**  farm or are in sort of these food deserts or are not around the style of agriculture  
**0:36:01-0:36:04:**  they want to support.  
**0:36:04-0:36:11:**  The ability to send them something they can help, any help in any sales mechanism is really  
**0:36:11-0:36:12:**  valuable at this small scale.  
**0:36:12-0:36:17:**  So people who want to support us from the other side of the country is a welcome sale.  
**0:36:17-0:36:19:**  Hmm.  
**0:36:19-0:36:29:**  Plus you can open a cider house or a pub and you know, and get people to your farm and  
**0:36:29-0:36:31:**  interact with the local community again.  
**0:36:31-0:36:39:**  Yeah, it's been definitely more, been able to build more culture and more resilience  
**0:36:39-0:36:45:**  and more like getting more, our sort of our rural area here now is like there's a spot  
**0:36:45-0:36:48:**  where people can spend time after work.  
**0:36:48-0:36:53:**  There's probably three or four of our staff have moved into the region and our young people  
**0:36:53-0:37:00:**  moving into a somewhat economically depressed area and buying homes and trying to put energy  
**0:37:00-0:37:06:**  into a small town where a very small town outside of, you know, a larger town of probably  
**0:37:06-0:37:14:**  40,000 people but we're 20 miles away and some energy into that economy is fantastic.  
**0:37:14-0:37:20:**  I also wanted to mention too that from the value added sign, like selling an apple, I'm  
**0:37:20-0:37:26:**  often, I find our ability to sell that apple at the price we need to get forward is very  
**0:37:26-0:37:27:**  difficult.  
**0:37:27-0:37:32:**  I have a very fixed idea about what food should cost and the price flexibility is very low.  
**0:37:32-0:37:38:**  They, if an apple is going to cost $2, it's like a big deal for someone if the apple is  
**0:37:38-0:37:43:**  going to cost $2 and 25 cents, that's a big change for someone to mentally swallow.  
**0:37:43-0:37:47:**  When you're making value added products, there's much more flexibility in what the product  
**0:37:47-0:37:51:**  should cost or what the perceived value is, particularly with making, you know, wine would  
**0:37:51-0:37:52:**  be an extreme end.  
**0:37:52-0:37:58:**  If you give us a $10 bottle of wine or a $50 bottle of wine, it's a 500% increase and you  
**0:37:58-0:38:02:**  can sell that story if that's your goal.  
**0:38:02-0:38:06:**  Like, but there's, that's sort of an extreme example, but any, like food has the lowest  
**0:38:06-0:38:12:**  price flexibility, which is unfortunate because it shouldn't be that way, but kind of as we're  
**0:38:12-0:38:19:**  hoping to fix some aspects of the food system, the value added side gives you these little  
**0:38:19-0:38:24:**  windows into more flexibility in setting your own price.  
**0:38:24-0:38:25:**  That's fascinating.  
**0:38:25-0:38:26:**  Yeah.  
**0:38:26-0:38:29:**  Well, that's really interesting information.  
**0:38:29-0:38:35:**  And just stepping back a bit, what you were saying earlier on, going back to the social  
**0:38:35-0:38:42:**  side, it's just amazing how a diversity of produce, diversity, sorry, of production,  
**0:38:42-0:38:46:**  agricultural production has led to a diverse business, which has led to create a variety  
**0:38:46-0:38:53:**  of functions in the local, you know, social context, which is, you know, reuniting people,  
**0:38:53-0:38:58:**  creating a place where people can enjoy themselves and connecting and connect together, connecting  
**0:38:58-0:38:59:**  with the community.  
**0:38:59-0:39:00:**  It goes beyond farming.  
**0:39:00-0:39:04:**  And this is what's fascinating with what you've created there.  
**0:39:04-0:39:06:**  Well, okay.  
**0:39:06-0:39:14:**  Maybe now is the time to talk about agroforestry and to look at your systems of how you're  
**0:39:14-0:39:19:**  integrating turkeys and fruit trees and also asparagus in between fruit trees.  
**0:39:19-0:39:24:**  So it would be amazing to start with the turkeys and to tell us a bit about how your, I mean,  
**0:39:24-0:39:29:**  tell us a bit about how it works out in practice, how you're integrating the turkeys, you know,  
**0:39:29-0:39:30:**  what are they eating there?  
**0:39:30-0:39:33:**  How are you managing them?  
**0:39:33-0:39:36:**  If you could describe that system, it would be great.  
**0:39:36-0:39:37:**  Yeah.  
**0:39:37-0:39:38:**  Yeah.  
**0:39:38-0:39:43:**  The system is sort of based on something that we experienced when working with Mark Shepard  
**0:39:43-0:39:46:**  in Wisconsin, New Forest Farm.  
**0:39:46-0:39:54:**  And he had two acres of asparagus that was alley cropped between his chestnut trees,  
**0:39:54-0:39:57:**  these sort of hybrid chestnut trees.  
**0:39:57-0:40:01:**  Turns out chestnuts were probably a better bet for the application than apples.  
**0:40:01-0:40:02:**  But at our site, we wanted to grow fruit.  
**0:40:02-0:40:06:**  It was a good fruit growing site that was an interest and a market.  
**0:40:06-0:40:10:**  And so have chosen apples.  
**0:40:10-0:40:15:**  So our system is semi-dwarf rows of apples that are probably spaced roughly about 70  
**0:40:15-0:40:18:**  feet apart, 65 to 70 feet.  
**0:40:18-0:40:20:**  So that's quite a wide alley.  
**0:40:20-0:40:27:**  And those alleys contain the asparagus in five row beds.  
**0:40:27-0:40:34:**  So there's these two acres of asparagus spread out across a larger amount of acreage that  
**0:40:34-0:40:39:**  also contains semi-dwarf apple trees, peaches and pears.  
**0:40:39-0:40:45:**  And those alleys are also where the turkeys graze.  
**0:40:45-0:40:50:**  So there's kind of three elements there that are related to the income streams and sort  
**0:40:50-0:40:52:**  of cash flow and business side of the farm.  
**0:40:52-0:40:58:**  There's that fruit crop, there's the asparagus crop, and then there's the livestock, the  
**0:40:58-0:40:59:**  turkeys.  
**0:40:59-0:41:03:**  The asparagus grows in a living cover, which at one point was better managed and it was  
**0:41:03-0:41:06:**  actually like a planted cover crop.  
**0:41:06-0:41:16:**  It is now sort of a perennial forage that is a mix of legumes and broad leaves and grasses.  
**0:41:16-0:41:21:**  And so that's the food source for, well, part of the food source for the turkeys, obviously  
**0:41:21-0:41:23:**  they eat a ton of grain and so there's a grain input.  
**0:41:23-0:41:27:**  But the turkeys are both an energy driver of the system.  
**0:41:27-0:41:31:**  They're a pest control element to the system.  
**0:41:31-0:41:34:**  They do help with disease suppression to some, which I could get into.  
**0:41:34-0:41:38:**  And they are a short term cash flow thing.  
**0:41:38-0:41:40:**  So that's one of our biggest hurdles too, right?  
**0:41:40-0:41:42:**  When we're talking, we're interested in perennials.  
**0:41:42-0:41:47:**  Perennials often have not the greatest business models associated with them early on.  
**0:41:47-0:41:53:**  The cash flow is often a struggle and semi-dwarf apple trees are somewhere in the middle of  
**0:41:53-0:41:56:**  those, that long-lived perennial plan.  
**0:41:56-0:42:01:**  The apple trees probably are like more of like a seven year trajectory before you're  
**0:42:01-0:42:06:**  really having some harvestable and saleable yields.  
**0:42:06-0:42:07:**  The asparagus is much sooner.  
**0:42:07-0:42:09:**  It's in that three year range.  
**0:42:09-0:42:13:**  The turkeys are a six month turnaround typically of cash flow.  
**0:42:13-0:42:15:**  So have that other layer in the system.  
**0:42:15-0:42:20:**  Not only are they a driver of those biology and support the trees, they also help the  
**0:42:20-0:42:23:**  business model work from year one.  
**0:42:23-0:42:29:**  So not that necessarily worked well for us from year one or that we cash flowed positively  
**0:42:29-0:42:38:**  in year one or two, but it could for someone who knew more than we did getting started.  
**0:42:38-0:42:43:**  So you rotate the turkeys using netting, right?  
**0:42:43-0:42:45:**  Electric netting, is that correct?  
**0:42:45-0:42:47:**  So what does your rotation look like?  
**0:42:47-0:42:48:**  How often do you move them?  
**0:42:48-0:42:54:**  Yeah, I guess starting with the turkeys do start in a brooder, like in a barn setting.  
**0:42:54-0:42:59:**  So just filling out my organic certification recently, that's the confined animal step,  
**0:42:59-0:43:05:**  which is where these birds are all in one little spot in a brooder, staying safe, going  
**0:43:05-0:43:08:**  from one week old to three weeks old at three weeks or three and a half weeks.  
**0:43:08-0:43:17:**  They go out onto pasture in the form of a chicken tractor, essentially like a polyface  
**0:43:17-0:43:19:**  Joel Salatin style chicken tractor system.  
**0:43:19-0:43:21:**  So there's several of those.  
**0:43:21-0:43:25:**  There's four are used right now for 250 turkeys.  
**0:43:25-0:43:30:**  So those turkeys are spread between four tractors that are run down the alleys of those fruit  
**0:43:30-0:43:37:**  trees, typically under the drip line, kind of closer to the tree at that time.  
**0:43:37-0:43:40:**  We do have to be careful with all of our turkey management that we're adhering to the organic  
**0:43:40-0:43:48:**  standard of, for a fruit tree crop, it's 90 days of fresh manure being introduced into  
**0:43:48-0:43:49:**  the system.  
**0:43:49-0:43:58:**  So you can't put down say fresh manure, like either hand applied or by having an animal  
**0:43:58-0:44:03:**  there within 90 days of harvest of a crop that is grown on a tree.  
**0:44:03-0:44:08:**  So that's a key piece that would be better in the future for us to design around more  
**0:44:08-0:44:12:**  very specifically about when turkeys could be there when they can't.  
**0:44:12-0:44:17:**  But typically that allows us early summer to introduce them to the trees or post harvest  
**0:44:17-0:44:19:**  cleanup to the trees.  
**0:44:19-0:44:26:**  Otherwise they are totally in the alleys between the trees, which is that 60 to 70 foot alley  
**0:44:26-0:44:28:**  cropping area where the asparagus is.  
**0:44:28-0:44:36:**  Hopefully I'm doing a decent job explaining it because it is a very physical system to  
**0:44:36-0:44:38:**  envision how the trees are planted.  
**0:44:38-0:44:43:**  But so just to confirm something you're playing between placing them, the turkeys very close  
**0:44:43-0:44:48:**  to the trees in the chicken tractors, Salitan style chicken tractors vs placing them in  
**0:44:48-0:44:53:**  the middle, kind of grazing on top of or around the asparagus, or that would be after the  
**0:44:53-0:44:54:**  asparagus have been harvested.  
**0:44:54-0:44:58:**  So after April, and they would just be so you're playing with this and that enables  
**0:44:58-0:45:02:**  you to kind of be in control of this organic certification standard, right?  
**0:45:02-0:45:08:**  They can be they can be in this middle lane whilst the apples are being harvested, for  
**0:45:08-0:45:09:**  example.  
**0:45:09-0:45:10:**  Yeah, exactly.  
**0:45:10-0:45:11:**  Yeah.  
**0:45:11-0:45:12:**  Okay, nice.  
**0:45:12-0:45:14:**  So they're essentially in a different field.  
**0:45:14-0:45:20:**  They're in an area where harvest crew is not at all engaged in if you fence them in appropriately  
**0:45:20-0:45:21:**  into the alley.  
**0:45:21-0:45:25:**  But they can be let under the drip line because really the most influence on the tree is gained  
**0:45:25-0:45:33:**  from letting them under the drip line of the tree where they can help decompose leaves,  
**0:45:33-0:45:38:**  apple leaves, they can help decompose fruit, they can work around the soil.  
**0:45:38-0:45:45:**  And the trunk line is an effective area for them to work.  
**0:45:45-0:45:48:**  They will eat insects, they will eat rodents.  
**0:45:48-0:45:51:**  We do have rodent problems in New York State with trees, particularly voles.  
**0:45:51-0:45:57:**  I don't know if you have them where you are, but they're a huge problem in New York.  
**0:45:57-0:46:03:**  Little rodents that like to girdle fruit trees and kill trees for seemingly no reason, but  
**0:46:03-0:46:04:**  I'm sure they have a good reason.  
**0:46:04-0:46:07:**  Just for fun, you know, just to piss off the farmer.  
**0:46:07-0:46:13:**  But I mean, all of these things, I definitely want to get into them, of course.  
**0:46:13-0:46:17:**  But just to keep going with the understanding of the systems, we have a good idea of what  
**0:46:17-0:46:22:**  it looks like and then we'll break these down a bit step by step with each one.  
**0:46:22-0:46:28:**  So from brooder, brooder, three weeks they go into those Cherokee tractors as we call  
**0:46:28-0:46:29:**  them.  
**0:46:29-0:46:32:**  And then usually three to seven weeks of age, they're in the tractor because they're often  
**0:46:32-0:46:39:**  small and we have predation and they're difficult, very difficult to fence at small sizes.  
**0:46:39-0:46:44:**  So three to six weeks, three to seven, they go out into a day range system after that.  
**0:46:44-0:46:46:**  So that's where the netting comes in.  
**0:46:46-0:46:53:**  And they live in a mobile roost system that we built years ago that is still functional.  
**0:46:53-0:47:01:**  I saw like a blurry picture one time of something that someone had taken at Polyface Farm here  
**0:47:01-0:47:04:**  in America and it was a turkey roost thing.  
**0:47:04-0:47:05:**  I was like, that's genius.  
**0:47:05-0:47:10:**  And we tried to build one that immediately blew over and broke and we rebuilt it a second  
**0:47:10-0:47:14:**  time and it totally works now.  
**0:47:14-0:47:17:**  We make it differently now, but now there's some sounds like there's some great plans  
**0:47:17-0:47:18:**  online that people can just follow.  
**0:47:18-0:47:21:**  So we just we still use that.  
**0:47:21-0:47:22:**  We call it the turkey ark.  
**0:47:22-0:47:29:**  It's like a rolling roost system so it can be pulled with horses or a tractor.  
**0:47:29-0:47:33:**  And it's about 14 feet wide and 24 feet long, I think.  
**0:47:33-0:47:41:**  But it fits its 250 full sized turkeys is maybe pushing it for that ark system.  
**0:47:41-0:47:45:**  We added some extra roosts this past year, but I think we're trying to find that healthy  
**0:47:45-0:47:52:**  batch size of infrastructure that matches the turkey size that we need for both the  
**0:47:52-0:48:00:**  health of the flock and marketing purposes and ecological impact and 250 birds in a batch  
**0:48:00-0:48:06:**  seems to be a sweet spot we're finding our system is capable of fitting.  
**0:48:06-0:48:12:**  And I think that batch size or flock size is kind of important when thinking about how  
**0:48:12-0:48:17:**  much animal impact you're trying to have in how much time.  
**0:48:17-0:48:22:**  So with apples, particularly horticultural intensive crops like that, there's a few  
**0:48:22-0:48:27:**  windows when you can get in to introduce your animals and you need to have enough impact.  
**0:48:27-0:48:32:**  You need to have enough density of animals to come in and do a significant amount of  
**0:48:32-0:48:36:**  disruption or impact and then you need to pull them out and they have to go somewhere  
**0:48:36-0:48:37:**  else.  
**0:48:37-0:48:40:**  If you have too few animals, it's maybe not the most beneficial.  
**0:48:40-0:48:42:**  Yeah, that's really interesting.  
**0:48:42-0:48:46:**  When you say you have a small window, you have small windows of opportunity to integrate  
**0:48:46-0:48:49:**  the animals in the fruit systems.  
**0:48:49-0:48:50:**  Could you elaborate a bit on that?  
**0:48:50-0:48:53:**  What sets the limits?  
**0:48:53-0:48:55:**  Could you just explain why you say that?  
**0:48:55-0:48:59:**  Yeah, so the asparagus has a broader window.  
**0:48:59-0:49:05:**  Like you said, really after harvest and then the ferns are growing over the early summer  
**0:49:05-0:49:12:**  and kind of are maturing by mid to late summer and can handle animals in there because the  
**0:49:12-0:49:16:**  animals trump them down and trample them almost like they would pasture.  
**0:49:16-0:49:21:**  So the later in the season they get on the asparagus, the better.  
**0:49:21-0:49:29:**  The fruit trees, on the other hand, the animals could go in there early on in the spring.  
**0:49:29-0:49:37:**  We often have a management challenge in that apples are in our climate, humid, wet.  
**0:49:37-0:49:41:**  Fruit trees are horticulturally really intensive in our area and challenging to grow.  
**0:49:41-0:49:43:**  We have a lot of pest and disease problems.  
**0:49:43-0:49:48:**  So we have a spray program we use in the spring.  
**0:49:48-0:49:53:**  So we're bringing a tractor through there with a sprayer and that is a conflict between  
**0:49:53-0:49:57:**  livestock being right in that same zone.  
**0:49:57-0:50:03:**  So we've learned to work with the timing on that.  
**0:50:03-0:50:06:**  We've sprayed anywhere from two times in a season, which is too few really.  
**0:50:06-0:50:11:**  We've had some problems and up to like 15 times in a season when we've had severe problems  
**0:50:11-0:50:15:**  related to mismanagement to recover from problems.  
**0:50:15-0:50:19:**  So we're finding that apples are much more horticulturally intensive than we originally  
**0:50:19-0:50:20:**  thought.  
**0:50:20-0:50:25:**  So that's defined some of the system, which is one reason I would be very particular about  
**0:50:25-0:50:30:**  designing with apples in the future in our climate.  
**0:50:30-0:50:36:**  And so the windows are set by the management needs of intervening in the system plus the  
**0:50:36-0:50:42:**  harvesting, which is you need to be out 90 days, you said before.  
**0:50:42-0:50:43:**  Yeah, exactly.  
**0:50:43-0:50:46:**  OK, so that's what sets the kind of the window.  
**0:50:46-0:50:52:**  Yeah, between spray, kind of intensive spray time and then harvest time.  
**0:50:52-0:50:54:**  There is a early season window for us.  
**0:50:54-0:50:56:**  It's like June, July.  
**0:50:56-0:50:58:**  And then you can come in.  
**0:50:58-0:51:00:**  Apples start getting harvested in September and October.  
**0:51:00-0:51:06:**  So you can come in maybe late September, October and November to have animals that are coming  
**0:51:06-0:51:11:**  in as sort of a cleanup effort, which has a lot of labor reduction and ecological value  
**0:51:11-0:51:15:**  to us to have the animals come at the end of the season to.  
**0:51:15-0:51:16:**  OK, nice.  
**0:51:16-0:51:19:**  So that's really interesting.  
**0:51:19-0:51:24:**  And now let's start you start to mention many things here, many words, little sentences  
**0:51:24-0:51:27:**  that need to be dug in through.  
**0:51:27-0:51:29:**  This is why we're here.  
**0:51:29-0:51:31:**  So let me tell us a bit about this.  
**0:51:31-0:51:34:**  Tell us a bit about let's start with the leaves and the and the decomposition.  
**0:51:34-0:51:38:**  We know that in our and fruit culture, one of the problems is leaves that stay for too  
**0:51:38-0:51:42:**  long that can spread disease onto the trees.  
**0:51:42-0:51:43:**  So we want to have fast decomposition.  
**0:51:43-0:51:44:**  Right.  
**0:51:44-0:51:45:**  Just setting the scene here.  
**0:51:45-0:51:48:**  So tell us, how do the turkeys help with this?  
**0:51:48-0:51:54:**  Yeah, we manage the turkeys in kind of on the same mob grazing mentality that people  
**0:51:54-0:51:55:**  will graze cattle.  
**0:51:55-0:52:00:**  So high density of animals in a small amount of space that typically move one every one  
**0:52:00-0:52:01:**  to two days.  
**0:52:01-0:52:07:**  So depending on the forage quality, they are the paddock size that we set up with the fencing  
**0:52:07-0:52:11:**  is designed for a one to two day rotation.  
**0:52:11-0:52:16:**  The denser it is, the more impact they they have.  
**0:52:16-0:52:22:**  And we want that effect where where the birds once where they just left often looks to the  
**0:52:22-0:52:26:**  maybe the untrained eye looks like kind of like a disaster, like all of the grass has  
**0:52:26-0:52:31:**  been eaten down or tramped down into that map on the ground.  
**0:52:31-0:52:34:**  There's a blanket of manure everywhere.  
**0:52:34-0:52:40:**  There's some patches of bare soil where they've been scratching or messing with their water  
**0:52:40-0:52:42:**  and making a bare patch or something.  
**0:52:42-0:52:45:**  So there's there's a disruption that's happening.  
**0:52:45-0:52:48:**  They don't go back to those areas usually at all.  
**0:52:48-0:52:51:**  And if anything, there will be a second impact from turkeys later on in the year.  
**0:52:51-0:52:55:**  But usually it's a one once a year, but sometimes it's twice.  
**0:52:55-0:52:58:**  So it's a long rest period and a high impact kind of like you would with cows.  
**0:52:58-0:53:06:**  And that seems to do things like periodically keep the grass really short right up under  
**0:53:06-0:53:11:**  the trunk line, which is a labor intensive task to do with human power or requires very  
**0:53:11-0:53:15:**  expensive machinery to mow like that.  
**0:53:15-0:53:22:**  And it also has the benefit of matting the grass down instead of fully mowing it.  
**0:53:22-0:53:26:**  So you can get a better diversity of plants, maybe a little more protection on the soil.  
**0:53:26-0:53:33:**  And that blanket of manure combined with matting the grass down helps to decompose that leaf  
**0:53:33-0:53:35:**  litter more readily.  
**0:53:35-0:53:40:**  Which that, yeah, like you mentioned, leaf litter is a great harbor for disease, particularly  
**0:53:40-0:53:41:**  scab.  
**0:53:41-0:53:42:**  Yeah.  
**0:53:42-0:53:43:**  OK, nice.  
**0:53:43-0:53:48:**  And I read a study about this actually, that they were integrating poultry into forests  
**0:53:48-0:53:52:**  and they were seeing a much faster decomposition rate of the litter, which may be positive  
**0:53:52-0:53:53:**  or negative.  
**0:53:53-0:53:54:**  And, you know, it depends on the context.  
**0:53:54-0:54:00:**  I'm not saying in the forest it was necessarily a good thing, but definitely in this context,  
**0:54:00-0:54:04:**  I mean, this is something you're talking about that's also backed by science and that people  
**0:54:04-0:54:05:**  are monitoring in other contexts.  
**0:54:05-0:54:06:**  So that's really interesting.  
**0:54:06-0:54:10:**  It's probably something reliable that we can, you know, something that we can rely on as  
**0:54:10-0:54:11:**  a technique.  
**0:54:11-0:54:18:**  Yeah, because people also recommend spreading nitrogen based fertilizers as a decomposing  
**0:54:18-0:54:22:**  agent if you're not using animals.  
**0:54:22-0:54:23:**  Yeah.  
**0:54:23-0:54:24:**  OK.  
**0:54:24-0:54:27:**  So what about, you know, you started mentioning now the grasses and the weeding.  
**0:54:27-0:54:32:**  I mean, what I'm thinking in my head, you know, with the system that you described is  
**0:54:32-0:54:37:**  that if the turkeys, they intervene in an area underneath the apple trees, for example,  
**0:54:37-0:54:42:**  to clear it for the harvest, to keep things clean, et cetera.  
**0:54:42-0:54:44:**  But they have a 90 day period where they need to be out.  
**0:54:44-0:54:48:**  Well, the grass would have sprouted back, right, by that time and it would already be,  
**0:54:48-0:54:51:**  you know, relatively tall and need to be mowed again, right?  
**0:54:51-0:54:52:**  Is that correct?  
**0:54:52-0:54:58:**  Yeah, depending on the rainfall of the season, we definitely have to do some mowing.  
**0:54:58-0:55:02:**  And since we do a U-pick as well, like you definitely need to do a pre-harvest mowing  
**0:55:02-0:55:09:**  that's pretty tight in order to foot traffic, whether it's employees or customers.  
**0:55:09-0:55:12:**  So there is a mowing there.  
**0:55:12-0:55:14:**  Sometimes it's a little ragtag of a mowing.  
**0:55:14-0:55:16:**  The turkeys do a very thorough job.  
**0:55:16-0:55:19:**  It's usually not ragged at all.  
**0:55:19-0:55:23:**  It's pretty homogenous and they really, if they're at the right density, will do a very  
**0:55:23-0:55:25:**  detailed job.  
**0:55:25-0:55:29:**  Sometimes we'll do a quick pass of mowing with the tractor, but won't bother with the  
**0:55:29-0:55:32:**  tree, the row middles, as we call them, like between the trees.  
**0:55:32-0:55:37:**  That's the more labor intensive area to get with the hand work.  
**0:55:37-0:55:39:**  Are the turkeys having an impact on weeding as well?  
**0:55:39-0:55:43:**  For example, if they intervene at that window, you know, for example, around the springtime  
**0:55:43-0:55:49:**  or late spring, when there starts to be a bit of a competition, depending on your climate,  
**0:55:49-0:55:50:**  right?  
**0:55:50-0:55:53:**  But this, I don't know how it works exactly, but maybe on some years in your climate, it's  
**0:55:53-0:55:54:**  a challenge.  
**0:55:54-0:55:56:**  You start to have competition between the trees and the grasses.  
**0:55:56-0:56:03:**  Have you used the turkeys as a tool to manage the grasses and to give them a bit of a shock?  
**0:56:03-0:56:05:**  Is it a weeding tool as well for you?  
**0:56:05-0:56:09:**  Yeah, yeah, it absolutely can be.  
**0:56:09-0:56:13:**  Getting the right amount of animals to the right acreage and totally replacing our mowing  
**0:56:13-0:56:19:**  hasn't happened, but we do have understory control.  
**0:56:19-0:56:23:**  In our system, it's a perennial ground cover, so it's not really so much weeds as it is  
**0:56:23-0:56:30:**  just like the competition of understory, which we typically, with our apple management practice,  
**0:56:30-0:56:34:**  like to let it grow to what looks like a first hay cutting size.  
**0:56:34-0:56:42:**  So quite tall and kind of with the idea that it's going to add value to the soil, it is  
**0:56:42-0:56:47:**  going to trap fungal diseases more at a ground level.  
**0:56:47-0:56:53:**  So we do sort of an early June mowing is our first mowing when someone might cut hay around  
**0:56:53-0:56:55:**  here.  
**0:56:55-0:56:59:**  So we think that one adds value and we try to cut the ground cover loosely and lay it  
**0:56:59-0:57:00:**  down.  
**0:57:00-0:57:04:**  But later in the season, the turkeys will kind of pulse through and keep ground cover  
**0:57:04-0:57:09:**  managed for us at different levels as well as introducing that fertility, which I've  
**0:57:09-0:57:15:**  found, we took a year off from doing turkeys one year and really noticing impact from our  
**0:57:15-0:57:17:**  system.  
**0:57:17-0:57:22:**  Maybe our soil types and the ground cover competition really benefits from having some  
**0:57:22-0:57:27:**  energy nitrogen introduced into the system, which is, you know, in this context is largely  
**0:57:27-0:57:30:**  at least 70% of their diet is grain.  
**0:57:30-0:57:35:**  So they're getting that from, you know, that's where the energy is coming from for our system  
**0:57:35-0:57:38:**  is imported grain.  
**0:57:38-0:57:43:**  So you're not fertilizing with other imports of manure or any other, I mean, you're organic,  
**0:57:43-0:57:49:**  so you're not going to be bringing mineral nitrogen, but your nitrogen applications comes  
**0:57:49-0:57:50:**  from the turkeys solely.  
**0:57:50-0:57:51:**  Is that is that correct?  
**0:57:51-0:57:52:**  Yeah.  
**0:57:52-0:57:53:**  Yep.  
**0:57:53-0:57:59:**  We do some micronutrient foliar applications and we're fixing up an old row mulcher and  
**0:57:59-0:58:01:**  that's been a valuable tool.  
**0:58:01-0:58:10:**  So we have access to great affordable hardwood bark mulch and wood chips so that over time  
**0:58:10-0:58:16:**  can be a really great carbon nitrogen in like fertilizing input to the system, which also  
**0:58:16-0:58:21:**  is great for habitat of insects and seems to be a fun thing for the turkeys to kind  
**0:58:21-0:58:23:**  of dust bathe themselves in.  
**0:58:23-0:58:28:**  So wood chips are a powerful or bark mulch is a powerful input to the system too.  
**0:58:28-0:58:34:**  That brings up for me the idea of are you not worried that of excess nitrogen, you know,  
**0:58:34-0:58:36:**  and brought into the system by the turkeys?  
**0:58:36-0:58:41:**  Is that a problem that you've perceived in the past?  
**0:58:41-0:58:47:**  We've thought about it being a problem and usually experienced that we need more nitrogen  
**0:58:47-0:58:50:**  than or energy than we've had.  
**0:58:50-0:58:54:**  Our peaches have suffered a little bit from being low lower input.  
**0:58:54-0:58:57:**  They could definitely they probably could use some more supplementary compost or manures  
**0:58:57-0:59:00:**  besides just one pulse of turkeys.  
**0:59:00-0:59:03:**  And then our apple varieties.  
**0:59:03-0:59:08:**  One of the big keys with apples that would be the future generations of this farm hopefully  
**0:59:08-0:59:15:**  will be better off is assessing which root stocks and scion would match with what soil  
**0:59:15-0:59:19:**  type to create the perfect vigor of a tree.  
**0:59:19-0:59:24:**  So a tree that has like a balanced calm growth habit and fruiting habit that takes a minimal  
**0:59:24-0:59:30:**  amount of nitrogen inputs and so we found trees that were way too vigorous that needed  
**0:59:30-0:59:34:**  very little nitrogen and were way too big and we had to remove those trees or graft  
**0:59:34-0:59:40:**  them and we have ones that have totally rented out that have been too small and didn't have  
**0:59:40-0:59:44:**  a good combination of root stock and scion for our soil type.  
**0:59:44-0:59:48:**  So that's been a nuance that is definitely a multi-generational project.  
**0:59:48-0:59:49:**  For sure.  
**0:59:49-0:59:51:**  Hopefully that makes sense.  
**0:59:51-0:59:54:**  That's kind of a vague reading book.  
**0:59:54-1:00:00:**  I think it would make sense for somebody that knows about food culture.  
**1:00:00-1:00:05:**  I'm specializing myself in food culture and so for me I would ask you thousands of questions  
**1:00:05-1:00:12:**  about especially food culture but the problem is that would require another podcast that  
**1:00:12-1:00:15:**  have to start another podcast called fruit growing or something.  
**1:00:15-1:00:17:**  But this is about the forestry.  
**1:00:17-1:00:24:**  So let's talk about what you mentioned about pest control.  
**1:00:24-1:00:31:**  I'm really curious to know more about how the birds are having an impact on pests and  
**1:00:31-1:00:33:**  you also mentioned diseases.  
**1:00:33-1:00:36:**  So also maybe you can I mean we've talked a bit about it now with the leaves and etc.  
**1:00:36-1:00:41:**  but has this come from observations like all of your own observations to be able to see  
**1:00:41-1:00:45:**  that you know you've had a significant decline or increase in things with the animals?  
**1:00:45-1:00:47:**  I'd love to know to get into this topic.  
**1:00:47-1:00:51:**  Yeah it definitely is coming from observation.  
**1:00:51-1:00:57:**  We don't have I don't have any one I can talk to about raising turkeys in an orchard really.  
**1:00:57-1:01:01:**  I don't know anyone around here who does it so I would love to get more input from other  
**1:01:01-1:01:02:**  people.  
**1:01:02-1:01:06:**  I've heard you know some anecdotal things about chickens and we used to raise some geese  
**1:01:06-1:01:11:**  around here and I've talked to some other folks about geese but turkeys have their own  
**1:01:11-1:01:12:**  unique habits as well.  
**1:01:12-1:01:16:**  I think chickens would also do really well for a lot of the purposes that we're after  
**1:01:16-1:01:21:**  in some ways even better because they have more of a scratching habit than turkeys.  
**1:01:21-1:01:26:**  Turkeys don't so much scratch at the ground but turkeys are larger than chickens and that's  
**1:01:26-1:01:29:**  why one reason we like them a lot so their impact is greater.  
**1:01:29-1:01:34:**  They're heavier and they're like four times the size of a chicken and their impact is  
**1:01:34-1:01:38:**  just that much greater and their appetite that much greater.  
**1:01:38-1:01:45:**  So yeah I mentioned it before but apples in our climate have a ton of insect and pest  
**1:01:45-1:01:48:**  and disease problems.  
**1:01:48-1:01:51:**  It's one of the more seems like one of the more horticulturally challenging places to  
**1:01:51-1:01:56:**  grow them definitely farther southern US like down to North Carolina it's extremely challenging  
**1:01:56-1:01:58:**  in some regards.  
**1:01:58-1:02:05:**  So any help we can get is great because there's a wide array of spray applications you can  
**1:02:05-1:02:11:**  do for organics but horticultural practices seem to be much preferred.  
**1:02:11-1:02:18:**  So the turkeys have the benefit of cleaning up fruit drops and helping decompose fruit  
**1:02:18-1:02:25:**  drops is one big benefit and those leaf drops that decomposing action is really helpful.  
**1:02:25-1:02:32:**  So they are sometimes consuming the fruit or if not just sort of like pecking on it,  
**1:02:32-1:02:39:**  stomping on it, layering manure on it and decomposing it and also finding insects that  
**1:02:39-1:02:48:**  are in it if it's a drop because there was maybe a curculio sting or larva of some sort  
**1:02:48-1:02:50:**  inside that fruit.  
**1:02:50-1:02:56:**  They are messing, they're sort of ravenously working around the base of a trunk of a tree  
**1:02:56-1:03:03:**  and are pulling insects that might be coming down from the tree and harboring in the soil.  
**1:03:03-1:03:04:**  They're able to feed on those.  
**1:03:04-1:03:09:**  They don't have any really impact on say, impacts of insects that fly from the tree  
**1:03:09-1:03:14:**  to a hedgerow and have their life cycle and fly back but they do some with the disruption  
**1:03:14-1:03:21:**  of the fruit drops and the late season kind of leftover harvest drops and then that decomposing  
**1:03:21-1:03:27:**  of soil, of leaf litter on the soil which harbors a lot of diseases in our area but  
**1:03:27-1:03:33:**  I mentioned apple scab is a large one and I'll butcher the name of this one but Marcininia.  
**1:03:33-1:03:44:**  Blotch is this emerging, very defoliating, challenging leaf pathogen that helps if you  
**1:03:44-1:03:51:**  can decompose and get rid of leaf litter and so animals, nitrogen, all that help to break  
**1:03:51-1:03:54:**  that down.  
**1:03:54-1:03:57:**  What happened when you didn't include the turkeys?  
**1:03:57-1:04:00:**  Did you notice like apart from the nitrogen thing and the vigor thing that you talked  
**1:04:00-1:04:04:**  about, did you notice differences in pests?  
**1:04:04-1:04:10:**  Yeah, I know insect front, I wish I could say that I definitely saw a difference when  
**1:04:10-1:04:11:**  we didn't have the turkeys in there.  
**1:04:11-1:04:17:**  The nitrogen was the more standout issue from areas that didn't get the impact.  
**1:04:17-1:04:22:**  The voles are a standout issue where it's very clear where there's vole activity.  
**1:04:22-1:04:25:**  They're a much bigger animal to follow what they're doing.  
**1:04:25-1:04:30:**  They're in their vole trails and their habits and they're girdling of trees and the areas  
**1:04:30-1:04:31:**  they have impact.  
**1:04:31-1:04:42:**  So that's very clear but we haven't done enough trialing to decisively say curculio pressure  
**1:04:42-1:04:50:**  was much less or maybe some of the moth pressures were much less because there was this impact.  
**1:04:50-1:04:56:**  I would have to be more scientific about it I guess and do some controls and see if it's  
**1:04:56-1:05:01:**  so anecdotally I can say for sure but just seeing the action that they have on the understory  
**1:05:01-1:05:10:**  and the fruit drops and leaf drops, those are practices that I have encouraged as growers  
**1:05:10-1:05:14:**  to do and the fact that you can get animals to do them for you makes you feel like okay  
**1:05:14-1:05:19:**  they are having an impact that I'm otherwise sort of should be obligated to go do myself.  
**1:05:19-1:05:28:**  So you've really noticed that the turkeys help you in terms of management costs.  
**1:05:28-1:05:34:**  There's like an over yielding management efficiency if we can compare to the over yielding poly  
**1:05:34-1:05:39:**  culture concepts where you put two cultures together and overall in some contexts and  
**1:05:39-1:05:45:**  in certain conditions you can get a higher production of biomass for example which is  
**1:05:45-1:05:49:**  something we typically talk about in agroforestry but we can compare that to the management  
**1:05:49-1:05:50:**  costs.  
**1:05:50-1:05:55:**  This is very interesting to hear and I'm curious to know more about it.  
**1:05:55-1:06:00:**  Anything that those turkeys are doing that we would otherwise have in our management  
**1:06:00-1:06:05:**  plan for apples is a reduction in hourly labor costs.  
**1:06:05-1:06:09:**  Everything we do on the farm gets paid hourly.  
**1:06:09-1:06:14:**  I used to do a lot of free unpaid labor and now everything is paid and has at least a  
**1:06:14-1:06:19:**  $1 an hour US dollar kind of price tag to it.  
**1:06:19-1:06:25:**  So and oftentimes more if there's equipment involved, the tractor costs are higher and  
**1:06:25-1:06:30:**  opportunity cost is another thing and so the costs are quite high with human intervention.  
**1:06:30-1:06:35:**  It's like our highest cost in the whole farm and business across the board, a third of  
**1:06:35-1:06:38:**  all of our expenses are labor related.  
**1:06:38-1:06:44:**  So anything an animal will do just by the nature of its existence is awesome and it's  
**1:06:44-1:06:48:**  saving us energy and effort and expense.  
**1:06:48-1:06:52:**  So we would have to be mowing tightly around those trees which is labor intensive.  
**1:06:52-1:06:59:**  We would have to be spreading more fertilizer and wood chips and that gets done within the  
**1:06:59-1:07:05:**  one hour of daily chores that go into the turkey rotation and there's value derived  
**1:07:05-1:07:11:**  from that and on the sort of turkey yield side too that pays for all that labor.  
**1:07:11-1:07:15:**  So it makes both budgets look more appealing.  
**1:07:15-1:07:18:**  And whilst creating value for you, right?  
**1:07:18-1:07:19:**  Yeah.  
**1:07:19-1:07:23:**  I mean economic value as well, like a product that you can sell.  
**1:07:23-1:07:27:**  Okay, that's super interesting.  
**1:07:27-1:07:32:**  And for me, you talked about chicken and scratching and that the turkey scratch less and you said  
**1:07:32-1:07:37:**  that if they were scratching more, it could be more beneficial.  
**1:07:37-1:07:42:**  Now that may seem counterintuitive for some and especially in context where you have,  
**1:07:42-1:07:46:**  for example, lots of mulch set around your trees to control the weed pressure, which  
**1:07:46-1:07:51:**  is very common technique, especially in the agro-ecological world.  
**1:07:51-1:07:58:**  And so I'm curious to know why you mentioned that scratching could be more beneficial for  
**1:07:58-1:07:59:**  your context.  
**1:07:59-1:08:00:**  Right, right.  
**1:08:00-1:08:06:**  Yeah, the system they're in right now doesn't have, there's haphazard mulch, but not mulch  
**1:08:06-1:08:11:**  that would be, is no longer for weed suppression right around the trunk.  
**1:08:11-1:08:14:**  We used to, when the early stages of tree growth, we did have mulch like that and maybe  
**1:08:14-1:08:18:**  I would be a little annoyed if the animals totally scratched it away from the base of  
**1:08:18-1:08:19:**  a young tree.  
**1:08:19-1:08:24:**  I should say that turkeys are big enough that they will kill young trees.  
**1:08:24-1:08:28:**  So it's not something for, it's not something for two year old trees.  
**1:08:28-1:08:33:**  They'll, especially in like a dry year, they'll try to peck at the bark of young trees.  
**1:08:33-1:08:36:**  Young trees have like tender buds and tender bark.  
**1:08:36-1:08:37:**  It's delicious.  
**1:08:37-1:08:41:**  And they will go after those so they can't be fenced into those until that tree starts  
**1:08:41-1:08:47:**  to get a little more juvenile and has real branches and has some real bark that isn't  
**1:08:47-1:08:48:**  super tender.  
**1:08:48-1:08:50:**  You need to put tree guards in this case.  
**1:08:50-1:08:54:**  Yeah, even with the tree guard, a turkey is tall enough that it will eat above the tree  
**1:08:54-1:08:57:**  guard when it's in its later stages of life.  
**1:08:57-1:09:01:**  The turkey is pretty big and it will eat above a tree guard if it's a tiny, like one to two  
**1:09:01-1:09:02:**  year old tree.  
**1:09:02-1:09:05:**  I wouldn't put them in there.  
**1:09:05-1:09:08:**  If you grow a really good three year old tree, I would put them in there.  
**1:09:08-1:09:13:**  A tree that maybe is close to standing six feet tall and has some branches.  
**1:09:13-1:09:14:**  Okay.  
**1:09:14-1:09:15:**  Okay.  
**1:09:15-1:09:16:**  That's very interesting.  
**1:09:16-1:09:17:**  Yeah.  
**1:09:17-1:09:20:**  So mulch has been part of the system early on.  
**1:09:20-1:09:22:**  We have dwarf orchards as well.  
**1:09:22-1:09:28:**  So we have orchards that are on trellis that have mulch underneath them routinely.  
**1:09:28-1:09:31:**  And we haven't done too much trials with the turkeys in there.  
**1:09:31-1:09:33:**  They do scratch that.  
**1:09:33-1:09:38:**  Chickens would probably scratch it more, but the desirable part of scratching like you  
**1:09:38-1:09:43:**  had asked is I think you get the enhanced insect control benefit.  
**1:09:43-1:09:46:**  It's also more of a decomposing action too.  
**1:09:46-1:09:52:**  When they're stirring up litter underneath the trees, they're burying leaves and they're  
**1:09:52-1:09:55:**  kind of blanking and creating their own composting layer.  
**1:09:55-1:10:01:**  But they are going after insects more readily, which might be hiding under tufts of grass  
**1:10:01-1:10:02:**  or in the top layer of the soil.  
**1:10:02-1:10:07:**  They're able to use their talons and get in there and open it up and get after them.  
**1:10:07-1:10:12:**  So chickens seem like they're a little more adept.  
**1:10:12-1:10:19:**  They're less like Godzilla and more like velociraptors or something and are able to get after those  
**1:10:19-1:10:21:**  insects more agilely.  
**1:10:21-1:10:22:**  Okay.  
**1:10:22-1:10:23:**  Interesting.  
**1:10:23-1:10:24:**  All right.  
**1:10:24-1:10:25:**  That's really interesting.  
**1:10:25-1:10:30:**  So again, it shows that depending on your context, depending on your system, that would  
**1:10:30-1:10:34:**  be or not an interesting feature to have more scratching or less.  
**1:10:34-1:10:36:**  Again, it always goes back to this.  
**1:10:36-1:10:38:**  So it depends on your context.  
**1:10:38-1:10:41:**  I know on our farm in Greece, we would not want to have that because everything's mulched  
**1:10:41-1:10:47:**  kind of closely because of this humidity problem and we're trying to conserve as much as possible.  
**1:10:47-1:10:52:**  And so we would be really pissed off if some chicken went in there and just scratched everything  
**1:10:52-1:10:58:**  all over the place and spread out kind of that buffer layer from temperatures and humidity  
**1:10:58-1:10:59:**  loss.  
**1:10:59-1:11:00:**  Right.  
**1:11:00-1:11:07:**  Yeah, we were geared up to have a 500 or 1000 bird egg layer flock two years ago, but had  
**1:11:07-1:11:11:**  to, at least things were too complex, we had to decide not to go down that road.  
**1:11:11-1:11:15:**  We thought it'd be very desirable to have them as part of the farm for those reasons.  
**1:11:15-1:11:22:**  But we pulled the plug on that project before we got started.  
**1:11:22-1:11:25:**  Maybe some.  
**1:11:25-1:11:31:**  So we've talked a lot about the benefits of the turkeys and what about some of the key  
**1:11:31-1:11:33:**  challenges of the turkeys?  
**1:11:33-1:11:40:**  I mean, have you seen impacts from the turkeys that you have, you know, that you'd have to  
**1:11:40-1:11:46:**  manage or that created some labour costs for you or things that you would rather not have  
**1:11:46-1:11:47:**  happened?  
**1:11:47-1:11:52:**  How does the turkey create some kind of challenge beyond, I mean, we've talked already about  
**1:11:52-1:11:56:**  the management cost of the management challenge of having the turkeys and the spraying happen  
**1:11:56-1:11:59:**  at the same time, which is a bit, you know, creates a limit.  
**1:11:59-1:12:02:**  But beyond that, what other problems have you and challenges have you experienced with  
**1:12:02-1:12:05:**  them in the orchard?  
**1:12:05-1:12:13:**  Yeah, the introduction of raw manures, like we've mentioned something we have to be thoughtful  
**1:12:13-1:12:18:**  of and it's been somewhat limiting sometimes is getting them around the trees at the right  
**1:12:18-1:12:19:**  time.  
**1:12:19-1:12:22:**  And you can only typically turkeys actually do herd fairly well.  
**1:12:22-1:12:27:**  Like you can group them up, not in a fence, and you can walk them with four or five people  
**1:12:27-1:12:33:**  into a whole nother, you know, walk them a half a mile away if you really wanted to,  
**1:12:33-1:12:34:**  which is different than chickens.  
**1:12:34-1:12:37:**  It's a little harder to do that, like put them in a group and push them with like sort  
**1:12:37-1:12:39:**  of a human energy.  
**1:12:39-1:12:45:**  So but they are limited a little bit in how they can move around the farm.  
**1:12:45-1:12:50:**  So you have to have this timing really good of like where can they be with the right impact  
**1:12:50-1:12:52:**  at the right time.  
**1:12:52-1:13:01:**  The turkeys themselves, I guess, for challenges with them, a big breakthrough came when we  
**1:13:01-1:13:05:**  put together that turkey arc system, that rolling roost system that the polyface farm  
**1:13:05-1:13:09:**  had figured out.  
**1:13:09-1:13:15:**  That would dramatically reduce the effort of taking care of the turkeys from protecting  
**1:13:15-1:13:16:**  them from predation.  
**1:13:16-1:13:20:**  So they in that roost system, they climb up to it at night and roost high like they want  
**1:13:20-1:13:22:**  to do naturally.  
**1:13:22-1:13:27:**  And then they come down in the morning whenever they're ready to versus having to be out there  
**1:13:27-1:13:32:**  in the morning first thing to let them out of a coop or get them, stuff them into a coop  
**1:13:32-1:13:35:**  that they don't want to go into at night.  
**1:13:35-1:13:38:**  So that would happen anywhere within the orchard or not.  
**1:13:38-1:13:41:**  But that was a large breakthrough is having that arc system for turkeys.  
**1:13:41-1:13:47:**  It's really key to their pasture health and safety.  
**1:13:47-1:13:51:**  And then damage to young trees, I guess, is one thing that we've learned and seeing how  
**1:13:51-1:13:58:**  they will, what size tree is OK for a turkey to be around and introducing them to the dwarf  
**1:13:58-1:13:59:**  orchard.  
**1:13:59-1:14:04:**  We're noticing that they will, if the forage isn't rotated quickly enough, they will go  
**1:14:04-1:14:05:**  after low hanging branches.  
**1:14:05-1:14:11:**  They're tall enough that they can get the bottom layer of trellised branches.  
**1:14:11-1:14:12:**  And that's a bummer.  
**1:14:12-1:14:17:**  So some interaction with the leaves and buds is to be expected.  
**1:14:17-1:14:22:**  But if they were left too long in a dwarf orchard, the trees are much more vulnerable  
**1:14:22-1:14:24:**  than semi-dwarf.  
**1:14:24-1:14:28:**  And chickens would not have that issue as much because they're just physically so much  
**1:14:28-1:14:31:**  shorter.  
**1:14:31-1:14:36:**  The turkey neck is quite long and they can reach quite high if they're bored.  
**1:14:36-1:14:40:**  I think we've covered a bit the turkey out one.  
**1:14:40-1:14:44:**  We could go into much more detail, but you've brought up some really interesting considerations  
**1:14:44-1:14:48:**  and some really interesting different aspects.  
**1:14:48-1:14:55:**  One of the things that I'm curious to know about is, do you think, based on your experience,  
**1:14:55-1:14:58:**  that we could scale these kind of systems?  
**1:14:58-1:15:02:**  A farmer that has, you know, where we're working, where I'm working at the moment with 10 hectares  
**1:15:02-1:15:05:**  and he's got lots of these issues as well, he's trying to manage for pests and disease  
**1:15:05-1:15:09:**  problems, he's trying to manage the decomposition of his litter.  
**1:15:09-1:15:13:**  He's managing all of this mechanically and with sprays, which is huge labour costs.  
**1:15:13-1:15:18:**  If a farmer like this wanted to implement such a system, do you think it's possible?  
**1:15:18-1:15:21:**  And I'd also like us to focus a bit on the mechanisation here as well.  
**1:15:21-1:15:24:**  How would that impact the mechanisation based on your experience?  
**1:15:24-1:15:29:**  How scalable is this?  
**1:15:29-1:15:33:**  I think absolutely scalable in my experience.  
**1:15:33-1:15:39:**  We're trying to scale it a little more over time, taking a slow approach because we're  
**1:15:39-1:15:45:**  first generation farmers and perennials are both expensive and time consuming and you  
**1:15:45-1:15:47:**  want to make sure you do them right.  
**1:15:47-1:15:51:**  I've definitely, this spring actually tore out a couple of acres of trees I planted eight  
**1:15:51-1:15:56:**  years prior and feeling like I'd done the wrong thing and had to kind of tear out the  
**1:15:56-1:16:00:**  juvenile several hundred trees that were not the right thing.  
**1:16:00-1:16:06:**  So we're taking a slower approach to scaling now, but I think people with a lot more experience  
**1:16:06-1:16:11:**  than we have could scale faster or larger.  
**1:16:11-1:16:17:**  One thing I've been talking with some of our staff about is orchards and apples in particular.  
**1:16:17-1:16:26:**  I don't know if they're the best suited for scaling because it's definitely a, because  
**1:16:26-1:16:32:**  of their horticultural intensity and orchard, we are very demanding of what we expect from  
**1:16:32-1:16:33:**  an orchard.  
**1:16:33-1:16:39:**  We want these clonal trees to live in close proximity to each other in very uniform plantings  
**1:16:39-1:16:45:**  and produce like with all these human needs on them to be either yielding at a certain  
**1:16:45-1:16:51:**  level, branching a certain way, just like a very demanding system from where they maybe  
**1:16:51-1:16:58:**  have originated from and were in evolutionary terms maybe asking too much of them too soon  
**1:16:58-1:17:03:**  and just asking for a lot of like labor and input costs and challenges with putting, packing  
**1:17:03-1:17:05:**  these trees in here per acre.  
**1:17:05-1:17:11:**  So I think one of the best opportunities with these trees and maybe a lot of trees in farm  
**1:17:11-1:17:17:**  systems is to, particularly ones that have pest and disease problems is to alley crop  
**1:17:17-1:17:25:**  and is to space them really far apart and to have more of a hedgerow edge effect happening  
**1:17:25-1:17:30:**  with these tree crops so they can scale over a larger landscape.  
**1:17:30-1:17:36:**  I think they just have to be in the right density to each other and not to reduce like  
**1:17:36-1:17:40:**  these kind of heavy industrial inputs that are often required when you pack a bunch of  
**1:17:40-1:17:48:**  these trees in the same space, if that makes any sense.  
**1:17:48-1:17:56:**  And then I think the infrastructure for harvesting and mechanizing the production of apples is  
**1:17:56-1:18:03:**  all there and these industries have a ton of the, you know, all the right equipment  
**1:18:03-1:18:06:**  and harvesting modalities and stuff figured out.  
**1:18:06-1:18:12:**  So relying on those is, seems totally doable.  
**1:18:12-1:18:20:**  But when trees are at lower densities, your efficiency and use of that equipment and cost  
**1:18:20-1:18:21:**  of land is higher.  
**1:18:21-1:18:28:**  So there's all these sort of things that maybe go negative on your spreadsheet and your budget  
**1:18:28-1:18:29:**  for a plan.  
**1:18:29-1:18:33:**  But I think it's outweighed by what you were talking about, that over yielding aspect of  
**1:18:33-1:18:39:**  a system as a whole, if you can manage the complexity.  
**1:18:39-1:18:44:**  And I think keeping the complexity as low as possible when you start is the best.  
**1:18:44-1:18:48:**  I certainly need to keep it low and so much to learn still.  
**1:18:48-1:18:50:**  But like three elements, that's a lot of elements.  
**1:18:50-1:18:52:**  There's a lot of interactions in those elements.  
**1:18:52-1:19:01:**  So two elements like tree and alley crop kind of system, that's plenty to figure out the  
**1:19:01-1:19:04:**  nuance of each of those crops themselves and then how they interact.  
**1:19:04-1:19:12:**  And I would say that would allow it to be more scalable if you start with simplicity  
**1:19:12-1:19:17:**  and maybe not starting with the most horticulturally intensive crops to interact with each other.  
**1:19:17-1:19:19:**  Yeah, yeah, makes sense.  
**1:19:19-1:19:20:**  What about the turkey elements?  
**1:19:20-1:19:22:**  What about scaling with the turkey element?  
**1:19:22-1:19:27:**  Do you think that integrating turkeys in the way that you've been doing, is that something  
**1:19:27-1:19:30:**  that we could, you know, scale up to larger?  
**1:19:30-1:19:36:**  Yeah, so is this, you know, as the orchard grows in size, also the turkey flock grows  
**1:19:36-1:19:43:**  in size and all the other kind of management practices based on mechanization as they also  
**1:19:43-1:19:45:**  evolve with the growing orchard.  
**1:19:45-1:19:46:**  Is that something that you think is scalable?  
**1:19:46-1:19:51:**  It has to be done by a small scale farmer.  
**1:19:51-1:19:58:**  I think it can be scalable in size, but I think it does need to scale with people.  
**1:19:58-1:20:02:**  I think I've mentioned, I guess, polyface behind a couple of times already, but I would  
**1:20:02-1:20:10:**  mention them again as a place that's showing scaling, small scale poultry production that  
**1:20:10-1:20:16:**  still has a high level of contact, of human contact in the system where instead of one  
**1:20:16-1:20:22:**  person managing more and more and more birds, it's often having that right size flock, that  
**1:20:22-1:20:28:**  healthy size flock and one person managing a reasonable amount of those flocks across  
**1:20:28-1:20:29:**  the right amount of landscape.  
**1:20:29-1:20:34:**  And then if you need to grow from there, another person coming in to manage a similar size  
**1:20:34-1:20:42:**  healthy unit and not trying to scale that like flock size or unit size is the way that  
**1:20:42-1:20:43:**  that could grow.  
**1:20:43-1:20:48:**  So I think you could have, I think it has been proven that you can have really efficient  
**1:20:48-1:20:54:**  production of, it's not inefficient to produce poultry this way.  
**1:20:54-1:21:00:**  There is a higher cost to the customer oftentimes than industrial processed products, but we  
**1:21:00-1:21:03:**  know that you're paying more of the true cost there.  
**1:21:03-1:21:09:**  There's less hidden costs than you do get with industrialized poultry production.  
**1:21:09-1:21:16:**  That just is such a failing system that a scalable alternative where it comes with more  
**1:21:16-1:21:23:**  true costs is totally appealing, I think, to most folks now.  
**1:21:23-1:21:27:**  One of the things we're seeing where we're working is people integrating sheep.  
**1:21:27-1:21:32:**  And so there's a farmer that has some sheep and that will place them in between vineyards  
**1:21:32-1:21:39:**  and within not orchards, but more in between the vineyards and on the cover crops of broadacre  
**1:21:39-1:21:43:**  crops, which in Switzerland is quite small areas.  
**1:21:43-1:21:45:**  It's not very, very large.  
**1:21:45-1:21:49:**  And there's been some interesting integrations there with two people managing it because  
**1:21:49-1:21:54:**  one person is professional in sheep and the other person is professional in trees or vineyards  
**1:21:54-1:21:55:**  or broadacre.  
**1:21:55-1:22:00:**  And so the broadacre farmer doesn't have to start learning how to manage sheep, which  
**1:22:00-1:22:04:**  can be complex as you're saying at scale.  
**1:22:04-1:22:10:**  And so it's kind of like the sheep farmer benefits from the cover crop and the broadacre  
**1:22:10-1:22:13:**  farmer benefits from nutrient cycling from the sheep in his cover crop.  
**1:22:13-1:22:17:**  And so there's a mutual benefit there that also happens to be funded by the government  
**1:22:17-1:22:20:**  partly, which motivates people to do it, which needs to be mentioned.  
**1:22:20-1:22:22:**  But yeah, that's fantastic.  
**1:22:22-1:22:23:**  Yeah, yeah.  
**1:22:23-1:22:28:**  You know, so that could be something interesting to do with turkeys as well.  
**1:22:28-1:22:38:**  But anyways, I think we've covered a lot of different aspects of your farm and the turkey  
**1:22:38-1:22:39:**  agroforestry.  
**1:22:39-1:22:43:**  We didn't manage to get into the asparagus so much, but we had to focus because otherwise  
**1:22:43-1:22:49:**  we would have not been able to reach the depth that was necessary for the turkey integration.  
**1:22:49-1:22:58:**  So yeah, thank you so much, Garrett, for sharing your story and sharing your experience and

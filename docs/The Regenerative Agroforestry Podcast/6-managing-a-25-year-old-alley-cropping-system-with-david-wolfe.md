### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 13:27:54)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:42:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:42-0:00:45:**  Hi everyone, welcome back to the podcast.  
**0:00:45-0:00:48:**  We're your hosts Etienne and Dimitri.  
**0:00:48-0:00:53:**  This week we're super excited to share with you an interview with David Wolf from Wakelands  
**0:00:53-0:00:55:**  Farm in the east of England.  
**0:00:55-0:00:59:**  Dimitri and I were super excited to have this interview because he's managing a 25 year  
**0:00:59-0:01:01:**  old agroforestry system.  
**0:01:01-0:01:04:**  And for us it's a great opportunity to see what that looks like.  
**0:01:04-0:01:08:**  We're often talking about young systems and there's so much innovation going on, but there  
**0:01:08-0:01:12:**  we get an opportunity to understand what it means to work among 25 year old trees and  
**0:01:12-0:01:16:**  the issues that might arise in terms of management.  
**0:01:16-0:01:20:**  So we're able to go into some detail with him on machinery and different management  
**0:01:20-0:01:21:**  techniques.  
**0:01:21-0:01:26:**  Yeah, Etienne, I think it's super important to have this conversation with more mature  
**0:01:26-0:01:33:**  systems because when we're designing and implementing systems now we're having an influence and  
**0:01:33-0:01:39:**  we're making decisions that are going to last 20, 25, 30 or even 40 years in these agroforestry  
**0:01:39-0:01:42:**  systems and you need to get it all right at this point.  
**0:01:42-0:01:50:**  So the conversation with David really helps us gain some visibility on that front.  
**0:01:50-0:01:55:**  The other thing I thought was really interesting is he explains to us how he's transitioning  
**0:01:55-0:02:01:**  this farm from basically a research farm, which was the initial project his parents  
**0:02:01-0:02:07:**  created and that now he's taking that towards a farm with more diversified income streams  
**0:02:07-0:02:10:**  and different enterprises.  
**0:02:10-0:02:11:**  For sure.  
**0:02:11-0:02:18:**  And all of the natural capital that was planted by his parents 25 years ago, that's enabling  
**0:02:18-0:02:24:**  him now to build a huge diversity, as you said, of enterprises, from agro-tourism to  
**0:02:24-0:02:30:**  on-farm restaurants, market gardens, grain production, biomass production and lots of  
**0:02:30-0:02:31:**  other things.  
**0:02:31-0:02:37:**  So it's incredible how this tree and natural capital, this wood natural capital is enabling  
**0:02:37-0:02:40:**  him to build a business.  
**0:02:40-0:02:42:**  So without further ado, let's get into it.  
**0:02:42-0:02:44:**  Hello, David.  
**0:02:44-0:02:45:**  Welcome to the podcast.  
**0:02:45-0:02:47:**  Thank you for having me.  
**0:02:47-0:02:55:**  Maybe we can start today with a bit of an overview of who you are and how the farm got  
**0:02:55-0:02:56:**  started.  
**0:02:56-0:03:01:**  OK, so my name is David Wolf.  
**0:03:01-0:03:08:**  My parents, Anne and Martin Wolf, lived in East Anglia, lived in Cambridge and I grew  
**0:03:08-0:03:09:**  up in Cambridge.  
**0:03:09-0:03:15:**  They went to live in Switzerland for the last part of my father's working life.  
**0:03:15-0:03:18:**  And while they were there, they decided to embark on a retirement project.  
**0:03:18-0:03:21:**  And they came back and he would be 60.  
**0:03:21-0:03:24:**  And they decided to set up what became Wakelands.  
**0:03:24-0:03:29:**  So in 1992, they bought the land.  
**0:03:29-0:03:33:**  In 1994, they planted the first trees.  
**0:03:33-0:03:41:**  And from 1994 onwards, they then ran Wakelands Organic Agroforestry, which was a very pioneering,  
**0:03:41-0:03:47:**  active, diverse agroforestry system in the UK and across Europe.  
**0:03:47-0:03:52:**  My mum died in 2016 and my father died last year, 2019.  
**0:03:52-0:03:55:**  And my brother and I and our families have now taken over.  
**0:03:55-0:04:00:**  So that's how I come to be looking after Wakelands at the moment.  
**0:04:00-0:04:04:**  And how did your father and your mother first turn to agroforestry?  
**0:04:04-0:04:06:**  How did they come across it?  
**0:04:06-0:04:12:**  So my father's working life, he'd worked mostly for the government as an agricultural scientist.  
**0:04:12-0:04:14:**  He was a plant pathologist.  
**0:04:14-0:04:18:**  He had always been interested in different ways of growing crops.  
**0:04:18-0:04:22:**  He was particularly interested in growing different sorts of crops together.  
**0:04:22-0:04:28:**  So I think when he came across agroforestry while he was still in his sort of first job,  
**0:04:28-0:04:31:**  it stuck in his mind as something he would like to try.  
**0:04:31-0:04:33:**  But at that point, it was too innovative.  
**0:04:33-0:04:37:**  It was too cutting edge for the sort of government funded research and so on.  
**0:04:37-0:04:43:**  So it had to wait until he had his own retirement project, his own retirement piece of land  
**0:04:43-0:04:46:**  to really give it a go.  
**0:04:46-0:04:51:**  And maybe you can give us a bit of a sense of the size of the farm and a bit of your  
**0:04:51-0:04:54:**  climate and local context.  
**0:04:54-0:05:00:**  So Wakelands is in Suffolk, in East Anglia, within England, within the UK.  
**0:05:00-0:05:08:**  East Anglia is possibly the most substantial arable agricultural area in the UK.  
**0:05:08-0:05:09:**  It's very flat.  
**0:05:09-0:05:11:**  It's got a relatively good climate.  
**0:05:11-0:05:13:**  It's got good soils.  
**0:05:13-0:05:19:**  And so there's a lot of cereal crops, sugar beet and so on, grown in East Anglia.  
**0:05:19-0:05:20:**  The Wicklands sits within that.  
**0:05:20-0:05:27:**  And when Anne and Martin bought it, it was a farmhouse with some meadows and a farmyard.  
**0:05:27-0:05:30:**  They then bought two further fields.  
**0:05:30-0:05:38:**  Those fields at the time were just in a traditional sort of modern chemical supported agriculture  
**0:05:38-0:05:39:**  system.  
**0:05:39-0:05:43:**  And so they then ended up with a total area of about 26 hectares.  
**0:05:43-0:05:49:**  So it's not an exaggeration, I think, to say that Wakelands is now literally an oasis in  
**0:05:49-0:05:53:**  the middle of the East Anglian farming prairie.  
**0:05:53-0:05:57:**  If you see an aerial photograph, we've got an aerial photograph on our website, for example,  
**0:05:57-0:06:01:**  you look at an aerial photograph, you really see that very distinctly.  
**0:06:01-0:06:05:**  That's something with Dimitri that we really, I mean, we talked a lot about it because when  
**0:06:05-0:06:10:**  we first found your farm and when we were contacting you, like the images are absolutely  
**0:06:10-0:06:11:**  spectacular.  
**0:06:11-0:06:16:**  So I'd recommend anyone going to see these beautiful, in some cases, 25 year old trees.  
**0:06:16-0:06:22:**  So you mentioned kind of the past and how your father and your mother set up the project  
**0:06:22-0:06:24:**  and where they were coming from with that.  
**0:06:24-0:06:28:**  But now that you've taken over, what does the farm look like today?  
**0:06:28-0:06:30:**  Are you selling some produce?  
**0:06:30-0:06:34:**  And if so, who are your customers?  
**0:06:34-0:06:42:**  So my parents were most particularly concentrated on the sort of research approach to things.  
**0:06:42-0:06:46:**  So my dad in particular was very interested in growing things in very small areas to do  
**0:06:46-0:06:47:**  comparisons.  
**0:06:47-0:06:53:**  So if you'd come here when he was really at his busiest, you'd have seen a patchwork of  
**0:06:53-0:06:57:**  tiny areas of different crops growing alongside each other, different combinations of things,  
**0:06:57-0:07:02:**  because he was very much still doing it as a scientific research project.  
**0:07:02-0:07:05:**  And indeed, he had collaborators based here from the Organic Research Centre for some  
**0:07:05-0:07:06:**  years working with him.  
**0:07:06-0:07:13:**  So there was a lot of sort of serious agricultural science done here over those years.  
**0:07:13-0:07:18:**  We, my brother and our families, we're not agricultural scientists, so we're not in a  
**0:07:18-0:07:21:**  position to carry on with that hardcore science.  
**0:07:21-0:07:25:**  But what we are doing is carrying on with the organic rotation agroforestry.  
**0:07:25-0:07:29:**  So the tree lines are still very much there and we're looking after the tree lines and  
**0:07:29-0:07:32:**  then the crop alleys in between.  
**0:07:32-0:07:35:**  Again, we're farming those with a variety of different things.  
**0:07:35-0:07:42:**  So the next phase really looks like Wakelands as not so much a research centre, but more  
**0:07:42-0:07:45:**  of a demonstration site.  
**0:07:45-0:07:50:**  It's possibly not big enough to be sort of seriously commercial in scale, but we're absolutely  
**0:07:50-0:07:54:**  going to make a go of it running as an organic agroforestry site, but with other things going  
**0:07:54-0:07:55:**  on on the site.  
**0:07:55-0:07:59:**  And that's really the important thing for us because we are very interested in not just  
**0:07:59-0:08:04:**  the sort of technical science and agronomy of the growing of the crops, we're interested  
**0:08:04-0:08:08:**  in what happens to the produce afterwards and the people being involved and so on.  
**0:08:08-0:08:15:**  So we are looking at getting people onto the site to enjoy it, to work with the fields,  
**0:08:15-0:08:20:**  to appreciate where the food comes from and most importantly, to then process the food.  
**0:08:20-0:08:26:**  So we're looking to set up on site a bakery and cooking facilities, accommodation for  
**0:08:26-0:08:28:**  people to come and stay.  
**0:08:28-0:08:33:**  And we're doing a lot, for example, with social media to connect people with the way in which  
**0:08:33-0:08:34:**  their food is grown.  
**0:08:34-0:08:36:**  I think we think the time is absolutely right.  
**0:08:36-0:08:40:**  People are interested in how their food is grown and where it's grown.  
**0:08:40-0:08:44:**  And so we're making collaborations with people and bringing people and organizations to the  
**0:08:44-0:08:49:**  site who want to run courses, who want to get involved so that it becomes, as I say,  
**0:08:49-0:08:55:**  very much of a demonstration site and not just a sort of behind the scenes growing site.  
**0:08:55-0:09:01:**  We'll definitely come back to that because we're very interested to understand that transition  
**0:09:01-0:09:02:**  from a strategic level.  
**0:09:02-0:09:07:**  But maybe before we go into more detail, maybe you could give us an overview of the different  
**0:09:07-0:09:14:**  systems you have on the farm and then we'll kind of dig in deeper to maybe the most relevant  
**0:09:14-0:09:15:**  ones.  
**0:09:15-0:09:18:**  But I think it's useful for everyone to see a bit of the diversity of what you do.  
**0:09:18-0:09:26:**  Okay, so Wakelands is about a total area of about 26 hectares, so 56 acres.  
**0:09:26-0:09:32:**  If you ignore the sort of farmhouse area and a couple of meadows, the rest of it is divided  
**0:09:32-0:09:34:**  into alleys.  
**0:09:34-0:09:37:**  The alleys all run north-south.  
**0:09:37-0:09:42:**  They vary in width between about 12 meters and about 18 meters.  
**0:09:42-0:09:46:**  And each alley is separated then by a belt of trees.  
**0:09:46-0:09:51:**  There are, so that's the sort of organic, that's the agroforestry structure.  
**0:09:51-0:09:57:**  There are, broadly speaking, four different areas within Wakelands.  
**0:09:57-0:10:02:**  One area, the tree lines are all hazel trees, hazel wood.  
**0:10:02-0:10:06:**  They're coppiced on a roughly seven year cycle.  
**0:10:06-0:10:08:**  Each alley copies in a different year.  
**0:10:08-0:10:13:**  So that produces a lot of wood for fencing and other construction purposes.  
**0:10:13-0:10:16:**  And then the remainder of that is used as chip for biomass.  
**0:10:16-0:10:20:**  And then we have a second area, which is willow, again, coppiced this time on a three year  
**0:10:20-0:10:21:**  cycle.  
**0:10:21-0:10:24:**  Again, used for fencing and hedging and so on.  
**0:10:24-0:10:27:**  And then the remainder chipped for biomass for a boiler.  
**0:10:27-0:10:32:**  And then we have the two probably more interesting areas, one of which is the oldest area planted  
**0:10:32-0:10:38:**  in 1994, which are essentially semi-hardwood timber trees.  
**0:10:38-0:10:42:**  Although there's also some things like cherries in there, which can be both fruiting and a  
**0:10:42-0:10:44:**  timber crop.  
**0:10:44-0:10:49:**  So they are now more than 25 years old and quite substantial trees.  
**0:10:49-0:10:53:**  And then we have the last area, they're all roughly the same area in size.  
**0:10:53-0:10:59:**  The last area, the tree alleys are a complete mixture of fruit and other trees.  
**0:10:59-0:11:04:**  So we've got in excess of 50 different sorts of apple tree, pears, lots of different sorts  
**0:11:04-0:11:13:**  of plums, cherries, apricots, figs, a whole range of different things growing in those  
**0:11:13-0:11:14:**  tree lines.  
**0:11:14-0:11:23:**  Also we have the combination of productive alleys where we grow wheat, lentils, squash,  
**0:11:23-0:11:26:**  oats, other similar sorts of crops.  
**0:11:26-0:11:32:**  And then the very productive tree lines, which are producing a timber crop or a wood crop,  
**0:11:32-0:11:35:**  but also a very variable food crop.  
**0:11:35-0:11:39:**  So there's lots of different produce coming from the farm in different ways and throughout  
**0:11:39-0:11:41:**  the year.  
**0:11:41-0:11:47:**  So David, we wanted to go into some more depth in some of these systems that you've described  
**0:11:47-0:11:48:**  now.  
**0:11:48-0:11:56:**  For example, when you talk about the copy-sink system, what are you growing in between the  
**0:11:56-0:11:58:**  copy-sink lines?  
**0:11:58-0:12:04:**  So broadly speaking, all of the alleys between the tree lines are equivalent in terms of  
**0:12:04-0:12:06:**  different crops we grow in there.  
**0:12:06-0:12:13:**  So those areas are divided for management purposes into 10 areas.  
**0:12:13-0:12:18:**  And then we're running an organic rotation around those 10 areas on a roughly four-year  
**0:12:18-0:12:19:**  cycle.  
**0:12:19-0:12:24:**  So at only one point, any particular alley will be 50% of the time is going to be in  
**0:12:24-0:12:28:**  a grass clover lay or similar.  
**0:12:28-0:12:31:**  And then 50% of the time is going to be a crop.  
**0:12:31-0:12:37:**  Those crops, as I say, the last couple of years we've grown wheat, some barley, some  
**0:12:37-0:12:41:**  oats, lentils, squash, and so on.  
**0:12:41-0:12:45:**  I think we're going to diversify a bit in the coming year.  
**0:12:45-0:12:48:**  And really it's just part of the organic rotation as to what gets grown in which alley.  
**0:12:48-0:12:54:**  So any of those things could be grown in the hazel alleys or in the willow alleys or in  
**0:12:54-0:12:55:**  the fruit tree alleys.  
**0:12:55-0:13:01:**  There's a little bit of a variation on that because the oldest alleys where the trees  
**0:13:01-0:13:07:**  are the oldest, and they're therefore the tallest, also happen to be the narrowest ones.  
**0:13:07-0:13:10:**  So they're the only ones where we have a bit of an issue with sunshine in daylight.  
**0:13:10-0:13:16:**  So those alleys are not so good for, for example, the lentils, which need a bit more sunshine.  
**0:13:16-0:13:19:**  But broadly speaking, we could be growing any of the things in any of the alleys in  
**0:13:19-0:13:20:**  the system.  
**0:13:20-0:13:24:**  So if you look at it long term, you'll just see them cycling around.  
**0:13:24-0:13:29:**  You brought up a really interesting point here about the interaction between the crops  
**0:13:29-0:13:31:**  and the trees.  
**0:13:31-0:13:35:**  And that's something that we wanted to dig deeper in.  
**0:13:35-0:13:40:**  Do you see that in different systems, for example, the copy-sink system compared to  
**0:13:40-0:13:46:**  the older timber tree producing system, do you see different performances in the intercrop?  
**0:13:46-0:13:51:**  Is there differences based on, for example, the light or?  
**0:13:51-0:13:56:**  Yes, so I'm not the scientist, so I'm not in a position to sort of comment on the mechanics.  
**0:13:56-0:14:02:**  But I do, for example, just this year, we grew some lentils in a relatively open field  
**0:14:02-0:14:10:**  situation, and some lentils in the alleys between the willow copy-sink.  
**0:14:10-0:14:15:**  And they ripened roughly two weeks apart, even though they were the same lentils planted  
**0:14:15-0:14:16:**  at the same time.  
**0:14:16-0:14:21:**  So we see quite distinct differences in that kind of way.  
**0:14:21-0:14:25:**  What the mechanisms for that are, I don't know, but there's definitely variations depending  
**0:14:25-0:14:28:**  on where we're growing it and in what conditions.  
**0:14:28-0:14:35:**  So with the lentils here, was there a difference in quantity of lentil being produced based  
**0:14:35-0:14:41:**  on the different systems, or was it the same?  
**0:14:41-0:14:42:**  We haven't yet done the calculations.  
**0:14:42-0:14:47:**  In fact, the last batch of lentils were only harvested yesterday afternoon.  
**0:14:47-0:14:51:**  So you'll have to come back to me on that one, I'm afraid.  
**0:14:51-0:14:52:**  OK, no, that's fine.  
**0:14:52-0:14:56:**  And how are you managing the trees?  
**0:14:56-0:15:02:**  If we zoom into the timber production area, are you managing the trees in a certain way,  
**0:15:02-0:15:08:**  for example, to get light through better or to optimise the amount of timber produced?  
**0:15:08-0:15:11:**  So most of those trees are now managed by being pollarded.  
**0:15:11-0:15:18:**  So they're pollarded periodically at a height of about three, three and a half metres.  
**0:15:18-0:15:23:**  That's partly to stimulate growth, but also the choice of pollarding rather than coppicing  
**0:15:23-0:15:29:**  is at least in part because it means that the lower part of the tree is therefore narrower.  
**0:15:29-0:15:33:**  And so it intrudes less into the cropping area so that the growth of the tree doesn't  
**0:15:33-0:15:39:**  really start until a height above the way you would have machinery and so on.  
**0:15:39-0:15:43:**  So that's been the broad approach to the managing of those trees.  
**0:15:43-0:15:47:**  I think it's also fair to say that some of the trees.  
**0:15:47-0:15:52:**  So, for example, the cherry trees haven't been possibly managed as well as they might  
**0:15:52-0:15:58:**  be because I think my parents were never quite clear whether they wanted to maximise the  
**0:15:58-0:16:00:**  cherry crop or they wanted to maximise the timber crop.  
**0:16:00-0:16:04:**  And slightly we ended up with a bit of a compromise.  
**0:16:04-0:16:08:**  So this year, for example, we had some very big, fantastic cherry trees with huge crops  
**0:16:08-0:16:09:**  of cherries on them.  
**0:16:09-0:16:13:**  But because the trees are so big, we weren't able to pick anything like, well, even only  
**0:16:13-0:16:17:**  perhaps 25% of the crop because the trees are so big.  
**0:16:17-0:16:21:**  So had they been managed for fruit, they'd have been managed differently over the years,  
**0:16:21-0:16:24:**  but it's now probably too late.  
**0:16:24-0:16:30:**  But just the question about that then is, how would you manage for fruit production  
**0:16:30-0:16:35:**  while keeping them low enough for harvest, but without impeding on the machinery?  
**0:16:35-0:16:38:**  Yeah, I think that's probably a challenge.  
**0:16:38-0:16:45:**  So, but I suspect you could keep them big enough to be out of the way of tractors and  
**0:16:45-0:16:50:**  so on, and yet still small enough to be picked from ordinary ladders or ordinary equipment,  
**0:16:50-0:16:54:**  whereas some of our trees now are 10, 15 metres tall.  
**0:16:54-0:16:59:**  And so you'd need very specialist equipment to be picking the cherries in those trees.  
**0:16:59-0:17:03:**  But those systems, so the mature cherry trees are distinct from the orchard.  
**0:17:03-0:17:09:**  So I'm assuming that in the orchards you've been managing, taking into account more production  
**0:17:09-0:17:10:**  in that case.  
**0:17:10-0:17:18:**  Yes, I think it's that maybe that sounds a bit too thought through, because actually  
**0:17:18-0:17:22:**  the orchard, what you're calling the orchard trees, and they're not, it's not an orchard  
**0:17:22-0:17:24:**  in the sense it's not densely packed with trees.  
**0:17:24-0:17:28:**  It's fairly, by orchard standards, it's still very low density of fruit trees.  
**0:17:28-0:17:30:**  But those trees are much younger.  
**0:17:30-0:17:36:**  So the issues about size and height are questions for the future really.  
**0:17:36-0:17:41:**  And talking about density, we mentioned the interline, but on a line, what would be the  
**0:17:41-0:17:46:**  typical spacing between trees?  
**0:17:46-0:17:50:**  So they are, they started out being about eight to 10 metres apart.  
**0:17:50-0:17:53:**  But there's been a fair amount of natural reseeding.  
**0:17:53-0:17:59:**  So for example, quite a lot of self seeded cherry trees around the main cherry trees.  
**0:17:59-0:18:05:**  And then we've done a certain amount of infilling both with new trees, but also with things  
**0:18:05-0:18:08:**  like fruit currant bushes and things like that.  
**0:18:08-0:18:12:**  So it's quite variable.  
**0:18:12-0:18:15:**  So you felt the need to densify the lines then?  
**0:18:15-0:18:16:**  Why was that the case?  
**0:18:16-0:18:19:**  It's not so much densify.  
**0:18:19-0:18:24:**  It's more a question of taking advantage of the spaces because where we've got relatively  
**0:18:24-0:18:29:**  young apple trees and cherry trees and so on, which are eight to 10 metres apart, there  
**0:18:29-0:18:33:**  are obvious gaps between them, which even if it's only for the short term, we can grow  
**0:18:33-0:18:39:**  gooseberries or red currants or black currants or similar things or rhubarb, other interesting  
**0:18:39-0:18:42:**  fruit and food to eat.  
**0:18:42-0:18:46:**  They may not survive the long term when the trees grow up, but certainly for a few years,  
**0:18:46-0:18:50:**  we can have other things in the system.  
**0:18:50-0:18:55:**  And so in this orchard, as you've let it densify, that's also let less light come in, right?  
**0:18:55-0:18:58:**  So you've decided to make compromise more in the direction of the fruit instead of the  
**0:18:58-0:18:59:**  winter crop?  
**0:18:59-0:19:06:**  I think that if you the area we're talking about, the trees are still that much smaller  
**0:19:06-0:19:09:**  and the alleys are slightly further apart anyway.  
**0:19:09-0:19:14:**  So we're not anywhere close yet to the kind of compromise that you're talking about.  
**0:19:14-0:19:18:**  The area where that compromise starts to happen is really only in the trees where there are  
**0:19:18-0:19:24:**  timber trees that are 25, 26 years old.  
**0:19:24-0:19:27:**  We're at the point where we're getting to the point where we need to make decisions  
**0:19:27-0:19:30:**  about the fruit trees as to how we manage them going forward.  
**0:19:30-0:19:34:**  But we're not, I don't think, at the point yet where they're causing any issues because  
**0:19:34-0:19:40:**  the alleys in that area are probably 15, 16 meters wide and the trees are still relatively  
**0:19:40-0:19:43:**  small.  
**0:19:43-0:19:48:**  So what if you compare it to the more mature system, you'd say that it's around 25 years  
**0:19:48-0:19:52:**  that you start to see a real compromise between the intercrop and the tree?  
**0:19:52-0:19:55:**  I don't know when you'd say it started.  
**0:19:55-0:20:00:**  When you say it's a compromise, it's only a compromise for some things.  
**0:20:00-0:20:03:**  So it's a compromise, for example, if you wanted to grow lentils, but not necessarily  
**0:20:03-0:20:06:**  if you wanted to grow other things.  
**0:20:06-0:20:11:**  I wouldn't want to say when that started to happen, I'm just not in a position to say,  
**0:20:11-0:20:16:**  but we're now at the point where we definitely have that issue.  
**0:20:16-0:20:18:**  I think it's also a good issue to have.  
**0:20:18-0:20:20:**  Yes, we're not complaining.  
**0:20:20-0:20:23:**  We're not complaining.  
**0:20:23-0:20:30:**  And so I imagine that pollarding in the timber area that you mentioned earlier on must have  
**0:20:30-0:20:37:**  a quite a big impact on the ecological dynamic of the system in terms of the light and also  
**0:20:37-0:20:38:**  the wind, right?  
**0:20:38-0:20:44:**  Could you maybe explain to us how that changed the management as well of the system?  
**0:20:44-0:20:50:**  Yeah, so I guess I wasn't around when they first decided to do the pollarding.  
**0:20:50-0:20:57:**  Certainly the shapes of the trees now are very distinctive and there's a lot of very  
**0:20:57-0:21:02:**  solid growth, very high up above the ground.  
**0:21:02-0:21:06:**  And then they're being maintained, some of them have been repollarded.  
**0:21:06-0:21:10:**  And then it really varies from one type of tree to another, quite what the effect of  
**0:21:10-0:21:11:**  that is.  
**0:21:11-0:21:14:**  So I think there's a lot of variability in the way that that's responded, which is partly  
**0:21:14-0:21:18:**  a function of the fact that there's a lot of variability in the tree system in Wakelands,  
**0:21:18-0:21:24:**  which is both a sort of successful feature of the system, but also I'm sure leads to  
**0:21:24-0:21:29:**  a certain amount of compromise and so on.  
**0:21:29-0:21:33:**  I wanted to ask something before, because we've opened a really interesting door there  
**0:21:33-0:21:39:**  on talking about diversity, but before I just wanted to ask, you mentioned that it's a problem  
**0:21:39-0:21:42:**  for growing lentils in those more mature systems.  
**0:21:42-0:21:45:**  Does that mean that some other crops are more shade tolerant?  
**0:21:45-0:21:47:**  And if so, which?  
**0:21:47-0:21:56:**  Yes, so for example, next year we're planning on growing a wheat crop in those alleys because  
**0:21:56-0:22:02:**  we're optimistic that wheat crop will be successful in a way that three or four years ago, my  
**0:22:02-0:22:05:**  father grew a lentil crop and it struggled with a lack of sunshine.  
**0:22:05-0:22:14:**  So we haven't done a sort of specific scientific assessment of the issues, but we have a sort  
**0:22:14-0:22:18:**  of practical experience that we're basing our decisions on.  
**0:22:18-0:22:23:**  And the fact that you have, let's say, a transforming and mature system now, does it make you consider  
**0:22:23-0:22:28:**  sometimes for example, moving away from arable crops and let's say, including chickens or  
**0:22:28-0:22:29:**  animals?  
**0:22:29-0:22:33:**  Is that a kind of transition in the strategy?  
**0:22:33-0:22:38:**  So we are looking at two things, I suppose, in that direction at the moment.  
**0:22:38-0:22:42:**  We are looking at reintroducing some intensive horticulture.  
**0:22:42-0:22:48:**  I say reintroducing because my mother and another woman did intensive horticulture in  
**0:22:48-0:22:53:**  some of the alleys for several years a few years ago, but then my mother became ill as  
**0:22:53-0:22:54:**  she was older.  
**0:22:54-0:22:56:**  So that stopped.  
**0:22:56-0:23:00:**  But we are looking to reintroduce that in at least two alleys next year.  
**0:23:00-0:23:06:**  We're talking to two different groups of growers who will probably each take over an alley  
**0:23:06-0:23:12:**  within what you're calling the orchard, although it's very low density.  
**0:23:12-0:23:16:**  They will each use slightly different systems to grow intensive horticulture, vegetables  
**0:23:16-0:23:18:**  and so on.  
**0:23:18-0:23:23:**  One of them is going to operate a no dig system and the other is going to do a more conventional  
**0:23:23-0:23:26:**  system and we'll see how that all goes.  
**0:23:26-0:23:30:**  So that's one area in which we're diversifying the nature of what we're growing and indeed  
**0:23:30-0:23:33:**  the way we're growing it because that will be their enterprises that are self-contained  
**0:23:33-0:23:36:**  their businesses.  
**0:23:36-0:23:40:**  We are absolutely looking at or not looking at interested in having some animals.  
**0:23:40-0:23:44:**  There have been chickens here before.  
**0:23:44-0:23:46:**  We're less likely to get on that route, but we're very interested, for example, in trying  
**0:23:46-0:23:48:**  some sheep.  
**0:23:48-0:23:52:**  We think it could be quite exciting to have some electric fencing that we can move around  
**0:23:52-0:23:57:**  the farm, that we can put around two or three alleys at a time and have a small flock of  
**0:23:57-0:24:03:**  sheep who graze on the clover grass in the alleys and also but also on the grass that's  
**0:24:03-0:24:05:**  in the tree lines.  
**0:24:05-0:24:07:**  And then we can move them around with the rotation.  
**0:24:07-0:24:13:**  The problem we've got with that is partly what a scale but also partly our land is very  
**0:24:13-0:24:14:**  wet clay.  
**0:24:14-0:24:17:**  So we wouldn't have any suitable winter pasture.  
**0:24:17-0:24:23:**  So we can only make that work really if we can collaborate with somebody else who has  
**0:24:23-0:24:28:**  winter quarters for their sheep and is looking for extra summer pasture.  
**0:24:28-0:24:31:**  But if we can find that collaboration, then we'd be very interested in introducing some  
**0:24:31-0:24:33:**  sheep into our system.  
**0:24:33-0:24:38:**  I was going to say, I think that's a recurring theme because we have the exact but opposite  
**0:24:38-0:24:43:**  problem in Greece, where we really wanted sheep to manage the pasture in the winter,  
**0:24:43-0:24:46:**  but then didn't have any appropriate pasture in the summer because of drought.  
**0:24:46-0:24:53:**  So I feel like building these kind of partnerships with local farmers is like the key to diversification  
**0:24:53-0:24:55:**  and including animals in orchards.  
**0:24:55-0:24:57:**  Go ahead, Dimitri.  
**0:24:57-0:24:59:**  I was going to ask about the scale.  
**0:24:59-0:25:03:**  You mentioned now that you had a problem of scale for the sheep.  
**0:25:03-0:25:06:**  Could you just elaborate on that a bit more?  
**0:25:06-0:25:13:**  So yes, so what I mean by having a scale question on sheep is if we are rotating the sheep around  
**0:25:13-0:25:20:**  within our system and also our system is such that at any one time half the land roughly  
**0:25:20-0:25:29:**  is in crops and half the land is in an organic lay, the actual area we have the sheep and  
**0:25:29-0:25:31:**  the number of sheep we could have is probably quite a small number.  
**0:25:31-0:25:36:**  So whether that makes for a viable flock of the kind which could produce, for example,  
**0:25:36-0:25:41:**  enough milk to make sheep's cheese is something we're looking at.  
**0:25:41-0:25:45:**  If it could, then great, we'll definitely have a go at that.  
**0:25:45-0:25:46:**  That's what I mean by scale.  
**0:25:46-0:25:52:**  It's whether we've got a big enough area allowing for the rotation to have a sustainable flock.  
**0:25:52-0:25:53:**  That makes sense.  
**0:25:53-0:25:59:**  And continuing the, I wanted to ask if there's a third option in those areas, especially  
**0:25:59-0:26:05:**  looking at the timber trees, which now are about 25 years, are you considering harvesting  
**0:26:05-0:26:11:**  them for wood and restarting the system or maybe have you got a succession there already  
**0:26:11-0:26:12:**  going on?  
**0:26:12-0:26:18:**  So well, the willows and the hazels are already harvested for wood.  
**0:26:18-0:26:23:**  We have a good wood crop.  
**0:26:23-0:26:28:**  So a lot of hazel staves we've sold last year, three and a half thousand.  
**0:26:28-0:26:33:**  We've got a guy who wants 10,000 next year of hazel staves, which he uses as a fencing  
**0:26:33-0:26:34:**  product.  
**0:26:34-0:26:40:**  In terms of the older trees, the timber trees, we've had trees that have been felled because  
**0:26:40-0:26:47:**  of disease or because of wind damage or whatever, which have generated a timber crop.  
**0:26:47-0:26:52:**  I don't think we've yet had any where there's been a planned felling of a tree which has  
**0:26:52-0:26:57:**  reached a maturity such that you're actually filling it for a timber crop in an elective  
**0:26:57-0:26:58:**  way.  
**0:26:58-0:27:00:**  That may well come.  
**0:27:00-0:27:04:**  So we're not yet at the point where we're recycling or infilling for planned reasons,  
**0:27:04-0:27:11:**  but there's been a certain amount of that for, as I say, damage and disease responses.  
**0:27:11-0:27:17:**  And I just wanted to ask out of curiosity, just maybe concluding the section on animals.  
**0:27:17-0:27:21:**  I felt like a reluctance on your behalf on chickens.  
**0:27:21-0:27:25:**  Is that based on that past experience with chickens that didn't go so well or what is  
**0:27:25-0:27:26:**  that based on?  
**0:27:26-0:27:30:**  That's it based on, that's a good question.  
**0:27:30-0:27:36:**  I just suspect that a chicken enterprise takes a lot more organisation and oversight than  
**0:27:36-0:27:38:**  we're currently able to give.  
**0:27:38-0:27:44:**  So I wouldn't rule out the possibility, but it's not in our wish list at the moment.  
**0:27:44-0:27:50:**  It also seems to be the case that you can consider putting in sheep because the trees  
**0:27:50-0:27:54:**  already mature and they won't be causing damage, right?  
**0:27:54-0:27:56:**  Otherwise chickens would be a more interesting option.  
**0:27:56-0:27:57:**  Sure.  
**0:27:57-0:27:58:**  Well, yeah, so certainly, certainly.  
**0:27:58-0:28:03:**  I mean, that is one of the advantages of having the old system is that we can include the  
**0:28:03-0:28:08:**  tree lines within the sheep area and be reasonably confident that sheep won't eat the trees.  
**0:28:08-0:28:14:**  So that's a bonus of the age of the whole project.  
**0:28:14-0:28:18:**  What's your, in your experience with the different intercrops, not especially, what's the difference  
**0:28:18-0:28:22:**  between a pollarding system and a copy-sink system?  
**0:28:22-0:28:26:**  How does that interact with what's happening in between the lines?  
**0:28:26-0:28:33:**  So where the trees are coppiced, obviously the new growth starts from the ground and  
**0:28:33-0:28:37:**  so they become very bushy at ground level.  
**0:28:37-0:28:42:**  And so they tend to be, that makes for a much wider tree alley.  
**0:28:42-0:28:44:**  Where they've been pollarded, then obviously the new growth starts at the point at which  
**0:28:44-0:28:45:**  you pollarded.  
**0:28:45-0:28:52:**  So you get, the growth is much higher and therefore away from machinery and so on.  
**0:28:52-0:28:58:**  So the lines where we have mature trees that have been pollarded, there's a lot of sort  
**0:28:58-0:29:03:**  of undergrowth below them, brambles and grass and small bushes and so on.  
**0:29:03-0:29:08:**  Whereas the tree lines, which have been coppiced, so the hazel and the willow, basically they  
**0:29:08-0:29:16:**  are solidly hazel or solidly willow down to ground level with less other growth in and  
**0:29:16-0:29:19:**  around the trees.  
**0:29:19-0:29:24:**  So one system, the pollarding system reaches higher, it goes up higher and the pollarding  
**0:29:24-0:29:27:**  system is more compact and lower.  
**0:29:27-0:29:30:**  Yes, so if you look to the pollarding system, what you're basically looking at is trees.  
**0:29:30-0:29:34:**  Whereas if you look at the coppicing system, it looks like hedges.  
**0:29:34-0:29:35:**  It's quite a different visual appearance.  
**0:29:35-0:29:40:**  Whereas with the coppicing system, you're getting a lot of growth close to the ground  
**0:29:40-0:29:49:**  in a way that is then good in subsequent years for mechanically harvesting to get either  
**0:29:49-0:29:55:**  timber for hedging and so on or timber for biomass chipping.  
**0:29:55-0:30:02:**  And you use a machine to harvest the willow and the hazelnut hedges, right?  
**0:30:02-0:30:06:**  Yeah, so they've used different technologies over the years.  
**0:30:06-0:30:13:**  Just in the last two years, two years ago, we were using what is effectively a very large  
**0:30:13-0:30:18:**  circular saw blade on a hydraulic arm from a tractor.  
**0:30:18-0:30:23:**  It's almost like a giant sort of domestic brush cutter.  
**0:30:23-0:30:28:**  And that was run along horizontally, let's say 30 centimetres above the ground.  
**0:30:28-0:30:31:**  So cut the crown very close to ground.  
**0:30:31-0:30:35:**  The advantage of that was it was very quick because you could just run the machine along.  
**0:30:35-0:30:42:**  The disadvantage was that what you then cut fell in every different direction.  
**0:30:42-0:30:47:**  So there was then a processing operation to get them all lined up in order to handle them,  
**0:30:47-0:30:50:**  stack them, move them and so on.  
**0:30:50-0:30:56:**  This last year, we used a different system, which was a different machine, which had an  
**0:30:56-0:31:03:**  enormous hydraulic sort of hand, I suppose you'd call it, which grabbed the willow or  
**0:31:03-0:31:09:**  the hazelnut almost in bunches and held a bunch of, let's say, 30 or so stems at one  
**0:31:09-0:31:13:**  time and then had a cutter that cut through the stems.  
**0:31:13-0:31:16:**  And then the hydraulic arm was able to lay them on the ground neatly.  
**0:31:16-0:31:20:**  So the result of that was, although it was slower to do the cutting, it meant we had  
**0:31:20-0:31:26:**  a very neatly laid line of cut timber that could then be handled and processed much more  
**0:31:26-0:31:27:**  quickly.  
**0:31:27-0:31:31:**  So different techniques have been applied with different pros and cons.  
**0:31:31-0:31:38:**  And taking into account the use of machinery and how practical it might be, do you have  
**0:31:38-0:31:43:**  a preference between a coppiced or a pollarded system in terms of managing the hole?  
**0:31:43-0:31:47:**  I'm thinking in terms of practicality, but I'm also thinking maybe in terms of the shade  
**0:31:47-0:31:48:**  it produces.  
**0:31:48-0:31:53:**  Well, certainly when it comes to the managing, the trees that we're managing by pollarding  
**0:31:53-0:31:58:**  are all larger, semi-hardwood timber trees.  
**0:31:58-0:32:04:**  And the management of that, the pollarding is all done by chainsaws and ladders.  
**0:32:04-0:32:07:**  And so it's essentially a pruning operation.  
**0:32:07-0:32:10:**  And the material that comes off that is obviously very difficult to handle because it's very  
**0:32:10-0:32:13:**  sort of random bits of branch.  
**0:32:13-0:32:17:**  Whereas what's coming off the coppicing system, because we're coppicing and have been coppicing  
**0:32:17-0:32:24:**  the same willow and hazel for many years, what's coming off there are straight growths.  
**0:32:24-0:32:28:**  They're three, four, five metres long.  
**0:32:28-0:32:36:**  When we coppice them and they are straight pieces of wood, let's say 30 millimetres in  
**0:32:36-0:32:41:**  diameter that are optimised for completely different uses.  
**0:32:41-0:32:45:**  So really they're different techniques for completely different things.  
**0:32:45-0:32:50:**  But is it easier, for example, in a pollarded system to control the amount of shade produced?  
**0:32:50-0:32:54:**  Yeah, I mean, the pollarded trees, because you're only pollarding them at three metres  
**0:32:54-0:32:57:**  above the ground, the growth then goes above three metres.  
**0:32:57-0:32:59:**  So they're much bigger trees.  
**0:32:59-0:33:04:**  So they're always going to create a lot more shade because you've only started the coppicing  
**0:33:04-0:33:05:**  three metres from the ground.  
**0:33:05-0:33:07:**  So they're going to be that much taller.  
**0:33:07-0:33:12:**  Whereas the coppice trees are coppiced, you know, when they're cut, they're cut to 100  
**0:33:12-0:33:14:**  mil from the ground, let's say not much more than that.  
**0:33:14-0:33:18:**  So when they're very short, they're really no shade at all.  
**0:33:18-0:33:21:**  And even when they're longest, they're only three metres tall.  
**0:33:21-0:33:28:**  So they're really quite different approaches for the different uses.  
**0:33:28-0:33:34:**  And so one of the things that comes out with the way that you manage the coppicing is that  
**0:33:34-0:33:35:**  you need to get a tractor in.  
**0:33:35-0:33:41:**  And so how does that, how does the management and the mechanisation interfere with the intercrop  
**0:33:41-0:33:42:**  as well?  
**0:33:42-0:33:47:**  Is it something, can you only enter the space in the interline in certain specific times?  
**0:33:47-0:33:52:**  Does it mean that it limits the types of crops that you have to choose as well?  
**0:33:52-0:33:56:**  Yes, I mean, certainly it means you can only go at certain times.  
**0:33:56-0:34:07:**  But at any one point in the system, we have an organic lay in half the land anyway.  
**0:34:07-0:34:11:**  So I mean, this year, the organic lay was in half of the willow area and all of the  
**0:34:11-0:34:12:**  hazel area.  
**0:34:12-0:34:16:**  So access to that was easy because you can just drive on it when it's dry.  
**0:34:16-0:34:22:**  Obviously, it's a bit more of a challenge if you've got a crop in the lines between  
**0:34:22-0:34:23:**  the coppicing.  
**0:34:23-0:34:29:**  As it happens this year, we were growing lentils in that area.  
**0:34:29-0:34:34:**  So that was relatively straightforward because it was an organic lay over the winter.  
**0:34:34-0:34:38:**  And so we could do the coppicing during the winter and then the lentils were planted in  
**0:34:38-0:34:39:**  the spring.  
**0:34:39-0:34:40:**  So that wasn't an issue.  
**0:34:40-0:34:44:**  If you were growing a winter wheat crop, then it would be a bit more of a challenge because  
**0:34:44-0:34:49:**  you wouldn't be able to coppice in that winter in that area.  
**0:34:49-0:34:53:**  So I think it's just a question of being a bit adaptable depending on what the crop choices  
**0:34:53-0:34:54:**  are.  
**0:34:54-0:35:01:**  But we are kind of coppicing some areas every year on different cycles so that we have a  
**0:35:01-0:35:05:**  coppiced willow crop and a coppiced hazel crop every year.  
**0:35:05-0:35:11:**  But at the same time, they're always regrowing over time.  
**0:35:11-0:35:16:**  And taking some of the similar question of how do you synchronize cycles, but applying  
**0:35:16-0:35:21:**  it more to the orchard, I'm assuming at some point you have to go into the fruit trees  
**0:35:21-0:35:24:**  and harvest their fruits.  
**0:35:24-0:35:28:**  Do you find that it's hard then not to have access maybe with not being able to go into  
**0:35:28-0:35:31:**  the interline and with a tractor or machinery?  
**0:35:31-0:35:34:**  Is that something that affects the harvest of fruits?  
**0:35:34-0:35:37:**  Well, we're not really using machinery for the harvesting.  
**0:35:37-0:35:39:**  The harvesting is all done by hand of the fruit.  
**0:35:39-0:35:43:**  So access isn't really a problem because you can always walk along the edge of the fields.  
**0:35:43-0:35:45:**  That's not the problem of the edge of the alleys.  
**0:35:45-0:35:46:**  That's not a problem.  
**0:35:46-0:35:49:**  And then you just use like wheelbarrows maybe to go to the end of the line.  
**0:35:49-0:35:53:**  Yeah, I mean, I suppose just thinking what we did this year, I mean, it's true that we  
**0:35:53-0:35:59:**  had, we used a tractor and trailer to move people and cherries around when we're doing  
**0:35:59-0:36:00:**  cherry picking.  
**0:36:00-0:36:03:**  That would have been more of a challenge if the alleys in question had been in the crop.  
**0:36:03-0:36:07:**  But again, you just have to think about that in terms of what you're planting and how you're  
**0:36:07-0:36:08:**  then going to deal with it.  
**0:36:08-0:36:11:**  So that's part of the fun.  
**0:36:11-0:36:12:**  Yeah.  
**0:36:12-0:36:18:**  Could you maybe explain to us some of these kind of ecological benefits that you're seeing  
**0:36:18-0:36:20:**  being provided by your systems?  
**0:36:20-0:36:22:**  I'm thinking, for example, windbreaks.  
**0:36:22-0:36:26:**  Naturally, when I saw the photos of your copy-sink system, I was just thinking, wow, those crops  
**0:36:26-0:36:27:**  in between are so tucked in.  
**0:36:27-0:36:29:**  They must be so protected from the wind.  
**0:36:29-0:36:33:**  What happens when you cut, for example, the copies in the first months of the spring when  
**0:36:33-0:36:36:**  you've got a crop there, but you've got low copy-sink systems?  
**0:36:36-0:36:38:**  How do you manage that?  
**0:36:38-0:36:39:**  Yeah.  
**0:36:39-0:36:43:**  So again, I think you'd have to talk to the ORC people, the organic research center people,  
**0:36:43-0:36:46:**  because I think they've done some work on that kind of thing.  
**0:36:46-0:36:47:**  And they've got the sort of long experience.  
**0:36:47-0:36:54:**  I mean, the only thing I would say, just picking up the way you've described it there, is that  
**0:36:54-0:37:00:**  because of the way we copy on a cycle, so in the willow, it's every three years, and  
**0:37:00-0:37:03:**  in the hazels, it's every seven.  
**0:37:03-0:37:09:**  But in the hazel rows, every row of hazel is actually a double row.  
**0:37:09-0:37:15:**  So you don't ever take out both the left and the right row, if you sort of mean, in the  
**0:37:15-0:37:16:**  same year.  
**0:37:16-0:37:21:**  So certainly in the hazels, you're never left with a bare line.  
**0:37:21-0:37:26:**  The worst you've got is, let's say, a five-year-old line and a cut-to-the-ground line, but they're  
**0:37:26-0:37:27:**  really adjacent to each other.  
**0:37:27-0:37:32:**  In the willows, we do take out the whole row of trees, but it would never be more than  
**0:37:32-0:37:35:**  that, it would never be adjacent rows because of the cycle.  
**0:37:35-0:37:39:**  So it's not as if you're suddenly opening up a huge area to the wind that wasn't opened  
**0:37:39-0:37:40:**  up before.  
**0:37:40-0:37:45:**  Of course, you're increasing the exposure slightly, but it's still all within a very  
**0:37:45-0:37:49:**  sheltered system overall.  
**0:37:49-0:37:55:**  I guess what's interesting to us is that when you start an agroforestry project or when  
**0:37:55-0:38:00:**  you read about agroforestry, there's a lot of principles and theoretical advantages.  
**0:38:00-0:38:07:**  And actually very few people are in a position to observe that from an experiential basis,  
**0:38:07-0:38:11:**  which is the case for you because the first trees were planted 25 years ago.  
**0:38:11-0:38:18:**  So without affirming anything scientifically, I guess we just wanted to have your perception  
**0:38:18-0:38:24:**  and maybe your experience of working in a system with mature agroforestry systems.  
**0:38:24-0:38:29:**  Do you feel that in a sense, it's delivering what everyone is aiming for?  
**0:38:29-0:38:34:**  Okay, without taking scientific indicators, maybe, but just in terms of biodiversity or  
**0:38:34-0:38:36:**  mitigating climate extremes.  
**0:38:36-0:38:41:**  So sure, it's certainly giving us diversity.  
**0:38:41-0:38:47:**  I suppose there's a sort of a simple anecdote based upon my father's experience from a few  
**0:38:47-0:38:54:**  years ago when he was growing potatoes and he grew potatoes in three parallel alleys.  
**0:38:54-0:39:00:**  And the farmer next door grew potatoes in a field which is about 100 acres, a bit more  
**0:39:00-0:39:07:**  than 100 hectares, but basically a vastly different scale.  
**0:39:07-0:39:11:**  And it was a particularly bad year potato blight.  
**0:39:11-0:39:18:**  We lost just one alley of potatoes essentially, but the other two were largely untouched because  
**0:39:18-0:39:24:**  of precisely the sheltering you're describing from the data blight spores.  
**0:39:24-0:39:28:**  Whereas the farmer next door essentially lost the whole field because once the blight was  
**0:39:28-0:39:30:**  blowing across the field, it blew across the whole field.  
**0:39:30-0:39:35:**  So you do see some fairly simple and occasionally quite graphically illustrated effects like  
**0:39:35-0:39:36:**  that.  
**0:39:36-0:39:37:**  Of course.  
**0:39:37-0:39:42:**  But for example, do you think the fact of, I know that some people would be afraid of  
**0:39:42-0:39:48:**  including trees because they would think it would increase, for example, maybe deers coming  
**0:39:48-0:39:52:**  and causing damage to crops.  
**0:39:52-0:39:57:**  Having trees and having mature trees around your arable crops, does it set certain challenges  
**0:39:57-0:39:59:**  as well in that respect?  
**0:39:59-0:40:00:**  So that's an interesting question.  
**0:40:00-0:40:08:**  So I won't talk about it in terms of the crops, if I may, but just in terms of the fruit.  
**0:40:08-0:40:16:**  So this year we had a big cherry crop and various people said, oh, aren't they being,  
**0:40:16-0:40:19:**  I'm going to have a terrible problem with birds.  
**0:40:19-0:40:22:**  And what was interesting was that although we do have a lot of birds because we have  
**0:40:22-0:40:28:**  a lot of trees, we didn't see any real evidence that the birds were eating the cherries.  
**0:40:28-0:40:32:**  It may be because we've got such a rich habitat, there's plenty else for them to eat.  
**0:40:32-0:40:33:**  I just don't know.  
**0:40:33-0:40:39:**  But again, with deer, we do have deer here, we have wild deer here, we have wild hares  
**0:40:39-0:40:40:**  here.  
**0:40:40-0:40:43:**  And we don't see a great deal of evidence.  
**0:40:43-0:40:47:**  We see a little bit of evidence of the deer doing some bark damage to some of the trees,  
**0:40:47-0:40:48:**  particularly the younger trees.  
**0:40:48-0:40:55:**  But we don't see any great evidence of problems with the deer in that way.  
**0:40:55-0:41:02:**  The other thing that's an issue in terms of pests in this part of the country is pigeons,  
**0:41:02-0:41:05:**  pigeons eating the cereal crops and so on.  
**0:41:05-0:41:06:**  And it's noticeable.  
**0:41:06-0:41:09:**  I mean, we do have a couple of areas of the farm that are much more open and don't have  
**0:41:09-0:41:10:**  trees in at all.  
**0:41:10-0:41:14:**  And just visually, you could see that there'd be whole flocks of pigeons sometimes in those  
**0:41:14-0:41:15:**  areas.  
**0:41:15-0:41:19:**  I actually thought we had a pigeon problem where we didn't see equivalent numbers of  
**0:41:19-0:41:24:**  pigeons in the alleys where you have the intercropping growing or anywhere between the tree lines.  
**0:41:24-0:41:31:**  Now, I haven't done any scientific basis for that, but simply observationally, whether  
**0:41:31-0:41:35:**  that's because the large flocks of pigeons don't want to land in the relatively narrow  
**0:41:35-0:41:38:**  alleys between the trees or what I just don't know.  
**0:41:38-0:41:42:**  But I'm sure there are those kind of interactions going on.  
**0:41:42-0:41:46:**  And I think one of the just to add to that, I talked earlier about the way in which in  
**0:41:46-0:41:52:**  the past there'd been collaborations between the organic research center in the UK and  
**0:41:52-0:41:53:**  Wakelands project.  
**0:41:53-0:42:00:**  We're back talking to the ORC about further sort of future collaborations.  
**0:42:00-0:42:03:**  And I think one of the things they're interested in is precisely looking at Wakelands as a  
**0:42:03-0:42:07:**  relatively mature agroforestry system.  
**0:42:07-0:42:09:**  So seeing if you can pinpoint some of those things.  
**0:42:09-0:42:13:**  And that's partly with the benefit of data that was collected in previous years around  
**0:42:13-0:42:14:**  things like tree growth and so on.  
**0:42:14-0:42:19:**  So there is a fair amount of data which could inform some longitudinal studies in that way.  
**0:42:19-0:42:23:**  So I'm optimistic that we can, there's still more to learn.  
**0:42:23-0:42:24:**  That would make sense.  
**0:42:24-0:42:30:**  And I'll add protection from spores, which I actually had never thought about as an advantage  
**0:42:30-0:42:31:**  for windbreaks.  
**0:42:31-0:42:37:**  We always think in terms of wind damage and storms or temperature, but that's also an  
**0:42:37-0:42:39:**  interesting effect that we'd never thought about.  
**0:42:39-0:42:41:**  So great.  
**0:42:41-0:42:48:**  I wanted to ask in terms of diversity and you've already mentioned so many crops.  
**0:42:48-0:42:55:**  And now that you're kind of transforming the strategy and you're thinking of selling and  
**0:42:55-0:43:02:**  diversifying even more by including intensive horticulture and all these elements, do you  
**0:43:02-0:43:08:**  have a farm shop or how do you manage to accommodate that diversity?  
**0:43:08-0:43:13:**  So what we're doing at the moment is that we are, I suppose we're doing two things in  
**0:43:13-0:43:14:**  terms of the diversity.  
**0:43:14-0:43:19:**  So just expanding the range of activities on the site, as well as bringing in people  
**0:43:19-0:43:24:**  to do the horticulture that as you've just described, we are building a sort of bakery  
**0:43:24-0:43:26:**  kitchen on the site.  
**0:43:26-0:43:31:**  And we have a woman, a young woman called Henrietta Inman, who is a sort of celebrated  
**0:43:31-0:43:36:**  and published baker-cum-chef who's much to our pleasure basing herself here.  
**0:43:36-0:43:39:**  So she is going to be working very closely with the people who are doing the growing  
**0:43:39-0:43:40:**  to specify what we grow.  
**0:43:40-0:43:44:**  And then she's going to be using the produce on the farm in her cooking.  
**0:43:44-0:43:50:**  And I suspect much of that cooking will be directed towards people who are coming to  
**0:43:50-0:43:53:**  the site for activities on site.  
**0:43:53-0:43:56:**  And that brings me to the second thing that we're doing in terms of diversification, which  
**0:43:56-0:44:02:**  is that we're converting the farmhouse to be accommodation and we're building what we  
**0:44:02-0:44:10:**  call glamping pods, which we will use in the organic, in the the layout is as accommodation.  
**0:44:10-0:44:14:**  So people can come here for whether it might be for holidays, but more likely for events,  
**0:44:14-0:44:21:**  whether it's for courses or meetings or whatever it may be, people coming to do things involving  
**0:44:21-0:44:23:**  the site and so on.  
**0:44:23-0:44:27:**  So we're in that latter regard where we had a couple of organized tree walks just in the  
**0:44:27-0:44:28:**  last couple of weeks.  
**0:44:28-0:44:32:**  And we're now talking to various people who are would like to run courses here next year  
**0:44:32-0:44:33:**  in 2021.  
**0:44:33-0:44:39:**  So we're already talking to people who want to do courses in, let me think, agroforestry  
**0:44:39-0:44:47:**  in permaculture, in sourdough making, in mead making, in willow weaving, in landscape painting,  
**0:44:47-0:44:48:**  and so on.  
**0:44:48-0:44:49:**  The list goes on.  
**0:44:49-0:44:50:**  So that's very exciting.  
**0:44:50-0:44:55:**  So those will be people who come here to do things sort of linked to the farming or the  
**0:44:55-0:44:58:**  environment or the food and will base themselves here.  
**0:44:58-0:45:04:**  And we hope will then feel more closely connected and they will be eating the food that's cooked  
**0:45:04-0:45:08:**  here by Henrietta based upon what is grown here.  
**0:45:08-0:45:14:**  And then just to go back briefly to the glamping pods, our glamping pods are sort of small  
**0:45:14-0:45:19:**  timber structures that are designed very much for all year round people to sleep in.  
**0:45:19-0:45:22:**  And they're quite well fitted out.  
**0:45:22-0:45:25:**  And they're designed like a little six legged spider.  
**0:45:25-0:45:29:**  And then we've got a purpose built trailer that we use to move them around.  
**0:45:29-0:45:34:**  So we then move them around within the organic, the lay alleys, but also as the lay alleys  
**0:45:34-0:45:35:**  move around.  
**0:45:35-0:45:39:**  So they are part of the organic, they will be part of the organic rotation, just like  
**0:45:39-0:45:41:**  any other crop.  
**0:45:41-0:45:45:**  And the point of designing them that way is that they absolutely don't compromise the  
**0:45:45-0:45:46:**  farming at all.  
**0:45:46-0:45:51:**  We're not in the position of turning productive land into a campsite or something like that  
**0:45:51-0:45:52:**  that some farmers might do.  
**0:45:52-0:45:57:**  This is something which gives us another income stream, but also brings people to visit here  
**0:45:57-0:46:04:**  and so on, which is entirely without any compromise to the farm, it's entirely an additional layer  
**0:46:04-0:46:05:**  of activity.  
**0:46:05-0:46:11:**  So we see all of those things as working together, partly to increase the sort of financial stability  
**0:46:11-0:46:16:**  of the whole thing, but also to make it not just a farm producing food, but also a farm  
**0:46:16-0:46:24:**  which has a wider role in society, employing people and educating them and so on.  
**0:46:24-0:46:28:**  It's like we often hear about the eggmobiles and the mobile chicken hens, but actually  
**0:46:28-0:46:34:**  you use doing tourism, mobile infrastructure for tourism, it's good, it really fits with  
**0:46:34-0:46:37:**  the rotation.  
**0:46:37-0:46:42:**  I just wanted to add something about the produce is, so if I understand correctly, you're thinking  
**0:46:42-0:46:48:**  of that almost all your produce can be then directly transformed and sold on site, would  
**0:46:48-0:46:50:**  you have any surplus?  
**0:46:50-0:46:54:**  Ask me in a year's time.  
**0:46:54-0:46:59:**  At the moment we don't know how much of our produce Henrietta will be able to use and  
**0:46:59-0:47:07:**  how much surplus there will be, which depends partly in terms of how her operation is a  
**0:47:07-0:47:12:**  self-contained enterprise, it depends slightly on how big that grows and it depends very  
**0:47:12-0:47:15:**  much on the nature of people coming here and how many people come here.  
**0:47:15-0:47:20:**  If we end up with people staying here at the moment we're building six pods, each of those  
**0:47:20-0:47:24:**  could accommodate two or four people, we hope to have 12 pods in due course.  
**0:47:24-0:47:29:**  If those pods were occupied by people staying here for even half the year, that would be  
**0:47:29-0:47:35:**  an awful lot of food and I suspect she would indeed use all the produce that we produce,  
**0:47:35-0:47:37:**  but we're a long way from that yet.  
**0:47:37-0:47:41:**  So at the moment we still, at the moment in the short term, at least when it comes to  
**0:47:41-0:47:46:**  the fruit produce, we still sell that through small retail outlets in the area and with  
**0:47:46-0:47:52:**  the cereals and the lentils and so on, we sell those through a specialist online retailer  
**0:47:52-0:47:58:**  called Hodmerdods who are based in this area but actually cover the whole of the UK.  
**0:47:58-0:48:04:**  And the cereals, at the moment you have them milled somewhere else and then you still...  
**0:48:04-0:48:11:**  The cereals, the wheat in particular, we mill on site and then we supply, we do supply Hodmerdods  
**0:48:11-0:48:16:**  with some grain because some of their customers want grain, but most of what we supply them  
**0:48:16-0:48:23:**  with is flour that's milled on site in relatively small batches so that anybody who buys their  
**0:48:23-0:48:30:**  Hodmerdods, their Wakelings flour from Hodmerdods, it would have been milled no more than a matter  
**0:48:30-0:48:31:**  of days or weeks beforehand.  
**0:48:31-0:48:37:**  It won't have sat around getting stale and certainly the real bread specialists are very  
**0:48:37-0:48:42:**  keen to have fresh milled flour because of its additional flavour compared to what you  
**0:48:42-0:48:44:**  might call stale flour.  
**0:48:44-0:48:46:**  Rightly so.  
**0:48:46-0:48:52:**  And so all of this is sold, could be sold locally as well to the local community?  
**0:48:52-0:48:57:**  Yeah, so we had with our cherries for example, we sold some cherries, we supplied some cherries  
**0:48:57-0:49:04:**  to a local organic box scheme that operates in Norwich, which is a small city nearby.  
**0:49:04-0:49:10:**  But we also sold small quantities into the village shop, which is 10 minutes down the  
**0:49:10-0:49:11:**  road.  
**0:49:11-0:49:14:**  So different dimensions.  
**0:49:14-0:49:18:**  And how many people does the farm hire at the moment?  
**0:49:18-0:49:21:**  That's a good question.  
**0:49:21-0:49:31:**  So we have two guys who are part-time contractors who do the arable work, so the wheat and the  
**0:49:31-0:49:33:**  lentils and so on.  
**0:49:33-0:49:35:**  And their hours are very variable.  
**0:49:35-0:49:40:**  I suspect it's probably an average of about one day a week through the year, but it's  
**0:49:40-0:49:42:**  very variable.  
**0:49:42-0:49:49:**  We have another couple of guys who again are employed as and when who do the tree management.  
**0:49:49-0:49:54:**  Another woman has been dealing with our squash crop this year.  
**0:49:54-0:49:58:**  The horticulture operations will involve several people and indeed one of them is going to  
**0:49:58-0:50:00:**  be a community supported agriculture scheme.  
**0:50:00-0:50:03:**  So that will involve members of the community working on the site.  
**0:50:03-0:50:07:**  But not all of those people are, well, none of those people are our employees, some of  
**0:50:07-0:50:09:**  them are contractors.  
**0:50:09-0:50:15:**  But in some of them, I mean like Henrietta, that's her own enterprise and the horticulture  
**0:50:15-0:50:20:**  is going to be the enterprise of the two different groups of women who are doing it.  
**0:50:20-0:50:22:**  We will just be hosting them.  
**0:50:22-0:50:25:**  So the intended arrangement with them is that they will have an area of land on which to  
**0:50:25-0:50:28:**  grow their food crops.  
**0:50:28-0:50:32:**  And what we're discussing with them is that they won't pay us, or they only pay us a nominal  
**0:50:32-0:50:37:**  amount, but they will in exchange for using the land give us, let's say, 25% of what they  
**0:50:37-0:50:41:**  produce for Henrietta to cook in her kitchen.  
**0:50:41-0:50:46:**  So it will be more of a sort of collaborative arrangement rather than a commercial arrangement  
**0:50:46-0:50:52:**  with them supplying her with food in exchange for, sorry, ingredients in exchange for using  
**0:50:52-0:50:55:**  the land.  
**0:50:55-0:50:59:**  So the number of people working here, in a year or two's time, I think there could be  
**0:50:59-0:51:03:**  quite a lot of people working here involved in farming and food production, but they won't  
**0:51:03-0:51:08:**  necessarily be, or they certainly won't be full time and they probably won't be our employees.  
**0:51:08-0:51:14:**  But we're very keen to have a lot of people doing stuff on the land involving food and  
**0:51:14-0:51:16:**  farming and the environment.  
**0:51:16-0:51:22:**  Again, in contrast to the sorts of methods that are used elsewhere, which involve one  
**0:51:22-0:51:25:**  guy and a huge machine or whatever it might be.  
**0:51:25-0:51:26:**  For sure.  
**0:51:26-0:51:31:**  And it's going to become quite a hub when all of these different partnerships develop.  
**0:51:31-0:51:32:**  Well, we hope so.  
**0:51:32-0:51:33:**  We hope so.  
**0:51:33-0:51:37:**  That's going to be really, really nice.  
**0:51:37-0:51:41:**  And the people that manage the trees at the moment and in the future, that's yourself.  
**0:51:41-0:51:44:**  And are you working with somebody else as well?  
**0:51:44-0:51:50:**  Well, I say we've got a couple of guys who are expert arboriculturalists who've been  
**0:51:50-0:51:53:**  doing stuff here for 15 or so years.  
**0:51:53-0:51:58:**  So they really, they get there carrying on and they're making the management decisions  
**0:51:58-0:52:00:**  day to day.  
**0:52:00-0:52:08:**  So one of the questions that we usually ask our guests is about mistakes.  
**0:52:08-0:52:14:**  Now in your case, because you've come into the farm a bit later than your parents, it'll  
**0:52:14-0:52:15:**  be interesting to see your perspective.  
**0:52:15-0:52:20:**  I don't know if you'll be able to go so far back in time, but what are some of the key  
**0:52:20-0:52:26:**  mistakes that were done on the farm in terms of the tree lines, in terms of the design  
**0:52:26-0:52:30:**  and et cetera, that how would you do things differently in the farm?  
**0:52:30-0:52:36:**  So the very earliest tree lines, which are now the oldest trees, were planted 12 meters  
**0:52:36-0:52:37:**  apart.  
**0:52:37-0:52:42:**  And I think that was too close together because as the trees and the undergrowth has got mature,  
**0:52:42-0:52:44:**  you lose about three meters of width.  
**0:52:44-0:52:48:**  So you end up with an active area of about nine meters.  
**0:52:48-0:52:49:**  So I think that was a mistake.  
**0:52:49-0:52:53:**  Whereas the later lines are planted sort of 15 meters or 18 meters apart, and that's much  
**0:52:53-0:52:57:**  more of a, much more sustainable balance.  
**0:52:57-0:52:58:**  That's the first thing.  
**0:52:58-0:53:04:**  The second thing is, as I mentioned earlier, the way in which some of the timber trees  
**0:53:04-0:53:05:**  have been managed.  
**0:53:05-0:53:13:**  So for example, the cherry trees, I think they were, it would have been better if there  
**0:53:13-0:53:17:**  had been an early decision to say that we either want these as fruit or we want them  
**0:53:17-0:53:20:**  as timber, and then they'd be managed accordingly.  
**0:53:20-0:53:22:**  Whereas I think it's been a bit of a compromise.  
**0:53:22-0:53:25:**  So I think we haven't got the best of both worlds.  
**0:53:25-0:53:31:**  And then a third example, so this is slightly away from the farming, but it's in terms of  
**0:53:31-0:53:34:**  what we do with the produce.  
**0:53:34-0:53:41:**  As we've discussed, the residue of the willow and hazel coppice is all chipped.  
**0:53:41-0:53:47:**  And then the chipped biomass is used in a biomass boiler to produce heating and hot  
**0:53:47-0:53:49:**  water for the farmhouse.  
**0:53:49-0:53:56:**  Now that boiler was installed in the corner of the farmyard, and the way in which that's  
**0:53:56-0:54:03:**  been installed has proved not all the sort of location of it within the complex is not  
**0:54:03-0:54:08:**  optimised really for the handling and the processing and the moving around of the chips.  
**0:54:08-0:54:13:**  So I would say if you were starting again, you'd put the boiler in a different place  
**0:54:13-0:54:19:**  and in a place where you very specifically identified land or buildings in which you  
**0:54:19-0:54:23:**  could store large quantities of wood chip and handle it very easily.  
**0:54:23-0:54:26:**  Whereas we haven't got that because of our layout.  
**0:54:26-0:54:33:**  So we do what might be unnecessary handling of the wood chip, moving it around from place  
**0:54:33-0:54:37:**  to place because of our layout compromises.  
**0:54:37-0:54:48:**  Well, and that means more time, more machinery and so on.  
**0:54:48-0:54:55:**  So at the moment, when the chips were all chipped, when was that now about the end of  
**0:54:55-0:55:02:**  March into April, we now have a huge pile of wood chip sitting in the field.  
**0:55:02-0:55:07:**  We are going to have to move that pile of wood chip before the rain start in a few weeks  
**0:55:07-0:55:12:**  time because by October or November, we won't be able to drive a tractor onto that field  
**0:55:12-0:55:14:**  because it'll be so wet.  
**0:55:14-0:55:19:**  So we have to move enough of that wood chip into an area of the farmyard and then cover  
**0:55:19-0:55:22:**  it up for the winter to keep the boiler going.  
**0:55:22-0:55:26:**  Now if we had a different layout, if it had been sort of planned in a different way, then  
**0:55:26-0:55:32:**  we wouldn't be doing, we would have chipped it into its final destination and it wouldn't  
**0:55:32-0:55:33:**  have been moved around.  
**0:55:33-0:55:38:**  So there's things like that, which because when my parents first laid the whole place  
**0:55:38-0:55:41:**  out, they didn't have a wood chip boiler that came with an afterthought, not an afterthought,  
**0:55:41-0:55:46:**  but with a late tradition, they perhaps didn't have the flexibility they might have had.  
**0:55:46-0:55:53:**  But I would just say in answer to your lessons learned questions, because it all evolved,  
**0:55:53-0:55:58:**  it didn't necessarily evolve in the most efficient way.  
**0:55:58-0:56:06:**  We suffered the same problems at Massey Farm as well, where as things have evolved without  
**0:56:06-0:56:11:**  necessarily the exact planning from the beginning, which is very difficult to do, then we definitely  
**0:56:11-0:56:18:**  felt the consequences of inefficient work and inefficient spacing or placing of things.  
**0:56:18-0:56:22:**  But continuing with the wood chips and heating the home, are you happy with the efficiency  
**0:56:22-0:56:26:**  of that system of being able to use the wood chips to heat your home?  
**0:56:26-0:56:29:**  Is that a system you're happy with?  
**0:56:29-0:56:37:**  Well, it's very nice to think that the hot water in my shower comes from chips that come  
**0:56:37-0:56:43:**  from timber that's grown in our fields, just as it's very nice to have a big solar photovoltaic  
**0:56:43-0:56:46:**  array and think that our electricity will come from the sun.  
**0:56:46-0:56:52:**  And obviously that's a big contributor, a big sort of potential climate change benefit,  
**0:56:52-0:56:57:**  because our fuel is a very short cycle carbon capture.  
**0:56:57-0:57:02:**  So it's constantly being replenished in carbon terms.  
**0:57:02-0:57:08:**  So that's all great in those sorts of ways.  
**0:57:08-0:57:12:**  It's compromised, it's not as good as it could be, because we're doing unnecessary handling.  
**0:57:12-0:57:17:**  And we haven't yet got it right in terms of the technology and the techniques for harvesting  
**0:57:17-0:57:18:**  and shipping and so on.  
**0:57:18-0:57:21:**  Those are all things we need to think about to refine.  
**0:57:21-0:57:25:**  But the basic principle, I think, is great.  
**0:57:25-0:57:28:**  And do you have any surplus left from the border?  
**0:57:28-0:57:33:**  Let's say, I mean, we can imagine a thousand uses for wood chips from the no dig markets  
**0:57:33-0:57:36:**  garden to, for example, mulching trees.  
**0:57:36-0:57:42:**  So in terms of volumes, do you have that resource as well?  
**0:57:42-0:57:43:**  Ask me in a year or two.  
**0:57:43-0:57:51:**  I say why I say that because until a year ago, well, until three years ago, my parents  
**0:57:51-0:57:54:**  lived in this house.  
**0:57:54-0:57:57:**  My mum died in 2016 and then it was just my dad living in the house.  
**0:57:57-0:58:02:**  So his needs for heating and hot water were relatively modest.  
**0:58:02-0:58:07:**  If so, in that era, there was a lot of surplus wood chip.  
**0:58:07-0:58:12:**  As I mentioned, we're planning on having a lot more people using the house and therefore  
**0:58:12-0:58:15:**  a lot more showers and a lot more whatever.  
**0:58:15-0:58:18:**  So it may be that we get through a lot more wood chip.  
**0:58:18-0:58:23:**  I'm optimistic that we still have plenty, but we won't necessarily have a huge surplus.  
**0:58:23-0:58:26:**  But as I say, if you ask me that question in a year or two, I'll be able to give you  
**0:58:26-0:58:27:**  a better answer.  
**0:58:27-0:58:29:**  Well, definitely do that.  
**0:58:29-0:58:32:**  You're not going to get rid of us so easily.  
**0:58:32-0:58:39:**  Well, one question I had in mind, you know, listening earlier when you were talking about  
**0:58:39-0:58:44:**  the strategy and opening up the farm to visitors and doing a hub, you mentioned that it was  
**0:58:44-0:58:46:**  also part of economic viability.  
**0:58:46-0:58:51:**  And that kind of made me think, let's say I understand that it's probably like something  
**0:58:51-0:58:52:**  that you want to do.  
**0:58:52-0:58:57:**  And it seems very coherent to open up the farm and the project.  
**0:58:57-0:59:00:**  But if you were to put apart the fact that you want to do it, do you think that you could  
**0:59:00-0:59:07:**  run agroforestry system based only on production that would be economically viable?  
**0:59:07-0:59:11:**  And the reason why I ask this is because it's such a crucial information for anyone kind  
**0:59:11-0:59:15:**  of setting out as we are and, you know, planting the trees and planting out.  
**0:59:15-0:59:20:**  And I think it's great if you have some insight into that, bearing in mind that I know that  
**0:59:20-0:59:25:**  the farm hasn't been run as a business, as a conventional business for the last 25 years,  
**0:59:25-0:59:30:**  but just, you know, based on where you are now and your your estimations and feeling  
**0:59:30-0:59:32:**  about that.  
**0:59:32-0:59:38:**  So I think it could be.  
**0:59:38-0:59:43:**  I think we have a number of challenges, including that the things I described to you as mistakes,  
**0:59:43-0:59:47:**  which mean that we have higher costs than we might otherwise have.  
**0:59:47-0:59:53:**  I think also, as I described to you, we are reliant on sort of contractors and so on.  
**0:59:53-0:59:56:**  And that's a relatively expensive way of doing things for some of those activities.  
**0:59:56-1:00:01:**  So if we were doing the farming directly ourselves, that we didn't have labour costs, that would  
**1:00:01-1:00:04:**  be different economics.  
**1:00:04-1:00:07:**  I think you choose your crops carefully.  
**1:00:07-1:00:09:**  And I think, again, we have issues about the layout.  
**1:00:09-1:00:15:**  So there are areas where we have very big headlands of grass and so on, which are great  
**1:00:15-1:00:19:**  for biodiversity and so on, but not so good in terms of the cropping area.  
**1:00:19-1:00:24:**  So I think you could if you were designing the system from scratch, you could design  
**1:00:24-1:00:27:**  it differently and operate it differently to make it much more sustainable, even in  
**1:00:27-1:00:28:**  its own terms.  
**1:00:28-1:00:31:**  And particularly if you included things like intensive horticulture, which are much more  
**1:00:31-1:00:37:**  financially productive, then I think that would be the case.  
**1:00:37-1:00:41:**  But from where we are, I think we can certainly make it much more financially sustainable  
**1:00:41-1:00:47:**  than it has been, whether it's on this relatively small farm area, it would be completely viable  
**1:00:47-1:00:55:**  without any subsidies as a self standing commercial proposition, just as farming is harder to  
**1:00:55-1:00:57:**  say.  
**1:00:57-1:01:01:**  And I think equally, if you look across the hedge and look at the farm next door, where  
**1:01:01-1:01:07:**  they're growing 100 hectares at the moment of beans in a completely ordinary, conventional,  
**1:01:07-1:01:11:**  chemically assisted way, I don't think they're making much money in growing beans either.  
**1:01:11-1:01:14:**  I think they are reliant on the subsidies as well.  
**1:01:14-1:01:19:**  So I think sometimes the comparisons need to be carefully framed.  
**1:01:19-1:01:24:**  I couldn't agree more because we often have conversations with people and then you kind  
**1:01:24-1:01:30:**  of have to remind that we're not comparing a system that works economically, which would  
**1:01:30-1:01:32:**  be the conventional one to alternatives.  
**1:01:32-1:01:37:**  We're comparing a system that doesn't work economically and relies on subsidies and still  
**1:01:37-1:01:39:**  where farmers struggle to make an income.  
**1:01:39-1:01:43:**  So thanks for reminding us the right comparison.  
**1:01:43-1:01:54:**  I had another question, which is, if you look at the farmers around you and that agricultural  
**1:01:54-1:02:00:**  deserts and you compare it to what's happening in your land, what do you think is the biggest  
**1:02:00-1:02:07:**  barrier or the biggest limitation for other farmers to adopt agroforestry systems?  
**1:02:07-1:02:12:**  Well I think there's a, I suppose there's a big lack of understanding and a big sort  
**1:02:12-1:02:16:**  of information deficit.  
**1:02:16-1:02:21:**  I also think that, I mean, so occasionally, not occasionally, quite often we get contacted  
**1:02:21-1:02:25:**  by farmers who are interested in converting to some agroforestry.  
**1:02:25-1:02:28:**  I mean, it's an interesting phenomenon.  
**1:02:28-1:02:34:**  I've had contact several times in the last few months from sort of young, I mean, I say  
**1:02:34-1:02:39:**  young people, so people let's say in their 30s who are the sons and daughters of the  
**1:02:39-1:02:41:**  existing older farmers.  
**1:02:41-1:02:46:**  And as the children are looking to inherit their farms or whatever, they are interested  
**1:02:46-1:02:48:**  in changing the methods.  
**1:02:48-1:02:53:**  So I've had a number of contacts from those kinds of people.  
**1:02:53-1:03:00:**  And one of the things that, that's great to sort of hear that, one of the things I think  
**1:03:00-1:03:03:**  one of the challenges I think they face is that when they, if they were to introduce  
**1:03:03-1:03:09:**  an agroforestry system into a field, then obviously for the first few years, the tree  
**1:03:09-1:03:16:**  lines are purely a detriment because they're compromising your arable crop, but they're  
**1:03:16-1:03:21:**  not yet giving you any return in terms of fruit or nuts or timber or anything like that.  
**1:03:21-1:03:25:**  So you have to have a much longer term perspective, whether it's longer term climate change perspective,  
**1:03:25-1:03:31:**  sort of as a big picture perspective, or whether it's simply your own economics and farming,  
**1:03:31-1:03:36:**  you have to have a, you have to be in it for the long game because you've got a few years  
**1:03:36-1:03:42:**  at least of where you're, you have a field of wheat or whatever it might be with saplings  
**1:03:42-1:03:45:**  in and that must look quite frustrating for a while.  
**1:03:45-1:03:49:**  So obviously we have the advantage that the Wakeland site has long since grown through  
**1:03:49-1:03:55:**  those early years, but I suspect that's a significant barrier for people.  
**1:03:55-1:03:56:**  I can imagine.  
**1:03:56-1:04:00:**  And now you can, when you respond to them, you can link our podcast.  
**1:04:00-1:04:01:**  Absolutely.  
**1:04:01-1:04:02:**  Absolutely.  
**1:04:02-1:04:03:**  Absolutely.  
**1:04:03-1:04:04:**  Hopefully.  
**1:04:04-1:04:09:**  I know, no, I'm only joking, but I mean, hopefully that's what we can continue to explore in  
**1:04:09-1:04:14:**  the next episodes and really go into those practical challenges and obstacles because  
**1:04:14-1:04:19:**  they're actually more interesting to us than, you know, repeating again and again how amazing  
**1:04:19-1:04:21:**  agroforestry is.  
**1:04:21-1:04:28:**  But maybe that's when, when maybe some smart subsidies or I don't know if it's some alternative  
**1:04:28-1:04:31:**  financing methods, but there's, it's true that there's, there's a lot of innovation  
**1:04:31-1:04:37:**  required beyond what's going on in the field to enable a large scale transition of agroforestry.  
**1:04:37-1:04:41:**  I'm sure that's all entirely correct.  
**1:04:41-1:04:42:**  Yeah.  
**1:04:42-1:04:47:**  And we'll, we'll of course link everything to do with the the farm and your websites  
**1:04:47-1:04:53:**  and social media and would encourage anyone to just go and see these beautiful pictures  
**1:04:53-1:04:59:**  at the very least of a beautiful 25 year old trees in the middle of the English countryside.  
**1:04:59-1:05:00:**  It's quite a sight.

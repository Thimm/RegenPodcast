### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 12:54:00)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:50:**  Today I'm interviewing Ben Raskin who's leading the implementation of various agroforestry  
**0:00:50-0:00:53:**  systems on Eastbrook Farm in the UK.  
**0:00:53-0:00:57:**  You'll get a really clear understanding of why and how trees were planted on Eastbrook  
**0:00:57-0:00:58:**  Farm.  
**0:00:58-0:01:02:**  I really enjoyed Ben's passion for woodchips and we got into the details of how much to  
**0:01:02-0:01:07:**  apply, the results they have achieved with them and how to supply them in the future.  
**0:01:07-0:01:11:**  Ben is also able to give a detailed comparison of the different options for protecting trees  
**0:01:11-0:01:16:**  which is such a crucial component of establishing silver pastoral systems.  
**0:01:16-0:01:18:**  I really hope you enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:18-0:01:20:**  Hi Ben, welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:20-0:01:21:**  Hello there.  
**0:01:21-0:01:27:**  Thanks for joining us today and let's get started with an introduction on who you are  
**0:01:27-0:01:30:**  and how you got interested into agroforestry.  
**0:01:30-0:01:34:**  So I'm Ben Raskin.  
**0:01:34-0:01:39:**  My main role job at the moment is working for the Soil Association.  
**0:01:39-0:01:43:**  I head up their horticultural and agroforestry work.  
**0:01:43-0:01:49:**  My background is as a vegetable grower so I was in mostly commercial vegetable production  
**0:01:49-0:01:52:**  for around 12 years.  
**0:01:52-0:02:01:**  And at the moment I'm also managing an agroforestry plantation in Wiltshire in southwest England  
**0:02:01-0:02:08:**  and then I do other bits and pieces of advice and writing to keep me off the streets.  
**0:02:08-0:02:13:**  And when's the first time you heard about agroforestry or that you started experimenting  
**0:02:13-0:02:14:**  with it?  
**0:02:14-0:02:17:**  I'm not sure if I'm honest.  
**0:02:17-0:02:25:**  I've been trying to think about this recently and so around, when was it, around 10 years  
**0:02:25-0:02:32:**  ago I planted up a very small agroforestry system which I can tell you about in more  
**0:02:32-0:02:33:**  detail.  
**0:02:33-0:02:40:**  It ended disastrously but and I'd been interested for a couple of years before that.  
**0:02:40-0:02:47:**  So it's sort of I guess sort of 12, 15 years but I can't remember what it was that got  
**0:02:47-0:02:48:**  me interested.  
**0:02:48-0:02:52:**  There was no sort of there was no eureka moment where I suddenly thought this is it.  
**0:02:52-0:02:53:**  You know I've got to do this.  
**0:02:53-0:03:01:**  I think it was a sort of a drip, drip really about the interactions between trees and initially  
**0:03:01-0:03:02:**  vegetables anyway.  
**0:03:02-0:03:08:**  Well I can't help myself but be interested by disasters so what happened in that first  
**0:03:08-0:03:09:**  project?  
**0:03:09-0:03:12:**  Well it had so much potential.  
**0:03:12-0:03:21:**  It was an old, a big old glass house and polytunnel nursery that had gone bust and there was a  
**0:03:21-0:03:27:**  vision of creating an eco center, you know horticultural eco center.  
**0:03:27-0:03:34:**  So there was someone there who was growing flowers and someone else who was producing  
**0:03:34-0:03:37:**  plug plants and I rented two acres.  
**0:03:37-0:03:41:**  It was really, really good soil and that was what attracted me to it.  
**0:03:41-0:03:48:**  It was some fantastic soil and I rented two acres outside space so I wasn't growing under  
**0:03:48-0:03:56:**  cover and spent, I can't remember, about four thousand pounds on fruit trees mainly.  
**0:03:56-0:04:00:**  Got them all planted and started growing some crops in between.  
**0:04:00-0:04:08:**  I planted some squash and artichokes I think initially and then unfortunately the landlord  
**0:04:08-0:04:16:**  went bust and I was very nervous about losing all the trees so I went and dug all the trees  
**0:04:16-0:04:22:**  up again and moved them to another site.  
**0:04:22-0:04:27:**  The disastrous bit in a way, I mean that was quite disastrous, but it also coincided with  
**0:04:27-0:04:32:**  the birth of my second son and my wife was in hospital with complications for a while  
**0:04:32-0:04:36:**  and so the trees were sort of last thing on my mind really.  
**0:04:36-0:04:41:**  So I didn't protect them properly and they got eaten by rabbits and they got flooded  
**0:04:41-0:04:45:**  in the field that I putted in and so when I finally got back to them, I think out of  
**0:04:45-0:04:50:**  the sort of 250 trees that there were initially or something, there were about eight left  
**0:04:50-0:04:53:**  that were still alive.  
**0:04:53-0:05:00:**  So it was interesting and I learned things but ultimately it was not what I had imagined  
**0:05:00-0:05:02:**  it was going to be.  
**0:05:02-0:05:07:**  It does raise an interesting point about implementing agroforestry systems on rented land and maybe  
**0:05:07-0:05:11:**  that's something we can come back a bit later in the interview.  
**0:05:11-0:05:17:**  But yeah, first I was thinking, I've seen your name associated to agroforestry in reports  
**0:05:17-0:05:21:**  of the Soil Association and it seems that you're also working on that theme through  
**0:05:21-0:05:22:**  the organization.  
**0:05:22-0:05:25:**  Can you tell us a bit about that, your work in there?  
**0:05:25-0:05:26:**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**0:05:26-0:05:34:**  So at the time of that failed experiment that I just described, Helen Browning joined the  
**0:05:34-0:05:40:**  Soil Association at a similar time as the chief executive and she'd been interested  
**0:05:40-0:05:49:**  in agroforestry and basically had said that we were talking about doing more agroforestry  
**0:05:49-0:05:54:**  with the Soil Association and I basically put my hand up and said, oh I'd like to do  
**0:05:54-0:05:56:**  that bit please.  
**0:05:56-0:06:03:**  And so gradually over, you know, from around 2012 we started planning how we were going  
**0:06:03-0:06:08:**  to build more agroforestry work within that.  
**0:06:08-0:06:13:**  And sort of jumping ahead a little bit as well, that then coincided with Helen starting  
**0:06:13-0:06:19:**  to do the planting on her own farm and asking me to help plan and implement that.  
**0:06:19-0:06:21:**  So that was in 2016.  
**0:06:21-0:06:26:**  So it's been a sort of gradual evolving really from a little bit that was of interest but  
**0:06:26-0:06:32:**  not key to my role to now where I'm probably spending more time on agroforestry than I  
**0:06:32-0:06:34:**  am on the horticulture.  
**0:06:34-0:06:39:**  I'd love us to come back to your work with the Soil Association but first it'd be great  
**0:06:39-0:06:43:**  to understand what you're working on at the moment.  
**0:06:43-0:06:49:**  From what I've gathered online, you're currently implementing agroforestry practices on Eastbrook  
**0:06:49-0:06:53:**  Farm and maybe you could give us a bit of an overview of that project.  
**0:06:53-0:06:54:**  Yeah absolutely.  
**0:06:54-0:07:00:**  So Eastbrook Farm is the farm that's run by Helen Browning who's also the CEO of the Soil  
**0:07:00-0:07:01:**  Association.  
**0:07:01-0:07:05:**  The most of the farm is rented from the Church of England.  
**0:07:05-0:07:15:**  So it's a 1500 acre, so what's that, 700 hectares roughly, farm.  
**0:07:15-0:07:17:**  It's quite long and thin.  
**0:07:17-0:07:22:**  It's about 8 kilometres long, the farm.  
**0:07:22-0:07:28:**  Because most of it is rented, she wasn't initially able to plant many trees.  
**0:07:28-0:07:34:**  The Church of England who owned it were at the time not very keen on trees being planted  
**0:07:34-0:07:36:**  on their land.  
**0:07:36-0:07:41:**  They seem to be changing now which is great, maybe partly because of what we've been doing.  
**0:07:41-0:07:48:**  But anyway, at the time she was hampered really a little bit by that.  
**0:07:48-0:07:54:**  But just before we started planning, she inherited some land.  
**0:07:54-0:08:00:**  So 200 acres which is sort of at the bottom end of the existing farm.  
**0:08:00-0:08:05:**  And so that's when we were able to start really putting trees in on her own land and really  
**0:08:05-0:08:11:**  starting to have the freedom I guess to implement a system or to experiment with systems that  
**0:08:11-0:08:13:**  she wanted to.  
**0:08:13-0:08:17:**  And what was her interest in planting trees in the first place, her motivations?  
**0:08:17-0:08:22:**  So that's a good question and I think it's one that anyone thinking about agroforestry,  
**0:08:22-0:08:25:**  you do need to go right back to that.  
**0:08:25-0:08:28:**  What is your main objective from planting trees because there's so many things they  
**0:08:28-0:08:29:**  can achieve.  
**0:08:29-0:08:35:**  And for Helen, there were probably two main reasons and some supplementary ones.  
**0:08:35-0:08:40:**  So climate and business resilience was a big thing.  
**0:08:40-0:08:46:**  So we know that the climate is going to throw all kinds of things at us.  
**0:08:46-0:08:48:**  Everything's getting more extreme.  
**0:08:48-0:08:54:**  We're getting colder periods, hotter periods, some colder periods, lots of wet periods,  
**0:08:54-0:08:58:**  lots of dry periods, weird times a year.  
**0:08:58-0:09:04:**  And being able to mitigate that a little bit with trees was really important.  
**0:09:04-0:09:12:**  But also that longer change in the climate offers threats to existing crops and opportunities  
**0:09:12-0:09:14:**  for new crops.  
**0:09:14-0:09:20:**  So for instance, we've been planting things like almonds and apricots, which are not traditional  
**0:09:20-0:09:24:**  in North Wiltshire.  
**0:09:24-0:09:30:**  We were, speculative I think would be a good word for it.  
**0:09:30-0:09:35:**  But who knows in 10 years time or in 20 years time, the climate might have changed sufficiently  
**0:09:35-0:09:37:**  that they're perfectly suited for those crops.  
**0:09:37-0:09:42:**  So it's testing the ground a little bit for some novel trees as well as trying to build  
**0:09:42-0:09:46:**  resilience into the farming system.  
**0:09:46-0:09:50:**  And the other big driver for Helen was around animal welfare.  
**0:09:50-0:09:58:**  So she's always been at the forefront of finding ways of farming better for animals.  
**0:09:58-0:10:04:**  So we know that trees provide shade, shelter, food, all of those things that can improve  
**0:10:04-0:10:08:**  an animal's life as well as the productivity of the system.  
**0:10:08-0:10:12:**  So those were the two main drivers.  
**0:10:12-0:10:19:**  And beyond that, things like improving soil health, improving biodiversity are also things  
**0:10:19-0:10:21:**  that she's passionate about.  
**0:10:21-0:10:27:**  And finally, I think she just loves trees, as probably we all do.  
**0:10:27-0:10:32:**  And just having more trees about, there's parts of her farm where the hedges have been  
**0:10:32-0:10:36:**  ripped out in the period following the Second World War.  
**0:10:36-0:10:39:**  There's bits where we've really got quite bare fields.  
**0:10:39-0:10:42:**  There's big fields, they're exposed.  
**0:10:42-0:10:46:**  And when you've got livestock up on them, it's not in the winter, it's not the best  
**0:10:46-0:10:47:**  place to be.  
**0:10:47-0:10:54:**  So just being able to make the landscape more treed was another big driver.  
**0:10:54-0:10:58:**  So I hear all these reasons rooted in production and in the farm itself.  
**0:10:58-0:11:03:**  But of course, both of you also have another dimension to your work with the Soil Association.  
**0:11:03-0:11:11:**  Is there also a dimension of a bit research and having a bit of a pilot site, or maybe  
**0:11:11-0:11:15:**  not pilots, but showcasing these different practices?  
**0:11:15-0:11:22:**  Or is it really about the farm and just the farm business rationale is enough in a sense  
**0:11:22-0:11:24:**  to justify these systems?  
**0:11:24-0:11:29:**  I suspect, and I can't speak for Helen, but I suspect she would have done it anyway.  
**0:11:29-0:11:38:**  But I think being able to act, as you say, exactly as an experimental farm, as a demonstration  
**0:11:38-0:11:41:**  farm of what to do and what not to do.  
**0:11:41-0:11:45:**  We're very happy to share things that haven't worked.  
**0:11:45-0:11:51:**  Allows us probably to be more experimental than if we were purely looking at it for business.  
**0:11:51-0:11:55:**  You know, on a very basic business level.  
**0:11:55-0:12:01:**  And the work that both Helen and I do actually between the Practical Work and the Soil Association  
**0:12:01-0:12:03:**  work are very interlinked.  
**0:12:03-0:12:06:**  And they both inform and help each other.  
**0:12:06-0:12:10:**  So Helen is very keen for people to come and visit the farm.  
**0:12:10-0:12:14:**  She's very keen for scientists to come and study the farm and researchers to come and  
**0:12:14-0:12:15:**  study it.  
**0:12:15-0:12:23:**  We've got in some of the fields, we're using the app, SectorMentor app, and we've got individual  
**0:12:23-0:12:29:**  trees tagged and where we can find the time we're measuring yield per tree and disease  
**0:12:29-0:12:31:**  and things like that.  
**0:12:31-0:12:39:**  So yeah, we're absolutely very keen for it to be of wider use as well as helping the  
**0:12:39-0:12:41:**  farm business.  
**0:12:41-0:12:47:**  That's great because if you can perceive knowledge as an output of the farm beyond production,  
**0:12:47-0:12:51:**  it helps put a lot of mistakes in perspective because you kind of tell yourself at least  
**0:12:51-0:12:53:**  we're learning from this and so are other people.  
**0:12:53-0:12:57:**  That's something we definitely relate to on Massey Farm.  
**0:12:57-0:13:03:**  And yeah, I think it's a good way of keeping motivation even in tough times.  
**0:13:03-0:13:09:**  Now that we have quite a good understanding of this, maybe we should look a bit more in  
**0:13:09-0:13:12:**  practice what these different systems look like.  
**0:13:12-0:13:17:**  So maybe you can give us an overview of the different agroforestry systems you've implemented.  
**0:13:17-0:13:19:**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**0:13:19-0:13:24:**  So first off, it's worth saying that this part of the farm is entirely livestock at  
**0:13:24-0:13:25:**  the moment.  
**0:13:25-0:13:27:**  So it's a silver pastoral system.  
**0:13:27-0:13:31:**  It's flat and it's mostly flat.  
**0:13:31-0:13:37:**  There's one field with a slope and it's heavy clay, most of it.  
**0:13:37-0:13:39:**  So it is croppable.  
**0:13:39-0:13:43:**  There have been crops on it in the past, but it's very wet and heavy.  
**0:13:43-0:13:52:**  And particularly in the spring, finding windows to cultivate the soil ready for crops is tricky.  
**0:13:52-0:13:58:**  So with some of the systems that we've implemented, we're allowing the potential for cropping,  
**0:13:58-0:14:02:**  even though it's currently livestock.  
**0:14:02-0:14:09:**  So if I run through maybe in the order that we've been planting them, that's probably  
**0:14:09-0:14:10:**  the easiest way.  
**0:14:10-0:14:18:**  So the first field that we planted up is called Barnfield, very imaginatively named because  
**0:14:18-0:14:21:**  it's next to the barn.  
**0:14:21-0:14:26:**  And that is probably you describe that more like an extensive orchard.  
**0:14:26-0:14:29:**  So it's relatively close spacing.  
**0:14:29-0:14:32:**  It's 10 meters between rows.  
**0:14:32-0:14:41:**  And we've got a mix of, I think around 23 or 24 species at the last count of tree fruit,  
**0:14:41-0:14:45:**  nuts and bush fruit.  
**0:14:45-0:14:53:**  Mostly each row is mostly one type of tree interplanted with one type of bush.  
**0:14:53-0:15:00:**  And we had quite a lot of debates about how much to mix everything up, you know, because  
**0:15:00-0:15:06:**  on the one hand, the more diverse everything is, the better from a sort of biological point  
**0:15:06-0:15:12:**  of view, but from a management and practical point of view, it gets more complicated.  
**0:15:12-0:15:17:**  So in the end, we erred towards the simpler management.  
**0:15:17-0:15:23:**  And it's still very diverse, but each row then is sort of its own row.  
**0:15:23-0:15:28:**  At the moment, we're cutting that grass for silage or hay.  
**0:15:28-0:15:31:**  But what we'd like to do is to have poultry in that field.  
**0:15:31-0:15:34:**  We did have a little bit in the first year.  
**0:15:34-0:15:38:**  And ideally what we'd like is someone to come and run a poultry enterprise.  
**0:15:38-0:15:44:**  So maybe one of your listeners could come and run some poultry for us.  
**0:15:44-0:15:50:**  So that's that field.  
**0:15:50-0:15:58:**  The next field we did is going to be a grazed woodland.  
**0:15:58-0:16:02:**  So we've planted it up with mixed native trees.  
**0:16:02-0:16:07:**  We'll let them grow on for 10, 15 years until they're big enough to be able to cope with  
**0:16:07-0:16:09:**  the cattle in.  
**0:16:09-0:16:14:**  And then we'll open that up and thin it out a bit.  
**0:16:14-0:16:17:**  And eventually that will be a grazed woodland.  
**0:16:17-0:16:23:**  And there's some interesting learnings there in terms of establishment and mulching, which  
**0:16:23-0:16:28:**  I can maybe come back to later on.  
**0:16:28-0:16:37:**  Then the field above that, which is around 46 acres, so around 20 hectares, we've got  
**0:16:37-0:16:39:**  an alley cropping system in there.  
**0:16:39-0:16:45:**  So we've got straight lines, straight parallel lines, 27 meters apart.  
**0:16:45-0:16:49:**  So that's following this kind of spacing calculations that Stephen Briggs did, where you end up  
**0:16:49-0:16:57:**  with a 24 meter strip effectively, which because 24 is divisible by 12, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, you  
**0:16:57-0:16:59:**  can use any piece of machinery.  
**0:16:59-0:17:04:**  So effectively it keeps all your options open.  
**0:17:04-0:17:10:**  And what we've done in that field is we've put a single strand electric fence on each  
**0:17:10-0:17:12:**  side of the trees.  
**0:17:12-0:17:17:**  So we've created effectively sort of 18 paddocks between the rows.  
**0:17:17-0:17:21:**  And we're now mob grazing between each row.  
**0:17:21-0:17:26:**  So whereas before it was grazed, I think in two halves from memory, it's now done on a  
**0:17:26-0:17:27:**  rotational basis.  
**0:17:27-0:17:33:**  So one of the interesting things for me is not only have we got the changes that planting  
**0:17:33-0:17:41:**  the trees are bringing, but we've also got the changes in farming practice that the system  
**0:17:41-0:17:44:**  has produced.  
**0:17:44-0:17:48:**  And certainly in the first year or two, I think Helen was pretty convinced that the  
**0:17:48-0:17:54:**  productivity of the grass had gone up significantly by the change in the grazing routine, even  
**0:17:54-0:18:00:**  before we really saw, you know, likely to see any impact from the trees.  
**0:18:00-0:18:04:**  And the trees in that field are mostly peri-pair trees.  
**0:18:04-0:18:10:**  So peri-pairs are a small, hard pair that you use for making a drink like cider.  
**0:18:10-0:18:14:**  So they're like cider apples, but they're pairs.  
**0:18:14-0:18:20:**  They grow quite big, they're big trees, and we've interplanted them with willow and alder,  
**0:18:20-0:18:27:**  which will coppice and use either for wood chip or for feed for the animals.  
**0:18:27-0:18:30:**  There's also some timber trees in that field.  
**0:18:30-0:18:37:**  So we've put a few oaks, cherries, hornbeam, wild service, and there's some sea buckthorners  
**0:18:37-0:18:38:**  into plant as well.  
**0:18:38-0:18:43:**  So we've grown quite a lot of sea buckthorn, quite interested in that.  
**0:18:43-0:18:47:**  There's a developing market in the UK for it, it's still relatively unknown, but there's  
**0:18:47-0:18:53:**  a couple of companies we're working with, one to, assuming we get enough harvest at  
**0:18:53-0:18:58:**  some point to supply that.  
**0:18:58-0:19:04:**  And the main objectives of those trees there were just to find trees that had economic  
**0:19:04-0:19:10:**  benefits, or were there some parameters given that you were selecting trees for an alley  
**0:19:10-0:19:11:**  cropping system?  
**0:19:11-0:19:13:**  Yes, that's a good question.  
**0:19:13-0:19:18:**  We wanted trees that were big enough to provide some benefit to the livestock.  
**0:19:18-0:19:22:**  We wanted them to be productive.  
**0:19:22-0:19:30:**  And when we were doing that initial research, peri-pairs were one of the things that there  
**0:19:30-0:19:31:**  was a demand for.  
**0:19:31-0:19:36:**  So there's lots of people growing apples, and at the moment in the UK, the cider apple  
**0:19:36-0:19:38:**  industry is on its knees.  
**0:19:38-0:19:43:**  There's lots of, well that's not quite fair, it's not on its knees, but there's an oversupply  
**0:19:43-0:19:44:**  of apples at the moment.  
**0:19:44-0:19:49:**  So we didn't want to go into something that we knew was already oversupplied.  
**0:19:49-0:19:51:**  So peri-pairs seemed like a good idea.  
**0:19:51-0:19:54:**  We knew there was still a strong demand for it.  
**0:19:54-0:19:59:**  It's still a relatively niche product, so there's not going to be hundreds of people  
**0:19:59-0:20:02:**  going out and planting lots of peri-pairs.  
**0:20:02-0:20:07:**  So we were fairly confident that we would be able to sell them.  
**0:20:07-0:20:15:**  And then the timber trees is a very long term, as you know, very long term project.  
**0:20:15-0:20:19:**  So that's not really looking about the immediate market, but we wanted something for the longer  
**0:20:19-0:20:23:**  term and some big trees in that field.  
**0:20:23-0:20:30:**  So for that field, the main objective, well the two main objectives, one was to try and  
**0:20:30-0:20:31:**  dry the land out.  
**0:20:31-0:20:37:**  So we're hoping that having these trees will reduce the flooding a little bit, make it  
**0:20:37-0:20:41:**  drier, particularly sort of in the spring when we might want to crop it, but also then  
**0:20:41-0:20:45:**  to provide shade and shelter for the animals.  
**0:20:45-0:20:51:**  So except in Barnfield where you have like an orchard system, for the two other agroforestry  
**0:20:51-0:20:58:**  systems, the needs of the animals that are already on the farm remain a central preoccupation  
**0:20:58-0:20:59:**  and kind of design.  
**0:20:59-0:21:06:**  Yeah, I'd say that's a good analysis.  
**0:21:06-0:21:12:**  And the field that we're, the sort of the next on the list as it were, is quite a long  
**0:21:12-0:21:13:**  field.  
**0:21:13-0:21:16:**  So it's a kilometer long.  
**0:21:16-0:21:22:**  And it's, if you look back at the historical maps, it was actually three fields.  
**0:21:22-0:21:28:**  So we're reinstituting the old hedges in that field and splitting it up again into three.  
**0:21:28-0:21:31:**  We've also put in some browsing blocks.  
**0:21:31-0:21:39:**  So these are, I got sort of this concept from Steve Gabriel, the American silver pasturist.  
**0:21:39-0:21:44:**  And it's a tightly planted block of, in our case, we're using willow and poplar at the  
**0:21:44-0:21:45:**  moment.  
**0:21:45-0:21:48:**  And that's what we've suggested in mulberry as well.  
**0:21:48-0:21:53:**  And you effectively let it grow and then bring the livestock into that area to then they  
**0:21:53-0:21:55:**  coppice it, they browse it down.  
**0:21:55-0:21:59:**  So you take them in for quite a short space of time, bring them out again before they  
**0:21:59-0:22:03:**  totally kill the trees, we hope.  
**0:22:03-0:22:04:**  So that's the idea with that.  
**0:22:04-0:22:07:**  We've got two small areas that we're trialing of that.  
**0:22:07-0:22:11:**  We haven't got, they're not old enough yet to have been browsed.  
**0:22:11-0:22:14:**  So we don't quite know how the system's going to work.  
**0:22:14-0:22:18:**  But there is apparently someone doing something similar down in Somerset where they've got  
**0:22:18-0:22:22:**  the old willow plantations for basket weeding.  
**0:22:22-0:22:24:**  So I'm hoping to learn a bit from that.  
**0:22:24-0:22:31:**  Yeah, the idea is once the animals come in and let's say, take some leaves, and you have  
**0:22:31-0:22:35:**  maybe some branches that have been stripped of leaves, you just don't prune the tree at  
**0:22:35-0:22:36:**  all.  
**0:22:36-0:22:39:**  You just leave it as such and then leave it to continue.  
**0:22:39-0:22:41:**  Yeah, I think that's the idea.  
**0:22:41-0:22:46:**  I mean, I think we might experiment with different options as well, because the other option  
**0:22:46-0:22:53:**  is you actually coppice it yourself, but let them browse it from the ground or throw it  
**0:22:53-0:22:54:**  over the hedge for them.  
**0:22:54-0:23:01:**  So that allows you to do it maybe in a more controlled way, but obviously has higher labour.  
**0:23:01-0:23:05:**  So what we quite like to do is maybe try and split the block into two and manage it in  
**0:23:05-0:23:09:**  a slightly different way and see, you know, with a lot of the things that we're trying  
**0:23:09-0:23:14:**  to do, we want to see if we can do at least two different management techniques or ways  
**0:23:14-0:23:19:**  of doing it just to see what happens, because often it's the mistake sometimes, isn't it,  
**0:23:19-0:23:21:**  that teach you something new as well.  
**0:23:21-0:23:25:**  But it's so interesting because, you know, it's a bit premature to talk about this because  
**0:23:25-0:23:29:**  you're only at the beginning, but, you know, hopefully we can get you back on the podcast  
**0:23:29-0:23:35:**  one day and get some information from that, because it seems certain that on terms of  
**0:23:35-0:23:41:**  fodder trees and this whole theme of using trees to feed animals, the question of how  
**0:23:41-0:23:47:**  you bring that food to them in a time efficient manner compared to, you know, hay or anything  
**0:23:47-0:23:51:**  grass related is so crucial and seems like such limiting factors.  
**0:23:51-0:23:56:**  So I'm really excited to hear that you're testing this out and I hope for my sake, at  
**0:23:56-0:24:01:**  least that you succeed and I can inspire myself in your work.  
**0:24:01-0:24:07:**  Well, we hope so, certainly, and I think inevitably when you're trialing these things, it's inefficient,  
**0:24:07-0:24:08:**  isn't it?  
**0:24:08-0:24:12:**  You know, it's like in the same way that, you know, cutting hay probably was pretty  
**0:24:12-0:24:14:**  inefficient when they first started doing it.  
**0:24:14-0:24:19:**  But now we've got combine harvesters and silage makers and all the rest of it, you know, so  
**0:24:19-0:24:26:**  it's, you know, if we know that it works and we know when to cut it and how to feed it,  
**0:24:26-0:24:30:**  then we can find ways of making it more efficient, I think.  
**0:24:30-0:24:36:**  But as a general rule, I think, you know, if you can bring the animal to the food, then  
**0:24:36-0:24:40:**  that's likely to be cheaper and quicker than having to bring the food to the animal.  
**0:24:40-0:24:41:**  Sure.  
**0:24:41-0:24:48:**  While we're on the theme of tree fodder, coming back to the grazed woodland system, have you  
**0:24:48-0:24:52:**  included in that some fodder species?  
**0:24:52-0:24:55:**  So we have, yeah, it's a real mixture.  
**0:24:55-0:24:59:**  So we've got things like, you know, oak that will end up being, you know, probably the  
**0:24:59-0:25:01:**  long term framework.  
**0:25:01-0:25:06:**  But we've got a lot of willow and so what else have we got in there?  
**0:25:06-0:25:08:**  I can't even remember all the species.  
**0:25:08-0:25:11:**  Certainly there's quite a few things.  
**0:25:11-0:25:14:**  I'm saying willow because I was there yesterday.  
**0:25:14-0:25:20:**  And the willow is sort of the one thing that seems to be doing the best in that plantation.  
**0:25:20-0:25:28:**  We planted it in 2018, which was very dry in the UK, I don't know about the rest of  
**0:25:28-0:25:33:**  Europe, but and we lost quite a lot of plants.  
**0:25:33-0:25:39:**  And it surprised me in some ways that the willows were the ones that survived because  
**0:25:39-0:25:40:**  you would think that maybe they wouldn't.  
**0:25:40-0:25:45:**  And I don't know whether they just managed to get their roots down quicker and therefore  
**0:25:45-0:25:46:**  survived.  
**0:25:46-0:25:53:**  So there was even in the height of the drought, there was water in the very lower levels.  
**0:25:53-0:25:59:**  But where the trees hadn't properly established, we did lose a lot.  
**0:25:59-0:26:01:**  And we had, I mentioned earlier, sort of accidental experiment.  
**0:26:01-0:26:05:**  I know we're going to talk about woodchipping a bit, but one of the things that sort of  
**0:26:05-0:26:12:**  really got me excited was we dumped a load of woodchip that we'd made over the fence  
**0:26:12-0:26:17:**  into this bit of the graze woodland, sort of meaning to go and spread it out and mulch  
**0:26:17-0:26:19:**  a whole load of trees and never got around to it.  
**0:26:19-0:26:24:**  So there was a little patch of trees in the corner that had sort of nearly a meter of  
**0:26:24-0:26:26:**  woodchip mulch around them.  
**0:26:26-0:26:29:**  And you would think that that wouldn't be great for them.  
**0:26:29-0:26:34:**  But those trees are now sort of nearly three meters tall and the ones next to them planted  
**0:26:34-0:26:40:**  on the same day with only a sprinkle of mulch are only sort of up to my waist.  
**0:26:40-0:26:50:**  So there's a real sort of powerful demonstration of the power of kind of keeping in, particularly  
**0:26:50-0:26:55:**  in that year, I think, the keeping in the water and keeping the weeds down.  
**0:26:55-0:26:59:**  When you say one meter, you mean one meter thick?  
**0:26:59-0:27:03:**  I mean, yeah, the mulch was a meter deep.  
**0:27:03-0:27:04:**  Wow.  
**0:27:04-0:27:07:**  In places, you know, which is ridiculous.  
**0:27:07-0:27:09:**  I wouldn't replicate it.  
**0:27:09-0:27:13:**  But in that instance, it happened to be just what the trees needed.  
**0:27:13-0:27:20:**  And your analysis of it is you think it comes down to moisture retention or weed suppression  
**0:27:20-0:27:21:**  as you're suggesting?  
**0:27:21-0:27:27:**  I think in that year, I suspect the main factor was water retention.  
**0:27:27-0:27:31:**  We know that mulching obviously keeps down weeds.  
**0:27:31-0:27:33:**  It can modulate extremes of temperature as well.  
**0:27:33-0:27:38:**  So it might well be that in that very hot year, it kept the roots cooler, which enabled  
**0:27:38-0:27:39:**  them to grow more.  
**0:27:39-0:27:43:**  I don't think we had a particularly cold winter.  
**0:27:43-0:27:49:**  So I think, you know, the keeping the soil warm wouldn't have been a particular benefit.  
**0:27:49-0:27:54:**  There's also, you know, we also know that the wood chip mulch boosts the soil biology.  
**0:27:54-0:27:58:**  But I don't think in the first year after planting, that would have been the main factor.  
**0:27:58-0:27:59:**  I suspect it was mainly moisture.  
**0:27:59-0:28:02:**  Well, you are right, we're gonna talk more about wood chips.  
**0:28:02-0:28:08:**  But before we do, I just wanted to finish a bit this understanding really, the different  
**0:28:08-0:28:16:**  systems and if I understand you correctly, then the grazed woodlands, the main purpose  
**0:28:16-0:28:22:**  there is shelter and shade for the animals and really making good grazing out of grass,  
**0:28:22-0:28:27:**  but you know, using the tree as more climatic.  
**0:28:27-0:28:30:**  Let's say how could you say that buffer, I guess?  
**0:28:30-0:28:31:**  Yeah, I think that's fair.  
**0:28:31-0:28:42:**  I think we might end up coppicing or pollarding some of the willow if we think that we can  
**0:28:42-0:28:48:**  do it and it's useful and the stock will benefit from it.  
**0:28:48-0:28:52:**  So we might end up managing some of the trees within that system.  
**0:28:52-0:28:59:**  But mostly it will be just established trees to provide shade and shelter.  
**0:28:59-0:29:05:**  Well since I feel this passion in you for wood chips, I think we should avoid the topic  
**0:29:05-0:29:07:**  any longer.  
**0:29:07-0:29:13:**  Maybe you could actually before we go specifically into wood chips, tell us about your strategy  
**0:29:13-0:29:14:**  in terms of mulching.  
**0:29:14-0:29:20:**  I don't know if you've only put wood chips or if you've tested out different techniques  
**0:29:20-0:29:24:**  or materials to suppress weeds, etc.  
**0:29:24-0:29:25:**  We have.  
**0:29:25-0:29:27:**  We've tested a few.  
**0:29:27-0:29:33:**  And I would say at this point as well that I was quite heavily influenced by an American  
**0:29:33-0:29:37:**  researcher called David Granatstein, who's well worth looking out for.  
**0:29:37-0:29:43:**  And he's done quite a lot of research on weed control in orchard systems in the States.  
**0:29:43-0:29:49:**  And I came across a presentation of his that looked at various strategies.  
**0:29:49-0:29:57:**  And in all the cases that involved an organic mulch, and particularly wood chip, the yields  
**0:29:57-0:30:02:**  from the trees and the establishment was made up for the extra cost of putting it down.  
**0:30:02-0:30:08:**  So that immediately kind of made me interested.  
**0:30:08-0:30:17:**  And I'd had various experiences with wood chip using it as a mulch in pots and using  
**0:30:17-0:30:22:**  it very well composted wood chip as a soil conditioner.  
**0:30:22-0:30:28:**  So sort of in the back of my head, I had it as an interesting product.  
**0:30:28-0:30:36:**  But when we started establishing the trees at East Brook, I tried some mulch mats.  
**0:30:36-0:30:38:**  So the Hessian mulch mats.  
**0:30:38-0:30:43:**  And then also they did deliver some Hessian with a plastic backing one by mistake that  
**0:30:43-0:30:45:**  I hadn't ordered, which I tried as well.  
**0:30:45-0:30:50:**  And I have to say I'd really, really dislike mulch mats.  
**0:30:50-0:30:53:**  I would not recommend them.  
**0:30:53-0:31:00:**  For us anyway, they provided this fantastic home for voles, a lovely waterproof roof.  
**0:31:00-0:31:04:**  And if you then mulch on top of that, you're insulating their home for them.  
**0:31:04-0:31:08:**  So you're giving them this perfect little microclimate under there and then they can  
**0:31:08-0:31:14:**  munch away at your roots without any fear of predators.  
**0:31:14-0:31:19:**  What we found is if you put the wood chip directly onto the soil, I don't know if it's  
**0:31:19-0:31:24:**  because it falls into the runs of the voles or they just don't like the texture of it,  
**0:31:24-0:31:30:**  but we've got very little damage where we mulch directly on the soil.  
**0:31:30-0:31:34:**  So those were our two main strategies.  
**0:31:34-0:31:41:**  Obviously being certified organic, we couldn't use herbicides even if we'd wanted to.  
**0:31:41-0:31:46:**  And the other options really were strimming, which we did a little bit of, but you risk  
**0:31:46-0:31:49:**  damaging the trees and it's just so expensive.  
**0:31:49-0:31:52:**  So we've mostly avoided that.  
**0:31:52-0:32:01:**  So we've come down now really to trying to get a really short grass or whatever's growing  
**0:32:01-0:32:08:**  there initially, and then a good mulch of wood chip to get it established.  
**0:32:08-0:32:18:**  One thing we are interested in trying is cultivating and harrowing a strip, which we then sow with  
**0:32:18-0:32:23:**  a low growing grass seed mix.  
**0:32:23-0:32:30:**  I'm still nervous with our soil that that won't give us good establishment as the mulch,  
**0:32:30-0:32:35:**  but it is something that I think we should look at because one of the problems with the  
**0:32:35-0:32:38:**  wood chip mulch is it doesn't control perennial weeds very well.  
**0:32:38-0:32:45:**  So we do get thistles and docks come up through it, which are a short term problem because  
**0:32:45-0:32:51:**  once the trees are big enough, then we'll be able to graze or mow in between them.  
**0:32:51-0:32:57:**  But for a lot of farmers having that level of weed in their field, I think would be a  
**0:32:57-0:32:59:**  problem.  
**0:32:59-0:33:04:**  We do look at it and think, oh, that looks really messy, but look at all the gold finches  
**0:33:04-0:33:08:**  on it, you know, the butterflies and you know, we got hairs nestling in there.  
**0:33:08-0:33:11:**  So, you know, the the wildlife that it brings in is amazing.  
**0:33:11-0:33:19:**  But equally, you know, there's definitely an element of knowing that farmers will be  
**0:33:19-0:33:24:**  put off if they look at that and go, oh, is this what it means if I have to plant trees  
**0:33:24-0:33:28:**  on my farm, I'm going to have all of these weeds and other farmers are going to be looking  
**0:33:28-0:33:30:**  at me thinking what a weedy field.  
**0:33:30-0:33:36:**  One issue we had with mulch was couch grass and all the kind of rhizobial grasses.  
**0:33:36-0:33:41:**  I don't know if you have it in the climate in the UK, because we do.  
**0:33:41-0:33:42:**  Oh, yeah.  
**0:33:42-0:33:47:**  And we really found that when you exclude, you know, all others, the ones that are able  
**0:33:47-0:33:54:**  to kind of move laterally really came in, then whether that's detrimental or not, or  
**0:33:54-0:33:56:**  more than another one, like we don't really know.  
**0:33:56-0:34:00:**  But that's definitely something like something against not against.  
**0:34:00-0:34:03:**  But yeah, a problem with with mulching we saw.  
**0:34:03-0:34:05:**  Yeah, I would agree.  
**0:34:05-0:34:08:**  I mean, I think the it really depends on what you're trying to grow.  
**0:34:08-0:34:13:**  So I think for most trees, it's not a problem.  
**0:34:13-0:34:17:**  And you know, or it's a minor problem for some for some of the crops.  
**0:34:17-0:34:21:**  I mean, things like we have got raspberries in a couple of rows.  
**0:34:21-0:34:25:**  And you know, some of the perennial weeds for raspberries are a nightmare.  
**0:34:25-0:34:29:**  And that's where the chickens actually really came came into their own.  
**0:34:29-0:34:31:**  They were brilliant amongst the raspberries.  
**0:34:31-0:34:38:**  Whereas, you know, even on something like sea buckthorn, it's big enough and vigorous  
**0:34:38-0:34:41:**  enough that it could cope with couch grass pretty well.  
**0:34:41-0:34:46:**  And, you know, we might have to stream around them once a year just to stop them getting  
**0:34:46-0:34:47:**  too out of control.  
**0:34:47-0:34:54:**  But we're we're hoping, I mean, the other thing to say about which, you know, we're  
**0:34:54-0:34:56:**  not intending to mulch every year.  
**0:34:56-0:34:59:**  It's very much an establishment technique.  
**0:34:59-0:35:03:**  So it's not it's not a permanent ongoing management tool.  
**0:35:03-0:35:09:**  And I think there's a there's a potential risk of, you know, nutrient imbalance if you  
**0:35:09-0:35:11:**  if you keep piling on wood chip every year.  
**0:35:11-0:35:16:**  So it's, you know, it's it's two or three applications during the first four or five  
**0:35:16-0:35:18:**  years, I think is how we're seeing it.  
**0:35:18-0:35:24:**  I'm curious about, you know, you mentioned the study were saying that the increase in  
**0:35:24-0:35:27:**  yields and growth kind of counterbalance the cost.  
**0:35:27-0:35:33:**  But I assume that only applies for kind of high value production, such as fruit trees.  
**0:35:33-0:35:38:**  And then wouldn't necessarily be the case for kind of more biomass or wild species that  
**0:35:38-0:35:39:**  you'd be planting.  
**0:35:39-0:35:41:**  Yeah, it's a good question.  
**0:35:41-0:35:42:**  I'm sure you're right.  
**0:35:42-0:35:47:**  I'm sure I'm sure that effect is is definitely more in high value crops.  
**0:35:47-0:35:55:**  But I mean, again, what we've the speed of establishment, it depends what you want, what  
**0:35:55-0:35:56:**  you want it for.  
**0:35:56-0:36:01:**  So if you know if if in fact all you want is shade to stop your cows overheating in  
**0:36:01-0:36:02:**  the summer.  
**0:36:02-0:36:08:**  Well, actually having that barrier a year earlier, you might well find that you've paid  
**0:36:08-0:36:09:**  that back.  
**0:36:09-0:36:14:**  You know, if you're if your milk production goes up by 10 percent, that might well pay  
**0:36:14-0:36:16:**  for the cost of the wood chipping.  
**0:36:16-0:36:22:**  So I think I think it's hard to know on some of those lower value stuff.  
**0:36:22-0:36:29:**  But certainly the the speed of establishment and initial growth that I've seen in a lot  
**0:36:29-0:36:36:**  of our plantings using the mulch, I think would justify in most circumstances.  
**0:36:36-0:36:39:**  But it would be interesting to it would be interesting to do those figures on the lower  
**0:36:39-0:36:41:**  value trees for sure.  
**0:36:41-0:36:47:**  And some organic orchards use some kind of light tillage to suppress weeds.  
**0:36:47-0:36:50:**  Was that never an option then for you?  
**0:36:50-0:36:52:**  We did consider it.  
**0:36:52-0:36:57:**  I mean, again, interesting looking at David Granatstein's figures, the tillage didn't  
**0:36:57-0:36:58:**  do that well.  
**0:36:58-0:37:01:**  You know, it was good at controlling weeds, but effectively you're destroying the soil  
**0:37:01-0:37:03:**  every time you go through it.  
**0:37:03-0:37:09:**  It's you know, it's quite it's quite destructive, really.  
**0:37:09-0:37:11:**  And the machinery that you need to do is quite expensive.  
**0:37:11-0:37:15:**  I think we were looking at 18000 pounds or something to buy to buy the machine and we  
**0:37:15-0:37:20:**  just it didn't quite fit right with us for the system.  
**0:37:20-0:37:25:**  The other thing for us in particularly where we've got the electric fencing is we can't  
**0:37:25-0:37:31:**  get close enough to the trees to to do that operation anyway.  
**0:37:31-0:37:35:**  So in some of the situations, it wasn't even going to be viable.  
**0:37:35-0:37:41:**  And now that you've okay, you've understood that woodchips are probably your best option.  
**0:37:41-0:37:45:**  Do you use it systematically as you plant new systems out?  
**0:37:45-0:37:51:**  And what is the kind of typical amount you lay on the tree for it to be effective?  
**0:37:51-0:37:52:**  So we do.  
**0:37:52-0:37:56:**  It's a short answer, assuming that we've got enough of it.  
**0:37:56-0:37:57:**  So we're quite lucky.  
**0:37:57-0:38:04:**  We've got a couple of tree surgeons that give us their woodchip and then we also produce  
**0:38:04-0:38:06:**  some of our own.  
**0:38:06-0:38:12:**  So we as we go forward, we didn't do very much planting last year.  
**0:38:12-0:38:15:**  We had a what do you call it?  
**0:38:15-0:38:21:**  A consolidation year, which was quite useful sometimes, I think, to take a step back for  
**0:38:21-0:38:22:**  sure.  
**0:38:22-0:38:28:**  But yeah, we're certainly planning going forward to mulch where we can.  
**0:38:28-0:38:33:**  Certainly looking at is I've just written this book on woodchip.  
**0:38:33-0:38:39:**  So I've done quite a lot of research into various studies about thickness of mulch.  
**0:38:39-0:38:45:**  And the consensus from various studies seems to show it's about 10 or 15 centimetres deep  
**0:38:45-0:38:53:**  is you see any less than 10 and you don't really get enough weed control effect.  
**0:38:53-0:38:59:**  You can go more, obviously, but how much woodchip have you got and how much time have you got  
**0:38:59-0:39:00:**  to put it down?  
**0:39:00-0:39:06:**  You know, so it becomes probably more expensive than it's worth doing up to a point.  
**0:39:06-0:39:10:**  So 10 to 15 centimetres is the normal amount.  
**0:39:10-0:39:18:**  But it does depend a little bit on the woodchip and how small the chips are, what species  
**0:39:18-0:39:20:**  it is, how well rotted it is.  
**0:39:20-0:39:24:**  So there's a few things that might affect how deep you put it on.  
**0:39:24-0:39:30:**  And for applying the woodchip, you're just able to drive in between the tree lines and  
**0:39:30-0:39:33:**  kind of do it in an effective manner with a big trailer.  
**0:39:33-0:39:35:**  Or how do you proceed?  
**0:39:35-0:39:40:**  So we've done it in two main ways.  
**0:39:40-0:39:46:**  Where the trees are closer together, we've done it with a tractor and a trailer and forks  
**0:39:46-0:39:51:**  shoveling off the back, which again is expensive, but you can be very accurate.  
**0:39:51-0:39:57:**  And particularly if you've got a tractor that you can load the trailer up with, you know,  
**0:39:57-0:40:00:**  the heap, that makes it much quicker.  
**0:40:00-0:40:09:**  The other way we've done it is with using a silage feeder wagon, which worked brilliantly,  
**0:40:09-0:40:12:**  as long as the chip is very even.  
**0:40:12-0:40:17:**  So where we produced our own woodchip from the willow, and we knew that it was all the  
**0:40:17-0:40:22:**  right size and didn't have anything else in it, that worked brilliantly.  
**0:40:22-0:40:27:**  And the farm manager just sort of put a little extension on the distributor and we sort of  
**0:40:27-0:40:30:**  hooked it over the electric fence and drove down.  
**0:40:30-0:40:36:**  And that once we got the speed right and how much was coming out, that worked fantastically.  
**0:40:36-0:40:43:**  We did a whole row, you know, in a 400 meter row we did in 15 minutes.  
**0:40:43-0:40:44:**  So that was great.  
**0:40:44-0:40:50:**  But as soon as you get the woodchip from the tree surgeons, where it's different species,  
**0:40:50-0:40:54:**  there's bits of long branch in it, you know, we've had the occasional chainsaw helmet and  
**0:40:54-0:40:58:**  pruning saws left in the pile.  
**0:40:58-0:41:02:**  So the farm manager quite rightly was rather reluctant to risk his machine with that.  
**0:41:02-0:41:05:**  And how does that perform as mulch then?  
**0:41:05-0:41:06:**  It performs fine.  
**0:41:06-0:41:11:**  Chainsaw helmets are great, you just lay them around the tree.  
**0:41:11-0:41:17:**  One thing that pops into my mind is that, you know, at the moment, anyone using woodchips,  
**0:41:17-0:41:22:**  or at least, you know, you're lucky enough to be surrounded by tree surgeons.  
**0:41:22-0:41:28:**  And since you're innovating, and maybe not that many people are using woodchips, you're  
**0:41:28-0:41:30:**  able to access all that biomass.  
**0:41:30-0:41:36:**  But if we were to imagine that woodchips were to become mainstream, let's say, how do you  
**0:41:36-0:41:40:**  see the possibility of scaling such a technique?  
**0:41:40-0:41:45:**  Because all of a sudden, you know, there'll be much less matter available, and it'd be  
**0:41:45-0:41:47:**  a real, real issue.  
**0:41:47-0:41:50:**  Yeah, I think that's a really good question.  
**0:41:50-0:41:54:**  I think it's all I think it might even be starting to happen already.  
**0:41:54-0:42:00:**  So I've heard in some parts of the country, it's getting harder to get hold of woodchip.  
**0:42:00-0:42:07:**  I think part of that is the biomass industry, which is sucking a lot of woodchip.  
**0:42:07-0:42:14:**  But I think also where it had been seen as a as just a waste, people are beginning to  
**0:42:14-0:42:15:**  to see its value.  
**0:42:15-0:42:20:**  Obviously, after they've read my book, the demand will go through the roof.  
**0:42:20-0:42:30:**  So you know, but I think for those, for farmers, I think we need to be starting to think about  
**0:42:30-0:42:35:**  producing our own and building it into our agroforestry systems.  
**0:42:35-0:42:41:**  That's to me, I think where it becomes a sustainable resource that you know, whether you're using  
**0:42:41-0:42:46:**  it to build your soil health or use it for livestock bedding, or you know, use it for  
**0:42:46-0:42:51:**  mulching, but actually thinking about, okay, well, I'm planting, I'm going to plant some  
**0:42:51-0:42:57:**  rows of coppice specifically for that purpose, and I'm going to manage them for that purpose.  
**0:42:57-0:43:00:**  It becomes more efficient.  
**0:43:00-0:43:02:**  And and it you know exactly what's in it.  
**0:43:02-0:43:05:**  So you know, one of the risks of all this stuff from the tree surgeons is you don't  
**0:43:05-0:43:07:**  quite know what's in it.  
**0:43:07-0:43:12:**  You know, probably it's all fine, but it might have some diseased wood in it might have,  
**0:43:12-0:43:16:**  you know, something that you just haven't seen, you know, we did get a bag of rubble  
**0:43:16-0:43:22:**  in it once, you know, he just said, Oh, really, you know, and it's that it's not a massive  
**0:43:22-0:43:25:**  problem, but it's still something that's out of your control.  
**0:43:25-0:43:30:**  And I think as farmers, we should, any input to our farm is an area of risk.  
**0:43:30-0:43:35:**  And if we can be producing our own in a controlled way where we know what's going into it.  
**0:43:35-0:43:41:**  And there's also it's not an area that's been that well researched, but there's there is  
**0:43:41-0:43:46:**  evidence that single species wood chips can have particular effects.  
**0:43:46-0:43:51:**  So we did a innovative farmers field lab with the Soil Association looking at using willow  
**0:43:51-0:43:55:**  wood chip to help control scab in apples.  
**0:43:55-0:44:02:**  So the salicylic acid, which aspirin basically seems to stimulate an immune reaction in trees  
**0:44:02-0:44:06:**  against the disease and make them better able to withstand scab.  
**0:44:06-0:44:12:**  And I suspect there's lots of things like that that are going on within, you know, the  
**0:44:12-0:44:18:**  wood chip accident or the whatever it is that we could start to play around with if we've  
**0:44:18-0:44:19:**  if we've got control.  
**0:44:19-0:44:24:**  And at the moment, most wood chip just comes in as, you know, a whole mix load of stuff.  
**0:44:24-0:44:28:**  So that's that's where I think it gets interesting and where it fits particularly into agroforestry  
**0:44:28-0:44:33:**  systems is giving the farmer their own valuable resource.  
**0:44:33-0:44:38:**  You know, it brings all the other benefits that we've talked about in terms of biodiversity,  
**0:44:38-0:44:46:**  animal welfare, soil health, etc., etc., as well as that that on farm resource that might  
**0:44:46-0:44:49:**  replace something else that you had to buy in.  
**0:44:49-0:44:52:**  And how have you designed that future supply on the farm then?  
**0:44:52-0:44:56:**  Well, we haven't yet is the short answer.  
**0:44:56-0:44:57:**  But we are talking about it.  
**0:44:57-0:45:00:**  So we have, you know, it's a big farm.  
**0:45:00-0:45:02:**  There's quite a lot of trees.  
**0:45:02-0:45:11:**  There's, there's actually an 18 acre woodland that Helen planted up nearly 20 years ago.  
**0:45:11-0:45:17:**  So there's there's actually quite a lot of wood at the moment that we could be chipping.  
**0:45:17-0:45:21:**  But equally, we don't want, you know, it's really important that wood is left in situ  
**0:45:21-0:45:22:**  as well.  
**0:45:22-0:45:25:**  We don't want to mop up every bit of tree and turn it into wood chip because that's  
**0:45:25-0:45:28:**  not helpful either.  
**0:45:28-0:45:33:**  So part of it is identifying trees on the farm that might supply that.  
**0:45:33-0:45:38:**  So we have, for instance, a lot of willows along our riverbank that historically were  
**0:45:38-0:45:40:**  pollarded.  
**0:45:40-0:45:41:**  So that's quite a good start.  
**0:45:41-0:45:45:**  And that's where we got a lot of wood chip from two years ago.  
**0:45:45-0:45:50:**  But then I think it's also building in these very specific.  
**0:45:50-0:45:52:**  So, so far, we haven't put them in.  
**0:45:52-0:45:58:**  But it might be that our next alley planting, for instance, is specifically done for wood  
**0:45:58-0:45:59:**  chip.  
**0:45:59-0:46:06:**  But we have, I would say we haven't yet done those calculations about, about what we want  
**0:46:06-0:46:11:**  to use it for, how much we'll need and how much it could supply.  
**0:46:11-0:46:15:**  So for instance, Helen's got, you know, there are two dairy on their farm, they've got two  
**0:46:15-0:46:17:**  dairy herds at each end of the farm.  
**0:46:17-0:46:24:**  At the moment, they're not using wood chip for bedding, but they could be.  
**0:46:24-0:46:29:**  But that would be a whole, you know, a whole another project to work out what exactly how  
**0:46:29-0:46:30:**  much wood chip would we need?  
**0:46:30-0:46:31:**  Where we get it from?  
**0:46:31-0:46:32:**  Do we have enough trees already?  
**0:46:32-0:46:34:**  What, you know, what do we need to plant?  
**0:46:34-0:46:39:**  So it's a, I think, particularly for a big farm, it's a big, it's a big decision because  
**0:46:39-0:46:45:**  you need to make sure that, you know, if you've got to have many animals are in the two herds,  
**0:46:45-0:46:49:**  I can't remember 300 dairy, you know, you've got to make sure you've got a good supply  
**0:46:49-0:46:53:**  to make sure you don't run out and it's got to be good quality and you know where it comes  
**0:46:53-0:46:54:**  from.  
**0:46:54-0:46:58:**  And I think the design is so important in that respect, because for example, the area  
**0:46:58-0:47:04:**  where I am in France is a mountainous area away from, you know, any cereal production.  
**0:47:04-0:47:09:**  So they're having to truck in all the straw for the bedding.  
**0:47:09-0:47:11:**  And it makes a lot of sense to be using wood chips.  
**0:47:11-0:47:17:**  But then once you've said that, to actually harvest in a time efficient way, wood chips,  
**0:47:17-0:47:21:**  and to have it at a cost where it's competitive with straw at the moment is really difficult,  
**0:47:21-0:47:25:**  because I think it's, it's one thing to design and think out a system which is made to be  
**0:47:25-0:47:32:**  harvested easily, easy to mechanize, you can bring a big chipper in and try and do things  
**0:47:32-0:47:33:**  on a bigger scale.  
**0:47:33-0:47:38:**  But then, you know, going here and there and hedges and trying to pull branches to the  
**0:47:38-0:47:39:**  chipper.  
**0:47:39-0:47:43:**  And that's a bit what we've done on Massey Farm in Greece, and I can tell you, if you  
**0:47:43-0:47:47:**  measure the price of the cubic meter of wood chips, it is, it is, if you're producing it  
**0:47:47-0:47:52:**  yourself and not just, you know, taking advantage of the residue of another activity, such as  
**0:47:52-0:47:54:**  wood surgeons, it's a big theme.  
**0:47:54-0:47:58:**  So I think that's, that's really interesting, actually, designing these efficient, smart  
**0:47:58-0:48:02:**  ways of harvesting that biomass is crucial.  
**0:48:02-0:48:03:**  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  
**0:48:03-0:48:10:**  And I think the other bit of that picture is, is how farmers can collaborate.  
**0:48:10-0:48:15:**  So on your own, you know, maybe you can't afford the machinery to make it happen.  
**0:48:15-0:48:19:**  But if there's a group of 10 of you, or you know, one of you sort of acts as a contractor,  
**0:48:19-0:48:25:**  or there's a cooperative, then actually you can start to introduce some of that scale.  
**0:48:25-0:48:31:**  But it, you know, particularly in hilly areas where it's not so easy to harvest efficiently,  
**0:48:31-0:48:33:**  it does, it becomes a challenge for sure.  
**0:48:33-0:48:38:**  Well, as much as we could sit here and talk about wood chips all night, there are a few  
**0:48:38-0:48:41:**  other questions on my list.  
**0:48:41-0:48:48:**  So the next one, I guess, is, you know, when you think trees and you think livestock, they're  
**0:48:48-0:48:53:**  not necessarily an easy combination and easy things to put together, especially when the  
**0:48:53-0:48:54:**  trees are young.  
**0:48:54-0:49:01:**  So my question now is, how have you dealt with protecting the trees from the livestock  
**0:49:01-0:49:08:**  and how has that kind of integration of young trees into a livestock business been?  
**0:49:08-0:49:14:**  So we do spend quite a lot of time talking about protection and fencing.  
**0:49:14-0:49:20:**  And ultimately, it's a discussion about cost and risk.  
**0:49:20-0:49:23:**  How many trees can you afford to lose?  
**0:49:23-0:49:29:**  And at what point is it worth spending lots of money on expensive fencing and tree guards?  
**0:49:29-0:49:35:**  So we've done and we've worked, I think, at both extremes.  
**0:49:35-0:49:42:**  So when we planted up a few of the alleys in the first year as an experiment just to  
**0:49:42-0:49:46:**  see how they grew and we hadn't put in the electric fencing.  
**0:49:46-0:49:53:**  So we just put in individual tree guards, six foot, so two meter tree guards with a  
**0:49:53-0:49:54:**  post.  
**0:49:54-0:49:55:**  We have a lot of deer.  
**0:49:55-0:49:58:**  So deer were our main concern.  
**0:49:58-0:50:00:**  And those guards seem to work really well.  
**0:50:00-0:50:06:**  But in that first year, we hadn't got the livestock there.  
**0:50:06-0:50:11:**  So year two in that field, we put in the electric fence.  
**0:50:11-0:50:17:**  So we've got a single strand of electric fence at about waist height.  
**0:50:17-0:50:22:**  And that's set up to a mains electric, so 10,000 volts.  
**0:50:22-0:50:27:**  And it's we've got one one strand on each side of the tree row.  
**0:50:27-0:50:28:**  And that works really well.  
**0:50:28-0:50:32:**  We've had no damage from the cows.  
**0:50:32-0:50:38:**  They I think in hindsight, we would have the fences slightly closer.  
**0:50:38-0:50:43:**  So we've got them 1.5 meters from the tree on each side.  
**0:50:43-0:50:49:**  I think we could go down to 1.25 meters or possibly even one because we've ended up with  
**0:50:49-0:50:56:**  quite a wide strip where they're not grazing under the wire, which is a weed problem for  
**0:50:56-0:50:57:**  us.  
**0:50:57-0:51:01:**  And so ideally, what we'd want is that wood chip strip and then grazed.  
**0:51:01-0:51:09:**  And at the moment, we've got a grass bit in between that, which is the worst weed bit.  
**0:51:09-0:51:14:**  Some fields, so Barnfield, which has got all the different fruit and nuts in and the grazed  
**0:51:14-0:51:18:**  woodland, we've deer fenced the entire field.  
**0:51:18-0:51:21:**  The grazed woodland, we got a grant to do that.  
**0:51:21-0:51:27:**  And Barnfield, we just decided that the value and number of the trees in the field was worth  
**0:51:27-0:51:30:**  spending the money on.  
**0:51:30-0:51:35:**  We also rabbit fenced that field because we got a lot of rabbits, which seemed to work  
**0:51:35-0:51:40:**  for the first two years, but then they found a way in, I say tend to.  
**0:51:40-0:51:45:**  So we then ended up having to go around and put a spiral guard on each of the trees in  
**0:51:45-0:51:47:**  that field as well.  
**0:51:47-0:51:52:**  And speaking to other people, that's quite a theme where you think you've done it well  
**0:51:52-0:51:55:**  enough, then you have to go back and do it again.  
**0:51:55-0:52:02:**  So one of the things I would say is to buy the most expensive, biggest stake you can.  
**0:52:02-0:52:08:**  So certainly in the first field, we put in the recommended stake and it was useless and  
**0:52:08-0:52:12:**  we've had to go back and restake pretty much every tree.  
**0:52:12-0:52:16:**  And we should have just spent the money in the first place to do it.  
**0:52:16-0:52:30:**  So yes, it's spending as much as you can without, what's the best way of putting it, spending  
**0:52:30-0:52:39:**  as much as you can without wasting your money, because you can put too much protection in.  
**0:52:39-0:52:42:**  And the question you have to ask yourself is how many of these trees can I afford to  
**0:52:42-0:52:50:**  lose and where we had a big field with fewer numbers of trees and less valuable trees,  
**0:52:50-0:52:58:**  we figured we could lose quite a few before we had to spend £25,000 on deer fencing.  
**0:52:58-0:53:03:**  It was more interesting to put deer fencing with the cost that comes with it than spending  
**0:53:03-0:53:07:**  on good quality tree guards on each individual tree?  
**0:53:07-0:53:11:**  So, yeah, it's a good question.  
**0:53:11-0:53:17:**  I mean, how good a quality tree guard does it have to be?  
**0:53:17-0:53:26:**  And the beauty in a way of the deer guard is it gives you that confidence that they  
**0:53:26-0:53:30:**  just can't get in until the trees are big enough.  
**0:53:30-0:53:36:**  Whereas with individual tree guards, you're always going back and having to check.  
**0:53:36-0:53:40:**  Maybe it was more expensive than it needed to be.  
**0:53:40-0:53:49:**  But when you're spending in that field, a lot of the trees were £15, £20 each.  
**0:53:49-0:53:54:**  So that once you've spent money to plant them an establishment and you've got the cost of  
**0:53:54-0:53:56:**  that, that adds up.  
**0:53:56-0:54:01:**  We've got 800 or so trees in that field.  
**0:54:01-0:54:08:**  I can't quite remember what that figure is, but 800 times 20, it's quite a lot.  
**0:54:08-0:54:10:**  So I'm not saying we got it right.  
**0:54:10-0:54:16:**  I'm not saying we made the right calculation every time, but it's thinking and often you  
**0:54:16-0:54:18:**  make a decision.  
**0:54:18-0:54:22:**  It's easy to say, oh, we can't afford to do that.  
**0:54:22-0:54:29:**  And then two years down the line, you realise that not spending that money up front is costing  
**0:54:29-0:54:30:**  you more money now.  
**0:54:30-0:54:36:**  So as an example, when we talked about the electric fencing on the alleys, there was  
**0:54:36-0:54:40:**  some discussion, well, we could use temporary electric fencing and just move it every time  
**0:54:40-0:54:43:**  we needed to move the animals.  
**0:54:43-0:54:47:**  And the farm manager said, well, hang on, if we have to do that, we'll never move it.  
**0:54:47-0:54:48:**  We won't get around to it.  
**0:54:48-0:54:54:**  Whereas if I've got permanent electric fencing with a bungee at the end of each alley, when  
**0:54:54-0:54:57:**  I want to move the cows, I just lift the bungee and move them.  
**0:54:57-0:55:02:**  So we'll move them all the time and say the management will be better because it's easy.  
**0:55:02-0:55:07:**  Whereas if I've got to faff around moving 400 metres of electric fence every time I  
**0:55:07-0:55:13:**  want to move them, it won't happen or it'll happen less frequently and it will cost more  
**0:55:13-0:55:15:**  money and labour's expensive.  
**0:55:15-0:55:18:**  So it's those decisions in a way.  
**0:55:18-0:55:22:**  And I don't think there's necessarily any right answer.  
**0:55:22-0:55:27:**  I mean, we're interested now in these cactus guards as well, which I think seem to come  
**0:55:27-0:55:30:**  down a bit in price, if I'm right.  
**0:55:30-0:55:35:**  I think we were looking at them at the weekend and sort of £13 each.  
**0:55:35-0:55:39:**  So yes, you know, actually you could buy quite a lot of individual guards at £13 before you  
**0:55:39-0:55:43:**  got to £10,000 on a deer fence.  
**0:55:43-0:55:48:**  So it's, yeah, I think it's a good decision.  
**0:55:48-0:55:52:**  I think the available products are changing all the time as well.  
**0:55:52-0:55:57:**  I think that there's more things available now than there were five years ago even.  
**0:55:57-0:56:03:**  So actually, although my question started with the livestock, it's not the wildlife  
**0:56:03-0:56:07:**  is much more of a challenge than livestock is really because you've just dealt with that  
**0:56:07-0:56:12:**  with a single line permanent fence, which isn't that expensive.  
**0:56:12-0:56:13:**  And then you're...  
**0:56:13-0:56:14:**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**0:56:14-0:56:18:**  So I mean, because we've only got cattle at the moment in that farm, single strand is  
**0:56:18-0:56:19:**  fine.  
**0:56:19-0:56:25:**  I think from memory that was £1.20 a metre, which compares to £12 a metre for deer fencing.  
**0:56:25-0:56:29:**  So, you know, significantly cheaper.  
**0:56:29-0:56:32:**  If we had sheep there as well, we'd probably want a double strand.  
**0:56:32-0:56:36:**  So that would put it up by £20 a metre or something.  
**0:56:36-0:56:41:**  But because, yeah, it's quite cheap, the electric fencing.  
**0:56:41-0:56:49:**  And you can plan for the cattle in a way, whereas wildlife is sometimes less, you know,  
**0:56:49-0:56:50:**  less able to plan.  
**0:56:50-0:56:54:**  So we've, you know, we're keeping out the big deer with that electric fence.  
**0:56:54-0:56:55:**  That works quite well.  
**0:56:55-0:56:58:**  But we also have muntjac deer and we have hares.  
**0:56:58-0:57:04:**  So we do still have to guard the individual trees behind that electric fencing, or certainly  
**0:57:04-0:57:07:**  until they're bigger.  
**0:57:07-0:57:13:**  One theme that I find interesting is knowledge and, you know, the relationship to knowledge  
**0:57:13-0:57:18:**  when you start working with agroforestry, because, first of all, it requires a whole  
**0:57:18-0:57:19:**  new skill set.  
**0:57:19-0:57:24:**  And it seems that in your case, they've kind of tackled that by hiring you.  
**0:57:24-0:57:28:**  And you know, you're a dedicated person on the farm.  
**0:57:28-0:57:33:**  But you know, how are you, how is that new skill set kind of articulating with the rest  
**0:57:33-0:57:34:**  of the farm?  
**0:57:34-0:57:39:**  And how is it to integrate different techniques and different viewpoints on an already functioning  
**0:57:39-0:57:40:**  farm?  
**0:57:40-0:57:46:**  A fascinating question, because I love that interaction.  
**0:57:46-0:57:52:**  And I think, again, I'm lucky in that Helen has quite a large farm.  
**0:57:52-0:57:58:**  So they already have lots of enterprises, they're used to a complicated farming system.  
**0:57:58-0:58:02:**  Having said that, you know, I think there probably were people on the farm team that  
**0:58:02-0:58:09:**  were questioning her sanity when she started planting trees all over the place.  
**0:58:09-0:58:14:**  And understanding the effect that your trees have on the rest of the farming system, I  
**0:58:14-0:58:16:**  think is really important.  
**0:58:16-0:58:23:**  I mean, I talked earlier about the fact that with the alleys, we change them to a rotational  
**0:58:23-0:58:25:**  grazing system.  
**0:58:25-0:58:30:**  And I think one of the things that, you know, although the farm manager at the time perhaps  
**0:58:30-0:58:36:**  wasn't that excited about having trees planted all across his field, he had been really keen  
**0:58:36-0:58:39:**  to trial rotational grazing.  
**0:58:39-0:58:43:**  And so, in a way, we sort of, we enabled that and created a system.  
**0:58:43-0:58:47:**  I mean, obviously, you can do it without planting trees across the farm, but in this instance,  
**0:58:47-0:58:54:**  it opened that opportunity, it sort of almost forced a move into that, that hopefully then  
**0:58:54-0:59:00:**  is beneficial in the long term.  
**0:59:00-0:59:07:**  I think the opportunity for new entrants into agroforestry, I think is one of the things  
**0:59:07-0:59:09:**  actually that really excites me at the moment.  
**0:59:09-0:59:14:**  A lot of farmers want trees, a lot of farmers, you know, some farmers are really keen to  
**0:59:14-0:59:20:**  do it themselves and learn about it, but a lot of them aren't, you know, or love the  
**0:59:20-0:59:24:**  idea of it, but don't want to do it themselves.  
**0:59:24-0:59:28:**  And so being able to bring in people, either that already have some experience or that  
**0:59:28-0:59:35:**  are just keen to focus on the trees is such a great opportunity.  
**0:59:35-0:59:42:**  And I think where, one of the things we're seeing at the Soil Association is a real interest  
**0:59:42-0:59:49:**  in people wanting to come into farming, particularly into horticulture, but into farming as well.  
**0:59:49-0:59:51:**  But it's not easy to find a way in.  
**0:59:51-0:59:57:**  It's not always easy to get the experience or to persuade people to let you do things.  
**0:59:57-1:00:04:**  And I think with trees, there's an opportunity to learn in a lower risk way.  
**1:00:04-1:00:07:**  You know, if you've got to deal with animals, you've got to know what you're doing or the  
**1:00:07-1:00:10:**  animal suffers.  
**1:00:10-1:00:16:**  And even with veg, you know, it mostly needs looking after on a day to day or week to week  
**1:00:16-1:00:17:**  basis.  
**1:00:17-1:00:19:**  Whereas trees are pretty forgiving.  
**1:00:19-1:00:23:**  You know, you have periods of the year when they need stuff, but most of the time you  
**1:00:23-1:00:25:**  can just let them get on with it.  
**1:00:25-1:00:33:**  And that's quite a nice way of bringing new people or part time farmers or, you know,  
**1:00:33-1:00:36:**  forest people, community groups, maybe they want to run trees.  
**1:00:36-1:00:44:**  So there's ways of creating partnerships on farm that I think is not so easy in some other  
**1:00:44-1:00:46:**  sectors or crops.  
**1:00:46-1:00:50:**  It's interesting how you approach it because, you know, farmers already have to master so  
**1:00:50-1:00:53:**  many skills just doing their everyday job.  
**1:00:53-1:00:58:**  And then, you know, agroforestry kind of needs you to add another layer and new skills and  
**1:00:58-1:01:02:**  you really see the way of tackling that through bringing new people in.  
**1:01:02-1:01:06:**  And I think it's really interesting because it's not often answered here.  
**1:01:06-1:01:12:**  And of course, it has its own individual issues, like every time you bring in human relationships  
**1:01:12-1:01:14:**  and social structures.  
**1:01:14-1:01:17:**  But it's definitely a really interesting way of looking at it.  
**1:01:17-1:01:24:**  Well, we know that diverse farming systems are more complicated to run, but in theory,  
**1:01:24-1:01:25:**  they're also more resilient.  
**1:01:25-1:01:29:**  I think they tend to be more interesting.  
**1:01:29-1:01:33:**  A farm, you know, farm the size of Helen's, you know, if it was just an arable farm, it  
**1:01:33-1:01:37:**  could potentially employ two people and some big tractors.  
**1:01:37-1:01:42:**  And instead, I think Helen was saying there's 28 people employed on the farm, you know,  
**1:01:42-1:01:50:**  so that's a much, much more exciting place to be than fields of cereals that are being  
**1:01:50-1:01:52:**  shipped off to the commodity market.  
**1:01:52-1:01:58:**  Instead we've got, you know, we go up and we see our produce in the pub or, you know,  
**1:01:58-1:02:00:**  it just becomes more interesting.  
**1:02:00-1:02:02:**  I think it's more interesting for the farmer.  
**1:02:02-1:02:08:**  And I think if you can, if you could make it work financially, but again, there's opportunities  
**1:02:08-1:02:11:**  to share that risk and reward.  
**1:02:11-1:02:17:**  You know, we're looking at maybe renting out the trees, you know, we establish the trees  
**1:02:17-1:02:21:**  and then we rent them out to someone to make an enterprise.  
**1:02:21-1:02:25:**  And when, you know, it can be share farming, it can be subletting, you know, there's all  
**1:02:25-1:02:26:**  kinds of arrangements.  
**1:02:26-1:02:33:**  There's some really interesting work at Dartington in Devon looking at different tenancy models  
**1:02:33-1:02:38:**  of how you sort of cope with that multi-layered ownership potentially.  
**1:02:38-1:02:41:**  But those are technical difficulties in a way.  
**1:02:41-1:02:49:**  And I think the opportunity to open up the countryside, to open up farming to a much  
**1:02:49-1:02:54:**  wider range of people is, I think it's exciting anyway.  
**1:02:54-1:03:00:**  But we do need a project like yours, you know, sharing that knowledge because just last time  
**1:03:00-1:03:06:**  I was talking with the director of the French Agroforestry Association and he was, you know,  
**1:03:06-1:03:11:**  putting the limiting, the main limiting factor to the lack of expertise and the lack of enough  
**1:03:11-1:03:17:**  people who have that knowledge that are able to, you know, manage successfully agroforestry  
**1:03:17-1:03:19:**  systems or advise them.  
**1:03:19-1:03:25:**  So I think there's a huge amount of work to be done on developing those skills and properly  
**1:03:25-1:03:29:**  training these new people that we can bring on then to farms.  
**1:03:29-1:03:33:**  Well, and if it's a problem in France where you've been doing it for much longer than  
**1:03:33-1:03:37:**  we have, then yeah, that problem is more so I would say in the UK.  
**1:03:37-1:03:40:**  Yeah, there's not many people that have been doing it.  
**1:03:40-1:03:44:**  You know, I'm still very new to this really, you know, relatively speaking.  
**1:03:44-1:03:48:**  So it's, we're all on a very steep learning curve.  
**1:03:48-1:03:56:**  And you know, still on that theme of knowledge, I was wondering, you know, how do you personally  
**1:03:56-1:04:00:**  manage to keep track with all these learnings and that knowledge generation?  
**1:04:00-1:04:04:**  If it's not clear, the reason why I ask that is, you know, when you're constantly testing  
**1:04:04-1:04:10:**  new things out and, you know, you have numerous tests and a lot of knowledge is being generated,  
**1:04:10-1:04:16:**  it's not always easy to keep track of that, you know, while also managing all the practical  
**1:04:16-1:04:17:**  aspects.  
**1:04:17-1:04:20:**  What makes you think I'm keeping track?  
**1:04:20-1:04:26:**  Yeah, I'm not sure that I am keeping track is the short answer.  
**1:04:26-1:04:32:**  So we, I'm, you know, I'm fairly typical, I think, of farmers and I'm not very good  
**1:04:32-1:04:33:**  at keeping records.  
**1:04:33-1:04:37:**  You know, I talk about the importance of keeping records, but I'm not that good.  
**1:04:37-1:04:40:**  The app that I'm using helps a bit.  
**1:04:40-1:04:44:**  So it's relatively easy to record stuff, but you still have to record it, you still have  
**1:04:44-1:04:46:**  to do that work.  
**1:04:46-1:04:55:**  So I guess my solution, I think, is to talk about it a lot and hope that I see it reflected  
**1:04:55-1:04:59:**  back at me at some point.  
**1:04:59-1:05:08:**  And I think the trick sometimes is understanding what the important bit is.  
**1:05:08-1:05:12:**  But of course, that might be different for different people.  
**1:05:12-1:05:17:**  So you know, what's sort of struck me as being really interesting or really important actually  
**1:05:17-1:05:20:**  might be different to what someone else spots.  
**1:05:20-1:05:25:**  And that's why it's important that we're open and that we share what we're doing.  
**1:05:25-1:05:30:**  You know, I want as many people to come around the farm as possible, partly because I want  
**1:05:30-1:05:32:**  to share what's worked and what hasn't.  
**1:05:32-1:05:37:**  But also I learn every time someone comes around the farm, they'll spot something else  
**1:05:37-1:05:41:**  that I haven't noticed or ask me a question about why I've done something.  
**1:05:41-1:05:43:**  And I have to think, well, that's a good question.  
**1:05:43-1:05:44:**  Why did I do that?  
**1:05:44-1:05:47:**  You know, sometimes it isn't something I've done.  
**1:05:47-1:05:49:**  Sometimes it's something that's happened by chance.  
**1:05:49-1:05:55:**  But yeah, how you keep track of it, I think is a good question.  
**1:05:55-1:06:03:**  And I think the more we can get researchers properly involved on farm, the better.  
**1:06:03-1:06:12:**  I think so much research is divorced from the reality of farming and bringing the research  
**1:06:12-1:06:20:**  properly onto farm, measuring things that farmers really want and need, I think is a  
**1:06:20-1:06:22:**  good way as well of keeping track.  
**1:06:22-1:06:28:**  Effectively, it allows that collaboration to properly record what's happening.  
**1:06:28-1:06:36:**  Because it's me just whether I happen to make a note of something one year or not, or else  
**1:06:36-1:06:39:**  it's gone out of my sieve headed brain.  
**1:06:39-1:06:47:**  Yeah, a bit linked to this question of knowledge, there's the idea of diversity on the farm.  
**1:06:47-1:06:50:**  And you've already mentioned that there's a great diversity in the orchard, but you've  
**1:06:50-1:06:56:**  also added a whole other lot of trees that you've planted in different systems.  
**1:06:56-1:07:01:**  That's obviously a lot of different types of trees and of different behaviors and different  
**1:07:01-1:07:02:**  patterns to keep track of.  
**1:07:02-1:07:09:**  And I'm just wondering, how are you finding working with so much diversity?  
**1:07:09-1:07:12:**  I know there's advantages to it on an agronomic level.  
**1:07:12-1:07:16:**  But as you mentioned before, there's also a lot of complexities that come with diversifying  
**1:07:16-1:07:17:**  so much.  
**1:07:17-1:07:24:**  Yeah, the answer is that I'm an amateur of all of them.  
**1:07:24-1:07:28:**  And I think that's probably inevitable.  
**1:07:28-1:07:31:**  So I've always been a generalist.  
**1:07:31-1:07:37:**  So when I was growing vegetables, I was growing, you know, for box schemes and farm shops,  
**1:07:37-1:07:40:**  I was growing 50, 60 different crops.  
**1:07:40-1:07:46:**  So inevitably, I'm never going to be as good at growing any particular one as a specialist  
**1:07:46-1:07:49:**  in that.  
**1:07:49-1:07:58:**  And the other risk of having so much diversity and complexity is that it's actually just  
**1:07:58-1:08:00:**  much harder to keep track of everything.  
**1:08:00-1:08:03:**  I mean, I have a time challenge as well.  
**1:08:03-1:08:07:**  So at the moment, I work half a day a week at the farm.  
**1:08:07-1:08:10:**  I started doing a day a week, I'm now doing half a day.  
**1:08:10-1:08:16:**  So that doesn't allow me enough time to check every tree, you know, every week, which is  
**1:08:16-1:08:23:**  really what I should be doing if I was managing it in a way that a commercial orchard grower  
**1:08:23-1:08:24:**  would manage.  
**1:08:24-1:08:31:**  And I think what we're trying to demonstrate is not necessarily best practice for each  
**1:08:31-1:08:32:**  particular crop.  
**1:08:32-1:08:38:**  Well, for sure, it's not best practice for each particular crop, so that was certainty.  
**1:08:38-1:08:47:**  But it's, you know, what we want to demonstrate is that you can have a low input and potentially,  
**1:08:47-1:08:55:**  I mean, I say this advisedly, but potentially sort of lowish skill system and still be productive  
**1:08:55-1:08:56:**  and useful.  
**1:08:56-1:09:02:**  So, you know, as an example with my almond trees, I mean, apart from the fact I don't  
**1:09:02-1:09:07:**  think there are any very many expert almond growers in the UK anyway, or certainly not  
**1:09:07-1:09:08:**  in UK conditions.  
**1:09:08-1:09:13:**  There's opportunity to be the first expert almond grower of the UK, the advantage of  
**1:09:13-1:09:17:**  niche climate change crops.  
**1:09:17-1:09:24:**  But I, you know, I don't know what I'm doing with almonds because, you know, I've never  
**1:09:24-1:09:25:**  planted them before.  
**1:09:25-1:09:28:**  I mean, I know a little bit more than I did four years ago.  
**1:09:28-1:09:34:**  So, you know, I know roughly what they want and what they like, which isn't what the English  
**1:09:34-1:09:37:**  climate gives them most of the time.  
**1:09:37-1:09:42:**  So, you know, two years running, we had a late frost, which hit the blossom.  
**1:09:42-1:09:45:**  We know that's the main, one of the main risks of growing in the UK.  
**1:09:45-1:09:52:**  My hope is that, you know, the risk of frost in spring is getting less as climate change  
**1:09:52-1:09:53:**  happens.  
**1:09:53-1:09:56:**  So we might get that less often, but it still happens.  
**1:09:56-1:10:01:**  This year we got an even later frost and not only did the blossom get hit, but the foliage  
**1:10:01-1:10:02:**  got hit as well.  
**1:10:02-1:10:06:**  You know, well, oh man.  
**1:10:06-1:10:11:**  And they're getting peach leaf curl disease, which the first year I picked off every leaf  
**1:10:11-1:10:14:**  and you know, we got 60 trees.  
**1:10:14-1:10:18:**  It's not, it's not a big, but it's enough that, you know, quite quickly you can't start  
**1:10:18-1:10:22:**  picking off every leaf, but they seem to grow through it.  
**1:10:22-1:10:32:**  So what I'm growing, I hope is a low maintenance crop that occasionally will give me a crop  
**1:10:32-1:10:33:**  of almonds.  
**1:10:33-1:10:37:**  And if I'm lucky, it will give me a crop one in three years, or maybe eventually two in  
**1:10:37-1:10:42:**  three years or three and four years.  
**1:10:42-1:10:47:**  If it's also giving me a habitat for the chickens when we've got them, or it's improving my  
**1:10:47-1:10:54:**  soil health or it's draining the land, then the profitability or the success of any particular  
**1:10:54-1:10:56:**  tree crop is less crucial.  
**1:10:56-1:10:58:**  I mean, of course we still want it to work.  
**1:10:58-1:11:04:**  So I, you know, I do still prune, you know, some of the trees and, and I, you know, I  
**1:11:04-1:11:09:**  look after them and I try to notice if they've got a problem, but the reality is I'm not  
**1:11:09-1:11:15:**  going to spend a lot of time spraying them or, you know, giving them an intensive management  
**1:11:15-1:11:21:**  regime that you would do if you were a purely commercial orchard of that particular tree  
**1:11:21-1:11:23:**  that you had to make your entire living from.  
**1:11:23-1:11:26:**  So they perform a slightly different function.  
**1:11:26-1:11:34:**  And so in a way, my, my generalist approach potentially becomes an advantage because I'm  
**1:11:34-1:11:38:**  looking at the entire system and I'm looking at how the soil is and how the animals are  
**1:11:38-1:11:39:**  underneath.  
**1:11:39-1:11:43:**  And, you know, so I'm trying to take in that whole picture rather than thinking that I  
**1:11:43-1:11:47:**  need to be the world expert almond grower.  
**1:11:47-1:11:51:**  The other aspect of diversity is that, you know, once you have all these crops, which  
**1:11:51-1:11:54:**  is already a success, you know, then you have to sell them.  
**1:11:54-1:12:00:**  And in your case, that's those additional productions are easily absorbed and sold through  
**1:12:00-1:12:02:**  the existing commercial channels.  
**1:12:02-1:12:03:**  Yes.  
**1:12:03-1:12:10:**  So certainly so far, everything we've produced has been sold through the village pub, which  
**1:12:10-1:12:14:**  Helen's partner runs.  
**1:12:14-1:12:23:**  The I suspect at some point in the, in maybe two or three years, we'll have more than they  
**1:12:23-1:12:29:**  can cope with, at which point we have, we have options.  
**1:12:29-1:12:35:**  So there are a number of local box schemes, for instance, that we could potentially sell  
**1:12:35-1:12:37:**  produce to.  
**1:12:37-1:12:46:**  There's a agroforestry specific market stall in London that again, might take some of the  
**1:12:46-1:12:48:**  more unusual stuff.  
**1:12:48-1:12:56:**  We also, Helen has a lot of experience in creating products and marketing.  
**1:12:56-1:13:01:**  So it might well be that we then start to look at creating, you know, juices or value  
**1:13:01-1:13:08:**  added products that again could be sold through the farm shop and the pub in the village.  
**1:13:08-1:13:14:**  So there's, I think we're in an unusual position in that sense, and that there's already some  
**1:13:14-1:13:21:**  markets opportunities there, but also an understanding within the business about product creation  
**1:13:21-1:13:26:**  and marketing that not necessarily every farm would have.  
**1:13:26-1:13:30:**  The other last thing I wanted to clarify a bit is that you mentioned at the moment you  
**1:13:30-1:13:34:**  have between half a day and one day on the farm.  
**1:13:34-1:13:42:**  So you actually kind of oversee a lot of the design and the strategy, but then you have  
**1:13:42-1:13:48:**  other people on the farm also kind of helping in the management, like I guess mowing and  
**1:13:48-1:13:50:**  all the maintenance that has to go with it.  
**1:13:50-1:13:51:**  Yeah, you're right.  
**1:13:51-1:13:54:**  You spotted that I don't do any of the work.  
**1:13:54-1:13:58:**  That's not what I meant.  
**1:13:58-1:14:04:**  So yeah, so at the moment, Paul, my colleague does a lot of the actual work.  
**1:14:04-1:14:10:**  So I mean, again, we're trying to set it up as relatively low maintenance.  
**1:14:10-1:14:18:**  So the main jobs are mowing, mowing and strimming and sort of remulching some of the trees at  
**1:14:18-1:14:20:**  the moment.  
**1:14:20-1:14:23:**  And then obviously harvesting and a bit of pruning.  
**1:14:23-1:14:31:**  But as the system expands, we're definitely needing to find people to take on bits of  
**1:14:31-1:14:32:**  it.  
**1:14:32-1:14:39:**  So it becomes, and again, I think this is where the opportunities for new entrants come  
**1:14:39-1:14:40:**  in.  
**1:14:40-1:14:46:**  We now have in Barnfield, for instance, we now have eight acres of established trees  
**1:14:46-1:14:51:**  just about to start coming into some kind of full production.  
**1:14:51-1:14:57:**  That could be a fantastic opportunity for someone to come in and run.  
**1:14:57-1:15:05:**  So we're the, I think you're right.  
**1:15:05-1:15:11:**  In a way, my role is around the development and new design, but we do also need to make  
**1:15:11-1:15:17:**  sure that we properly maintain and manage them and make them fulfill their potential.  
**1:15:17-1:15:23:**  And that's an interesting challenge, which is becoming more important as the system establishes.  
**1:15:23-1:15:28:**  And I guess to always have the management and the design closely linked together, because  
**1:15:28-1:15:33:**  if you're ever going to be improving the systems, and it seems that every year with experience,  
**1:15:33-1:15:39:**  you're learning things and putting new things into place, it's really valuable to have those  
**1:15:39-1:15:41:**  aspects working closely together.  
**1:15:41-1:15:42:**  Yeah, it's crucial.  
**1:15:42-1:15:48:**  And we're moving more slowly than we had initially anticipated.  
**1:15:48-1:15:53:**  So when we looked initially at the 200 acres, we thought we might plant within five or six  
**1:15:53-1:15:54:**  years.  
**1:15:54-1:16:01:**  And after five years, we've planted just under half of it.  
**1:16:01-1:16:06:**  But actually, that was quite a deliberate decision to slow down and to learn.  
**1:16:06-1:16:08:**  It's also an expensive business.  
**1:16:08-1:16:12:**  So there's a cost factor to that as well.  
**1:16:12-1:16:17:**  But every year is different.  
**1:16:17-1:16:21:**  So we've had wet years, we've had dry years, we're starting to understand what does well.  
**1:16:21-1:16:24:**  The cherries initially did really well.  
**1:16:24-1:16:26:**  And then we had a horrible wet year.  
**1:16:26-1:16:31:**  And a quarter of the field, they all looked horrible and started to drop it out because  
**1:16:31-1:16:32:**  they didn't like it.  
**1:16:32-1:16:37:**  So let's really understand what's still doing well after five years.  
**1:16:37-1:16:42:**  And then we can be pretty certain that we can plant that with confidence.  
**1:16:42-1:16:50:**  And we're refining our management techniques, where we invested in a small flail mower this  
**1:16:50-1:16:57:**  year to just to speed up some of the keeping the grass down a little bit.  
**1:16:57-1:17:03:**  And in some ways, it didn't matter because we would get the big kit in.  
**1:17:03-1:17:04:**  But you're not in control of that.  
**1:17:04-1:17:07:**  You know, we're at the mercy of the weather.  
**1:17:07-1:17:10:**  And you know, we're one little field at the edge of the farm.  
**1:17:10-1:17:13:**  It's never the priority for the rest of the farm stuff.  
**1:17:13-1:17:20:**  So having our own little flail mower means we can sort of pop out when we need to and  
**1:17:20-1:17:23:**  actually get around the field.  
**1:17:23-1:17:29:**  So as the system progresses and starts to bring in a little bit income as well, so we  
**1:17:29-1:17:31:**  can justify spending a bit more money on it.  
**1:17:31-1:17:33:**  I think it will become easier to manage.  
**1:17:33-1:17:44:**  But part of it, I guess, is understanding when to invest and what to invest in and how  
**1:17:44-1:17:45:**  valuable these crops are.  
**1:17:45-1:17:51:**  We did a 25 year business plan at the start, which, you know, in some ways is almost not  
**1:17:51-1:17:53:**  worth the paper it's written on.  
**1:17:53-1:17:57:**  But it does give you an idea of cash flow and when you might expect income to come in.  
**1:17:57-1:18:00:**  But yeah.  
**1:18:00-1:18:01:**  OK.  
**1:18:01-1:18:06:**  And you know, we started the conversation, you mentioned mistakes.  
**1:18:06-1:18:12:**  And you know, that's definitely almost some of the most interesting things that we can  
**1:18:12-1:18:17:**  discuss because there's so much, so many things that can be learned for our listeners.  
**1:18:17-1:18:22:**  And do you have any kind of standout mistakes or some that you think would be particularly  
**1:18:22-1:18:28:**  relevant to people setting up systems out there that you like to share with our listeners?  
**1:18:28-1:18:29:**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**1:18:29-1:18:35:**  I mean, I guess one of them is sort of almost a mistake and almost not, in that it was planned  
**1:18:35-1:18:40:**  that it would be a mistake, which is the fact that we planned so many different things knowing  
**1:18:40-1:18:44:**  that some of them would fail.  
**1:18:44-1:18:50:**  And I guess one of the bits of advice is to plant a few things immediately, even if you're  
**1:18:50-1:18:54:**  not sure what you're going to be doing, actually just plant a few trees of a few different  
**1:18:54-1:19:00:**  species and see what grows, particularly if you're being more experimental.  
**1:19:00-1:19:03:**  So one thing you can do is look around you and see what's growing well.  
**1:19:03-1:19:08:**  But if you're trying to grow unusual things, you might have no idea.  
**1:19:08-1:19:09:**  I think it's worth trialing it.  
**1:19:09-1:19:14:**  I think the climate particularly is changing so quickly.  
**1:19:14-1:19:19:**  The historical wisdom about what works and what doesn't work is not always worth listening  
**1:19:19-1:19:20:**  to anymore.  
**1:19:20-1:19:27:**  But we've certainly had some trees fail and some of them predictably so, like the cherries  
**1:19:27-1:19:29:**  in the heavy clay.  
**1:19:29-1:19:31:**  But then almonds are not supposed to like clay either.  
**1:19:31-1:19:36:**  And they're doing very well, although they're not fruiting that well, they're growing very  
**1:19:36-1:19:37:**  well.  
**1:19:37-1:19:39:**  So that's one thing.  
**1:19:39-1:19:44:**  The other thing we, so we, as I said, we've got this heavy clay, it's quite hard to plant  
**1:19:44-1:19:45:**  into.  
**1:19:45-1:19:46:**  It's quite hard work.  
**1:19:46-1:19:50:**  So we created a slit using a subsoiler.  
**1:19:50-1:19:56:**  So a single slit through the soil to plant into, which worked brilliantly.  
**1:19:56-1:19:59:**  It was really easy to plant, speeded it up, no end.  
**1:19:59-1:20:03:**  And then we had this really dry year in 2018.  
**1:20:03-1:20:08:**  And the crack opened up where we'd created the slit.  
**1:20:08-1:20:11:**  And we had a meter and a half deep crack at some points.  
**1:20:11-1:20:14:**  I mean, it was really, really deep.  
**1:20:14-1:20:18:**  And of course, this poor little tree is sitting there at the top of the slit with no water  
**1:20:18-1:20:20:**  and no root development.  
**1:20:20-1:20:23:**  So we definitely learned from that.  
**1:20:23-1:20:28:**  What I think we'll probably do, I think we would still create the slit.  
**1:20:28-1:20:34:**  But what we would do is plant maybe 15 centimeters to one side of it so that you're not right  
**1:20:34-1:20:35:**  in that slit.  
**1:20:35-1:20:42:**  And the other thing we found was the trees that we planted in January mostly survived.  
**1:20:42-1:20:48:**  The ones that we planted in March, beginning of March, mostly didn't.  
**1:20:48-1:20:56:**  So even having an extra six weeks or so to develop seemed to make a difference.  
**1:20:56-1:21:03:**  And then the ones that we mulched pretty much all survived and the ones that we didn't failed.  
**1:21:03-1:21:07:**  So I think we could still use the slit planting method because it made it so much easier.  
**1:21:07-1:21:11:**  But we would offset it and mulch.  
**1:21:11-1:21:14:**  So those are probably the two big ones.  
**1:21:14-1:21:20:**  And the other thing, and again, I'm not sure if we could have predicted this, but in one  
**1:21:20-1:21:26:**  aisle, for instance, we've got quince trees, which we've interplanted with sea buckthorn.  
**1:21:26-1:21:31:**  And the quince have done so badly that the sea buckthorn are now bigger than the tree.  
**1:21:31-1:21:33:**  So we probably should have had it the other way around.  
**1:21:33-1:21:37:**  But again, I don't know if that's a mistake or just the learning.  
**1:21:37-1:21:39:**  Yeah, well, thanks, Ben.  
**1:21:39-1:21:41:**  Thank you so much for sharing all of this with us.  
**1:21:41-1:21:45:**  And I learned a lot and I'm sure our listeners will as well.  
**1:21:45-1:21:51:**  We hope we can get a place in your busy schedule for another episode sometime in the next two  
**1:21:51-1:21:52:**  years.

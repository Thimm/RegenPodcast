### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 01 Aug 2022 17:14:42)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:48:**  So hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:53:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we have a bit of a special session because for once  
**0:00:53-0:00:59:**  I'm actually sitting here with a guest that we're going to have on the show and I'm really  
**0:00:59-0:01:02:**  happy to invite Mark, Mark Leiber.  
**0:01:02-0:01:06:**  Mark is actually my neighbour, we live in the same little village in Portugal so this  
**0:01:06-0:01:08:**  is really really cool.  
**0:01:08-0:01:17:**  He's also a friend of mine and Mark is an expert and a practitioner of syntropic agriculture.  
**0:01:17-0:01:21:**  We've had 40 episodes and not one of them yet has been syntropic agriculture so we thought  
**0:01:21-0:01:26:**  that it was really about time to get somebody on that could really give us an introduction  
**0:01:26-0:01:31:**  to what syntropic agriculture is and I thought Mark was the perfect person for this.  
**0:01:31-0:01:38:**  So without further ado I'm going to let Mark introduce himself and tell us a bit more about  
**0:01:38-0:01:40:**  his story and how he ended up here.  
**0:01:40-0:01:41:**  Welcome on the show Mark.  
**0:01:41-0:01:49:**  Thank you Dimitri for this invitation and the special honour to be here with all of  
**0:01:49-0:01:53:**  you listeners today.  
**0:01:53-0:02:01:**  As Dimitri said my name is Mark Leiber, I am born in Germany, I grew up in the United  
**0:02:01-0:02:06:**  States then with 18 years old I moved back to Germany.  
**0:02:06-0:02:13:**  From there I realised that I wanted to work with plants, it was when I was about 20, 21.  
**0:02:13-0:02:18:**  My step brother started a permaculture project in Kenya to support a local family, a small  
**0:02:18-0:02:24:**  landowner and it was a project that really touched me because my brother was being really  
**0:02:24-0:02:32:**  selfless and just really investing most of his money into this property, building houses,  
**0:02:32-0:02:37:**  planting fruit trees, buying the land itself, buying water pumps, creating all kinds of  
**0:02:37-0:02:42:**  structures for this local family to start being self-sufficient and he started, he went  
**0:02:42-0:02:46:**  to Australia to do a course with Jeff Loughton in permaculture.  
**0:02:46-0:02:49:**  He started talking a lot about permaculture and he was applying all these techniques there  
**0:02:49-0:02:56:**  on this property in Kenya and it moved me when he started doing this and made me want  
**0:02:56-0:03:04:**  to get into the same thing because I really saw a lot of truth in the idea of not sending  
**0:03:04-0:03:12:**  money to countries where people have lack of food and other resources but instead going  
**0:03:12-0:03:17:**  there and helping them to sustainably look after themselves.  
**0:03:17-0:03:23:**  So I asked him what he thought that I could do in order to help him because I wanted to  
**0:03:23-0:03:25:**  get on board with this project with him.  
**0:03:25-0:03:30:**  He's a golf teacher by profession which would allow him to spend the winters travelling  
**0:03:30-0:03:38:**  to Australia, to Kenya and these places but so he has no formal education in agriculture  
**0:03:38-0:03:46:**  and so he said well if you could study agriculture then we would have somebody with a deeper  
**0:03:46-0:03:54:**  insight into the whole technicalities of the project and we could maybe make more of these  
**0:03:54-0:04:01:**  kind of projects and so I got really excited about this idea and I started trying to register  
**0:04:01-0:04:08:**  for agricultural degree and it turned out to be super difficult because my diploma from  
**0:04:08-0:04:12:**  the US was not sufficient to enrol in university in Europe.  
**0:04:12-0:04:17:**  I probably would have also not gotten in university in the US because I had never done an SAT  
**0:04:17-0:04:26:**  and you know I had kind of been a bit careless in my high school years about being in school  
**0:04:26-0:04:31:**  and so you know like I then had these consequences that I actually had a very difficult time  
**0:04:31-0:04:38:**  getting into a school and well I found this one school in the Netherlands and it seemed  
**0:04:38-0:04:46:**  really appealing and it was kind of like it just somehow happened that it was a funny  
**0:04:46-0:04:53:**  story but in the end they admitted me into the study programme and I mean from there  
**0:04:53-0:04:56:**  a lot of really beautiful things came.  
**0:04:56-0:05:02:**  The study itself I would say was not really what affected me so like of course it had  
**0:05:02-0:05:08:**  imprint on me because we learned a lot about the technicalities of how plants work, the  
**0:05:08-0:05:14:**  morphology, the processes on a cell level and this kind of stuff is really interesting,  
**0:05:14-0:05:17:**  genetics, breeding, all this kind of stuff we learned about.  
**0:05:17-0:05:23:**  We also had some classes about economics and marketing classes but in general it was a  
**0:05:23-0:05:30:**  very conventional you know it was mainly horticulture so greenhouse, how's it called, ornamental  
**0:05:30-0:05:38:**  plant growing but also like tomatoes and cucumbers and then a bit of like arable land agriculture  
**0:05:38-0:05:45:**  like but really limited like potatoes, corn and almost already stopped there like wheat  
**0:05:45-0:05:50:**  or something like this was hardly ever addressed so this is like really like corn, potatoes  
**0:05:50-0:05:56:**  and greenhouses like really like the Dutch kind of thing you know.  
**0:05:56-0:06:03:**  You know we had the good thing about the studies was that it had attracted quite an international  
**0:06:03-0:06:08:**  group of people with different backgrounds and different fields of interest and we also  
**0:06:08-0:06:19:**  had a lot of freedom to how does it say like construct the studies as we saw fit to ourselves  
**0:06:19-0:06:26:**  and our interests so we had like two years of actual theoretical studies and then the  
**0:06:26-0:06:31:**  third and the fourth year you're pretty much free to do whatever you saw fit you know you  
**0:06:31-0:06:38:**  had to meet like certain requirements and stay within the structure of the whole expectations  
**0:06:38-0:06:45:**  but there was like if you knew how to operate within that and especially if you had like  
**0:06:45-0:06:54:**  a capacity of writing emotionally profound and how's it called like messages to the board  
**0:06:54-0:06:59:**  member like the directory of the boards you know you could get like special requests through  
**0:06:59-0:07:05:**  to make like things that were maybe not like entirely foreseen but that you like you know  
**0:07:05-0:07:09:**  if you were like really like determined and you could express that in some kind of way  
**0:07:09-0:07:17:**  then you could get away with doing some quite cool stuff and so you know I in the first  
**0:07:17-0:07:23:**  study year it was really when the first moments when I really started working with trees I  
**0:07:23-0:07:29:**  did an internship in an organic tree nursery flores naturalica bomb and then doing the  
**0:07:29-0:07:36:**  Netherlands and so flores he has a really interesting assortment of all kinds of fruit  
**0:07:36-0:07:44:**  varieties mainly focusing at the time he was mainly focusing on heritage apple pear cherry  
**0:07:44-0:07:50:**  plum and so on so forth varieties and I learned a number of things there first of all like  
**0:07:50-0:07:56:**  I planted my first trees in my life there then you know like how to measure row how  
**0:07:56-0:08:02:**  to you know prepare soil how to dig how to graft how to prune he taught me how to use  
**0:08:02-0:08:07:**  chainsaws he taught me how to use a tractor he taught me how to climb trees with the harness  
**0:08:07-0:08:12:**  how to prune safely because he was also doing tree maintenance and how to use wood chippers  
**0:08:12-0:08:17:**  and so like the whole package like everything like he gave me like pretty much like the  
**0:08:17-0:08:24:**  crash course of everything it was really practical approach and I really like self-learning approach  
**0:08:24-0:08:28:**  and I think like being with flores to me was like the perfect preparation for going to  
**0:08:28-0:08:35:**  ernst because flores like the first time he ever let me use a chainsaw I think I was wearing  
**0:08:35-0:08:41:**  shorts and just a normal t-shirt it was summer never used a chainsaw in my life and he just  
**0:08:41-0:08:46:**  like shows me how to turn it on and he's like okay this is how you turn it on two more important  
**0:08:46-0:08:50:**  things this is how you put the brake this is how you turn it off make sure you have  
**0:08:50-0:08:55:**  like a good position with your feet like that you're standing strong and just have fun and  
**0:08:55-0:09:00:**  he leaves and he leaves me there with the chainsaw by myself and like these kind of  
**0:09:00-0:09:06:**  situations would happen like very regularly where I remember where I was really high up  
**0:09:06-0:09:11:**  in an oak tree I was like 15 meters high up in an oak tree that we're pruning he had already  
**0:09:11-0:09:15:**  finished his tree which was next to mine yeah and it was the first time that I was kind  
**0:09:15-0:09:24:**  of like doing this like seriously and so I was pruning this tree and I did like two or  
**0:09:24-0:09:32:**  three mistakes I broke the window of the client's house which was not like so dramatic as it  
**0:09:32-0:09:37:**  sounds now but you know we could fix it but you know there's like this element of you  
**0:09:37-0:09:42:**  know he was not always present and you have to like be able to adapt to situations and  
**0:09:42-0:09:46:**  learn really fast yourself yeah I think that was perfect preparation for going to ernst  
**0:09:46-0:09:50:**  farm because so you have to tell us a bit about who ernst is because many people will  
**0:09:50-0:09:55:**  be like ernst but who is ernst like what is this what's this ernst guy that keeps coming  
**0:09:55-0:09:59:**  up in the conversation all right well so you know I started having lots of questions to  
**0:09:59-0:10:04:**  my teachers especially after having done this internship because they're teaching us really  
**0:10:04-0:10:11:**  conventional ideas and methods and they're just like okay we have to do more GMO we have  
**0:10:11-0:10:16:**  to focus on breeding more to make the crops more specific to threats of climate change  
**0:10:16-0:10:21:**  to water scarcity we have to be more efficient in the use of fertilizers so we can be more  
**0:10:21-0:10:26:**  sustainable in the use of them we have to dial in the use of pesticides and really target  
**0:10:26-0:10:32:**  them and I was like guys do you really think that this has a future like I am now I was  
**0:10:32-0:10:38:**  then 22 years old I'm now 26 and so I told him I was like you know when I'm 50 years  
**0:10:38-0:10:43:**  old I don't know if I will still be able to feed myself and a family from doing this kind  
**0:10:43-0:10:50:**  of stuff or if we would be able to feed humanity as you guys so loudly proclaim applying these  
**0:10:50-0:10:55:**  techniques and my teachers they couldn't ever answer me these questions with a group of  
**0:10:55-0:11:03:**  friends of mine we started this initiative it was like aside from our study program to  
**0:11:03-0:11:07:**  build a food forest next to the university there was like a big food forest movement  
**0:11:07-0:11:14:**  in the Netherlands and we kind of got inspired by that and wanted to make our own food forest  
**0:11:14-0:11:21:**  next to the university looking to plant it in a more rational and economically oriented  
**0:11:21-0:11:28:**  way okay that was one of the initial ideas and in this whole process many very special  
**0:11:28-0:11:34:**  things happen like I remember one of those moments was when we met Mark Shepherd he had  
**0:11:34-0:11:40:**  been a big inspiration at the time yeah I read his book and you know that was also like  
**0:11:40-0:11:45:**  really significant introduction to the whole subject of regenerative agriculture and agroforestry  
**0:11:45-0:11:54:**  to me at the time and you know but like I think two weeks after we got to know Mark  
**0:11:54-0:12:02:**  Shepherd we had organized this four-day visit for Ernst Gutch to visit us there in the Netherlands  
**0:12:02-0:12:09:**  and like I swear in those four days I learned more about the things that I came to university  
**0:12:09-0:12:15:**  to learn about and everything that I thought would be significant to what I wanted to achieve  
**0:12:15-0:12:22:**  in agriculture in my life than I had in the previous two years of studying and so Ernst  
**0:12:22-0:12:30:**  had like very immediate and very big impact on me and so he is the person that developed  
**0:12:30-0:12:38:**  this whole concept of syntropic agroforestry he has been yeah working on this I would say  
**0:12:38-0:12:46:**  for over 50 years I mean he grew up doing agriculture in a smallholder family farm in  
**0:12:46-0:12:53:**  Switzerland that was still applying very traditional methods and he still has very deep memories  
**0:12:53-0:12:59:**  of the crop rotations and the agroforestry systems that they had at the time so they  
**0:12:59-0:13:05:**  also had all these hedges all these windbreaks all these fruit trees overshadowing the grain  
**0:13:05-0:13:10:**  fields and everything interconnected with the livestock with the different crops and  
**0:13:10-0:13:16:**  so he still had like very he still has like very very strong memories of this that he  
**0:13:16-0:13:23:**  would also share with me and you know this very overall inspiring person he worked in  
**0:13:23-0:13:30:**  breeding afterwards and from what I understand at the time when he was working in breeding  
**0:13:30-0:13:36:**  he was working on creating clover varieties that were more productive and especially that  
**0:13:36-0:13:43:**  were more resistant to the I think it was iron toxicity in the atmosphere that was produced  
**0:13:43-0:13:52:**  by the pollution by the airplanes so something made by airplanes that was causing clover  
**0:13:52-0:13:59:**  varieties to start going weaker I don't know if this is actually really true this is something  
**0:13:59-0:14:04:**  that a friend of mine told me once I'd never heard this from the mouth of Ernst that this  
**0:14:04-0:14:08:**  was the reason why he was breeding but so he was in charge of this breeding program  
**0:14:08-0:14:17:**  for clover he went to I think he collected over 500 heritage clover varieties from different  
**0:14:17-0:14:25:**  farms in Switzerland and these clover varieties had been bred specifically to each farm for  
**0:14:25-0:14:32:**  over 500 years so the farmers would be breeding their own clover on their farm and he then  
**0:14:32-0:14:39:**  went after this 500 year selection program process to over 400 or 500 farms selected  
**0:14:39-0:14:44:**  the most beautiful clovers and made all kinds of crosses from them and out of it resulted  
**0:14:44-0:14:51:**  a clover variety which is actually still widely used here in Europe nowadays so like 40 years  
**0:14:51-0:15:01:**  later it's still being like widely used incredible and so but he started asking himself if because  
**0:15:01-0:15:07:**  of the nature of his work if it would not be more intelligent to instead of looking  
**0:15:07-0:15:16:**  for varieties and genotypes that were more resistant to the mismanagement or the mistreatment  
**0:15:16-0:15:22:**  that we were giving the plants if it would not be more intelligent to create conditions  
**0:15:22-0:15:28:**  in which the plants would feel well out of themselves so he started making a lot of experiments  
**0:15:28-0:15:33:**  with intercropping there in Switzerland he had made also some experiments with where  
**0:15:33-0:15:41:**  he had like plants inside boxes and he would like for example he would have corn and beans  
**0:15:41-0:15:47:**  and something else inside a box and he had windows where he could take away the side  
**0:15:47-0:15:55:**  of the box and look at the roots of the plants and so for example he injected colorants into  
**0:15:55-0:16:00:**  one species of plant inside that box and he could see how long it would take for that  
**0:16:00-0:16:05:**  colorant to appear in the root system of another species inside the same box and so he was  
**0:16:05-0:16:11:**  already working on the stuff in the 60s and 70s.  
**0:16:11-0:16:12:**  Wow phenomenal.  
**0:16:12-0:16:18:**  And you know he was then making a lot of connections with how plants work together and he was actually  
**0:16:18-0:16:25:**  seeing that he was having increases in yield when he would plant corn and potatoes together  
**0:16:25-0:16:32:**  that he would harvest 30% more potatoes than in a monoculture and 30% more corn and so  
**0:16:32-0:16:42:**  he was having quite some significant results and afterwards he decided to ask to leave  
**0:16:42-0:16:50:**  his job because he wanted to commit himself full time to his research in plant consortia  
**0:16:50-0:16:55:**  and agroforestry instead of continuing on the breeding.  
**0:16:55-0:17:01:**  He left his job and unfortunately, well what does it say unfortunately, well he couldn't  
**0:17:01-0:17:06:**  find a piece of land in Europe to work on because the prices were quite high at the  
**0:17:06-0:17:12:**  time and he moved with his family to Costa Rica and he was working there for six or seven  
**0:17:12-0:17:19:**  years from what I understand in the program with refugees where there were I think it  
**0:17:19-0:17:26:**  was Nicaraguan refugees that they were teaching sustainable agriculture.  
**0:17:26-0:17:33:**  Please Ernst excuse me if I say anything that is not 100% accurate but this is like how  
**0:17:33-0:17:39:**  I remember and he worked there for six or seven years and he started making these more  
**0:17:39-0:17:43:**  like simplified agroforestry systems like alley cropping.  
**0:17:43-0:17:50:**  It had like some elements of natural succession but he realized that by just making these  
**0:17:50-0:17:58:**  alley cropping systems or that by you know they were quite complex.  
**0:17:58-0:18:04:**  They had support species, they had fruit trees and then they had grain and tuber crops so  
**0:18:04-0:18:09:**  corn, beans, manioc or cassava in the in between rows.  
**0:18:09-0:18:18:**  They had bananas and other fruit trees and then support species like yeah just trees  
**0:18:18-0:18:24:**  for growing good foliage, making shade and windbreak and a supportable microclimate for  
**0:18:24-0:18:25:**  the other plants.  
**0:18:25-0:18:31:**  And he was working there on really rich soils from what I remember but he was having trouble  
**0:18:31-0:18:36:**  with the productions and he was realizing that if he wanted to continue producing in  
**0:18:36-0:18:42:**  these systems that he was never able to become independent of external inputs so that he  
**0:18:42-0:18:51:**  would have to keep adding some sort of fertilizer in order to maintain productivity.  
**0:18:51-0:18:56:**  And it's what he wrote about in his text I think he published in 1992 breakthrough in  
**0:18:56-0:18:57:**  agriculture.  
**0:18:57-0:19:04:**  He writes that that was his like main critique at himself at that point that with this alley  
**0:19:04-0:19:10:**  crop with this complex alley cropping system he still could not move away from external  
**0:19:10-0:19:16:**  inputs and he still could not achieve that which he was looking for to work solely based  
**0:19:16-0:19:22:**  on the mechanisms that we find in nature in a natural ecosystem.  
**0:19:22-0:19:27:**  After six years of this work he moved to Brazil where he bought his farm which maybe some  
**0:19:27-0:19:31:**  of you guys listening to you know parts of the story.  
**0:19:31-0:19:37:**  He bought this 500 hectare piece of land that was totally utterly degraded.  
**0:19:37-0:19:44:**  It was originally called Fazendo Olhos Dagua which means as much as farm of the eyes of  
**0:19:44-0:19:50:**  water which is a name given to farms in Brazil where they say it's the birth point of water  
**0:19:50-0:19:56:**  so it's places with a lot of dew a lot of rain and a lot of water springs.  
**0:19:56-0:20:02:**  And so it's a watershed you know very strong watershed.  
**0:20:02-0:20:08:**  But the previous owner had owned a sawmill had cut down pretty much all of the native  
**0:20:08-0:20:14:**  rainforest that was there and then had gone through this burn cycle agriculture where  
**0:20:14-0:20:23:**  they would plant cassava where they would plant different annual or biannual crops for  
**0:20:23-0:20:25:**  smallholder subsistence farming.  
**0:20:25-0:20:31:**  They had livestock and you know like these watershed areas they are very sensitive to  
**0:20:31-0:20:36:**  degradation especially areas with a lot of water springs once you start clogging up the  
**0:20:36-0:20:41:**  creeks and you get erosion like clogging up the creeks and then the water spring drying  
**0:20:41-0:20:46:**  out as a result of loss of vegetation you don't even know where the creek is anymore  
**0:20:46-0:20:53:**  than you have this really bad dynamic of drought and water logging because the water cannot  
**0:20:53-0:20:58:**  actually leave when it needs to and because there is no more vegetation that dries out  
**0:20:58-0:21:01:**  the second there is no rain.  
**0:21:01-0:21:08:**  And in the tropical soils we know that all these biological and also chemical processes  
**0:21:08-0:21:16:**  just happen on such a more rapid and accelerated rate and so his soils when he bought the farm  
**0:21:16-0:21:22:**  there was like parts where I think the majority had like pH around 4.2 but some parts even  
**0:21:22-0:21:28:**  3.8 there was like no trace of phosphorus or phosphates there was like very little nitrogen  
**0:21:28-0:21:34:**  there was almost no potassium there was toxic amounts of aluminium and also other elements  
**0:21:34-0:21:39:**  and just toxic quantities and just nothing would grow like the grasses I mean this is  
**0:21:39-0:21:46:**  like used to be a tropical rainforest with 50 meter tall trees and 2600 millimeters of  
**0:21:46-0:21:50:**  precipitation per square meter per year.  
**0:21:50-0:21:56:**  The previous owner cut down everything it started only raining 1100 millimeters after  
**0:21:56-0:22:04:**  the removal of the forest so the rainfall dropped by more than 50% and all the water  
**0:22:04-0:22:10:**  springs dried out all these chemical biological processes in the soil led to the fact that  
**0:22:10-0:22:17:**  now not even grasses will grow taller than like 10 or 15 centimeters and the previous  
**0:22:17-0:22:22:**  owner then decided to abandon the farm and they called it Fazendo dos Fugees dos Tatejas  
**0:22:22-0:22:28:**  Seca so the farm of the fugitives of the dry land.  
**0:22:28-0:22:29:**  Who named it like that?  
**0:22:29-0:22:31:**  The previous owner.  
**0:22:31-0:22:34:**  They abandoned the land and they called it that.  
**0:22:34-0:22:38:**  The name even carried the story of the degradation.  
**0:22:38-0:22:45:**  And that's the name that it's registered at as until today like if you go to the Nojiri  
**0:22:45-0:22:52:**  and like officially Ernst's farm name is called Fazendo dos Fugees dos Tatejas Seca.  
**0:22:52-0:22:58:**  So once again for you guys listening in that don't speak Portuguese it's farm of the fugitives  
**0:22:58-0:23:04:**  or refugees of the dry land because they just had to abandon it because nothing more would  
**0:23:04-0:23:10:**  grow even the most tolerant crops and so Ernst bought this farm everybody called him crazy  
**0:23:10-0:23:14:**  in the region they would they were saying like yeah nothing will ever grow there you  
**0:23:14-0:23:21:**  won't be able to even grow pineapple or cassava like nothing of this grows he got like certificates  
**0:23:21-0:23:25:**  from universities that were saying that he would never be able to grow cacao on this  
**0:23:25-0:23:30:**  farm because there's like such a low pH or like that he would never be able to grow it  
**0:23:30-0:23:34:**  in an economically viable fashion because he would just have to put so much calcium  
**0:23:34-0:23:42:**  and so much other fertilizers in order to make the production viable that he would not  
**0:23:42-0:23:48:**  be able to reach a break even point because of the price of the cost of production in  
**0:23:48-0:23:55:**  comparison to the price of the product and so he on this farm he started developing really  
**0:23:55-0:24:05:**  his techniques of centropic farming which you know he had really the idea that he carried  
**0:24:05-0:24:12:**  with him from Costa Rica that it should be possible to work on any soil on this planet  
**0:24:12-0:24:19:**  no matter how degraded it is without using any external inputs and still achieve economically  
**0:24:19-0:24:27:**  viable agricultural production and only using natural processes so he started making lots  
**0:24:27-0:24:33:**  of experience experiments on his farm his idea was that maybe even if he had to use  
**0:24:33-0:24:39:**  a one-time fertilization that in the long term he would be like he did not want to fertilize  
**0:24:39-0:24:47:**  more than one time and so he like he planted 111 hectares of cacao within the first year  
**0:24:47-0:24:55:**  and I think it was like 300 hectares of forest or something like this and he the cacao plantations  
**0:24:55-0:25:03:**  he divided into different experiments wherein some he would apply the recommended quantities  
**0:25:03-0:25:11:**  of conventional fertilizer so like the package that the green revolution was offering and  
**0:25:11-0:25:20:**  then he was also in some of the blocks he would put the recommended quantity of organic  
**0:25:20-0:25:27:**  fertilizer so same stuff but from organic origin or accepted by organic agriculture  
**0:25:27-0:25:32:**  and then the third series of attempts he was using nothing I think it was just like this  
**0:25:32-0:25:40:**  really like maybe like five percent or two percent of the recommended quantity of chalk  
**0:25:40-0:25:45:**  and he was not using it on the whole area but like I remember him telling me that in  
**0:25:45-0:25:49:**  some places he would even just use a teaspoon of chalk on the place where he would put a  
**0:25:49-0:25:55:**  cacao seed so that like when the seed would germinate it would have like something to  
**0:25:55-0:26:00:**  hold on to and to not immediately die but then it also did not obviously have the conditions  
**0:26:00-0:26:06:**  to really develop and that it would have to wait for the other plants to solve the acidity  
**0:26:06-0:26:12:**  of the soil and to raise the pH so have to wait for natural processes to occur in order  
**0:26:12-0:26:19:**  to then be able to develop and so what happened as a result of these three lines of experiment  
**0:26:19-0:26:27:**  was that the areas where he put nothing the corn like grew like three centimeters tall  
**0:26:27-0:26:34:**  and withered the beans that he had planted same thing germinated died the like they just  
**0:26:34-0:26:39:**  turned yellow they didn't even get to finish making their first true leaves and they were  
**0:26:39-0:26:50:**  gone the bananas no chance papaya no chance man yolk like growing but like weak and like  
**0:26:50-0:26:56:**  that's like for the short cycle crops then in the field with the conventional fertilizer  
**0:26:56-0:27:01:**  he had like huge corn production huge bean production bananas developing super beautiful  
**0:27:01-0:27:09:**  papaya developing super beautiful and after three months so like somewhere after the corn  
**0:27:09-0:27:15:**  harvest this huge plummet in productivity and like all the cacao trees died many of  
**0:27:15-0:27:20:**  the other fruit trees he had seeded so he plants everything by seed right most of those  
**0:27:20-0:27:24:**  trees all died and those are the areas like the field where you and me worked you know  
**0:27:24-0:27:31:**  that that was like a forest that he had he had then worked on it again afterwards but  
**0:27:31-0:27:35:**  it had no cacao trees because of this reason because it was one of those fields where he  
**0:27:35-0:27:40:**  had used come yeah salt fertilizer or chemical fertilizer and he just had no cacao trees  
**0:27:40-0:27:48:**  there it was just other trees that had come up and in the field of the organic fertilization  
**0:27:48-0:27:52:**  it was pretty much the same thing just that it took a bit longer and the effect was less  
**0:27:52-0:27:57:**  severe like maybe a bit less corn production and bean production a bit less of a spike  
**0:27:57-0:28:03:**  in the beginning but also like a less extreme plummet in the end maybe not such a severe  
**0:28:03-0:28:11:**  die of like like all of the cacao trees like maybe let's say like five percent or eight  
**0:28:11-0:28:17:**  percent survived but you know also like he was not able to establish his cacao trees  
**0:28:17-0:28:27:**  like this in the field where he had done nothing within three years his cacao trees grew like  
**0:28:27-0:28:32:**  30 centimeters tall i think he said and so in the beginning was very hard and it was  
**0:28:32-0:28:37:**  there where he then started developing this technique which he also describes in this  
**0:28:37-0:28:43:**  text breakthrough in agriculture which he calls selective weeding which is not really  
**0:28:43-0:28:48:**  a weeding as such but it's more like a selective pruning and some plants he actually does weed  
**0:28:48-0:28:54:**  but it's really just a few and so he was looking for the plants that were spontaneously coming  
**0:28:54-0:29:00:**  up and then periodically he would go through all the fields and with his machete selectively  
**0:29:00-0:29:06:**  cut out all the plants that were at the end of the flowering and so you know like in his  
**0:29:06-0:29:13:**  theory when the plants reach this morphological ripeness when they finish flowering and they  
**0:29:13-0:29:18:**  start maturing their seeds so going towards physiological ripeness they start already  
**0:29:18-0:29:23:**  entering into a state of senescence that has the impact on all the other plants in the  
**0:29:23-0:29:30:**  surroundings and so he always when there's a plant that enters into this kind of state  
**0:29:30-0:29:36:**  he always goes to prune it in order to either reset its life cycle so it re-sprouts with  
**0:29:36-0:29:42:**  renewed vigor and by then you know you have to imagine that it's like waves you know like  
**0:29:42-0:29:47:**  first the plant grows up and it reaches a certain point and it starts flowering then  
**0:29:47-0:29:52:**  if you prune it it already has a root system established it already has its associated  
**0:29:52-0:29:57:**  microbiology and all of these things you prune it it grows back stronger and it reaches a  
**0:29:57-0:30:05:**  new height so a new higher wave is created and this you know this pruning process it's  
**0:30:05-0:30:12:**  also something we learned in university it's mostly apical pruning so removing the top  
**0:30:12-0:30:21:**  growth points of the plants has a very significant impact on the plant on a hormonal level so  
**0:30:21-0:30:29:**  you basically shift the whole hormone hormonal balance within the plant because in the top  
**0:30:29-0:30:34:**  in the tips of the plant is where a certain hormone called auxin is produced and that's  
**0:30:34-0:30:41:**  really promoting this apical growth with the central leader suppressing the side branches  
**0:30:41-0:30:47:**  from growing too strongly and growing up and it's actually kind of you know in that sense  
**0:30:47-0:30:53:**  limiting the speed of growth you know the second you remove that on a tree you know  
**0:30:53-0:31:00:**  you would remove the top and then proportionally prune back all the side branches so that you  
**0:31:00-0:31:04:**  don't just apically prune the top like they do here in Portugal they you know they just  
**0:31:04-0:31:08:**  climb up a tree they knock out the top and then they leave all the side branches and  
**0:31:08-0:31:14:**  there's these poor trees then standing there but you know you climb up you knock out the  
**0:31:14-0:31:18:**  top and then you knock out all the side branches proportionally so that the tree maintains  
**0:31:18-0:31:26:**  the same shape same exact shape before and after it's just proportionally reduced and  
**0:31:26-0:31:31:**  so all the branches are apically pruned what happens is there's no more source of auxin  
**0:31:31-0:31:38:**  and there's two hormones produced in the root system cytokinin and gibberellic acid which  
**0:31:38-0:31:46:**  are huge growth enhancing hormones under the influence of these hormones a plant will portray  
**0:31:46-0:31:53:**  much higher cell division rate much higher velocity of photosynthesis more photosynthesis  
**0:31:53-0:31:59:**  means more water being cycled or recycled you know in Ernst theory he doesn't really  
**0:31:59-0:32:05:**  believe that all plants drink water from the soil but that it's a cycle where they actually  
**0:32:05-0:32:10:**  with the do they create water and they due to temperature differences I mean it's also  
**0:32:10-0:32:16:**  goes back to Victor Schauberger which if any of you listening are interested in Ernst's  
**0:32:16-0:32:23:**  work I highly suggest you to start studying Victor Schauberger there are some really nice  
**0:32:23-0:32:31:**  works about his work by a man called Callum Coates and the book living energy is like  
**0:32:31-0:32:37:**  living energies is really like the most all encompassing description of Victor Schauberger's  
**0:32:37-0:32:44:**  work which you know like reading these books was also really helping me understand where  
**0:32:44-0:32:50:**  what Ernst was talking about because you know it's really just an in-depth comprehensive  
**0:32:50-0:32:56:**  understanding of how nature actually works like not how modern science belief nature  
**0:32:56-0:33:01:**  works not how modern physicists believe that nature works but how nature and the cosmos  
**0:33:01-0:33:09:**  actually works so you see that there is like the understanding of Ernst and yours as well  
**0:33:09-0:33:16:**  there's a big disparity between modern understanding of how plants and natural systems work and  
**0:33:16-0:33:22:**  how things actually work you see that there's a big difference yeah I mean for sure I mean  
**0:33:22-0:33:26:**  the biggest one that surprises people all the time that come here the first one like  
**0:33:26-0:33:31:**  I said is like don't these plants drink so much water because I have so many plants so  
**0:33:31-0:33:35:**  close together and people are like how are you managing like aren't they competition  
**0:33:35-0:33:39:**  is like that's the first one like drinking water the second one competition like that  
**0:33:39-0:33:43:**  just blows people out of the water is like what like you don't believe that plants compete  
**0:33:43-0:33:49:**  with each other because you know like I have thousands of plants here in my plant in my  
**0:33:49-0:33:56:**  farm to give you guys an idea listening I have about 70,000 trees planted on one and  
**0:33:56-0:34:03:**  a half no one point three hectares and so that gives me about seven trees per square  
**0:34:03-0:34:10:**  meter and you know I haven't planted the whole fields it's all in rows and sometimes on the  
**0:34:10-0:34:18:**  space of like 10 square centimeters there's like 10 trees growing out of it and there's  
**0:34:18-0:34:23:**  this one water dropper and I'm irrigating very little for the climate in which I am  
**0:34:23-0:34:31:**  here and you know I always tell people I was like that have this doubt I just tell them  
**0:34:31-0:34:36:**  I was like alright so I want you to go around my farm and show me an example where you see  
**0:34:36-0:34:42:**  a plant suffering because of another one or like one plant competing with another one  
**0:34:42-0:34:47:**  because you don't see that you see the complete opposite you see how they nurture each other  
**0:34:47-0:34:51:**  how they raise each other how they improve the conditions for each other and that is  
**0:34:51-0:34:57:**  you know I always explain it like this if you know how to work with plants I think that's  
**0:34:57-0:35:02:**  just really like the basis of this work is like really understanding how to work with  
**0:35:02-0:35:09:**  plants descending off of the pedestal as Ernest always says so like descending off of our  
**0:35:09-0:35:15:**  throne of thinking that we're like the supreme being the intelligent ones but to understand  
**0:35:15-0:35:21:**  that we are part of this intelligent system that we don't over pose ourselves to the will  
**0:35:21-0:35:28:**  of the plants but that we sort of say tune in to their desires and to their needs and  
**0:35:28-0:35:37:**  then from that perspective seek to optimize this whole system and giving each plant its  
**0:35:37-0:35:42:**  correct conditions in comparison to all the other ones around it and the second that you  
**0:35:42-0:35:47:**  understand and know how to work with plants in such a sense that you know through pruning  
**0:35:47-0:35:55:**  through selective weeding through selective pruning you can optimize the shade conditions  
**0:35:55-0:36:01:**  the I actually don't believe in shade I don't have shade in my farm I have filtered sunlight  
**0:36:01-0:36:07:**  you know there exists no shade here it's just filtered sunlight and so like I plant citrus  
**0:36:07-0:36:12:**  trees and people tell me but do citrus trees grow in shade I say I don't know I plant them  
**0:36:12-0:36:21:**  in filtered sunlight and I see a big difference in their health being in filtered sunlight  
**0:36:21-0:36:29:**  in comparison to direct sunlight and so you know the second you understand how to work  
**0:36:29-0:36:35:**  with these plants together and optimizing this process there's no more conflicts and  
**0:36:35-0:36:43:**  the only way that you might be able to like where I feel like man got this idea of competition  
**0:36:43-0:36:53:**  from is when you look at nature and when you look at the natural like occurrence of plants  
**0:36:53-0:36:57:**  that might not be managed and it might not be maintained by a person with this understanding  
**0:36:57-0:37:04:**  or by anybody at all you know it might just be let grown wildly and so people then think  
**0:37:04-0:37:11:**  this is competition because this plant is like suffocating this one but I actually just  
**0:37:11-0:37:18:**  believe it's conflicts that arise out of mismanagement or no management and also in that sense you  
**0:37:18-0:37:27:**  know ernsti always says there's no competition there's only co-definition so no competition  
**0:37:27-0:37:37:**  but co-definition all the different plants they together co-co-decide who is the most  
**0:37:37-0:37:45:**  adapted the most strong like who is the genome like imagine there's a hundred oak trees growing  
**0:37:45-0:37:51:**  all together on the space that in the future one oak tree would grow in the beginning you  
**0:37:51-0:37:56:**  know all of them are serving a function because they're occupying that area you know like  
**0:37:56-0:38:03:**  one of the big ideas of some tropic farming is that occupy the maximum of potential space  
**0:38:03-0:38:11:**  from with photosynthesis in all stages of development of your plantation so you want  
**0:38:11-0:38:16:**  to always have the whole place full of photosynthesis and in the beginning you can allow yourself  
**0:38:16-0:38:21:**  to have that many trees there making a deep taproot into the soil working the soil mobilizing  
**0:38:21-0:38:30:**  microbiology because the space just allows it and they together then will co-decide who  
**0:38:30-0:38:41:**  is the most adapted genotype to this exact location and that one will be indicated by  
**0:38:41-0:38:45:**  portraying more vigor by portraying more strength but sometimes it's really surprising it's  
**0:38:45-0:38:49:**  not even the plants that are growing fastest in the beginning that end up staying and you  
**0:38:49-0:38:57:**  know you just really have to be able to tune in and understand which plant is now meant  
**0:38:57-0:39:03:**  to go and which plant is meant to stay which is very difficult concept to explain to people  
**0:39:03-0:39:09:**  and I think the only way that I have somehow started learning how to relate to plants on  
**0:39:09-0:39:16:**  this level is by having planted them myself and taking care of my own agroforestry system  
**0:39:16-0:39:22:**  over a few years now where you have this connection with the plant from the beginning you know  
**0:39:22-0:39:27:**  and a lot of times actually the animals will come and take out the plants so rodents or  
**0:39:27-0:39:33:**  other animals they come and take them out like the oak trees if I cut them with my scissors  
**0:39:33-0:39:37:**  they will sprout back no matter what so I cannot take them out but the mice they will  
**0:39:37-0:39:44:**  go and cut the root of the weaker ones and that's very interesting so ernstee after three  
**0:39:44-0:39:48:**  years his cacao trees were still very small and he developed this technique of selective  
**0:39:48-0:39:53:**  weeding and selective pruning where he was pruning the plants that were flowering by  
**0:39:53-0:40:00:**  five years he started noticing a big difference because spontaneous trees and also trees that  
**0:40:00-0:40:05:**  he had planted himself that were adapted to the conditions of the site had significantly  
**0:40:05-0:40:10:**  developed and he could start pruning them then he started seeing a big shift in the  
**0:40:10-0:40:14:**  dynamics of the place and the cacao trees started growing very fast and then by eight  
**0:40:14-0:40:22:**  years he started having production and these are now the orchards that 35-36 years later  
**0:40:22-0:40:29:**  are still highly productive and that are producing the cacao that he and him and his family are  
**0:40:29-0:40:38:**  living from in the beginning what he ended up using as an economic production to pay  
**0:40:38-0:40:45:**  off his farm and to pay the salaries of his workers and pay for his livelihood was bananas  
**0:40:45-0:40:51:**  he was dehydrating bananas.  
**0:40:51-0:40:56:**  I just want to put that and nowadays he's producing on average about three times more  
**0:40:56-0:41:03:**  cacao per hectare per year than the average Brazilian conventional farmer that uses the  
**0:41:03-0:41:09:**  whole package of fungicides, herbicides, fertilizers and so on and so forth.  
**0:41:09-0:41:11:**  It's not just this it's when you've tasted his cacao.  
**0:41:11-0:41:15:**  I know like it's something else isn't it?  
**0:41:15-0:41:18:**  To all of you guys listening Dimitri and me we're sitting here right now both with the  
**0:41:18-0:41:24:**  cup full of urns cacao and it just brings very special atmosphere.  
**0:41:24-0:41:30:**  Tell us a bit more about this thing of pruning and organic matter which is so representative  
**0:41:30-0:41:34:**  of syntropic agriculture and this is what you're saying is the next phase in which you  
**0:41:34-0:41:35:**  went.  
**0:41:35-0:41:37:**  Maybe explain a bit more what that means.  
**0:41:37-0:41:45:**  What really brings the productivity into the system is as you said the pruning and it's  
**0:41:45-0:41:50:**  you know always I was reading through my notes from when I was at urns farm the other day  
**0:41:50-0:41:55:**  by coincidence I think it was actually before I knew that we would do this interview and  
**0:41:55-0:42:02:**  I'd written down that a syntropic plantation works in six dimensions.  
**0:42:02-0:42:06:**  So it's a six dimensional entity.  
**0:42:06-0:42:09:**  Maybe now I would say it's seven.  
**0:42:09-0:42:13:**  Anyways you have the first three dimensions which is space.  
**0:42:13-0:42:14:**  How plants are arranged in space.  
**0:42:14-0:42:21:**  This is how the different plants grow above and below each other and next to each other.  
**0:42:21-0:42:28:**  So stratification, layering, it's a very big part of the syntropic agriculture approach  
**0:42:28-0:42:35:**  where you really attempt to fit each plant into its optimal position.  
**0:42:35-0:42:43:**  Ernst and his son Tancred they studied the Brazilian rainforest in many different places  
**0:42:43-0:42:48:**  of Brazil and they came to the conclusion that there's 11 strata in the forest.  
**0:42:48-0:42:58:**  So you have emergent, canopy to emergent, then canopy convex, canopy concave, medium  
**0:42:58-0:43:08:**  to canopy, medium to canopy, then medium to canopy, then you have medium, then medium  
**0:43:08-0:43:14:**  to low, then low, then there's a herbaceous layer and then the regeneration layer which  
**0:43:14-0:43:18:**  are all the trees that will make part of the next, like that are being raised underneath  
**0:43:18-0:43:20:**  the forest.  
**0:43:20-0:43:25:**  The fourth dimension that ties in with all of this is time.  
**0:43:25-0:43:29:**  Which as I said there's a regeneration layer and you know like some plants they live shorter,  
**0:43:29-0:43:31:**  some plants they live longer.  
**0:43:31-0:43:40:**  You plant this whole spectrum of different species that are from different life cycles.  
**0:43:40-0:43:43:**  So that's the fourth dimension is time.  
**0:43:43-0:43:50:**  The fifth dimension is the interaction between all these different species that exist within  
**0:43:50-0:43:52:**  the plantation.  
**0:43:52-0:43:59:**  So you know like here on my farm when I first started it's very much research focused so  
**0:43:59-0:44:05:**  I also did this to understand what really works here on this land but I was planting  
**0:44:05-0:44:13:**  about 80 species per row together which had all kinds of herbaceous and short cycle vegetable  
**0:44:13-0:44:17:**  plants but then also long-lived trees.  
**0:44:17-0:44:27:**  The sixth dimension is dynamic which is strongly driven by the human intervention into the  
**0:44:27-0:44:30:**  ecosystem and that's where the pruning comes in.  
**0:44:30-0:44:39:**  The pruning, like our main objective in pruning is to optimize the natural processes occurring  
**0:44:39-0:44:47:**  on the site principally photosynthesis and natural succession of species.  
**0:44:47-0:44:56:**  So the natural succession of species in the beginning you know we start by planting.  
**0:44:56-0:45:00:**  Imagine you have different life cycles of different plants.  
**0:45:00-0:45:06:**  The first life cycle would be your vegetable crops like radishes, melons, corn, beans,  
**0:45:06-0:45:16:**  sweet potatoes that grow together in this short life cycle and they sort of produce  
**0:45:16-0:45:19:**  a macroorganism between each other.  
**0:45:19-0:45:27:**  They are the ones that start to create, well they produce this macroorganism where each  
**0:45:27-0:45:35:**  one of them is fulfilling a unique function in regards to the other ones and one of their  
**0:45:35-0:45:43:**  functions that they are fulfilling is to as I said before cover the maximum amount of  
**0:45:43-0:45:50:**  area with photosynthesis on immediate time frame but also through their metabolism they  
**0:45:50-0:46:04:**  are changing the qualities of the site climatically so they are starting to modulate the microclimate,  
**0:46:04-0:46:09:**  they are raising the humidity, lowering the temperature but then also biologically and  
**0:46:09-0:46:15:**  chemically so they are starting to produce accidents through their roots that start feeding  
**0:46:15-0:46:17:**  microbiology.  
**0:46:17-0:46:24:**  This microbiology then in turn starts mobilizing different nutrients and well trace minerals  
**0:46:24-0:46:29:**  and all kinds of stuff naturally and I think that this is really the only way that you  
**0:46:29-0:46:35:**  can get this stuff back into the soil because you know like here where I live in the top  
**0:46:35-0:46:41:**  soil we are like imagine lacking like pretty much all the trace elements you could imagine  
**0:46:41-0:46:51:**  there is like manganese, magnesium, phosphate, calcium, boron, copper, plus sulfur, plus  
**0:46:51-0:46:58:**  a number of other things just completely missing from the top soil but you know the trees here  
**0:46:58-0:47:04:**  they can make roots that go 80 meters deep and I believe that through these natural processes  
**0:47:04-0:47:09:**  is how we can actually sustainably create this balance in the soil again that putting  
**0:47:09-0:47:15:**  rock dust or stuff like this is not a solution because they will oxidize and chemically bind  
**0:47:15-0:47:19:**  up with other elements in the same process that the ones did that were originally here  
**0:47:19-0:47:22:**  due to the degradation of the land.  
**0:47:22-0:47:26:**  It's like symptomatic it's not actually solving the core problem which is the lack of life  
**0:47:26-0:47:33:**  in the soil, lack of organic matter, lack of cycle, shade, all these things that this  
**0:47:33-0:47:39:**  complex microorganism which is an agroecological system which is and this is what's fascinating  
**0:47:39-0:47:44:**  with Centropic Ag is that they're really you guys are really attempting here to solve the  
**0:47:44-0:47:50:**  issue from the port from what is actually wrong with the machine that we're trying to  
**0:47:50-0:47:56:**  solve it's not a machine it's a bad metaphor but the system the organism solve it reactivate  
**0:47:56-0:47:57:**  it.  
**0:47:57-0:48:03:**  When you guys are solving that issue you're going you're doing really deep biomimicry  
**0:48:03-0:48:08:**  like from all the agricultural systems that I know Centropic Agriculture is the one that  
**0:48:08-0:48:14:**  goes as close to nature which is the one that is most intimately biomimic in nature.  
**0:48:14-0:48:15:**  No for sure.  
**0:48:15-0:48:17:**  As close to them right?  
**0:48:17-0:48:24:**  You know like that's why I found so much enthusiasm in working together with Ernst because he  
**0:48:24-0:48:32:**  is just like you know it's it feels so true so profoundly true what he is working on and  
**0:48:32-0:48:40:**  what he is doing and it has like such a deep meaning to you know our planet in my point  
**0:48:40-0:48:49:**  of view you know it really affected me very deeply on a soul level and you know it obvious  
**0:48:49-0:48:54:**  like so to continue that conversation you know like you then have this first microorganism  
**0:48:54-0:49:00:**  of short life cycle plants that kind of starts altering the conditions of the site of intervention  
**0:49:00-0:49:06:**  and then later on like they through through their metabolism and through the alterations  
**0:49:06-0:49:13:**  which they cause on the site of intervention they produce the conditions for the plants  
**0:49:13-0:49:21:**  of the next life cycle so the next macroorganism to successfully be able to establish without  
**0:49:21-0:49:27:**  the work of these we don't call them pioneer plants we don't call them biomass plants because  
**0:49:27-0:49:32:**  calling them pioneer plants would mean that they're like something external or something  
**0:49:32-0:49:38:**  like of lesser value you know they are not external they all make part of the same system  
**0:49:38-0:49:43:**  they just are part of a different life cycle they're not pioneering anything you know it's  
**0:49:43-0:49:50:**  like you know when there's an embryo being created inside the mother's womb there's no  
**0:49:50-0:49:54:**  the stem cells are not pioneer cells they're stem cells that's what everything else builds  
**0:49:54-0:49:59:**  up from you know there is no pioneers in that sense they all make part of the same system  
**0:49:59-0:50:07:**  at just at different stages and then the also no biomass plants so we have no plant in the  
**0:50:07-0:50:14:**  system that we intentionally integrate in order to produce biomass we look for plants  
**0:50:14-0:50:20:**  that are able to vigorously grow under the conditions of the site and are able to react  
**0:50:20-0:50:27:**  well to strong pruning but that is not with the objective to create biomass i mean it's  
**0:50:27-0:50:33:**  the biomass production is like a sub product and i think that's where like a lot of people  
**0:50:33-0:50:37:**  get ernest wrong because you know he never goes to prune a tree with the intention to  
**0:50:37-0:50:43:**  bring down organic material he prunes the trees in order to optimize them in their crown  
**0:50:43-0:50:48:**  shape in their like in the amount of filtered sunlight that they make or the amount of sun  
**0:50:48-0:50:53:**  filtration that they create in order to optimize that with all the other plants that exist  
**0:50:53-0:50:59:**  around it you know and he really looks at it from this perspective and what's interesting  
**0:50:59-0:51:05:**  is the second you start doing it like this you will always have the perfect amount of  
**0:51:05-0:51:11:**  organic material to cover the soil completely like you won't have too much you won't have  
**0:51:11-0:51:17:**  too little if you like invest it well you'll be able to cover 100% of the area with like  
**0:51:17-0:51:25:**  in his farm like 3 to 5 cm layer of fresh organic material without like over pruning  
**0:51:25-0:51:33:**  the plants just by pruning them the right amount that is necessary for the optimization  
**0:51:33-0:51:47:**  of the system and so you know like then the and the pruning in like let me so you have  
**0:51:47-0:51:53:**  these different life cycles and how they succeed each other is how we build up this forest  
**0:51:53-0:52:01:**  and how one life cycle transitions into the next is a large part of what we call dynamics  
**0:52:01-0:52:12:**  of the ecosystem and to fortify these dynamics we use techniques such as pruning and the  
**0:52:12-0:52:19:**  pruning has one very strong impact which is as i was mentioning earlier the reset of growth  
**0:52:19-0:52:26:**  cycles of plants and the reinvigoration of plants so bringing plants to a higher level  
**0:52:26-0:52:33:**  then they would go without pruning and this in urn's theory as all plants are connected  
**0:52:33-0:52:39:**  via mycorrhiza when one plant in the system or two plants in the system are experiencing  
**0:52:39-0:52:46:**  this state of accelerated and invigorated growth due to pruning and when they are cycling  
**0:52:46-0:52:52:**  all the cytokine and gibberellic acid that they actually transmit this through the mycorrhiza  
**0:52:52-0:52:59:**  to other plants and i've actively seen this happen on his farm where i was pruning elephant  
**0:52:59-0:53:06:**  grass which i planted together with my corn and my beans and my young trees i prune it  
**0:53:06-0:53:12:**  and my cacao trees are like 10 centimeters tall and have these tiny little leaves the  
**0:53:12-0:53:18:**  second i prune it a week later the cacao trees have like 30 centimeter long leaves all of  
**0:53:18-0:53:23:**  a sudden they're like drooping down on the floor and they've like they were like stopped  
**0:53:23-0:53:27:**  before they were not growing and i prune the elephant grass and the cacao trees just make  
**0:53:27-0:53:32:**  this huge push making really big leaves and you see it in urn's forest you know the in  
**0:53:32-0:53:37:**  the region a normal cacao tree makes like leaves that are like 20 to 30 centimeters  
**0:53:37-0:53:42:**  long in his forest i remember him coming up to us with like leaves that were 60 or 70  
**0:53:42-0:53:48:**  centimeters big and so it makes very big difference this that's without any fertilizers nothing  
**0:53:48-0:53:56:**  he has never used anything never on most of his active plantations you know most of the  
**0:53:56-0:54:04:**  places where he actually harvests cacao where he is able to produce he never fertilized  
**0:54:04-0:54:11:**  and those are his best plantations very interesting maybe you tell us a bit more about because  
**0:54:11-0:54:16:**  you referred a few times to your farm and where you're working here in portugal maybe  
**0:54:16-0:54:22:**  you can tell us a bit about how you how you know you're applying what you learned with  
**0:54:22-0:54:27:**  urn's and and how all this all this incredible journey you've just explained to us how that  
**0:54:27-0:54:34:**  led to pinta da sabelias and and your story kind of in portugal i still feel like i haven't  
**0:54:34-0:54:37:**  i we've talked a lot about centropic farming but i still don't feel like i've actually  
**0:54:37-0:54:48:**  given like a real like definition of what it is so um i think the number one thing to  
**0:54:48-0:54:58:**  centropic farming is to mimic the natural ecosystem of the site of intervention in its  
**0:54:58-0:55:03:**  structure function and dynamic as closely as possible so structure is referring to the  
**0:55:03-0:55:10:**  stratification the dynamic to the different life cycles the dynamic between the different  
**0:55:10-0:55:15:**  seasons but then also the dynamic that exists between when the plantation is pruned and  
**0:55:15-0:55:21:**  when it's not pruned so like light and shade or light and filtered sunlight amounts of  
**0:55:21-0:55:30:**  sunlight in the plantation and then function refers to anything from nutrient cycling to  
**0:55:30-0:55:42:**  water cycling and so on and so forth and the next point is that the plantations should  
**0:55:42-0:55:48:**  work without any external inputs that the biggest external input that we use is our  
**0:55:48-0:55:56:**  knowledge of sociology of plants so how plants behave towards each other and with each other  
**0:55:56-0:56:04:**  and how to optimize ecological processes as well another external input is the planting  
**0:56:04-0:56:14:**  material in some cases we like ernst he uses almost exclusively seeds he i've like while  
**0:56:14-0:56:20:**  i was in his farm i never planted a single plant there's always seeds directly in the  
**0:56:20-0:56:26:**  ground even i mean in his farm even tomatoes i was planting directly on the spot i wasn't  
**0:56:26-0:56:35:**  making a nursery for anything and so you know like that's a big part of the thing that ideally  
**0:56:35-0:56:42:**  if you adhere to really what's the tropic farming is you don't use any seedlings or  
**0:56:42-0:56:53:**  grafted plants the third part is that the plantations are able to mobilize and recycle  
**0:56:53-0:57:05:**  so mobilize and transform and then recycle their own nutrient and water necessities and  
**0:57:05-0:57:14:**  a big part is also that the plantation should be economically viable and profitable but  
**0:57:14-0:57:22:**  even more importantly that it is profitable in a sense of natural capital or as ernst  
**0:57:22-0:57:31:**  calls it the quality quantity and quality of consolidated life on the site so that it  
**0:57:31-0:57:37:**  has a significant increase in quantity and quality of consolidated life on the site but  
**0:57:37-0:57:43:**  that it also positively contributes in the same sense to the macro organism planet earth  
**0:57:43-0:57:50:**  as a whole so you know like here for example on my farm i'm having a positive impact on  
**0:57:50-0:57:56:**  the system on the site by bringing straw from a neighbor i'm enriching i'm giving conditions  
**0:57:56-0:58:03:**  for life to work here by bringing in this moat is not completely aligned with the centropic  
**0:58:03-0:58:10:**  principles because by doing this i might not be having entirely positive benefit to the  
**0:58:10-0:58:15:**  macro organism planet earth as a whole by taking nutrients and organic matter from another  
**0:58:15-0:58:20:**  site exactly because you're having a negative impact on another site in order to enrich  
**0:58:20-0:58:28:**  your own site another aspect is that we don't consider anything to be a pest or a disease  
**0:58:28-0:58:35:**  all of the animals all of the bugs all of these different interveners and cohabitants  
**0:58:35-0:58:42:**  of our forests are endobionts of the forest just as ourselves and that they make part  
**0:58:42-0:58:51:**  of the department or the agency of optimization of life processes so they will only start  
**0:58:51-0:58:57:**  to intervene when we have not managed to put a plant in its right context in the right  
**0:58:57-0:59:02:**  conditions and you see this in urns farm all the time and here in my own farm i also i've  
**0:59:02-0:59:11:**  never had any animal or bug or critter intervene with my crops where i could not reason or  
**0:59:11-0:59:17:**  figure out through reason why it had come why that because it usually comes if you're  
**0:59:17-0:59:25:**  open to it it will tell you immediately what you did wrong and it's you know they are lesson  
**0:59:25-0:59:32:**  givers and they are so say teachers for us to be able to optimize or better understand  
**0:59:32-0:59:37:**  nature and the ecosystem and how to better intervene with our plantations and how to  
**0:59:37-0:59:43:**  better cultivate our tree crops instead of looking at them as something evil that's coming  
**0:59:43-0:59:51:**  to punish us we could look at them as teachers and how to better treat our plants there's  
**0:59:51-0:59:59:**  one more element that is about some traffic farming that right now i'm not coming up with  
**0:59:59-1:00:07:**  so we'll skip that and yeah so here my farm after having lived in urns farm for over one  
**1:00:07-1:00:12:**  year i did an internship here in portugal on the agricultural estate at that duffrech  
**1:00:12-1:00:18:**  new mail which at the time was working together with urns to install different agroforestry  
**1:00:18-1:00:25:**  fields around the estate some more intensively managed closer to the main production sites  
**1:00:25-1:00:32:**  to the living areas some more extensive areas in large fields where they were trying to  
**1:00:32-1:00:41:**  reforest 100 hectare big really degraded field and i came to do an internship here for my  
**1:00:41-1:00:47:**  university and to kind of help prepare things for a workshop that urns was going to give  
**1:00:47-1:00:54:**  here and during this time you know i just really fell in love with the ecosystem with  
**1:00:54-1:00:59:**  the area i always felt like i wanted to work and live in europe that i didn't want to go  
**1:00:59-1:01:08:**  to brazil but mostly for the reason that i you know there was already so much going on  
**1:01:08-1:01:15:**  there and i felt like the whole knowledge of urns that there was very little being like  
**1:01:15-1:01:20:**  very like nobody was strictly following his ideas really here in europe you know like  
**1:01:20-1:01:27:**  there's people applying techniques and principles of syntropic farming in some cases but i really  
**1:01:27-1:01:35:**  wanted to apply as much of it as i could and really do things as i'd seen on his farm which  
**1:01:35-1:01:43:**  i'll get to in a minute is you know i am not i have not entirely managed to live up to  
**1:01:43-1:01:49:**  that standard either i think it's good to be honest about that i don't consider what  
**1:01:49-1:01:54:**  i do here really syntropic farming if i would look at it from a puristic standpoint you  
**1:01:54-1:02:02:**  know because a number of the principles that i had mentioned earlier are just not fulfilled  
**1:02:02-1:02:09:**  you know the first one is that as i said i do use external inputs like straw or organic  
**1:02:09-1:02:17:**  material that i bring in from neighbors most of it i would say 95 of all the organic material  
**1:02:17-1:02:22:**  i bring into the farm are actually trash and byproducts of different production chains  
**1:02:22-1:02:31:**  from neighbors like for example i bring in a lot of rotten wood from one a firewood processing  
**1:02:31-1:02:36:**  company here close by so when they split up the firewood all these little bits of wood  
**1:02:36-1:02:42:**  fall off and the bark and the mosses and it just creates this marvelous black soil because  
**1:02:42-1:02:45:**  it just sits there forever and then there's all these little pieces of wood that are all  
**1:02:45-1:02:51:**  like covered in fungi and everything and i bring that in because as a supplement to my  
**1:02:51-1:02:57:**  soil and there's a neighbor that has a lot of he has a horse stable and nobody in the  
**1:02:57-1:03:03:**  area in the region here wants to use his horse manure because he mixes it with wood chips  
**1:03:03-1:03:10:**  and people here are used to plowing the manure under and leaving the soil uncovered and obviously  
**1:03:10-1:03:15:**  you shouldn't plow under manure like this it will do bad for your soil because it's  
**1:03:15-1:03:22:**  very rich in carbon and much less rich in nitrogen and is not decomposed and so i use  
**1:03:22-1:03:28:**  this a lot because it comes very cheap and is very is my cheapest way of covering the  
**1:03:28-1:03:37:**  soil organic material and then the other product that i do use is hay from a neighbor he has  
**1:03:37-1:03:44:**  yeah i think he has about two or three hundred cows and he has this extensive grazing operation  
**1:03:44-1:03:52:**  and every year they make a large number of hay bales and he has had last year and this  
**1:03:52-1:03:58:**  year a lot of bales that were rotten because they've been exposed to the weather and he  
**1:03:58-1:04:04:**  sells them to me for very cheap and for me it's perfect because i just shred them up  
**1:04:04-1:04:10:**  with the mulcher that goes behind the tractor and then it's kind of like shredded hay the  
**1:04:10-1:04:14:**  seeds are already not viable anymore because the hay is really old and it's been exposed  
**1:04:14-1:04:20:**  to the weather and so in this anaerobic decomposition that occurs inside the bale the seeds become  
**1:04:20-1:04:25:**  inviolable i have no more weeds coming from the hay and it's much cheaper than if i buy  
**1:04:25-1:04:36:**  fresh hay or straw and i do also use a lot of seedlings here in my farm and i do use  
**1:04:36-1:04:43:**  in limited quantities irrigation so these are like you know the main elements where  
**1:04:43-1:04:50:**  i would say that i'm not like entirely centropic and then also i'm just a question why are  
**1:04:50-1:04:54:**  you doing it this way in that case if it's not purely centropic what are the reasons  
**1:04:54-1:05:01:**  that are pushing you towards using these these inputs the straw and the stuff the irrigation  
**1:05:01-1:05:07:**  as well just understand what's the you know strategy behind that there's a different number  
**1:05:07-1:05:15:**  of reasons first of all you know i'm doing a research farm here and you know i have mostly  
**1:05:15-1:05:23:**  like research objectives and for me it's also you know as this is the nature of the farm  
**1:05:23-1:05:28:**  the economic model behind it for the past two and a half years has been mostly been  
**1:05:28-1:05:37:**  relying on funding and you know i i myself working so hard for planting all these agroforestry  
**1:05:37-1:05:44:**  systems i want to see things develop and i want myself to see myself here inside a forest  
**1:05:44-1:05:52:**  within a reasonable time span and also i want to show some kind of results to my funders  
**1:05:52-1:05:57:**  and if you would look back at the list of materials that i told you that i use there's  
**1:05:57-1:06:07:**  nothing in there that is like a fast decomposing so to say organic fertilizer it's all like  
**1:06:07-1:06:13:**  imagine like whole grain cereals for the soil you know it's like whole grain food it's uh  
**1:06:13-1:06:21:**  integral and so you know um when you have in centropic farming we also don't believe  
**1:06:21-1:06:30:**  in decomposition or as people would call it compost we don't generally don't i mean there's  
**1:06:30-1:06:36:**  i don't you know believe anymore in these dogmas i used to be like very strict about  
**1:06:36-1:06:41:**  what i wanted to do or not want to do you know i work with the resources i have available  
**1:06:41-1:06:50:**  to me and compost has this funny thing that it's a lot of organic material that plants  
**1:06:50-1:06:59:**  work very hard to complexify all this solar and cosmic energy into their plant structure  
**1:06:59-1:07:07:**  into their like the plant fibers making all these sugars and these yeah this beautiful  
**1:07:07-1:07:15:**  magnificent being and if we then take that and put that into a compost which is a exothermic  
**1:07:15-1:07:23:**  reaction so it heats up and inside this heating up process a lot of these energies are actually  
**1:07:23-1:07:31:**  being sent back out into the universe so it's a entropic reaction in the end and what we  
**1:07:31-1:07:38:**  usually do is we apply any kind of organic material as fresh as possible directly to  
**1:07:38-1:07:46:**  the place where we planted at the feet of our plants and let that process occur on site  
**1:07:46-1:07:51:**  and there are specific ways in which we arrange the organic material so that it doesn't get  
**1:07:51-1:08:00:**  hot and that leads to the fact that you actually have a reaction that cools down the place  
**1:08:00-1:08:05:**  so here my farm you know last year we had this weather station running and you could  
**1:08:05-1:08:13:**  see that while in the control fields the soil temperature 10 cm below soil level was 38  
**1:08:13-1:08:19:**  degrees at the peak of the day here my farm was only 21 and you see that's a very big  
**1:08:19-1:08:25:**  difference for a plant root system for the microbiology for the fungi for the bacteria  
**1:08:25-1:08:33:**  in this kind of really harsh climate where temperatures go 42-44 degrees and the like  
**1:08:33-1:08:40:**  drought period is 4-5 months and the rains are getting more and more unpredictable  
**1:08:40-1:08:45:**  you can't tell us this and not tell us how you layer the organic matter  
**1:08:45-1:08:54:**  well you have to it's kind of like imagine like those windrows that the tractors make  
**1:08:54-1:08:59:**  when they pile up the hay so it has like one pile where it's like a pile that's high on  
**1:08:59-1:09:05:**  the center and then it falls off to the sides imagine if you would do two of those right  
**1:09:05-1:09:10:**  next to each other so you would have two piles that are high on top and then fall off towards  
**1:09:10-1:09:17:**  the sides and just where those two piles meet where the organic material is like let's say  
**1:09:17-1:09:23:**  like only 5 or 10 cm thick and then on the outsides you know you have like the 30-40  
**1:09:23-1:09:28:**  cm thick organic material in the center is where you have the plants and so what happens  
**1:09:28-1:09:39:**  is that it actually draws humidity and cold air it creates this how's it called a thermal  
**1:09:39-1:09:47:**  current that brings the fresher air and the humidity towards the center towards the plant  
**1:09:47-1:09:54:**  and yeah so I don't I didn't want to get into explaining it because I think it's hard to  
**1:09:54-1:10:00:**  visualize without like a physical example yeah yeah no but all of these techniques that  
**1:10:00-1:10:06:**  you're talking about they require or imagine like if you if you just plant a single tree  
**1:10:06-1:10:13:**  or like a group of trees one of the things you know we don't call make we don't plant  
**1:10:13-1:10:18:**  a tree in a hole in some tropic farming like ernest is always very explicit about the fact  
**1:10:18-1:10:27:**  that a hole is for the people and that a nest is for the trees so it's a place of creation  
**1:10:27-1:10:36:**  a place of birth cradle so to say and with this parable made when you have one of these  
**1:10:36-1:10:41:**  nests the best way to organize the organic material around it is exactly in the shape  
**1:10:41-1:10:46:**  of a bird's nest so this kind of circle that's high on the outside and then at the center  
**1:10:46-1:10:52:**  where the trees are maybe three to five centimeters thick so just because of the shape of the  
**1:10:52-1:10:58:**  way it's organized you're seeing like a big impact of course on temperatures as compared  
**1:10:58-1:11:03:**  to just layering mulch kind of in whichever way yeah because you know if you make this  
**1:11:03-1:11:09:**  single pile with all the mulch organized just in one thing if you would plant the trees  
**1:11:09-1:11:15:**  on the center of that first of all their trunks would rot away yeah for sure second you are  
**1:11:15-1:11:22:**  creating a heat driven reaction which sends energy back to the universe we in some tropic  
**1:11:22-1:11:30:**  farming you know we attempt to use the natural capital given to us to trigger transformative  
**1:11:30-1:11:40:**  processes that lead to a growth in capital on the site and improvement of life conditions  
**1:11:40-1:11:46:**  for all consolidated beings on that site so you know that's why I said we don't believe  
**1:11:46-1:11:55:**  in decomposition or in compost because when we apply these fresh whole organic materials  
**1:11:55-1:12:03:**  to the soil they are not decomposed but they are being transformed into higher life forms  
**1:12:03-1:12:08:**  which is a chain reaction of one life form eating the other one eating the other one  
**1:12:08-1:12:15:**  eating the other one and that is leading to the fact of improving and raising the life  
**1:12:15-1:12:24:**  conditions on that place so that more demanding trees or plants can grow so here in my project  
**1:12:24-1:12:32:**  I started working here almost three years ago it's based in this agricultural estate  
**1:12:32-1:12:40:**  at that Lufthansa where they allowed me the privilege to purchase a parcel of their property  
**1:12:40-1:12:48:**  or Alfredo the owner of the land he allowed me the privilege to purchase a part of his  
**1:12:48-1:12:55:**  lands a part of his inheritance in order to realize my dream in order to realize my project  
**1:12:55-1:13:02:**  of living here of cultivating this land and reforesting it and so I started with principally  
**1:13:02-1:13:07:**  three objectives you know when I came back from Ernst's farm I told you this the other  
**1:13:07-1:13:14:**  day you know I was looking to deepen my knowledge about plants about agriculture and so I bought  
**1:13:14-1:13:20:**  a lot of books about food forest about agroforestry about organic agriculture all this kind of  
**1:13:20-1:13:26:**  stuff and I started reading it I'm like hey like all of this stuff does not actually align  
**1:13:26-1:13:30:**  with that what Ernst was telling me like they're talking about competition they're talking  
**1:13:30-1:13:36:**  about you know all these kind of things and I don't feel that this is actually it's all  
**1:13:36-1:13:43:**  very honorable work and I don't want to say it's not valuable it's very valuable but you  
**1:13:43-1:13:50:**  know I was I wanted to tune in to this truth that I felt from Ernst's this deep understanding  
**1:13:50-1:13:58:**  of how nature actually works you know and so instead of studying continued study agriculture  
**1:13:58-1:14:03:**  I bought like all kinds of books about philosophy and if you look at my library now like most  
**1:14:03-1:14:11:**  of it's like Cicero, Marcus Aurelius, Plato all kinds of stuff from ancient Egypt and  
**1:14:11-1:14:17:**  you know that's really what started fascinating me and one of the big things that started  
**1:14:17-1:14:23:**  fascinating me about these texts is the way that they describe the Mediterranean ecosystem  
**1:14:23-1:14:28:**  that they found when they had first come here so in like the ancient Greek texts you know  
**1:14:28-1:14:37:**  there's like the example of Kritius and Timaeus from Plato where Plato is describing how Athens  
**1:14:37-1:14:44:**  looked 12,000 years ago based on current like time counting was like a historical account  
**1:14:44-1:14:53:**  that he had received from Egyptian priest and so I mean there's a story where they also  
**1:14:53-1:14:56:**  it's a bit of a controversial story because it's also the same text where they describe  
**1:14:56-1:15:06:**  Atlantis they it's like pretty much there's this guy Solon who had later on been like  
**1:15:06-1:15:14:**  a dictator that the state of Greece voluntarily elected because they believed he was the only  
**1:15:14-1:15:21:**  one that could save the state of calamity that was occurring in Greece he was very wise  
**1:15:21-1:15:26:**  man and he had studied in Egypt and he was getting in this discussion with the ancient  
**1:15:26-1:15:32:**  Egyptian priest about how the Greeks knew everything about history and he starts relating  
**1:15:32-1:15:43:**  like how forget the name of the guy was the name of the his son of Apollo and he asked  
**1:15:43-1:15:53:**  his father Apollo to let him or Helios to drive the Sun chariot and so when he got on  
**1:15:53-1:16:00:**  the Sun chariot he couldn't drive it and he got off course and he crashed it and it burned  
**1:16:00-1:16:06:**  the face of the earth and that was one of the moments according and so the Solon he  
**1:16:06-1:16:11:**  starts relating these stories to the priest and then the priest goes yes you tell these  
**1:16:11-1:16:16:**  stories very good and also the story of the flood you know this very good and your people  
**1:16:16-1:16:21:**  very honorable because you still remember these events but here in Egypt we have never  
**1:16:21-1:16:26:**  suffered from fire that erased our knowledge because we are living in the desert and we  
**1:16:26-1:16:32:**  have never suffered from flood that erased our civilization and our knowledge because  
**1:16:32-1:16:38:**  there's no rain here and we still remember that there was not just one fire or one flood  
**1:16:38-1:16:43:**  but that there was many other ones before and so he starts telling about how there was  
**1:16:43-1:16:50:**  a civilization living in Athens 10,000 years before Plato lived and he is describing the  
**1:16:50-1:16:56:**  ecosystem and the water springs and all the stuff that was there so I mean like it's like  
**1:16:56-1:17:02:**  for modern historians it's a bit of a dubious story but you know it just fascinated me like  
**1:17:02-1:17:09:**  how they describe the Mediterranean ecosystem and there's much more explicit examples of  
**1:17:09-1:17:15:**  where they actually describe how their ecosystem look like and then we also obviously have  
**1:17:15-1:17:21:**  the the pollen evidence you know from the depths of lakes and other places where the  
**1:17:21-1:17:27:**  pollen just accumulated that show us that these were very diverse deciduous forests  
**1:17:27-1:17:32:**  I've read research on the pollen it's called the name of it is this type of work do you  
**1:17:32-1:17:38:**  remember what they call it it's crazy and they can go back from the studies I was seeing  
**1:17:38-1:17:45:**  they went back up to 8,000 years ago and they've connected the pollen findings with the archaeological  
**1:17:45-1:17:50:**  findings yeah and you can see exactly where the man cut down the forest exactly and they  
**1:17:50-1:17:57:**  aligned it with so the arrival of dust of fire different layers and the changes in the  
**1:17:57-1:18:02:**  50 to 100 years of the ecosystem and I can't talk about the details now what I can say  
**1:18:02-1:18:08:**  is that there's been some radical and clearly anthropogenic changes of the ecosystem of  
**1:18:08-1:18:12:**  a civilization that we would have we would say oh no it's small and not many you know  
**1:18:12-1:18:15:**  they didn't have chainsaws they didn't have machines but they had radical impact they  
**1:18:15-1:18:23:**  weren't much stronger than us you know like they were like our people nowadays like you  
**1:18:23-1:18:29:**  know we're like both of us were like men at almost the peak of our like livelihoods like  
**1:18:29-1:18:34:**  if you would compare us to people from those times or even people from 150 years ago we're  
**1:18:34-1:18:40:**  weak you know like we don't even know how to like you know these guys they were like  
**1:18:40-1:18:49:**  really like strong and built and you know like they knew how to cut down a tree even  
**1:18:49-1:18:57:**  if they didn't have a chainsaw yeah and anyway so you know like number one these texts they  
**1:18:57-1:19:02:**  really inspired me and it made big part of why I wanted to move to the Mediterranean  
**1:19:02-1:19:12:**  climate and number one objective behind this project then obviously came to be to re-establish  
**1:19:12-1:19:18:**  a functioning Mediterranean forest because coming from the super inspiring example that  
**1:19:18-1:19:24:**  Ernst gave to the world where he has like rehabilitated the super destroyed land and  
**1:19:24-1:19:30:**  nowadays like it was like based on the index that they have there by a scientific institute  
**1:19:30-1:19:36:**  called the IBAMA in Brazil it was the most degraded land in the large region nowadays  
**1:19:36-1:19:45:**  it's the most biodiverse most rich in photosynthesis most healthy biome his farm in the whole Atlantic  
**1:19:45-1:19:50:**  rainforest region which is a million three hundred thousand square kilometers they've  
**1:19:50-1:19:55:**  done studies on the biodiversity there I mean he has many species there that are listed  
**1:19:55-1:20:01:**  as extinct I was shocked when I went to his farm it's crazy he has the biggest I saw he  
**1:20:01-1:20:07:**  has the biggest collection of genotypes of cacao probably in the whole world he has collected  
**1:20:07-1:20:14:**  all kinds of indigenous cacao varieties from all over South America and Middle America  
**1:20:14-1:20:18:**  and there's like five hundred genotypes of cacao that he has he's also brought trees  
**1:20:18-1:20:23:**  there from the Amazon from Central America from it's like it's a crazy mix of edible  
**1:20:23-1:20:29:**  species no for sure like it in Asia everywhere yeah that's fascinating and so you know like  
**1:20:29-1:20:36:**  coming from this super inspiring example I just I remember like you know when I realized  
**1:20:36-1:20:40:**  that I would have to leave Ernst's farm I started having nightmares about going back  
**1:20:40-1:20:44:**  to the city because I really didn't want to leave nature and the natural environment that  
**1:20:44-1:20:49:**  I was in and I approached Ernst and I was like Ernst you know I'm getting really worried  
**1:20:49-1:20:54:**  I don't know if I want to leave I don't know if I'll ever feel good again living in a city  
**1:20:54-1:21:01:**  said Mark that's okay just know that now is the time where you have to leave but if I  
**1:21:01-1:21:07:**  was you at your age and if I had seen and learned what you learned and saw here I would  
**1:21:07-1:21:14:**  leave with all the certainty inside of me and all the what is it called determination  
**1:21:14-1:21:20:**  to do the same thing somewhere else in the world and he like spoke that into my soul  
**1:21:20-1:21:25:**  and it like shifted my perspective immediately because before I was like worried about returning  
**1:21:25-1:21:29:**  to Europe and all of a sudden I was like super excited I was like let's go I want to start  
**1:21:29-1:21:42:**  planting forests in Europe you know so you know I really like it's like so to say like  
**1:21:42-1:21:49:**  I feel like we inherited this landscape as it is now and to me it's just like in respect  
**1:21:49-1:21:54:**  to all our ancestors I am planting these forests and I want to make a Mediterranean ecosystem  
**1:21:54-1:21:59:**  that works again and you know like what was very special experience to me this year I  
**1:21:59-1:22:05:**  had the honor I had a client that hired me for a consultancy job in Greece and I got  
**1:22:05-1:22:14:**  to plant agroforestry about 500 meters from this huge palace that's made out of boulders  
**1:22:14-1:22:21:**  that must weigh like 80 tons or more which apparently was a palace that Hercules built  
**1:22:21-1:22:26:**  to live in so that was like the place where Hercules lived which is like one of my favorite  
**1:22:26-1:22:31:**  figures from the Greek myths and I planted agroforestry 500 meters from there and like  
**1:22:31-1:22:35:**  you just dig in the soil it's like full of ceramics is insane and you know like it's  
**1:22:35-1:22:42:**  really like in honor of this heritage and in honor of this beautiful landscape you know  
**1:22:42-1:22:47:**  I want to work on these lands and plant these forests and bring these ecosystems to work  
**1:22:47-1:22:55:**  again and second objective is to create like an oasis and hotspot and a place of prolonged  
**1:22:55-1:23:03:**  well-being for all kinds of pollinating insects and all kind of seed dispersing animals and  
**1:23:03-1:23:11:**  also other animals that fulfill other functions in the ecosystem of course including humans  
**1:23:11-1:23:15:**  so it's not a natural reserve but it's a place of permanent inclusion of the human which  
**1:23:15-1:23:25:**  is another thing that Ernst always talks about and so the third objective is to apply as  
**1:23:25-1:23:32:**  much as I can the principles and techniques of syntropic farming here in the Mediterranean  
**1:23:32-1:23:39:**  climate and act kind of like as a learning spot and a hotspot for knowledge creation  
**1:23:39-1:23:49:**  and knowledge sharing around this topic and yeah we're gonna be sharing some some pictures  
**1:23:49-1:23:57:**  of your farm to everybody to conclude there's by now four different fields that I've planted  
**1:23:57-1:24:01:**  each one of them is between three thousand to four and a half thousand square meters  
**1:24:01-1:24:11:**  big in total they're like 13,000 square meters so 1.3 hectares and on this area I've planted  
**1:24:11-1:24:20:**  estimated about 70,000 trees most of them by seed directly a lot of them also now in  
**1:24:20-1:24:29:**  more recent years in like this planting season and the one before by nursery seedlings and  
**1:24:29-1:24:36:**  yeah it's and then it has all the fruit trees in it as well my farm is mainly focused on  
**1:24:36-1:24:45:**  citrus 21 varieties of citrus I have olives I have figs grapes walnuts and let's say grapes  
**1:24:45-1:24:53:**  already no peaches that's the sixth one so these six and one of the four fields is also  
**1:24:53-1:25:00:**  done completely without irrigation the other three they do receive some irrigation but  
**1:25:00-1:25:08:**  it's very limited very nice I think that gives like a very broad explanation of what's here  
**1:25:08-1:25:15:**  in the ground I think that this whole story has been of course there's so much to it and  
**1:25:15-1:25:20:**  you've been very skilled at telling us this whole adventure that you've been through and  
**1:25:20-1:25:27:**  one more thing that I want to clarify is that this project has the objective for me to be  
**1:25:27-1:25:31:**  able to continue personally developing as well so it's not just like a learning center  
**1:25:31-1:25:36:**  for other people but also learning place for myself I did not just want to go out in the  
**1:25:36-1:25:40:**  world and start being a consultant or whatever or working for other people I really wanted  
**1:25:40-1:25:47:**  to do things on my own property and get experience in this ecosystem before sharing any knowledge  
**1:25:47-1:25:54:**  and that is because I'm not an expert in centropic farming as you had introduced me in the beginning  
**1:25:54-1:26:00:**  I'm a student and you know I think that's a big part about the philosophy of centropic  
**1:26:00-1:26:06:**  farming is that you never consider yourself a master you never consider yourself an expert  
**1:26:06-1:26:11:**  you are an eternal student to mother nature I just want to finish off thanking you so  
**1:26:11-1:26:18:**  much for coming on the show it's been you know long overdue and I think it came at exactly  
**1:26:18-1:26:23:**  the right moment okay fantastic and we're gonna have another round together and thank  
**1:26:23-1:26:29:**  you so much it's been really enjoyable and thank you to all the listeners that listened

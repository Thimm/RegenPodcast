### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Fri, 15 Jul 2022 15:11:39)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:33:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:33-0:00:34:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:34-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:45:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:48:**  Welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:50:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:50-0:00:53:**  Today I have the pleasure of welcoming Patrick Worms onto the show.  
**0:00:53-0:00:59:**  He is a policy advisor for World Agroforestry and the president of the European Agroforestry  
**0:00:59-0:01:01:**  Federation.  
**0:01:01-0:01:05:**  We discuss together agroforestry but from a policy perspective to understand how we  
**0:01:05-0:01:12:**  can convince decision makers and what type of funding is needed to scale agroforestry.  
**0:01:12-0:01:16:**  Although much of the conversation is focused on Europe, Patrick gives some insights that  
**0:01:16-0:01:20:**  will be of great interest to anyone who wants to convince key players of the opportunity  
**0:01:20-0:01:23:**  that agroforestry represents.  
**0:01:23-0:01:27:**  Patrick is an amazing speaker and you will find that this interview is not only highly  
**0:01:27-0:01:31:**  informative but also very entertaining and full of punchlines.  
**0:01:31-0:01:32:**  Enjoy.  
**0:01:32-0:01:33:**  Hi, Patrick.  
**0:01:33-0:01:35:**  Welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:35-0:01:38:**  Thank you.  
**0:01:38-0:01:44:**  So you know you're a bit of an unusual guest but a bit different from the farmers we usually  
**0:01:44-0:01:45:**  interview.  
**0:01:45-0:01:50:**  So why don't you just tell us who you are and what you do in life?  
**0:01:50-0:01:51:**  Thank you Etienne.  
**0:01:51-0:01:57:**  Well I'm Patrick Worms, I'm a German citizen who lives in Belgium and here I represent  
**0:01:57-0:02:03:**  World Agroforestry which is a research institution headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya where I am  
**0:02:03-0:02:05:**  the senior science policy advisor.  
**0:02:05-0:02:08:**  I'm also the president of the European Agroforestry Federation.  
**0:02:08-0:02:14:**  I'm now in my second term and the board will be renewed in New Orleans so I'm looking forward  
**0:02:14-0:02:20:**  to passing the baton on to somebody else at the European Agroforestry Conference which  
**0:02:20-0:02:25:**  will be happening this May in Sardinia in Italy.  
**0:02:25-0:02:29:**  And how did you first get involved with agroforestry?  
**0:02:29-0:02:39:**  Well 12 years ago I was helping a friend organize what was the United Arab Emirates very first  
**0:02:39-0:02:43:**  global conference devoted to environmental issues, a conference called Eye on Earth.  
**0:02:43-0:02:49:**  And there I listened to a fascinating presentation by Professor Dennis Garrity whom some of you  
**0:02:49-0:02:51:**  audience will know.  
**0:02:51-0:02:55:**  He was director general of World Agroforestry at the time.  
**0:02:55-0:03:02:**  And Dennis made a presentation that explains the wonderful capabilities and impact of mixing  
**0:03:02-0:03:04:**  crops with trees.  
**0:03:04-0:03:09:**  And as a biologist because I'm trained as a geneticist that was immediately obvious  
**0:03:09-0:03:10:**  to me.  
**0:03:10-0:03:12:**  The other thing that was obvious to me is that even though I spent all of my career  
**0:03:12-0:03:18:**  dealing with environmental issues I had never even heard the World Agroforestry before Dennis  
**0:03:18-0:03:19:**  mentioned it.  
**0:03:19-0:03:22:**  So I thought these guys needed some help.  
**0:03:22-0:03:26:**  At the time I just sold my own lobbying company here in Brussels so I was flushed not enough  
**0:03:26-0:03:31:**  to stop working for the rest of my life but enough not to have to worry about my income  
**0:03:31-0:03:32:**  for a few months.  
**0:03:32-0:03:37:**  And so I started lobbying for agroforestry here in Brussels not realizing what it was  
**0:03:37-0:03:41:**  really within a few months I realized I really needed to learn more.  
**0:03:41-0:03:44:**  So I got on a flight to Nairobi told my wife I'd be there for a couple of weeks I ended  
**0:03:44-0:03:49:**  up staying a couple of months then it took me down to Zambia and to Malawi to get a better  
**0:03:49-0:03:54:**  Zimbabwe to get a better understanding of what this agroforestry stuff is.  
**0:03:54-0:03:57:**  And at the end of that it was agreed that it would be useful if I carried on working  
**0:03:57-0:03:59:**  with them but I couldn't carry on doing it for free forever.  
**0:03:59-0:04:02:**  And so they signed a contract with me and that was 11 years ago.  
**0:04:02-0:04:04:**  So that's how I got into agroforestry.  
**0:04:04-0:04:09:**  I was an environmentally concerned individual who had been doing environmental remediation  
**0:04:09-0:04:14:**  projects mostly in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union for decades who  
**0:04:14-0:04:18:**  understood a little bit about lobbying about corporate lobbying and about government lobbying  
**0:04:18-0:04:27:**  and who was fascinated by what was what struck me at the time and still remains an absolutely  
**0:04:27-0:04:34:**  extraordinary way of managing landscapes for both human ends and ecosystem agains.  
**0:04:34-0:04:39:**  And what elements really you know it's interesting to hear a journey going from lobbyists to  
**0:04:39-0:04:44:**  all of a sudden getting this sudden interest for agroforestry.  
**0:04:44-0:04:46:**  What elements specifically kind of appeal to you?  
**0:04:46-0:04:50:**  Were they on the purely ecological level or did you also see social benefits?  
**0:04:50-0:04:53:**  I mean what caught your eye?  
**0:04:53-0:04:54:**  All of the above.  
**0:04:54-0:05:00:**  What really the first thing that struck me was the sheer elegance of a system that rotates  
**0:05:00-0:05:07:**  nutrients gases and water in a far more efficient way across its components than a monocrop  
**0:05:07-0:05:12:**  system ever could simply because you have more roots they go deeper you have a bigger  
**0:05:12-0:05:15:**  crown so you have bigger ecosystemic effects.  
**0:05:15-0:05:19:**  The second thing that struck me and that was right at the same time because Dennis was  
**0:05:19-0:05:24:**  speaking about agroforestry in the West African Sahelian context was the extraordinary impact  
**0:05:24-0:05:29:**  this had on social and economic benefits because these are environments in which I mean yeah  
**0:05:29-0:05:33:**  if you have oodles of capital if you're a millionaire you can sink a well and you can  
**0:05:33-0:05:38:**  use diesel and you can use pesticides and fertilizers and all the rest of it and you  
**0:05:38-0:05:42:**  can grow stuff in the Sahel but local farmers don't operate like that they're too poor and  
**0:05:42-0:05:46:**  in that environment unless you have trees it's really difficult to grow anything at  
**0:05:46-0:05:47:**  all.  
**0:05:47-0:05:51:**  The trees provide you with fertility with protection against drought with protection  
**0:05:51-0:05:54:**  against storms etc etc etc etc.  
**0:05:54-0:05:59:**  So right from the start I had this this vision of a system that was benefiting both the farmers  
**0:05:59-0:06:04:**  and the people living on a piece of land and the wider community and by wider community  
**0:06:04-0:06:08:**  I don't mean the wider human community I mean the wider community of life the animals the  
**0:06:08-0:06:14:**  plants the microbiome etc I.e. all the bits and pieces that we don't normally think about  
**0:06:14-0:06:17:**  but that make the difference between a living and a dead planet.  
**0:06:17-0:06:22:**  Tell us a bit more about your job today at the World Agroforestry what do your daily  
**0:06:22-0:06:24:**  tasks look like?  
**0:06:24-0:06:29:**  My daily tasks are really to do two things first is to influence policy and influencing  
**0:06:29-0:06:35:**  policy means ensuring that development funding for example goes more into an agroecological  
**0:06:35-0:06:41:**  direction than into an intensive agricultural direction.  
**0:06:41-0:06:45:**  It means trying to influence the way that certain strategic documents are being drafted  
**0:06:45-0:06:51:**  or are being prepared so for example you can see the imprimatur of the work that we do  
**0:06:51-0:06:57:**  in the European Union's biodiversity strategy the European Union's forestry strategy or  
**0:06:57-0:07:02:**  the European Union's farm to fork strategies all of which mention agroforestry as a pretty  
**0:07:02-0:07:05:**  good way of managing landscapes.  
**0:07:05-0:07:10:**  We try to integrate agroforestry into different bits of policy whenever we can so for example  
**0:07:10-0:07:15:**  the director general for climate at the European Commission has identified carbon farming as  
**0:07:15-0:07:22:**  something we need to do in order to get to grips with the carbon greed we all have and  
**0:07:22-0:07:27:**  to identify the key interventions within carbon farming they commissioned some consultants  
**0:07:27-0:07:33:**  who work with them and the result is peatland rewetting and agroforestry.  
**0:07:33-0:07:37:**  So it doesn't matter which way you look at this whether you look at it from the perspective  
**0:07:37-0:07:41:**  of productivity whether you look at it from the perspective of resilience whether you  
**0:07:41-0:07:44:**  look at it from the perspective of social issues whether you look at it from the perspective  
**0:07:44-0:07:50:**  of biodiversity or whether you look at it from the perspective of climate agroforestry  
**0:07:50-0:07:52:**  always comes back as a pretty good option.  
**0:07:52-0:07:56:**  What are your tools to convince people about agroforestry what are the decision makers  
**0:07:56-0:08:00:**  looking for and you know how can you push forward this agenda?  
**0:08:00-0:08:02:**  A story.  
**0:08:02-0:08:06:**  A story backed by good scientific evidence.  
**0:08:06-0:08:10:**  You're not going to get anywhere if all you do is send people scientific papers and World  
**0:08:10-0:08:14:**  Agroforestry is an institution that does research so that publishes scientific papers I think  
**0:08:14-0:08:19:**  by now we have over 7,000 peer reviewed papers to our name but papers don't change policy  
**0:08:19-0:08:23:**  what does change policy is the ability to tell a story built on those papers so that  
**0:08:23-0:08:30:**  people can envision a different future from the current trend that they're on.  
**0:08:30-0:08:36:**  Policymakers want to make the world a better place within the regulatory constraints within  
**0:08:36-0:08:39:**  they have to operate their bureaucrats and bureaucrats have to operate within the rules  
**0:08:39-0:08:44:**  that other bureaucrats have prepared but within those rules they want to chippy the rest of  
**0:08:44-0:08:50:**  us in the right direction so they are going to be encouraging the adoption of agroforestry  
**0:08:50-0:08:54:**  if they can see the evidence that agroforestry works but in order for them to sit down and  
**0:08:54-0:09:00:**  spend an hour or two going through papers to convince themselves that agroforestry works  
**0:09:00-0:09:03:**  you need to give them an opening you need to give them the possibility of doing so and  
**0:09:03-0:09:09:**  you do that through stories and that means that you give them visions it's images it's  
**0:09:09-0:09:15:**  simple graphs it's photographs it's podcasts it's presentations it's simple things things  
**0:09:15-0:09:21:**  that make them go hey what is this agroforestry stuff why is it so important in other words  
**0:09:21-0:09:26:**  things that make people react in much the way that I reacted to Dennis Garrity's presentation  
**0:09:26-0:09:29:**  in Abu Dhabi all these years ago.  
**0:09:29-0:09:32:**  Dennis is also very good at telling stories.  
**0:09:32-0:09:38:**  And what always uh struck me is that um what always you know I found very powerful is that  
**0:09:38-0:09:43:**  both agroforestry but more widely regenerative agriculture have a amazing story to tell right  
**0:09:43-0:09:48:**  and most of us that got into it were taken into that story and through emotion rather  
**0:09:48-0:09:52:**  than facts so totally understand where you're coming from with that.  
**0:09:52-0:09:57:**  Yeah but it's it's important to understand that we didn't stay with it with the regenerative  
**0:09:57-0:10:03:**  agriculture story or the agroforestry story or the agroecology story because of the emotions  
**0:10:03-0:10:09:**  we stayed with it because the facts corroborated our emotions we looked at it and we thought  
**0:10:09-0:10:13:**  hey this sounds great this is wonderful this is a way in which we can save the planet but  
**0:10:13-0:10:18:**  then the next reaction is does it actually work or am I just being taken for a ride and  
**0:10:18-0:10:22:**  that's when you go through the books when you go through the papers when you talk to  
**0:10:22-0:10:27:**  people who are doing it and when you begin to understand more and more what it can and  
**0:10:27-0:10:34:**  what it cannot do and that reinforces the belief if you like it reinforces the story  
**0:10:34-0:10:39:**  and that is why regenerative agriculture is growing despite the fact that we have practically  
**0:10:39-0:10:44:**  no money for marketing unlike the agrochemical industry which this year is reckoned to be  
**0:10:44-0:10:53:**  spending about 245 billion dollars on sorry to have a revenue of about 245 billion dollars  
**0:10:53-0:10:58:**  outside of China so that's just the rest of the world and we don't have and of course  
**0:10:58-0:11:01:**  they operate these companies operate like pharma companies which means about 40% of  
**0:11:01-0:11:08:**  their revenue goes into marketing distribution etc rather than research and we don't have  
**0:11:08-0:11:12:**  that resource the only thing we have is a better story than that but the story is convincing  
**0:11:12-0:11:15:**  more and more farmers.  
**0:11:15-0:11:20:**  So you know that's your day job and as a president of URAF do you do similar missions then or  
**0:11:20-0:11:22:**  how does that compare?  
**0:11:22-0:11:28:**  Yeah it's very it's a very similar mission and my bosses in Nairobi understand that I'm  
**0:11:28-0:11:35:**  pursuing their objective as well when I am worrying about European agroforestry so at  
**0:11:35-0:11:41:**  URAF we really try to do two things first we try to encourage Europe's agroforesters  
**0:11:41-0:11:47:**  and the membership is I guess about two-thirds academic one-third farmers to get better at  
**0:11:47-0:11:52:**  talking about agroforestry in their own national context that means we have regular monthly  
**0:11:52-0:11:56:**  meetings where we exchange information where we see what's happening in different countries  
**0:11:56-0:12:01:**  etc the second thing that we try to do is to help them win research contracts two-thirds  
**0:12:01-0:12:06:**  in academics, academics run from one grant to another it's a pretty hard life and I mean  
**0:12:06-0:12:10:**  farmers and academics are probably the two job descriptions that have the hardest life  
**0:12:10-0:12:14:**  in Europe at the moment and both of them are in URAF so what we're trying to do is to put  
**0:12:14-0:12:20:**  in place these these consortia these groupings of universities and practitioners and farms  
**0:12:20-0:12:26:**  etc that together want to research some aspect of agroforestry and win some funding usually  
**0:12:26-0:12:29:**  at the European level from from DG research.  
**0:12:29-0:12:33:**  So those are the two main things that we do the third thing that we do is of course what  
**0:12:33-0:12:38:**  I've already talked about the the lobbying side and trying to influence policy and that's  
**0:12:38-0:12:44:**  fiendishly hard because you can convince some bureaucrats in Brussels-Burg and story but  
**0:12:44-0:12:49:**  when the decision-making is distributed across all the member states of the European Union  
**0:12:49-0:12:54:**  suddenly it becomes much much harder and that was the flaw in the farm to fork strategy  
**0:12:54-0:12:59:**  the farm to fork strategy says all the right things about agroforestry but the farm to  
**0:12:59-0:13:05:**  fork strategy asks for the member states to create their own strategic plans because they  
**0:13:05-0:13:11:**  know better what works in their local context which is of course true but at the same time  
**0:13:11-0:13:16:**  deeply flawed because the ministries of agriculture inside these member states are the main point  
**0:13:16-0:13:21:**  of contact for the agrochemical industry across Europe that's where the decisions are taken  
**0:13:21-0:13:25:**  about what to authorize what not to authorize what to sell how to sell it how to buy where  
**0:13:25-0:13:31:**  the subsidies go etc etc so and and there we have no voice or very very little voice  
**0:13:31-0:13:36:**  since we don't have lobbyists in every capital of the European Union and so the strategic  
**0:13:36-0:13:43:**  plans that came back from the from those capitals are by and large extremely discouraging documents  
**0:13:43-0:13:50:**  of several thousand pages that mention agroforestry once or twice and that's why and I'm sure  
**0:13:50-0:13:56:**  that many of you listeners know this that's why the fear now is that under the new common  
**0:13:56-0:14:01:**  agricultural policy and its strategic plans we're going to actually take a step back in  
**0:14:01-0:14:08:**  agroecological terms rather than a step forward and that is now being encouraged by the fact  
**0:14:08-0:14:14:**  that the agrochemical industry is using the excuse of the Russia's invasion of Ukraine  
**0:14:14-0:14:19:**  to try to encourage Europe to double down on more fertilizers more pesticides more diesel  
**0:14:19-0:14:24:**  and less ecological bullshit. And so what do you see in the new cap policy that actually  
**0:14:24-0:14:31:**  takes things backwards rather than forwards? Not in the policy at European level it's more  
**0:14:31-0:14:36:**  what's coming back from the member states in the in terms of the strategic plans you  
**0:14:36-0:14:40:**  could say that the one thing that's taking things backwards at the European level is  
**0:14:40-0:14:46:**  the fact that the bureaucrats who develop a farm to fork strategy do not seem to have  
**0:14:46-0:14:51:**  realized that by giving so much freedom back to the member states that some of the things  
**0:14:51-0:14:56:**  that they wanted to happen on the agroecological front in Brussels since it isn't a mandate  
**0:14:56-0:15:02:**  but just one option amongst many was going to get abandoned. They may not have fully  
**0:15:02-0:15:08:**  realized that this is what was going to happen and that is what has happened. In most states  
**0:15:08-0:15:14:**  the measures to promote agroforestry are laughable. In the Czech Republic for example which under  
**0:15:14-0:15:21:**  its previous Ministry of Agriculture was actually quite pro agroforestry you now have a proposal  
**0:15:21-0:15:28:**  where only 0.02% of the agricultural surface of the country should be transformed into  
**0:15:28-0:15:34:**  agroforestry in the next five years. In other words nothing. Our Czech colleagues the Czech  
**0:15:34-0:15:40:**  Agroforestry Federation has enough requests from farmers to consume the five-year resource  
**0:15:40-0:15:44:**  the Czech government is planning to spend on the strategic on the agroforestry part of  
**0:15:44-0:15:53:**  the strategic plan within a year. So and that's only three farms. Three farms want to do agroforestry  
**0:15:53-0:15:57:**  and that would already consume all of the finances the Czech Republic is planning to  
**0:15:57-0:16:03:**  allocate to agroforestry over the next five years within one year. That's how little the  
**0:16:03-0:16:08:**  promotion of agroforestry is in the Czech Republic and we see that being repeated in  
**0:16:08-0:16:14:**  other countries as well. Ministries of agriculture are just not taking it seriously. Brussels  
**0:16:14-0:16:19:**  is taking it seriously but national ministries of agriculture are not and that's a foundational  
**0:16:19-0:16:24:**  problem. It's a fundamental problem because it means that farmers who want to transfer  
**0:16:24-0:16:28:**  to agroforestry not only are they not going to get the subsidies but very often they're  
**0:16:28-0:16:33:**  not going to get the technical advice that they need and as we all know agroforestry  
**0:16:33-0:16:39:**  sounds beautiful but the practice is not always easy. You need to know what tree to plant,  
**0:16:39-0:16:43:**  how to plant them, how to prune them, how to fertilize them, how to water them, what  
**0:16:43-0:16:47:**  distance to plant them, what the market is like etc etc etc etc and you need to know  
**0:16:47-0:16:52:**  all that before you even start planting your very first tree. Where are farmers going to  
**0:16:52-0:16:57:**  get that advice from? They're not getting it from the public advisory bodies which are  
**0:16:57-0:17:05:**  all into productivist agriculture. They might get it from activists, from NGOs and from  
**0:17:05-0:17:12:**  other farmers who are doing it but by definition these are a not very numerous and b concentrated.  
**0:17:12-0:17:18:**  Typically when you have an agroforestry somewhere you have other agroforestries in the neighborhood  
**0:17:18-0:17:22:**  and when you don't have any agroforestry at all you don't have any agroforestry for hundreds  
**0:17:22-0:17:27:**  of kilometers and it is in these places without any agroforestry at all of course that most  
**0:17:27-0:17:32:**  of the heavy lifting needs to be done and that's just not happening. We will come back  
**0:17:32-0:17:39:**  later on to you know how we can try and leverage and scale agroforestry but first I wanted  
**0:17:39-0:17:43:**  to get a sense of how things have evolved throughout your career. I mean from what I  
**0:17:43-0:17:49:**  understand policymakers have been more and more you know sensitive and have at the European  
**0:17:49-0:17:53:**  level have started to listen but now we're still at a point where we need to see like  
**0:17:53-0:17:58:**  scaling it up. How has it changed throughout your career lobbying for agroforestry and  
**0:17:58-0:18:08:**  working on it? It's been positive. To caricature 10 years ago people would not take my calls.  
**0:18:08-0:18:14:**  Today I get the calls. I don't have to call people. So there is a much greater interest  
**0:18:14-0:18:19:**  now in these techniques than there were 10 years ago and that's not just because of the  
**0:18:19-0:18:22:**  work that we've been doing it's because of the work that a lot of other people have been  
**0:18:22-0:18:29:**  doing. For example I don't know if you've seen the latest adaptation report of the IPCC.  
**0:18:29-0:18:34:**  I mean these are thousands of scientists who review hundreds of thousands of papers and  
**0:18:34-0:18:39:**  their conclusion on the land based stuff is agroecology rocks. Agroecology is better for  
**0:18:39-0:18:43:**  productivity it's better for adaptation it's better for resilience it's better for biodiversity  
**0:18:43-0:18:47:**  it's better for social things and then they have these wonderful two words between brackets  
**0:18:47-0:18:53:**  high confidence. What that means is the scientists have reviewed all of these studies and the  
**0:18:53-0:19:00:**  conclusions are very very sound. This is not you know daring science at the edge somewhere  
**0:19:00-0:19:04:**  that may or may be proven wrong in the future may or may not be proven wrong in the future.  
**0:19:04-0:19:10:**  This is settled science which a large community of scientists have concluded with high confidence  
**0:19:10-0:19:16:**  is the way to go. And that kind of message keeps on coming back time and time and time  
**0:19:16-0:19:20:**  again. Then we also know the FAO keeps on repeating and how much land degradation there  
**0:19:20-0:19:26:**  is. The IPCC keeps on repeating how much how many emissions are connected to the food systems.  
**0:19:26-0:19:30:**  There was a food system summit that looked at these things as well. So at the United  
**0:19:30-0:19:36:**  Nations level. So you do have an understanding at an international policy level that business  
**0:19:36-0:19:41:**  as usual simply doubling down with better seeds and better pesticides and better fertilizers  
**0:19:41-0:19:48:**  and better machinery GPS control and what have you. Yeah well it helps but at the margins  
**0:19:48-0:19:53:**  it doesn't it's not transformative. And right now margins don't work anymore. If we simply  
**0:19:53-0:19:58:**  do things at the margin we're turning this planet into hell. We need complete transformation  
**0:19:58-0:20:03:**  and in the agricultural system complete transformation does not mean replacing intensive agriculture  
**0:20:03-0:20:09:**  with agroecology. It means adding agroecology to the toolbox. Your trees are not there to  
**0:20:09-0:20:13:**  replace your tractors. Your trees are there to work with your tractors. And with a bit  
**0:20:13-0:20:17:**  of luck thanks to your trees you'll need to spend less on fertilizer and you'll need to  
**0:20:17-0:20:21:**  spend less on pesticides. And at the end you can harvest the timber and make some extra  
**0:20:21-0:20:26:**  money. That's the foundational promise of agroforestry for a farmer. But unless that  
**0:20:26-0:20:31:**  message comes out again and again and again so that farmers actually after a hard day's  
**0:20:31-0:20:35:**  work go on to Google to try to find out a little bit more about what that agroforestry  
**0:20:35-0:20:41:**  stuff is all about. This is not going to happen. But who is pushing back? I know you mentioned  
**0:20:41-0:20:46:**  the agro business beforehand but if the tree is not there. They're not pushing back. They  
**0:20:46-0:20:53:**  don't have to worry about it. Nobody's pushing back against agroforestry. Agroforestry is  
**0:20:53-0:20:59:**  like dieting. Everybody thinks it's a good idea and nobody does it. You know they're  
**0:20:59-0:21:04:**  not but they are not talking about it either. Go to a farm supply shop. What do you see?  
**0:21:04-0:21:09:**  The posters, the leaflets, the brochures. They're all about the latest seed, the latest  
**0:21:09-0:21:14:**  chemical, the latest machine, whatever you have. They're not about planting trees. They're  
**0:21:14-0:21:20:**  not about agroecology. They're not about agroforestry. And the reason is simple to understand. If  
**0:21:20-0:21:25:**  I'm in the business of making money from farmers I can do so very easily by selling them a  
**0:21:25-0:21:30:**  bag of stuff with a label about how it works and maybe add a nice app that they can have  
**0:21:30-0:21:34:**  on their phone so they know exactly what to spray when for what condition. And I can package  
**0:21:34-0:21:41:**  it with gorgeous marketing and everybody buys because it works. But if instead I want to  
**0:21:41-0:21:46:**  teach a farmer how to plant some trees I can't scale it. I can't run out 500,000 consultants  
**0:21:46-0:21:51:**  out of a factory and send them into the landscape. I need to train individuals. These individuals  
**0:21:51-0:21:57:**  need to spend time with the farmers. And because most farmers have not yet done any agroforestry  
**0:21:57-0:22:01:**  it's extremely intensive time. You need to sit down with them time and time again to  
**0:22:01-0:22:06:**  discuss it, to go through their fears, to go through their hopes, to begin to figure  
**0:22:06-0:22:11:**  out what the plant is going to look like, to design it, to help them plant. Who is going  
**0:22:11-0:22:14:**  to pay for that? They're not going to pay for that because they're not yet convinced  
**0:22:14-0:22:18:**  that this is going to make them money. The state is not paying for it because the state  
**0:22:18-0:22:24:**  has basically privatized extension services which are mostly about productivist issues.  
**0:22:24-0:22:27:**  Agricultural colleges are not going to pay for it or do it because agricultural colleges  
**0:22:27-0:22:34:**  are in partnership with big ag are focused mostly on better seeds and better management  
**0:22:34-0:22:38:**  and better pesticides and better chemicals and better machinery and more GPS and drones  
**0:22:38-0:22:44:**  and tractors and robots. So who's going to do it? Nobody is doing it. That's why agroforestry  
**0:22:44-0:22:49:**  doesn't spread. It's not because people hate it, it's because people ignore it.  
**0:22:49-0:22:52:**  But from what I understand from what you say is that today we have a European level which  
**0:22:52-0:22:59:**  is pretty proactive, has been convinced to a certain extent. To a certain extent. But  
**0:22:59-0:23:02:**  certain individuals in the policy circles at least have seen the value and have tried  
**0:23:02-0:23:08:**  to push that in European policy. Then we have the farm level where we have more and more  
**0:23:08-0:23:13:**  farmers that are interested to try it out, your example in the Czech Republic. And the  
**0:23:13-0:23:17:**  level that's kind of blocking at the moment is more the state level with agricultural  
**0:23:17-0:23:24:**  ministries that have privileged access for lobbies of the agro industry. And I'm wondering  
**0:23:24-0:23:29:**  if that level, the nation level, is the level that's blocking, what's missing there then?  
**0:23:29-0:23:33:**  Is it that they haven't been convinced by the story? Is it that they actually are trying  
**0:23:33-0:23:40:**  to block it to favour another type? Like how can you, where do you see the blockage?  
**0:23:40-0:23:48:**  Well, at several levels. First, they don't hear the story. You need strong, proactive,  
**0:23:48-0:23:53:**  vibrant activist agroforestry federations or agroecology federations or regenerative  
**0:23:53-0:23:59:**  agricultural federations inside these countries that are rich enough to pay for people to  
**0:23:59-0:24:04:**  go and sit in these ministries regularly to prepare the stories, to prepare the brochures,  
**0:24:04-0:24:10:**  to have the meetings, to organise the cocktails, to take people to dinner, to build the relationships.  
**0:24:10-0:24:16:**  That's missing. That's missing almost everywhere. The second thing that's necessary is the ability  
**0:24:16-0:24:23:**  to analyse and take apart the work that's being done by the agro industrial lobbying  
**0:24:23-0:24:30:**  that ignores agroecological things. It's never about demonising pesticides or demonising  
**0:24:30-0:24:35:**  fertilisers. These are, every farmer knows, these are tools that are extremely powerful  
**0:24:35-0:24:40:**  and I'm glad they're in the toolbox. It's about understanding that if the only thing  
**0:24:40-0:24:45:**  you do is focus on those tools, you end up with a land degradation, the land erosion,  
**0:24:45-0:24:50:**  the emissions and the high debts that are bedeviling today's European farming. You have  
**0:24:50-0:24:55:**  to add agroecology to that, not replace one with the other. Then it's up to every farmer  
**0:24:55-0:25:01:**  to decide how he or she wants to go down that journey. Some farmers will just be happy to  
**0:25:01-0:25:06:**  have monoclonal rows of poplars in their wheat fields. It's already much better than having  
**0:25:06-0:25:11:**  a simple wheat field, right? It's the simplest form of agroforestry. Others will go full  
**0:25:11-0:25:16:**  hog and do syntropic permaculture and that's great. It's much better. It's much more productive.  
**0:25:16-0:25:20:**  It's better for the soil, blah, blah, blah, but it requires a completely different way  
**0:25:20-0:25:24:**  of thinking. The first kind of farming, you do it much as you did before. You don't have  
**0:25:24-0:25:30:**  to increase your labour that much. The one with the poplars. The whole syntropic permaculture  
**0:25:30-0:25:34:**  thing. We can forget about using machinery and we need lots of people. It's a completely  
**0:25:34-0:25:39:**  different way of farming. And that too is what a good agroforestry advisor does. And  
**0:25:39-0:25:42:**  a good agroforestry advisor does not come into your farm and ask you what tree would  
**0:25:42-0:25:47:**  you like to plant? A good agroforestry advisor comes into a farm and asks you, what kind  
**0:25:47-0:25:54:**  of person are you? How do you like to work? Are you a loner? Poplars. Do you love having  
**0:25:54-0:25:57:**  people around and do you want to have many more young people on your farm? Permaculture.  
**0:25:57-0:26:01:**  Right. I'm caricaturing, but that's the kind of conversation that you need to have to help  
**0:26:01-0:26:09:**  farmers develop a farm holistically that meets their purpose, not just paying down debt,  
**0:26:09-0:26:13:**  because that's what most farmers are worried about now. They have bought the bullshit coming  
**0:26:13-0:26:18:**  from industry. They are in debt up to here. Bigger tractors, bigger this, bigger that,  
**0:26:18-0:26:22:**  more land, more, more, more, more. And at the same time, less and less and less and  
**0:26:22-0:26:27:**  less money coming in for the commodities that they produce. And yes, there will be a boost  
**0:26:27-0:26:31:**  because of the war this year. Commodity prices are going through the roof, but we can't expect  
**0:26:31-0:26:36:**  that to last. So on average, most farmers have been getting poorer and poorer and more  
**0:26:36-0:26:43:**  and more into debt. And so of course, that eats at you. The anxiety kills you. And it  
**0:26:43-0:26:49:**  really does. Farmers are in Europe, the job description at the highest risk of suicide.  
**0:26:49-0:26:55:**  And that is absolutely disgusting. It's us, it's society that's responsible for that,  
**0:26:55-0:26:59:**  because we don't respect our farmers, we don't pay enough for the food they produce, and  
**0:26:59-0:27:04:**  we squeeze the shit out of them just to get more and more cheap crap to fill our supermarkets.  
**0:27:04-0:27:09:**  So we need to change that too. That means we the consumers need to get better at recognizing  
**0:27:09-0:27:14:**  the difference between crap and good food. We need to work with a farmer so that the  
**0:27:14-0:27:18:**  good food becomes available to all social classes, not just to the highly educated rich  
**0:27:18-0:27:23:**  people. We need to work with a policymaker so that they encourage the good farmers to  
**0:27:23-0:27:30:**  work together with other farmers to help everybody move along in the right direction. That's  
**0:27:30-0:27:36:**  you, you know, if I'm being utopian, that's what we need. We need a holy trinity of farmers,  
**0:27:36-0:27:40:**  consumers and governments all pushing in the same direction.  
**0:27:40-0:27:45:**  We we've looked a lot at the European context. And this is our focus, rather than the African  
**0:27:45-0:27:51:**  continent. But to get an idea of what that looks like in Africa today, where are you  
**0:27:51-0:27:55:**  at then is the story through? What is the agroforestry landscape look like?  
**0:27:55-0:28:00:**  More and more what's happening in Africa, first of all, is that there is a lot more  
**0:28:00-0:28:07:**  agroforestry than there is in Europe, simply because African agriculture has been undercapitalized  
**0:28:07-0:28:10:**  in colonial times and ever since, which means that most farmers don't have access to the  
**0:28:10-0:28:15:**  kind of capital that would allow them to mechanize and use a lot of inputs, which means that  
**0:28:15-0:28:24:**  the farmers have to depend on other ways of farming. In since independence in many African  
**0:28:24-0:28:32:**  countries, the ideal has been the intensive agriculture ideal. So the agricultural advisors  
**0:28:32-0:28:36:**  that were taught in African universities were taught the same thing as they were taught  
**0:28:36-0:28:40:**  in European universities, we need a clean field, get rid of all these weeds, get rid  
**0:28:40-0:28:44:**  of all these shrubs and all these trees get a nice clean field use a tractor irrigates,  
**0:28:44-0:28:50:**  blah, blah, blah, blah. Thankfully, Africa is poor. So there are not many agricultural  
**0:28:50-0:28:56:**  advisors and there are even fewer farmers who can afford to follow that kind of advice.  
**0:28:56-0:28:59:**  So that never happens. But that means that most African farmers did not get the advice  
**0:28:59-0:29:03:**  they actually need, which is the advice on agroecology and how to manage their landscapes  
**0:29:03-0:29:10:**  in a more effective way. That has begun to change. I don't know the history well enough  
**0:29:10-0:29:14:**  to tell you where that started 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 30 years ago, but it has begun  
**0:29:14-0:29:22:**  to change. And it's beginning to change at the level of governments. One big push in  
**0:29:22-0:29:28:**  that direction has been the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Paris Agreement asks  
**0:29:28-0:29:34:**  every signatory country to declare what they call their nationally determined contribution,  
**0:29:34-0:29:40:**  what you're going to do at the level of your country to reduce emissions moving forward  
**0:29:40-0:29:45:**  or to absorb carbon moving forward. So the nationally determined contributions of a place  
**0:29:45-0:29:50:**  like Germany, we're going to build lots of windmills and solar panels. We're also shutting  
**0:29:50-0:29:54:**  down our nuclear power plants, but don't look at that, please. And the nationally determined  
**0:29:54-0:29:57:**  contribution for a place like Niger is going to be we're going to be restoring a lot of  
**0:29:57-0:30:01:**  landscapes. Niger does not have a lot of fossil fuel emissions, it does have a lot of degraded  
**0:30:01-0:30:06:**  land. So if it restores a lot of landscapes, a lot of that carbon that's in the atmosphere  
**0:30:06-0:30:12:**  is going to get back into Nigeria soils. And these nationally determined contributions,  
**0:30:12-0:30:20:**  some international commitments like the Africa 100 initiative 100 million restored hectares  
**0:30:20-0:30:26:**  of land, or the Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel, a band of trees going from  
**0:30:26-0:30:30:**  Senegal in the west to Djibouti in the east to separate the Sahel from the Sahara. All  
**0:30:30-0:30:37:**  of these initiatives are being subscribed to by local governments and are being used  
**0:30:37-0:30:43:**  to promote agroforestry. How does that promotion happen in practice? Well, there's not a lot  
**0:30:43-0:30:50:**  of money, it's development funding. And development funding is fickle. A project typically three  
**0:30:50-0:30:55:**  to five years, never more. And trees take a long time to grow even in the tropics. So  
**0:30:55-0:31:01:**  it's hard to institutionalize what is required for agroforestry in the tropics. You do have  
**0:31:01-0:31:06:**  a lot of projects that are encouraging farmers to plant trees, and most of those trees die.  
**0:31:06-0:31:10:**  Most of those trees die because having planting a tree is like having a baby. It's not when  
**0:31:10-0:31:15:**  the job stops. It's when the job starts, especially that young sapling is going to be fragile,  
**0:31:15-0:31:20:**  you're going to need to protect it, you're going to be from animals from drought. And  
**0:31:20-0:31:26:**  that demands labor, which Africans, farmers often don't expand. So what you typically  
**0:31:26-0:31:30:**  find is that there's a lot of trees around the villages, those are fruit trees, but in  
**0:31:30-0:31:34:**  the fields, there are very, very few trees because the animals are eating the saplings.  
**0:31:34-0:31:38:**  So what we need to do instead is to encourage people to work with things that demand less  
**0:31:38-0:31:42:**  capital and less labor, forms of agroforestry that demand less capital and less labor, and  
**0:31:42-0:31:48:**  that's regenerate regeneration, farmer managed natural regeneration. In across the landscapes  
**0:31:48-0:31:53:**  of Africa, you will have stumps of trees that were cut down and you have seeds in the ground,  
**0:31:53-0:31:58:**  encourage these trees to regenerate by pruning away the weak shoots and keeping the stronger  
**0:31:58-0:32:03:**  shoots, you can rapidly get forests back, because a regenerated tree grows much more  
**0:32:03-0:32:09:**  quickly than a freshly planted sapling because there's a big root mass that's feeding just  
**0:32:09-0:32:16:**  one little, one little shoot, as opposed to one little root feeding one little shoot.  
**0:32:16-0:32:21:**  So you have faster growth. By definition, you have trees that are adapted to that landscape  
**0:32:21-0:32:26:**  that are coming back, rather than trees that may come from a long way away selected by  
**0:32:26-0:32:31:**  somebody who doesn't understand the local climate and that will struggle. So these techniques  
**0:32:31-0:32:36:**  work. And in places where these techniques have been applied at scale, like Niger, they  
**0:32:36-0:32:41:**  have been transformative. In Niger, we estimate that there's now about 15 million hectares  
**0:32:41-0:32:46:**  of restored land with these regenerated trees, mostly a form of acacia called phytherbia  
**0:32:46-0:32:50:**  albeda, which is useful, because it's got a reverse phenology, it goes into dormancy  
**0:32:50-0:32:56:**  in the rainy season, so it doesn't compete with the crops. And these 15 million hectares  
**0:32:56-0:33:01:**  are generating millions of tons of more cereals per year than before, literally, because in  
**0:33:01-0:33:05:**  that landscape, it's difficult to farm without the protection of trees, the rainy season  
**0:33:05-0:33:09:**  is there. And you can get enough rain, you can get 600 or 800 millimeters, but you only  
**0:33:09-0:33:14:**  get it for two months. And after that for 10 months, it's dry. And if you don't have  
**0:33:14-0:33:21:**  the trees to buffer that and to keep the water on the ground, rather than having it run off,  
**0:33:21-0:33:24:**  and to provide a little microclimate through shade, your crops are going to struggle to  
**0:33:24-0:33:29:**  come to maturity. So in those environments, agroforestry is beginning to work better and  
**0:33:29-0:33:36:**  better. Another place where agroforestry is spreading with slowly is in the humid tropics,  
**0:33:36-0:33:42:**  coffee, cocoa, rubber, that sort of thing, where consumers in the rich world are willing  
**0:33:42-0:33:47:**  to pay a premium for agroforestry versions of those commodities, it's still very small  
**0:33:47-0:33:50:**  but it's growing.  
**0:33:50-0:33:56:**  Would the biggest tool then be access to funding then in this African context? Because is the  
**0:33:56-0:34:00:**  knowledge out there or what what tools do we have to try and make this work?  
**0:34:00-0:34:05:**  The knowledge is by and large out there with a proviso that you don't have enough advisors,  
**0:34:05-0:34:10:**  you need to train them. Funding Yes, absolutely. But not funding for yet another agroforestry  
**0:34:10-0:34:19:**  project, funding to institutionalize it, funding so that Mali or Senegal or Ethiopia or Zambia  
**0:34:19-0:34:26:**  can train and support and give careers to agroforestry and agroecology advisors for  
**0:34:26-0:34:33:**  the duration. That means funding that comes year after year after year for 102030 years,  
**0:34:33-0:34:38:**  funding that is insulated from the vagaries of politics, funding that is insulated from  
**0:34:38-0:34:42:**  the vagaries of the market, funding that is there to ensure that farmers have access to  
**0:34:42-0:34:49:**  the management advice that they need. And that funding needs to be institutionalized.  
**0:34:49-0:34:58:**  This has been done before. And the success can be seen across East Asia. You can compare  
**0:34:58-0:35:05:**  eight countries in East Asia. In the first group, you have Taiwan, South Korea, Japan,  
**0:35:05-0:35:17:**  and China. In the second group, you have the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia.  
**0:35:17-0:35:25:**  Let me focus on Taiwan and on the Philippines. In 1960, Taiwan was poorer than Ghana, its  
**0:35:25-0:35:32:**  income per head was lower than that of Ghana. What did the Taiwanese government do? It provided  
**0:35:32-0:35:39:**  free education only to one category of university students, agronomists, and only on condition  
**0:35:39-0:35:44:**  that these agronomists would then agree to go and live for a minimum of four years in  
**0:35:44-0:35:49:**  a village and become the agricultural advisor of those villages. What kind of education  
**0:35:49-0:35:53:**  did these agronomists get? Taiwan was poor, couldn't afford tractors and fertilizers and  
**0:35:53-0:36:01:**  pesticides. They got advice in traditional agroecological agricultural production methods.  
**0:36:01-0:36:06:**  That's what they learned. And that's what they told the farmers. At the same time, Taiwan  
**0:36:06-0:36:14:**  had a land reform. It redistributed land belonging to big landowners and big families to small  
**0:36:14-0:36:21:**  holders. Suddenly you had a country of smallholders, three, four, five hectares each being advised  
**0:36:21-0:36:28:**  by highly trained agroecological advisors. Extremely rapidly, the agricultural productivity  
**0:36:28-0:36:35:**  of the island exploded, went through the roof. And it focused on two commodity crops, asparagus  
**0:36:35-0:36:41:**  and mushrooms, which were exported to the United States. And that was the first export  
**0:36:41-0:36:46:**  success of Taiwan. And what happened to the money that came back? The money that was in  
**0:36:46-0:36:54:**  the farmers pockets. It was placed in rural credit institutions, banks. The interest paid  
**0:36:54-0:36:59:**  on that were low. So the amount of capital that was accumulating in these banks was high.  
**0:36:59-0:37:04:**  Who could get access to that capital? Companies that exported. How could you prove that you  
**0:37:04-0:37:11:**  export? Not with the tax, not with a form from your own country's tax office from the  
**0:37:11-0:37:16:**  Taiwanese tax office, because you can corrupt some guy to sign that. But with a form coming  
**0:37:16-0:37:21:**  from the government of the country to which you're exporting. If you have that, and you  
**0:37:21-0:37:25:**  can prove that you're exporting, you have access to low credit. Why did they do that?  
**0:37:25-0:37:28:**  Because that means that companies were encouraged to export, and they were encouraged to try  
**0:37:28-0:37:33:**  their hand against other products everywhere else. You also have protectionism. Other companies  
**0:37:33-0:37:38:**  could not come into Taiwan at the time. The result of that was an extraordinarily rapid  
**0:37:38-0:37:43:**  development. Today, when you look out your window, you see Taiwanese-made cars everywhere.  
**0:37:43-0:37:47:**  They are amongst the world's highest quality cars. The very first cars that were exported  
**0:37:47-0:37:53:**  from Taiwan using this model was to Saudi Arabia in 1970 or 1971. There were 1000 of  
**0:37:53-0:37:59:**  them. Two years later, less than 200 were still on the road. The quality was so shit.  
**0:37:59-0:38:04:**  But that's how you learn. That's how you learn. That's how they got credits. That's how Hyundai,  
**0:38:04-0:38:08:**  that company, learned how to make better and better and better cars. And it's now a world  
**0:38:08-0:38:15:**  beater. And that's why today Taiwan is now a country that produces 80% of the world's  
**0:38:15-0:38:23:**  microchips. That's computer, that phone, your car, your washing machine, whatever you have  
**0:38:23-0:38:28:**  that has a microchip in it. It's got an 80% chance of having come out of Taiwan. Now look  
**0:38:28-0:38:34:**  at the Philippines. The Philippines in 1960 was richer than Taiwan. The Philippines today  
**0:38:34-0:38:41:**  is the poorest of the lot. What did the Philippines do? It had very large land holding, very large  
**0:38:41-0:38:49:**  land holdings belonging to a few rich families. The productivity is abysmal. Big landowners  
**0:38:49-0:38:55:**  doing sugar cane or what have you. Lots of inputs, lots of machinery, very low productivity.  
**0:38:55-0:39:01:**  And a lot of landless peasants. These landless peasants, if they're lucky, get a job spraying  
**0:39:01-0:39:05:**  toxic chemicals and get sick in the process. If they're unlucky, they sit by the side of  
**0:39:05-0:39:10:**  the road, hocking some goods, hoping not to start. Not surprisingly, they're not happy.  
**0:39:10-0:39:16:**  Not surprising that he's doing stability and security. And in the 1970s, the farmers revolted  
**0:39:16-0:39:21:**  with Mao's little red book in their hand. Today they're revolting with the Prophet Muhammad's  
**0:39:21-0:39:26:**  little green book in their hand. It's the same thing. Landless peasants lead to instability.  
**0:39:26-0:39:32:**  And the Philippines is still now the poorest of the eight countries in that region.  
**0:39:32-0:39:36:**  Agroecology has been shown to work. After the example of Taiwan, South Korea, Japan  
**0:39:36-0:39:41:**  and China did all the same thing. When China started reforming in the late 70s, the first  
**0:39:41-0:39:45:**  thing that they did was to give farmers the right to own the produce of their land and  
**0:39:45-0:39:51:**  to manage their own land. And every farmer only had a few hectares. Boom! Agricultural  
**0:39:51-0:39:56:**  productivity exploded. So this can work. This has worked before. And what I very much hope  
**0:39:56-0:40:01:**  is that African governments recognize what worked in East Asia and why it worked and  
**0:40:01-0:40:10:**  try to do the same thing back home. So far, we are not yet getting there. That story is  
**0:40:10-0:40:19:**  not well known enough. And people are not yet understanding the crucial role that land  
**0:40:19-0:40:25:**  reform and agroecology played in getting these four successful countries to go from the state  
**0:40:25-0:40:29:**  of rural poverty to the state of advanced industrial wealth.  
**0:40:29-0:40:33:**  But now that these countries like Taiwan, if you looked at its agriculture today, has  
**0:40:33-0:40:40:**  it been industrialized, its agriculture, as it grew more wealthy and moved away from agroecology?  
**0:40:40-0:40:45:**  This followed the model, the European model, in the sense that you have more and more subsidies  
**0:40:45-0:40:55:**  for people to produce rice, basically. But it doesn't matter anymore. I mean, Taiwan  
**0:40:55-0:41:00:**  is a rich industrial country. It imports most of its food. The farming is basically people  
**0:41:00-0:41:04:**  are being paid to maintain the landscape and to produce a bit of rice. The farming is not  
**0:41:04-0:41:11:**  relevant anymore. So it's in that sense, it's a bit like Europe. You have a farming community  
**0:41:11-0:41:16:**  comprised mostly of old people, because the young have gone to the cities to work in the  
**0:41:16-0:41:20:**  factories. And these old people are getting subsidized to stay on the land.  
**0:41:20-0:41:26:**  But OK, so then if we take back the conversations, these industrialized countries and we assume  
**0:41:26-0:41:30:**  that it's not good enough, you know, to just produce rice or just produce wheat or whatever,  
**0:41:30-0:41:35:**  and we go back to the idea that we need agroforestry, we need to change management even in these  
**0:41:35-0:41:39:**  industrialized countries. How do you see the funding going forward then? Because you mentioned  
**0:41:39-0:41:45:**  that in Africa, rather than funding individual projects, we should be funding institutionalized  
**0:41:45-0:41:50:**  bodies. Of course, the context is vastly different in Europe. But my question is, you know, where  
**0:41:50-0:41:54:**  do you see where should the funding go? Is it only farmers?  
**0:41:54-0:41:59:**  The context is not that different. Farmers in Africa and in Europe want the same thing.  
**0:41:59-0:42:03:**  They want some resilience, they want some stability and they want a higher income. Farmers  
**0:42:03-0:42:10:**  in Africa and in Europe are being overwhelmed with the same pro-intensive agricultural messages.  
**0:42:10-0:42:16:**  By this, by that, you'll become a better farmer. Farmers in Africa and in Europe both lack  
**0:42:16-0:42:22:**  quality advice. Farmers in Africa and Europe, neither farmers in Africa nor farmers in Europe  
**0:42:22-0:42:28:**  have access to good pro agroforestry, pro agroecology, pro regenerative agriculture  
**0:42:28-0:42:31:**  institutions. So the context is very similar. The amount of wealth we have in Europe is  
**0:42:31-0:42:37:**  of course much, much higher. And what I would do with that wealth is again institutionalize  
**0:42:37-0:42:42:**  it. If we cannot convince member states to do so, and to my knowledge, France is the  
**0:42:42-0:42:47:**  only country in Europe that actually did try to do that under a former agricultural ministry  
**0:42:47-0:42:54:**  named Stéphane Lefort. It launched a 4 per 1000 initiative to put carbon in the soil.  
**0:42:54-0:42:58:**  It put money on the table to train agroecology and agroforestry advisors to ensure that agroforestry  
**0:42:58-0:43:03:**  was part of the curriculum in agricultural colleges. I don't know how far that has gone  
**0:43:03-0:43:06:**  and if that is continuing, but at least it moved in the right direction. But it's the  
**0:43:06-0:43:10:**  only state in the earth to have done that. And that's what's needed everywhere. So we  
**0:43:10-0:43:15:**  can only do, we need to do two things at the same time. First, we need to become much,  
**0:43:15-0:43:22:**  much better at telling this story to our national governments that this is an essential tool  
**0:43:22-0:43:26:**  in the agricultural toolbox. And the second thing that we need to do is to get much, much  
**0:43:26-0:43:33:**  better at explaining to foundations or funding bodies or rich individuals that they need  
**0:43:33-0:43:40:**  to fund the institutionalization of agroforestry and agroecology advice. Another thing that  
**0:43:40-0:43:50:**  we need to do is to stop dividing ourselves into lots of little boxes. Agroecology, agroforestry,  
**0:43:50-0:43:57:**  philanthropic agriculture, silver arable, silver plastral, holistic raising, farming God's  
**0:43:57-0:44:04:**  way, organic, there's dozens upon dozens upon dozens of labels that all mean the same thing.  
**0:44:04-0:44:10:**  Mix things up, include trees and think before you spray. That's what they all mean, right?  
**0:44:10-0:44:13:**  But they are all these different words because this one is a little bit different from that  
**0:44:13-0:44:18:**  one. And this one, we use the trees in this way and this one, fuck it. Why the hell do  
**0:44:18-0:44:23:**  we need to have that complexity? Industrial agriculture, petrochemical agriculture has  
**0:44:23-0:44:29:**  understood that. That's why they talk about conventional agriculture. And it doesn't matter  
**0:44:29-0:44:36:**  whether you're growing wheat or oil palm or chickens or beef. It's conventional agriculture,  
**0:44:36-0:44:42:**  which means lots of machinery, lots of capital, lots of expensive inputs. They always call  
**0:44:42-0:44:48:**  it conventional no matter what it is. They even call it traditional. And that shocks  
**0:44:48-0:44:53:**  me. There is nothing traditional about petrochemical agriculture. It didn't exist 70 years ago.  
**0:44:53-0:44:58:**  It's a product of modernity. Traditional agriculture is what we do. It's what the regenerators  
**0:44:58-0:45:03:**  do. It's what the agroecologists do. It's what the agroforestries do. So what we need  
**0:45:03-0:45:09:**  to do is to get much better at the vocabulary as well. We are traditional agriculture. They  
**0:45:09-0:45:15:**  are petrochemical agriculture.  
**0:45:15-0:45:20:**  And in terms of this funding, do you see then, you mentioned foundations, you mentioned other  
**0:45:20-0:45:26:**  bodies than public bodies. And that was one of my questions. Which role do you see for  
**0:45:26-0:45:31:**  private companies, for other sources of funding? And I'm thinking at the moment, we're talking  
**0:45:31-0:45:36:**  a lot about carbon credits, for example, or payment for ecosystem services that also sometimes  
**0:45:36-0:45:41:**  can be controversial on some levels. And where do you see the future of this? Because we've  
**0:45:41-0:45:47:**  obviously seen how difficult it is to change this massive mammoth that the CAP is and European  
**0:45:47-0:45:53:**  policy is in general. So do you see it more promising to try and, I mean, bypass it, you  
**0:45:53-0:45:57:**  can't bypass it because it's the reality of farmers, but I mean, to kind of sidestep it  
**0:45:57-0:46:03:**  and try and take things forward with companies or other types of actors? Or how do you see  
**0:46:03-0:46:04:**  this strategy?  
**0:46:04-0:46:11:**  The interest in carbon is immense. There's a wall of money flooding across the landscape,  
**0:46:11-0:46:16:**  everybody's looking for high quality carbon. And people are recognising that there's only  
**0:46:16-0:46:20:**  so many pristine rainforests you can save by pumping money into them. So you need to  
**0:46:20-0:46:25:**  plant trees in other environments. So a lot of that money is going to tree plantations,  
**0:46:25-0:46:31:**  not a great idea. But a lot of it is trying to go into agroforestry, much better idea.  
**0:46:31-0:46:35:**  But that money is facing the same kind of problem that we've just described. It's happy  
**0:46:35-0:46:40:**  to reward farmers who do agroforestry, but it doesn't understand that it first has to  
**0:46:40-0:46:48:**  pay for the technical assistance to convince those farmers to try agroforestry. So these  
**0:46:48-0:46:54:**  funds very often are just looking for existing projects that they can top up. In effect,  
**0:46:54-0:46:59:**  they're parasites. They want somebody else to pay for the technical advice, somebody  
**0:46:59-0:47:05:**  else to help the farmers do the difficult job of deciding to do agroforestry. And then  
**0:47:05-0:47:10:**  they will reward the farmers. Sorry, that's not business. That's just parasitism. People  
**0:47:10-0:47:17:**  who want to do it right, carbon funders want to do it right, and they exist know that they  
**0:47:17-0:47:21:**  have to roll up their shirtsleeves, they have to go into the landscape, they have to help  
**0:47:21-0:47:25:**  the farmers adapt. And that is not going to be cheap, and it's not going to be fast, but  
**0:47:25-0:47:28:**  it is going to be very high quality carbon.  
**0:47:28-0:47:34:**  And so again, it goes back to this idea of like, going to find partners on a national  
**0:47:34-0:47:39:**  level and funding them, funding networks, funding technicians, funding the professionals  
**0:47:39-0:47:45:**  that can then bring this transition forward, rather than looking for lonely pioneers and  
**0:47:45-0:47:49:**  saying we helped plant X amount of trees. Is that what you're saying?  
**0:47:49-0:47:53:**  Absolutely. If you want to change the world, you need people to change it. It's as simple  
**0:47:53-0:47:58:**  as that. Especially when the solution is not an app or something you buy in a bag, but  
**0:47:58-0:47:59:**  something that consists of advice.  
**0:47:59-0:48:03:**  One of my questions, but I think we've answered it a bit is, you know, what's the next step  
**0:48:03-0:48:07:**  for the European agroforestry movements? You've talked about telling a story. I don't know  
**0:48:07-0:48:15:**  if there's something more to add, or on the funding aspect, if anything comes to mind.  
**0:48:15-0:48:23:**  Yeah. The story is like a key that opens the lock to a door, right? And once the door is  
**0:48:23-0:48:28:**  open, you have the room behind it. And the room behind it is the empty brain box of the  
**0:48:28-0:48:33:**  person who tried to convince them, you need to, you need to furnish that room. And you  
**0:48:33-0:48:39:**  need to add reasons to believe. And that's when the data comes in. That's where the experiments  
**0:48:39-0:48:46:**  comes in. That's where the testimonials from successful farmers comes in, right? Once you  
**0:48:46-0:48:50:**  do that, once you have that, then you have an ally. And then you have to understand how  
**0:48:50-0:48:56:**  to use that ally. Can an ally help you change policy? Or can an ally help you get the right  
**0:48:56-0:49:01:**  funding stream in place? Or if you're lucky, as in France with Stéphane Lefort, can an  
**0:49:01-0:49:07:**  ally actually begin to change the way the whole agricultural education and advice machinery  
**0:49:07-0:49:12:**  of a major member state operates, right? But Stéphane Lefort was also convinced by a story  
**0:49:12-0:49:16:**  originally, and then he educated himself. He's a clever man. And he found that this  
**0:49:16-0:49:20:**  was more than just a story. And that's how you have to work. So what is the future for  
**0:49:20-0:49:25:**  European Agroforestry? First European Agroforestry is becoming professionalized. We were founded  
**0:49:25-0:49:30:**  over 10 years ago, the ERF. And so far, it's been exclusively run by volunteers. There's  
**0:49:30-0:49:34:**  a board, there's an executive committee, each and every one of us is doing it on top of  
**0:49:34-0:49:39:**  our day job. We are hiring a Secretary General with a bit of luck that Secretary General  
**0:49:39-0:49:45:**  will be in place from August or September onwards with an office in Brussels. We'll  
**0:49:45-0:49:50:**  be hiring, hopefully a full time lobbyist to support the Secretary General. And so we  
**0:49:50-0:49:54:**  will have a voice that's going to be stronger simply because it is going to be a little  
**0:49:54-0:50:01:**  bit institutionalized and professionalized. The more difficult thing, but the more important  
**0:50:01-0:50:06:**  thing in my view will be for the next board of the European Agroforestry Federation to  
**0:50:06-0:50:14:**  focus on how we can help individual national federations become better national lobbyists.  
**0:50:14-0:50:19:**  We need the Hungarians and the Romanians and the Swedes and the Irish and the Spanish and  
**0:50:19-0:50:23:**  what have you to become better at lobbying their own ministries of agriculture and their  
**0:50:23-0:50:30:**  own national governments to ensure that agroecological options like agroforestry are integrated into  
**0:50:30-0:50:38:**  the agricultural development plans. And we need to do it now. We have a tendency of putting  
**0:50:38-0:50:43:**  enormous hopes and new Common Agricultural Policy proposals and then when they come out  
**0:50:43-0:50:50:**  and the inevitable disappointment comes in, we have a tendency of laying down our weapons  
**0:50:50-0:50:53:**  and saying, oh, well, at least we tried. Let's wait for the next one in five years time and  
**0:50:53-0:50:57:**  let's do it again. Well, we've been doing that for 15 years. It's not done a lot of  
**0:50:57-0:51:02:**  change. We need to get better at lobbying on an ongoing basis. And with the strategic  
**0:51:02-0:51:07:**  plans, we actually have that possibility, right? Yes, the strategic plans are bloody  
**0:51:07-0:51:12:**  awful, but they can be adapted year after year after year. And if we create a coalition  
**0:51:12-0:51:18:**  of farmers that want it, of academics and activists that say, guys, this is a no brainer,  
**0:51:18-0:51:21:**  you've got to do agroforestry, it's got to be part of the toolkit, then maybe we can  
**0:51:21-0:51:26:**  shift the needle a little bit in the member states. And that's going to become, but that's  
**0:51:26-0:51:30:**  more complicated. It doesn't happen in English, or even in French, it happens in Slovene or  
**0:51:30-0:51:40:**  Croat or Romansh or Finnish. It happens in cultures that we don't necessarily know, it  
**0:51:40-0:51:44:**  happens in languages that we don't know. And it has to be done 27 different times, not  
**0:51:44-0:51:48:**  just once. So it's a lot more expensive and a lot more complicated. And figuring out how  
**0:51:48-0:51:53:**  to make that happen, figuring out how to get that funded is going to be crucial in the  
**0:51:53-0:51:58:**  future of European agroforestry.  
**0:51:58-0:52:03:**  And today you have because what's what I find interesting is that Dimitri and I started  
**0:52:03-0:52:08:**  the podcast from the totally different perspective, what you're saying is that we heard the story,  
**0:52:08-0:52:11:**  and then faced with the difficulties, we're like, okay, well, let's try and actually figure  
**0:52:11-0:52:16:**  this out on the ground. And we often talk about, you know, we often start from the assumption,  
**0:52:16-0:52:21:**  okay, we know the big picture, we know how amazing it is. But we are always faced with  
**0:52:21-0:52:27:**  those technical difficulties. But today, when you when you talk about agroforestry, you  
**0:52:27-0:52:32:**  have all the successful examples, you need them to, to illustrate that today, the limiting  
**0:52:32-0:52:37:**  factor is getting that story outside. It's not the technical kind of level.  
**0:52:37-0:52:42:**  That's true to a large extent with one proviso, it's remarkably difficult to get good data  
**0:52:42-0:52:48:**  on the economic benefits of agroforestry. And the reason for that is that so much of  
**0:52:48-0:52:52:**  the economic benefits depend on the total income, including the timber of the trees  
**0:52:52-0:52:58:**  at the end of their rotation. And even short rotation to trees like poplars, it's 15-18  
**0:52:58-0:53:02:**  years before you start seeing any income. So and no research project lasts as long.  
**0:53:02-0:53:06:**  So there's remarkably little research that is simply toted up the expenses and the outgoings  
**0:53:06-0:53:14:**  for an agroforestry system from beginning to end. And that's difficult because farmers  
**0:53:14-0:53:19:**  are interested in income. And we cannot give them here, here's a farm that's been doing  
**0:53:19-0:53:24:**  it for 50 years, here's an incoming outgoings, here's how the debt has gone down. And here's  
**0:53:24-0:53:29:**  how the profits have gone up. We have remarkable difficulty doing that. The only place where  
**0:53:29-0:53:34:**  we can do that is in places that have traditional agroforestry systems, like the Dehezas or  
**0:53:34-0:53:39:**  the Montados in Iberia, which are silver pastoral systems with a variety of livestock grazing  
**0:53:39-0:53:45:**  on the oaks, including the iconic cork oak. Those systems have been in operation for a  
**0:53:45-0:53:53:**  very long time. The farmers who are using those systems have climbed up the food chain  
**0:53:53-0:54:01:**  to provide extremely valuable, extremely highly rewarded meats to the top end, the luxury  
**0:54:01-0:54:08:**  market. Think of Pata Negra Am, for example, or in Hungary, Mangalitsa pork. And in these  
**0:54:08-0:54:15:**  environments you can study the incomes and the outgoings and it works. And sometimes  
**0:54:15-0:54:20:**  you have, it's anecdotal, but sometimes you have examples like this place I know of in  
**0:54:20-0:54:27:**  Portugal, an aristocratic family that got its land back after the socialists lost power.  
**0:54:27-0:54:33:**  Two brothers, 450 hectares each. One followed the advice of the agronomists, got rid of  
**0:54:33-0:54:38:**  all these trees, put a wheat plantation in place, worked well for a couple of decades.  
**0:54:38-0:54:46:**  Now not so much. The other one, gregarious, liked people, kept his Montado system and  
**0:54:46-0:54:49:**  invited young people to come and try different kinds of farming, horticulture and olives  
**0:54:49-0:54:54:**  and chickens and what have you on there, saying that they didn't have to pay any rent for  
**0:54:54-0:54:58:**  the first five years and after that they would split the profits. The first brother is now  
**0:54:58-0:55:03:**  living alone on his farm. You don't need many people to manage 450 hectares of wheat. You  
**0:55:03-0:55:09:**  can do it with machinery. He's depressed. His wife has left him. The other farmer, he's  
**0:55:09-0:55:16:**  got 20, 25 families living on his land. It's surrounded by children and kids and families.  
**0:55:16-0:55:19:**  The landscape is thriving. There's water, there's animals, there's wildlife. There's  
**0:55:19-0:55:25:**  a lot of pigs, a lot of cattle and a lot of sheep and a lot of happy people. I mean it's  
**0:55:25-0:55:30:**  obvious which system is better, right? It's just obvious but it's rare that you see this  
**0:55:30-0:55:33:**  side by side comparison like that.  
**0:55:33-0:55:38:**  And especially what we found difficult is, you know, when you talk to scientists often  
**0:55:38-0:55:45:**  their science, scientific studies are on a very specific topic at a very specific time  
**0:55:45-0:55:51:**  frame. So it's very hard to get them to extrapolate or make bigger statements or tendencies because  
**0:55:51-0:55:55:**  that's a bit against their scientific minds, you know. So we've been trying to get those  
**0:55:55-0:56:01:**  scientists on the show and also trying to talk to farmers. And it is interesting because  
**0:56:01-0:56:06:**  we've talked to dozens of people and we have had very interesting conversations but it  
**0:56:06-0:56:13:**  is difficult to sit a farmer down and tell him like what exactly have you observed or  
**0:56:13-0:56:19:**  can you really put a number on it, can you really quantify it. That's very difficult.  
**0:56:19-0:56:23:**  And I was just wondering if that was a challenge in terms of actually then pushing that story  
**0:56:23-0:56:28:**  forward on the policy level or if at the end of the day you already have all the data you  
**0:56:28-0:56:35:**  need because you have a bigger maybe sample of studies you can rest yourself upon.  
**0:56:35-0:56:40:**  As I said on the financial side we simply don't have enough data, right? We need more  
**0:56:40-0:56:45:**  data. On the biophysics, the social side we do have enough data but on the finance side  
**0:56:45-0:56:50:**  we don't have enough data. We have good anecdotes but the plural of anecdote is not data. To  
**0:56:50-0:56:54:**  get back to this idea that scientists don't want to be drawn, they are scientists. Their  
**0:56:54-0:57:01:**  job is not to lobby for A or B. Their job is to find out how A or B works and at most  
**0:57:01-0:57:07:**  to compare them and to do the papers. They are the wrong person to ask for these big  
**0:57:07-0:57:13:**  sweeping statements. That's why World Agroforestry, a scientific research organization hired somebody  
**0:57:13-0:57:18:**  like me. I am not a practicing scientist. I am a storyteller. That's what I do. And  
**0:57:18-0:57:23:**  they figured they needed somebody like me on top of all of the science to explain the  
**0:57:23-0:57:27:**  science better, to help the science get into the right policy circles, to help the science  
**0:57:27-0:57:32:**  get into the right donor circles. So we need both. We need both. We need an alliance of  
**0:57:32-0:57:37:**  these different skill sets. We need clever farmers who are doing it well and who can  
**0:57:37-0:57:42:**  show their farms to others. We need the scientists who can measure how well these systems work  
**0:57:42-0:57:46:**  and how badly the other systems work. We need the storytellers who can package all that  
**0:57:46-0:57:50:**  and put it out there and help people understand how important it is. And you Etienne with  
**0:57:50-0:57:55:**  your podcast, you are a classical storyteller. I mean you are actually getting lots of people  
**0:57:55-0:57:58:**  to tell those stories and as I understand it you have more and more listeners on your  
**0:57:58-0:58:05:**  podcast. So it's great. We need more like you. We need more people to tell the story  
**0:58:05-0:58:12:**  of regeneration. Finally, and that's utopian again, we need a little bit of education at  
**0:58:12-0:58:19:**  the level of the schools. Kids have no idea where their food comes from. They don't know  
**0:58:19-0:58:24:**  what nature is. I'm sure we've all had that experience. Our city-based friends say, oh,  
**0:58:24-0:58:28:**  I had a great weekend. I went walking in the countryside. It was wonderful to be in pure  
**0:58:28-0:58:33:**  nature and you ask them where they went and when you then look at them at they were in  
**0:58:33-0:58:38:**  an intensively farmed agricultural areas just after this break loads of pesticides. Not  
**0:58:38-0:58:44:**  so natural. So people don't understand the difference between a high functioning ecosystem  
**0:58:44-0:58:50:**  and a non-functioning ecosystem. And I think that this love of complexity, this biofilia,  
**0:58:50-0:58:59:**  this love of farming systems that combine things is something that kids have from very  
**0:58:59-0:59:04:**  small onwards. Three, four, five year olds when they picture a farm, they picture an  
**0:59:04-0:59:10:**  apple tree and a cow and a goat and a pig and a happy farm. They picture what is in  
**0:59:10-0:59:16:**  effect a smallholder farm. And when they grow up they forget that because nobody has encouraged  
**0:59:16-0:59:21:**  them to think that this is important and they think it's perfectly normal to have these  
**0:59:21-0:59:27:**  giant farms of 5,000 hectares that are producing one commodity only while destroying the land.  
**0:59:27-0:59:32:**  So we need to encourage that love of complexity as kids grow up. We need to encourage them  
**0:59:32-0:59:36:**  to be able to recognize when they walk in the countryside, this is a well-managed farm.  
**0:59:36-0:59:42:**  This is a badly managed farm. This is good land. This is bad land. And that's something  
**0:59:42-0:59:47:**  that disappears as people move to cities. But it's utopian to expect the educational  
**0:59:47-0:59:53:**  systems of all of Europe to start taking these issues on board sensibly and consequently.  
**0:59:53-0:59:58:**  So Patrick, thank you so much for taking the time to answer these questions today and giving

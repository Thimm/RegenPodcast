### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Thu, 31 Mar 2022 06:02:47)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:30:**  a promising technique called agroforestry.  
**0:00:30-0:00:35:**  In order to find out how it can help us with these challenges, we'll be interviewing farmers,  
**0:00:35-0:00:40:**  scientists, and other experts to share with you their experiences, practical advice, and  
**0:00:40-0:00:43:**  scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:47:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:51:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we just had a fantastic interview with Andrew and Jill  
**0:00:51-0:00:56:**  Stewart from Yan Yan Gert West Farm.  
**0:00:56-0:01:00:**  This farm is a leader in regenerative and holistic farming based in the Otway Ranges  
**0:01:00-0:01:03:**  of southern Victoria in Australia.  
**0:01:03-0:01:07:**  In the past 30 years, they've been planting agroforestry systems such as shelterbelts,  
**0:01:07-0:01:14:**  riparian buffers, farm forestry, and silvopasture on about 230 hectares, complementing their  
**0:01:14-0:01:16:**  lamb business.  
**0:01:16-0:01:22:**  They went from 3 to 20% tree cover without reducing their traditional crop productivity  
**0:01:22-0:01:26:**  since they started, which is an incredible achievement.  
**0:01:26-0:01:32:**  This episode is about an incredible farm that takes regenerative agriculture extremely seriously  
**0:01:32-0:01:36:**  and where tree crops and trees have played a fundamental role.  
**0:01:36-0:01:39:**  So tune in to find out more and I really hope you enjoy.  
**0:01:39-0:01:42:**  Andrew, Jill, welcome on the podcast.  
**0:01:42-0:01:44:**  Thanks for inviting us.  
**0:01:44-0:01:45:**  It's a pleasure.  
**0:01:45-0:01:46:**  Thanks Dimitri.  
**0:01:46-0:01:49:**  We're really happy to be here and speak with you.  
**0:01:49-0:01:50:**  Yeah, me too.  
**0:01:50-0:01:55:**  I'm very excited to delve into your amazing farm.  
**0:01:55-0:01:57:**  And if I'm not mistaken, you recently won an award, right?  
**0:01:57-0:02:00:**  Quite an important award for Australian one.  
**0:02:00-0:02:01:**  Is that correct?  
**0:02:01-0:02:08:**  We won the Bob Hawke Landcare Farming Award and Bob Hawke was a former Prime Minister  
**0:02:08-0:02:18:**  of Australia and in 1989, he elevated landcare from a small estate organization which emanated  
**0:02:18-0:02:23:**  in Victoria in southern Australia and he took it to the national stage.  
**0:02:23-0:02:32:**  And 1989, so that gave it a bit of leverage and some great national support to really  
**0:02:32-0:02:38:**  kick landcare off in Australia as a national organization.  
**0:02:38-0:02:44:**  And we were fortunate enough to win that award last year.  
**0:02:44-0:02:47:**  Wow, that's incredible.  
**0:02:47-0:02:50:**  Is there only one farm per year that wins the award?  
**0:02:50-0:02:52:**  Yes, one farm.  
**0:02:52-0:03:01:**  It's to recognize leadership in landcare and sustainable agriculture and that's what it  
**0:03:01-0:03:02:**  was.  
**0:03:02-0:03:08:**  It is actually a single person award, Dimitri, so Andrew actually won the award.  
**0:03:08-0:03:16:**  Of course, we all helped him.  
**0:03:16-0:03:19:**  The award couldn't be given to multiple people or a family.  
**0:03:19-0:03:20:**  That's the way they had it set up.  
**0:03:20-0:03:27:**  It goes to a single person, so Andrew was the one that was nominated for the award.  
**0:03:27-0:03:32:**  And then since then, we've actually also won the Victorian Government Farming Landcare  
**0:03:32-0:03:33:**  Award.  
**0:03:33-0:03:34:**  Andrew and I have both won that.  
**0:03:34-0:03:35:**  Wow, that's fantastic.  
**0:03:35-0:03:36:**  We've won the award recently.  
**0:03:36-0:03:43:**  Well, it makes me very grateful to have you on the podcast because having award-winning  
**0:03:43-0:03:47:**  farmers on the show is fantastic.  
**0:03:47-0:03:52:**  Another thing we should say, I think, with the national award, the Bob Wolk Landcare  
**0:03:52-0:03:59:**  Award is that it's also recognition of the community and the groups we've worked with  
**0:03:59-0:04:04:**  over the last 30 years with the Otwayaga Forestry Network and the East Otway Landcare Group  
**0:04:04-0:04:09:**  and the Pangamite Catchment Management Authority.  
**0:04:09-0:04:14:**  There's been a lot of collaboration for example on the revegetation of the Yan Yan Girth catchment  
**0:04:14-0:04:16:**  involving many farmers.  
**0:04:16-0:04:19:**  So that's all part of it.  
**0:04:19-0:04:25:**  There's been a lot of community activity in this region in land care and agroforestry.  
**0:04:25-0:04:32:**  So it's also recognition of those efforts because no one person can do this.  
**0:04:32-0:04:35:**  It's got to be a collaboration.  
**0:04:35-0:04:41:**  It's about networking and working together and coming up with better plans for our farm  
**0:04:41-0:04:44:**  and farming systems.  
**0:04:44-0:04:47:**  And that's the case for your farm as well, right?  
**0:04:47-0:04:51:**  You're working as a family, if I understood correctly.  
**0:04:51-0:04:52:**  That's right.  
**0:04:52-0:04:54:**  So Andrew and I mainly run the farm.  
**0:04:54-0:04:59:**  We have three daughters and two of those daughters work on the farm with us.  
**0:04:59-0:05:03:**  And then when we have tree planting days and things like that, the extended family comes.  
**0:05:03-0:05:09:**  So the rest of Andrew's family that live in Melbourne and down on the coast come up and  
**0:05:09-0:05:15:**  help plant as well as a whole heap of other people as well, friends and people that think  
**0:05:15-0:05:17:**  tree planting is a real novelty.  
**0:05:17-0:05:19:**  So that happens every year.  
**0:05:19-0:05:21:**  We have a family and friends tree planting day.  
**0:05:21-0:05:24:**  So we've been doing that for 30 years, that tree planting day.  
**0:05:24-0:05:27:**  So that's been great.  
**0:05:27-0:05:34:**  And just pre-COVID in 2019 when everyone was allowed out, we had 74 people turn up.  
**0:05:34-0:05:36:**  And that was a big event.  
**0:05:36-0:05:41:**  And that turned into a nice social activity too, Dimitri, because that's part of the poly  
**0:05:41-0:05:47:**  ethos of land care and running farms is the community aspect of it.  
**0:05:47-0:05:49:**  And we really enjoy that.  
**0:05:49-0:05:56:**  And so after planting, we have a late lunch and sit down and enjoy the scenery and each  
**0:05:56-0:05:57:**  other's company.  
**0:05:57-0:06:02:**  Yeah, we usually have a bit of a bonfire somewhere up where we've been planting and everyone  
**0:06:02-0:06:04:**  brings food to shares.  
**0:06:04-0:06:06:**  So it's a really, really lovely day.  
**0:06:06-0:06:09:**  But we've been doing it for a long time.  
**0:06:09-0:06:14:**  Some of the people that have been coming have been coming for nearly 30 years.  
**0:06:14-0:06:19:**  Last year we ended up, sorry, pre-COVID we did a bit of a tour to look at all the stuff  
**0:06:19-0:06:23:**  they've planted in the previous year so they could see how some of their trees have grown  
**0:06:23-0:06:25:**  that they've helped plant many years before.  
**0:06:25-0:06:28:**  So they're pretty excited about that.  
**0:06:28-0:06:29:**  That's incredible.  
**0:06:29-0:06:34:**  They've seen the whole evolution of the tree planting since the beginning, right?  
**0:06:34-0:06:35:**  Because 30 years ago that it started.  
**0:06:35-0:06:37:**  More or less, yeah.  
**0:06:37-0:06:44:**  It's intergenerational now because our daughters are now sort of in their late 20s, early 30s.  
**0:06:44-0:06:48:**  And then our oldest daughter has three girls.  
**0:06:48-0:06:49:**  So we've got three grandchildren.  
**0:06:49-0:06:54:**  Then my brothers and sisters have family and they come down and their friends come down.  
**0:06:54-0:06:57:**  So we've been getting a lot of young people, which has been motivating.  
**0:06:57-0:07:03:**  So that they've really taken on the whole idea that tree planting is a good idea.  
**0:07:03-0:07:07:**  And they encourage their friends and they're very enthusiastic.  
**0:07:07-0:07:12:**  And you get a lot of engineers, you get young people around and that's great for us older  
**0:07:12-0:07:17:**  people because I think it inspires everybody.  
**0:07:17-0:07:21:**  We just had a planting day last week with 50 people.  
**0:07:21-0:07:24:**  And in a few hours we got so many trees planted.  
**0:07:24-0:07:26:**  It was incredible.  
**0:07:26-0:07:28:**  And then we had, again, same thing.  
**0:07:28-0:07:33:**  I can really relate to your experiences thanks to this because we then had a big barbecue  
**0:07:33-0:07:34:**  going.  
**0:07:34-0:07:41:**  All the tables were out in the field and everybody was eating and drinking and enjoying after  
**0:07:41-0:07:42:**  the tree planting.  
**0:07:42-0:07:47:**  It was perfect because it worked super well for the farmer that wanted the trees planted.  
**0:07:47-0:07:50:**  It worked for people that wanted to learn about tree planting.  
**0:07:50-0:07:54:**  And then they wanted to get out of the city and spend a bit of time in the countryside  
**0:07:54-0:07:57:**  and be on a farm and connecting and networking.  
**0:07:57-0:08:01:**  It was really an important, let's say, moment.  
**0:08:01-0:08:03:**  It was very inspiring.  
**0:08:03-0:08:06:**  It's like a cross-pollination, isn't it?  
**0:08:06-0:08:07:**  City gift.  
**0:08:07-0:08:08:**  Exactly.  
**0:08:08-0:08:12:**  And it makes it more enjoyable for us too than us just going out there and planting  
**0:08:12-0:08:13:**  the trees.  
**0:08:13-0:08:19:**  We have other people here as well so it makes the whole job much easier and much more fun.  
**0:08:19-0:08:22:**  So it's great having all the young people here.  
**0:08:22-0:08:23:**  They're all pretty enthusiastic.  
**0:08:23-0:08:28:**  And a lot of those come back, the mates of ours, daughters come back and they help prune  
**0:08:28-0:08:32:**  later on because they love getting up and they've got high pruning some of the agroforestry  
**0:08:32-0:08:33:**  trees.  
**0:08:33-0:08:37:**  So that's been sort of a carry on from the planting.  
**0:08:37-0:08:41:**  Maybe we could go a bit into the story of the farm.  
**0:08:41-0:08:45:**  How did you get started with your farm?  
**0:08:45-0:08:46:**  How did everything begin?  
**0:08:46-0:08:50:**  When did you start transitioning towards these new practices?  
**0:08:50-0:08:56:**  I suppose to answer that we should give a little bit of history about the farm.  
**0:08:56-0:09:00:**  Our family has been on this property for 116 years.  
**0:09:00-0:09:04:**  It came here in 1905.  
**0:09:04-0:09:10:**  And so we're now up to the sixth generation on the property.  
**0:09:10-0:09:18:**  And our father, he actually started planting native trees back in 1967 because he was keen  
**0:09:18-0:09:22:**  on shade and shelter for these sheep and birds.  
**0:09:22-0:09:23:**  He loved birds.  
**0:09:23-0:09:29:**  And he and his friend who had a farm or has a farm as well was of a similar feeling to  
**0:09:29-0:09:30:**  that.  
**0:09:30-0:09:34:**  And so they got together and started planting native trees, which was not a common thing  
**0:09:34-0:09:42:**  to do because at that stage, people were mainly planting cypress trees and pine trees or maybe  
**0:09:42-0:09:44:**  even cutting trees down.  
**0:09:44-0:09:47:**  And so that was a bit of a shift in those days.  
**0:09:47-0:09:52:**  And it wasn't easy then because they went to land care groups, they went to nurseries.  
**0:09:52-0:09:56:**  It wasn't the communal support that we had.  
**0:09:56-0:09:58:**  But they battled away.  
**0:09:58-0:10:04:**  And it was only small scale then, but they really pioneered planting native trees in  
**0:10:04-0:10:06:**  this district.  
**0:10:06-0:10:13:**  And then later on, as we grew up, I think that had an impact on us.  
**0:10:13-0:10:18:**  I remember planting trees when I was a kid with my father.  
**0:10:18-0:10:24:**  And then when we came and became really active in the farm, we thought we should develop  
**0:10:24-0:10:30:**  a whole farm plan because we were facing a lot of issues on the farm, even though a bit  
**0:10:30-0:10:37:**  of tree planting had occurred, we needed a lot more because we had issues such as erosion,  
**0:10:37-0:10:43:**  tumbler erosion and stream bank erosion and gully erosion and then salt affected areas  
**0:10:43-0:10:47:**  as well, water logging back in those days, lack of biodiversity.  
**0:10:47-0:10:49:**  Baddocks being too big.  
**0:10:49-0:10:56:**  So as a family, we developed a whole farm plan to try and avert these issues and come  
**0:10:56-0:11:01:**  up with a strategic approach to seeing what we could do.  
**0:11:01-0:11:04:**  And it coincided with land care.  
**0:11:04-0:11:11:**  Land care sort of kicked off in about 1986, 87.  
**0:11:11-0:11:15:**  And then we were developing our whole farm plan in the early 90s.  
**0:11:15-0:11:22:**  So we were working with land care and then our colleague, Rowan Reed, whom you've interviewed,  
**0:11:22-0:11:28:**  he bought a property only three kilometers away and we became friends way back in 1987.  
**0:11:28-0:11:29:**  And we've been friends ever since.  
**0:11:29-0:11:35:**  And the first day we met, we were talking trees and the last conversation I had with  
**0:11:35-0:11:41:**  him three days ago was still talking trees and that'll continue.  
**0:11:41-0:11:47:**  And so he had the idea of agroforestry and we really hadn't thought much about that because  
**0:11:47-0:11:56:**  we were focusing on looking at how to address these issues using the land care approach.  
**0:11:56-0:12:03:**  And so we started fencing out areas such as the creek lines and the drainage lines and  
**0:12:03-0:12:07:**  the salt affected areas and planning those out and the waterlogged areas and the remnant  
**0:12:07-0:12:09:**  vegetation areas.  
**0:12:09-0:12:11:**  And this is what we had on our plan.  
**0:12:11-0:12:19:**  But with the agroforestry, it seemed to us after talking with Rowan that why don't we  
**0:12:19-0:12:23:**  integrate some agroforestry with the plantings because we're doing all this work.  
**0:12:23-0:12:28:**  Why not manage some of the trees for tree products?  
**0:12:28-0:12:32:**  So we took the fences out a bit wider than the normal land care planting and flanked  
**0:12:32-0:12:35:**  them with some of those trees that we could manage.  
**0:12:35-0:12:38:**  And that's how it really evolved, I think.  
**0:12:38-0:12:45:**  And we've been working towards that plan for the last 30 years and now we've established  
**0:12:45-0:12:51:**  50,000 trees and shrubs along these areas and that's really resulting in a web of connected  
**0:12:51-0:12:57:**  trees throughout the farm forming wildlife corridors and protection for the soil and  
**0:12:57-0:13:06:**  the animals and the waterways and it's brought in the birds.  
**0:13:06-0:13:11:**  And also we're connecting with neighbours because at that time there was the Yan Yan  
**0:13:11-0:13:15:**  Gurr Creek catchment plan through the land care group we worked with.  
**0:13:15-0:13:17:**  So we were very involved with that.  
**0:13:17-0:13:21:**  So our wildlife corridors are connected with our neighbours and that Yan Yan Gurr Creek  
**0:13:21-0:13:24:**  catchment is now 18 kilometres long.  
**0:13:24-0:13:27:**  It's pretty much all been fenced out and pretty vegetated.  
**0:13:27-0:13:29:**  So there's been a lot of collaboration.  
**0:13:29-0:13:33:**  So there was a whole mood of people doing a lot of things at that time in land care  
**0:13:33-0:13:38:**  in agroforestry and then coming up with more sustainable farming systems.  
**0:13:38-0:13:43:**  So that's sort of roughly the evolution of where we've got and Jill might have something  
**0:13:43-0:13:45:**  to add that I've forgotten.  
**0:13:45-0:13:47:**  Well I think we covered it all.  
**0:13:47-0:13:53:**  Yeah, I mean we were working on the farm so we were aware of the issues that we had, the  
**0:13:53-0:13:58:**  physical issues that we had in the landscape and it was certainly very exposed out working  
**0:13:58-0:14:01:**  particularly on some of our top hills.  
**0:14:01-0:14:08:**  We just had no shelter, no shade and we were getting, one year it was very dry and we lost  
**0:14:08-0:14:14:**  a lot of topsoil blowing off the pasture and the pasture was probably not as good as it  
**0:14:14-0:14:15:**  could have been.  
**0:14:15-0:14:18:**  We didn't have as much ground cover as we should have but also no trees to stop the  
**0:14:18-0:14:19:**  wind either.  
**0:14:19-0:14:24:**  We thought at the time when we were up there putting a fence up that we really need to  
**0:14:24-0:14:31:**  plant some trees to try and slow this wind down and keep our soil on our own place and  
**0:14:31-0:14:34:**  add a bit of biodiversity.  
**0:14:34-0:14:38:**  So this was a very, let's say, complete introduction.  
**0:14:38-0:14:43:**  I really enjoyed it and I know some of the listeners may be thinking, you know, but wait,  
**0:14:43-0:14:47:**  what is actually being produced on the farm apart from the trees?  
**0:14:47-0:14:53:**  So I think it's the time to mention as well maybe, you know, what's your main crops coming  
**0:14:53-0:14:57:**  out of the farm, what acreage are you farming on?  
**0:14:57-0:15:00:**  Some of these basics would be really great to hear.  
**0:15:00-0:15:08:**  Yeah, well I mean the main production off the farm is sheep so we raise sheep prime  
**0:15:08-0:15:10:**  lambs for meat.  
**0:15:10-0:15:18:**  So that's our main, and this year we've raised around, sorry last year we raised around 1700  
**0:15:18-0:15:20:**  lambs that have gone off the sale.  
**0:15:20-0:15:27:**  We have a base flock of 1300 ewes that we breed from with rams that we put over them.  
**0:15:27-0:15:33:**  So that's our main production but there's lots of small side productions happening now.  
**0:15:33-0:15:40:**  A lot to do with the other opportunities then being created through the agroforestry network.  
**0:15:40-0:15:43:**  So we've planted native flowers.  
**0:15:43-0:15:47:**  So we've had a system where we've been going through the farm and fencing off all our dams  
**0:15:47-0:15:52:**  to improve the water quality because we've found if stock get into dams they make a bit  
**0:15:52-0:15:55:**  of a mess and they also cause erosion around the edge.  
**0:15:55-0:16:01:**  So we're now slowly going around the whole farm and fencing every dam off and some if  
**0:16:01-0:16:06:**  they're high in the landscape with the trough off them which is just gravity fed and others  
**0:16:06-0:16:09:**  where we just have a very small stock access where the stock can get in and get a drink  
**0:16:09-0:16:13:**  but they can't wallow around in the water or get around the banks.  
**0:16:13-0:16:20:**  And so every dam that we've fenced off we've planted out because we just thought we'd add  
**0:16:20-0:16:25:**  to the biodiversity on the farm and makes the dams look a lot nicer and provides habitat  
**0:16:25-0:16:28:**  for wild animals and things like that.  
**0:16:28-0:16:34:**  But one of the dams we decided to take the fence out a bit further and we planted about  
**0:16:34-0:16:40:**  27 different species of Banksy as native Australian flowers and really we did it for fun.  
**0:16:40-0:16:45:**  We put lots of things in there as well we put Leucodendrons and Leucospernums and Cunzias  
**0:16:45-0:16:48:**  and all sorts of other plants in there.  
**0:16:48-0:16:54:**  But it ended up of course all those things flowered and we thought well maybe we'll start  
**0:16:54-0:16:58:**  selling them at the top of the driveway so I was just making up bunches and putting at  
**0:16:58-0:17:02:**  the top of the driveway which just went like hot cakes probably because they were too cheap  
**0:17:02-0:17:03:**  but anyway.  
**0:17:03-0:17:11:**  And then I had like our local Landcare office come to me and say oh we're having a Landcare  
**0:17:11-0:17:17:**  event can you do the flowers for it so that all started to happen and then you know friends  
**0:17:17-0:17:20:**  someone knew someone were having a wedding and they wanted native flowers so we started  
**0:17:20-0:17:27:**  supplying those and then we had probably oh I don't know how many bushes of flowers we  
**0:17:27-0:17:35:**  had 27 species but we've probably got a couple of hundred bushes of Banksy planted in this  
**0:17:35-0:17:39:**  area and so of course we had a lot of flowers so I thought well I've got lots of flowers  
**0:17:39-0:17:45:**  there and need to do something with them so picked them and took them into local florists  
**0:17:45-0:17:51:**  and they just jumped on them they just they're hard to get hold of and when they're freshly  
**0:17:51-0:17:56:**  grown and locally grown they were very keen to support that.  
**0:17:56-0:18:03:**  So I now supply local florists and colac and which is sort of half an hour from us and  
**0:18:03-0:18:07:**  that's a regular thing now so every week I'm taking orders they have standard orders that  
**0:18:07-0:18:12:**  they put into me each week and every week I take those orders in and deliver them to  
**0:18:12-0:18:19:**  them so that's actually become a fairly substantial income for the farm now I mean not as cheap  
**0:18:19-0:18:25:**  but it's pretty good and in fact it's been so successful we're now putting another plantation  
**0:18:25-0:18:30:**  in so we've sectioned off another area in the farm that's not so productive for grass  
**0:18:30-0:18:35:**  and sheep but that would be a good well-dained site to put more Banksy's in and we'll probably  
**0:18:35-0:18:38:**  make this a more commercial plantation so we'll actually plant it in rows and things  
**0:18:38-0:18:43:**  so it's easy to harvest whereas the site where it is now it's a beautiful oasis and it's  
**0:18:43-0:18:50:**  gorgeous but the plants are just planted all over the place and pathways are pretty thin  
**0:18:50-0:18:54:**  to get in between plants and things particularly now it's 10 years later that we planted that  
**0:18:54-0:18:58:**  it's getting quite overgrown and pretty hard to get through to pick flowers so we thought  
**0:18:58-0:19:03:**  well we'll put a commercial plantation and it's going to be a bit easier to pick but  
**0:19:03-0:19:11:**  it's amazing we do farm tours and we have that's one of the favorite spots you know  
**0:19:11-0:19:15:**  nearly every tour group that comes they love the farm but boy they absolutely fall in love  
**0:19:15-0:19:20:**  with the Banksia site and it's got native foods and things in there too we're growing  
**0:19:20-0:19:25:**  native mint and lily pillies and a few other things in there just just trialing for fun  
**0:19:25-0:19:31:**  and then my brother-in-law Andrew's brother Hugh has been heavily involved with that site  
**0:19:31-0:19:35:**  and he's planted fruit trees in there so it's sort of like a seed and flower forest now  
**0:19:35-0:19:41:**  so it's something that's been a great you know just a side thing to the farm that wasn't  
**0:19:41-0:19:42:**  there before.  
**0:19:42-0:19:50:**  I mean firstly I've seen the the video that they filmed with this spot and it looks incredible  
**0:19:50-0:19:54:**  I would and I've only seen it in a video so I can't even imagine what it's like in person  
**0:19:54-0:20:00:**  but it seems to be quite a high value area as you know per area in the sense it's very  
**0:20:00-0:20:06:**  high value per hectare kind of thing right it's very concentrated quite small in producing  
**0:20:06-0:20:11:**  this very high value product whilst you know benefiting biodiversity it seems like such  
**0:20:11-0:20:12:**  a huge win-win.  
**0:20:12-0:20:18:**  It is a big win-win I mean it's in that area now there is 12 species of honey eaters and  
**0:20:18-0:20:22:**  before that there would have been no birds there it's just an eroding dam with nothing  
**0:20:22-0:20:29:**  around it so it's now incredibly diverse there's lots of little bush swamp rats up there echidnas  
**0:20:29-0:20:33:**  in there there's all sorts of things in there now it's really quite a really biodiverse  
**0:20:33-0:20:39:**  little spot and one of the beauties of the banks here is that they like not very good  
**0:20:39-0:20:44:**  soil acidic sandy loam soil is what we've got up there and that's what banks here is  
**0:20:44-0:20:48:**  like so we haven't had to do anything we've planted them nursed them along a bit to get  
**0:20:48-0:20:55:**  them going but really apart from me pruning the trees the and the plants now you know  
**0:20:55-0:20:59:**  it's not you don't have to put fertilizer on you don't have to be up there watering  
**0:20:59-0:21:03:**  them all the time because they like a lack of water they've been grown in western Australia  
**0:21:03-0:21:09:**  a lot of them so they used to you know drought and so they're very drought tolerant so they're  
**0:21:09-0:21:13:**  very easy and they're they you know they're just the most beautiful flowers they're very  
**0:21:13-0:21:16:**  unusual and a lot of people really like them.  
**0:21:16-0:21:22:**  Well part of the program up there is I think it's looking at the graded site that Jill  
**0:21:22-0:21:26:**  mentioned where the cattle were just utilizing it and it was so sandy they were pushing it  
**0:21:26-0:21:34:**  in and so it was very bad for agriculture but fantastic for banks here so it's it's  
**0:21:34-0:21:39:**  matching you know another management system for that site and turning a problem into a  
**0:21:39-0:21:47:**  creative solution and now Jill's hard work has become also an economic proposition as  
**0:21:47-0:21:54:**  well which was a bit unexpected as Jill explained so sometimes I mean we consider this as part  
**0:21:54-0:22:00:**  of our agroforestry you know the the bushes and and shrubs and and flowers native flowers  
**0:22:00-0:22:11:**  part of our agroforestry so sometimes you get you get unexpected unexpected benefits  
**0:22:11-0:22:15:**  coming out of the woodwork and that's one of them and there are others that we can talk  
**0:22:15-0:22:16:**  about later.  
**0:22:16-0:22:20:**  And the other beauty of that too is the the water quality has improved out of sight in  
**0:22:20-0:22:25:**  that dam because the cattle aren't making a mess of it now it's got a trough off it  
**0:22:25-0:22:29:**  so it's on a hillside so the trough can just be gravity fed and that's down below outside  
**0:22:29-0:22:34:**  the plantation and the paddock for the stock to get a drink so you know the water quality  
**0:22:34-0:22:38:**  is so much clearer than it was it was very muddy before but it's really quite clear and  
**0:22:38-0:22:42:**  a lot of reeds have grown up in the dam now that couldn't have done before because the  
**0:22:42-0:22:47:**  cattle would have just like either knocked them or eaten them so you know it has been  
**0:22:47-0:22:49:**  a real win-win situation.  
**0:22:49-0:22:54:**  And there's a lot of there's the cacophony of frogs there if you go up there in the evening  
**0:22:54-0:22:59:**  the frogs all over the place although I didn't ever see a frog there for 30 years and now  
**0:22:59-0:23:00:**  there's heaps of frogs.  
**0:23:00-0:23:05:**  Yes it's a beautiful spot and it's really lovely to go up there and pick because it's  
**0:23:05-0:23:09:**  you know I have I have I do employ someone now because I'm selling so many flowers so  
**0:23:09-0:23:13:**  I employ someone to come and help me pick and I've just you know the people I've employed  
**0:23:13-0:23:17:**  have only had a couple of them and they've just said this is the best job they've ever  
**0:23:17-0:23:19:**  had you know this is just really fun.  
**0:23:19-0:23:25:**  Being up there and I saw the birds listening to the frogs and picking these beautiful flowers  
**0:23:25-0:23:27:**  and you know so they just love it.  
**0:23:27-0:23:31:**  I suppose we should talk about some of the other things you know the products that have  
**0:23:31-0:23:34:**  been derived from the trees on the farm.  
**0:23:34-0:23:38:**  Yeah I would love to get into that but before that I just wanted I had one thing in mind  
**0:23:38-0:23:44:**  and I was just thinking about you know the tulip production systems that they have in  
**0:23:44-0:23:50:**  in Europe with these massive fields of just which is one flower and they're all chemically  
**0:23:50-0:23:52:**  managed and etc.  
**0:23:52-0:23:57:**  When you think about if we could produce flowers in this way especially with you know as you  
**0:23:57-0:24:02:**  said more a bit more rational systems with lines a bit more organized even though that  
**0:24:02-0:24:07:**  wouldn't be so beautiful of course but it just seems like you know it could just transform  
**0:24:07-0:24:13:**  the the flower industry especially if it's in high demand it's something that's you know  
**0:24:13-0:24:18:**  if I went to a shop personally I would definitely buy perennial flowers rather than annual flowers  
**0:24:18-0:24:22:**  in the same way that we try to eat as much perennial food as we can right?  
**0:24:22-0:24:25:**  People realized how many flowers were being imported because a lot of them couldn't be  
**0:24:25-0:24:32:**  imported anymore and I think I don't think many florists actually educate their buyers  
**0:24:32-0:24:35:**  about where the flowers come from but I think what happened is a lot of people went into  
**0:24:35-0:24:40:**  the flowers to get their normal flowers whatever they get and you know told oh no well we can't  
**0:24:40-0:24:45:**  get those and then you know why not oh well they come from Chile or they come from South  
**0:24:45-0:24:51:**  Africa or somewhere and people just were absolutely amazed at how many flowers we actually import  
**0:24:51-0:24:55:**  when we've got these beautiful ones here that we can just you know grow in our own country  
**0:24:55-0:25:01:**  that are suited to our soils that we don't need to be using fertilizer or and we don't  
**0:25:01-0:25:05:**  we don't even use any sprays up at this site it's it's there is a bit of maintenance physical  
**0:25:05-0:25:11:**  maintenance that has to go on up there but we've planted a lot of native grasses and  
**0:25:11-0:25:15:**  tussocks and things like that like up there to try and keep the weeds under control so  
**0:25:15-0:25:21:**  that we don't have to be doing too much maintenance but yeah it's a pretty pretty good site.  
**0:25:21-0:25:26:**  Maybe we shift to the some of the other products that you have that have emerged from from  
**0:25:26-0:25:32:**  the forestry plantations from the agroforestry sorry plantations what you know what other  
**0:25:32-0:25:35:**  kind of products have you started selling based on the tree plants?  
**0:25:35-0:25:41:**  Well we we have sold we've got some pine plantations in and we even though we haven't harvested  
**0:25:41-0:25:47:**  any big logs out of that yet originally when we were first growing the trees we had an  
**0:25:47-0:25:53:**  approach from someone that wanted to buy Christmas trees so we actually went through and just  
**0:25:53-0:25:57:**  marked the trees that we would allow them to take which weren't probably the best form  
**0:25:57-0:26:02:**  for us for our agroforestry logs but okay for them to take for Christmas trees so a  
**0:26:02-0:26:05:**  guy actually came and just harvested those we just went through and marked the ones he  
**0:26:05-0:26:11:**  could take and then and when he paid us for those they actually paid for the establishment  
**0:26:11-0:26:18:**  of the pine tree so it was a really good good way to get those established.  
**0:26:18-0:26:24:**  And other things we've we've done small amounts of harvesting for round wood timber so we've  
**0:26:24-0:26:30:**  got our daughter and her partner are natural builders and they're within a set of friends  
**0:26:30-0:26:35:**  that are natural builders so they use a lot of round wood tinder logs so they've come  
**0:26:35-0:26:39:**  in and harvested a few of those that are just smaller logs out of our plantations that aren't  
**0:26:39-0:26:46:**  big enough for to go for big logs at this stage and yeah Michelle our daughter's partner  
**0:26:46-0:26:52:**  Nick is a landscape designer so he's harvested round wood logs for a wild playground down  
**0:26:52-0:26:56:**  at the coast that he built for a kindergarten.  
**0:26:56-0:26:58:**  What else have we what else have we?  
**0:26:58-0:27:10:**  We've also got had some harvesting for blue gum pulp for high quality paper making and  
**0:27:10-0:27:16:**  but instead of planting our pulp logs our blue gum logs in one big block we've stretched  
**0:27:16-0:27:22:**  them out into three kilometers of tall grow shelter belts throughout the farm and all  
**0:27:22-0:27:28:**  along our land class subdivisions because when the company first approached us about  
**0:27:28-0:27:33:**  blue gums I think they were keen just to put them all in the say a 20 acre block but we  
**0:27:33-0:27:40:**  thought that was high risk you know and and it wouldn't get many multiple values from  
**0:27:40-0:27:46:**  that so we had our whole farm planned in place so it was an ideal situation to then use that  
**0:27:46-0:27:52:**  to negotiate with the company that we could place 12 road plantations along our land class  
**0:27:52-0:27:57:**  subdivisions and into three kilometers of shelter belts which has given a significant  
**0:27:57-0:28:03:**  shelter for the farm of course they get harvested they were planned in 1993 and harvested in  
**0:28:03-0:28:10:**  2007 and now they're really growing because they coppice from the stump and end up with  
**0:28:10-0:28:16:**  more four or five litres and we come in maybe 18 months later and take out the poor leaders  
**0:28:16-0:28:21:**  and leave the strong leader and so we've been managing the crop for a second rotation which  
**0:28:21-0:28:26:**  will be a few years down the track and so that's that also provide us with a good cash  
**0:28:26-0:28:34:**  income to put into a tree fund for the farm and then we've used that tree fund to finance  
**0:28:34-0:28:40:**  other plantings throughout the property and that's how we how we've managed that there's  
**0:28:40-0:28:52:**  also some seed so we've got a seed orchard and we have we have spotted gum and sugar  
**0:28:52-0:28:59:**  gum and we've been in a partnership with another group with that and my brother and we've surrounded  
**0:28:59-0:29:05:**  the seed orchard with three rows of biodiverse native plantings to protect it and to enhance  
**0:29:05-0:29:11:**  the pollination to give better seed production and improve the environment and so the thinnings  
**0:29:11-0:29:16:**  from that plantation are the ones that Jill referred to have been used for the round wood  
**0:29:16-0:29:22:**  timber building and we're letting the others grow on for soil logs as well as harvesting  
**0:29:22-0:29:26:**  some of the seed we haven't sold much seed we thought there was going to be more demand  
**0:29:26-0:29:33:**  for it there is seed in storage so that that might change but it's also a plantation which  
**0:29:33-0:29:38:**  is protecting the lives of the sheep giving them good shade and shelter as well so we  
**0:29:38-0:29:45:**  really like to focus on the multi-purpose functionality of these projects so they're  
**0:29:45-0:29:52:**  probably the main things we've used that we've sold there's also the sculptures that we have  
**0:29:52-0:29:58:**  we have we've got a fairly artistic daughter who goes to lots of festivals and she's she  
**0:29:58-0:30:04:**  and a crew of people have been artists at festivals building big sculptures so they've  
**0:30:04-0:30:08:**  bought some of the timber for us some of the some of the thinnings as Andrew's talking  
**0:30:08-0:30:13:**  about to build sculptures for festivals so some of it's gone off to that and then out  
**0:30:13-0:30:20:**  we've got another daughter she makes she makes cut placemats out of timber so you know even  
**0:30:20-0:30:26:**  if it's just foreign logs or or thinnings she'll she makes placemats out of you know  
**0:30:26-0:30:32:**  beautiful placemats so often out of she oak so she's just cutting a thin a thin thing  
**0:30:32-0:30:36:**  straight across the round log and then making placemats and they're beautiful she oils them  
**0:30:36-0:30:42:**  and gives them away as presents and things the other product which is coming online soon  
**0:30:42-0:30:46:**  but not quite there yet is will be saw logs we've got some saw logs that are ready for  
**0:30:46-0:30:51:**  harvest we've got some that are 80, 83 or 4 centimeters of diameter at breast height  
**0:30:51-0:30:57:**  and they've been high prune and so a number of species you've probably got about 10 species  
**0:30:57-0:31:02:**  of saw logs that we're managing including finest radiata and blackwoods and blue gums  
**0:31:02-0:31:08:**  and yellow sugar gums and spotty gums and others and so they're all integrated mainly  
**0:31:08-0:31:14:**  with our plantations and we manage those and so they'll be coming on stream that'll be  
**0:31:14-0:31:21:**  fused down the track and that'll be pretty exciting when we get those happening as well  
**0:31:21-0:31:26:**  How much does that represent? I mean is that a quite a big chunk of the shelter beds shelter  
**0:31:26-0:31:31:**  belts that you've planted that have been used for you know timber production?  
**0:31:31-0:31:38:**  Well this way I guess we've taken the property from 3% woody vegetation in 1991 to 18% now  
**0:31:38-0:31:48:**  and probably pushing closer to 20% I suppose and so of those about half those are being  
**0:31:48-0:31:55:**  managed in different ways in that system there's a lot of understory integrated with those  
**0:31:55-0:32:00:**  plantings as well because we're really big on biodiversity and overall we've established  
**0:32:00-0:32:06:**  about 120 species of overstory and understory of trees and shrubs throughout the farm  
**0:32:06-0:32:11:**  Yeah so there's lots that we will never cut down that are just there for biodiversity  
**0:32:11-0:32:17:**  and wildlife and shelter and shade and things like that  
**0:32:17-0:32:23:**  And how are you going to, I'm just thinking a bit about the saw logs that you're going  
**0:32:23-0:32:29:**  to be harvesting soon because I imagine that represents quite a big chunk of first year  
**0:32:29-0:32:33:**  income but also of the trees that you've planted for economic reasons  
**0:32:33-0:32:38:**  How do you plan on harvesting and selling that without being a forestry farm? One of  
**0:32:38-0:32:42:**  the things that we often encounter is farmers don't have the knowledge or the infrastructure  
**0:32:42-0:32:47:**  to be able to do that and then when they're planted in shelter belts often companies can  
**0:32:47-0:32:51:**  be a bit slightly pissed off really at having to come in and harvest them, they'd rather  
**0:32:51-0:32:57:**  have them in monocrop blocks so how are you guys going to navigate that problem?  
**0:32:57-0:33:00:**  Well I suppose if we look at the bluegums which have been harvested and we've had the  
**0:33:00-0:33:07:**  experience now although they were done in those belts it did make it more difficult  
**0:33:07-0:33:12:**  and more challenging but they still did it and we were in a profit share program and  
**0:33:12-0:33:19:**  we both made a profit so it actually worked so we know that and we know it can work again  
**0:33:19-0:33:20:**  so that's fine  
**0:33:20-0:33:24:**  And what we did do with the bluegums though when we did get them harvested the first time  
**0:33:24-0:33:29:**  we actually cooperated with neighbours and other people in the area that have got bluegums  
**0:33:29-0:33:34:**  on their farms too so the company could come and they could harvest the next door neighbours  
**0:33:34-0:33:39:**  they could harvest the guys down the road and so we all cooperated with each other and  
**0:33:39-0:33:43:**  we all harvested at the same time it made more worthwhile for that company to come out  
**0:33:43-0:33:47:**  and know that they had a few farms where they could get a harvest of bluegums from  
**0:33:47-0:33:52:**  That's right and that was done in collaboration with our Ottawa Agroforestry network as well  
**0:33:52-0:34:00:**  so that was definitely, to get back to your question, with the Pinus radiata we have three  
**0:34:00-0:34:08:**  small lots of Pinus radiata and we have had discussions with a company that's about 30  
**0:34:08-0:34:16:**  neighbours away some years ago and at that stage they said if we could get the logs up  
**0:34:16-0:34:24:**  to a landing up near the road somewhere well they would pick them up but we think that  
**0:34:24-0:34:31:**  there would be probably sufficient volume there to justify a proper harvester to come  
**0:34:31-0:34:41:**  out and do those logs as well with the other ones which are more niche opportunities we'd  
**0:34:41-0:34:50:**  be looking at harvesting those ourselves and using a portable mill to those and I think  
**0:34:50-0:34:56:**  that that sort of thing is starting to come on stream now where I think it's going to  
**0:34:56-0:35:01:**  be more possible, not quite there yet but I think over the next 5 or 10 years there's  
**0:35:01-0:35:08:**  going to be more of this activity getting around and so we feel confident that we'd  
**0:35:08-0:35:14:**  be able to do that and be able to harvest those because that would just be small scale  
**0:35:14-0:35:20:**  and it would be interesting to see how that all pans out but that would be something we'll  
**0:35:20-0:35:21:**  have to negotiate at the time.  
**0:35:21-0:35:27:**  There is a call now, there is starting to be a call now from architects that are looking  
**0:35:27-0:35:35:**  for sustainably grown timber and that sort of thing so the  
**0:35:35-0:35:36:**  Forestry Network is starting to get people like that ringing up going we've got a project  
**0:35:36-0:35:42:**  we want to do and the owners have called for sustainably grown timber, what have you got,  
**0:35:42-0:35:46:**  what can you supply so we think that sort of thing, the demand for that sort of thing  
**0:35:46-0:35:48:**  is going to increase.  
**0:35:48-0:35:53:**  Because when I'm thinking about the scale of this project I'm thinking about 50,000  
**0:35:53-0:36:00:**  trees maybe a quarter of them managed for timber, that seems like quite a big harvest  
**0:36:00-0:36:05:**  project as well, that seems nearly like a full time job for somebody to be harvesting  
**0:36:05-0:36:08:**  that and then milling it with a mill on farm.  
**0:36:08-0:36:14:**  We're harvesting individuals, we're not harvesting everything at the same time so that niche  
**0:36:14-0:36:21:**  timber that would be harvested as we get orders so it would be a small job, you're obviously  
**0:36:21-0:36:25:**  not harvesting if you've got 50,000 trees and you're harvesting a quarter of them or  
**0:36:25-0:36:31:**  you're not doing that all at the same time, it's over a year probably.  
**0:36:31-0:36:37:**  Whereas the blue gums obviously all come out all at once and the pine trees would probably  
**0:36:37-0:36:41:**  come out mostly at once too but the others would all be singly harvested.  
**0:36:41-0:36:48:**  I think keeping in context is that the blue gum plantations there's about 8,000 of those  
**0:36:48-0:36:54:**  so that's going to be done mechanically and we've already done one iteration of that and  
**0:36:54-0:37:05:**  with the pines there's probably about 1,000 of those thereabouts and then probably a bit  
**0:37:05-0:37:11:**  more than that actually so we think we can do that with more of a commercial operation  
**0:37:11-0:37:16:**  and then the other trees as you were saying, it's more selective over time, that would  
**0:37:16-0:37:21:**  be over probably a 20 year period or 15 year period or something like that so you'd be  
**0:37:21-0:37:26:**  just doing some selective logging from time to time and we'll just have to see how that  
**0:37:26-0:37:30:**  goes but that'll be the excitement trying to work out.  
**0:37:30-0:37:34:**  And I guess that that's also going to enable you to get higher value for those logs because  
**0:37:34-0:37:39:**  if you manage to sell them directly to smaller groups or smaller enterprises that are looking  
**0:37:39-0:37:46:**  for specific native high quality wood, hopefully that would help with gaining value, right?  
**0:37:46-0:37:50:**  Our colleague, Rong Lee, he's already been doing this so he's been paving the way for  
**0:37:50-0:37:57:**  us so we're learning from him and our orders are keen on the project because they've been  
**0:37:57-0:38:01:**  involved in even planting the trees and now they've been involved in breeding them and  
**0:38:01-0:38:06:**  now they get interested in how we're going to harvest them so these are the discussions  
**0:38:06-0:38:07:**  we're having.  
**0:38:07-0:38:12:**  So like all these things when you're trying something a bit different, the whole thinking  
**0:38:12-0:38:17:**  process is an evolutionary process and there's nothing set in concrete about this so we'll  
**0:38:17-0:38:25:**  just have to see how it works out but thus far we've been able to harvest and gain return  
**0:38:25-0:38:30:**  from some of our trees and the shrubs with the banks as the deal does and so it's just  
**0:38:30-0:38:35:**  a learning curve all the way through because we're coming from a low knowledge base because  
**0:38:35-0:38:41:**  this is the first iteration on this farm of this sort of activity so it's like it's sort  
**0:38:41-0:38:45:**  of pioneering in a way and just sort of seeing how it goes.  
**0:38:45-0:38:51:**  But meanwhile, if we don't ever take some of those trees out it won't matter because  
**0:38:51-0:38:54:**  of all the multiple benefits we're getting from having the trees on our place so we're  
**0:38:54-0:39:02:**  not really set in stone that we're going to cut all those trees down but they're providing  
**0:39:02-0:39:07:**  multiple benefits as they're growing so it doesn't matter if they don't get harvested  
**0:39:07-0:39:14:**  they can stay there and provide shade and shelter and biodiversity and habitat and all  
**0:39:14-0:39:18:**  the other things that trees provide for you in the meantime.  
**0:39:18-0:39:24:**  Jill's quite right there, I mean in a way it's like the tree products is icing on the  
**0:39:24-0:39:30:**  cake and we didn't harvest any of those trees they're all earning their right to be on the  
**0:39:30-0:39:36:**  farm but because we've been managing them we've kept the opportunity alive to have the  
**0:39:36-0:39:41:**  choice of cutting them down or leave them there for their carbon or for the birds and  
**0:39:41-0:39:48:**  not take them out so we might take some and leave some or take more or take less so we  
**0:39:48-0:39:52:**  can decide and make decisions as we go.  
**0:39:52-0:39:57:**  I mean in the sense originally you planted these trees in shelter belts for example if  
**0:39:57-0:40:03:**  we break into a bit the shelter belt example to give more of a visual and more detailed  
**0:40:03-0:40:10:**  understanding to our listeners and to myself I'm fascinated by this we've got shelter belts  
**0:40:10-0:40:16:**  that have been originally planted for the ecosystem services, windbreak, shade for the  
**0:40:16-0:40:22:**  animals etc that's their original function and you've just extended them a bit in order  
**0:40:22-0:40:26:**  to be able to add a bit more forestry opportunities.  
**0:40:26-0:40:32:**  Not only have we planned along the riparian zones and the drainage lines and the salt  
**0:40:32-0:40:37:**  affected areas and the remnant vegetation areas but we've also planned along land class  
**0:40:37-0:40:45:**  subdivisions and they're all connected so you can see how that can provide a lot of  
**0:40:45-0:40:52:**  ecosystem service by having wildlife corridors right through the farm and then getting all  
**0:40:52-0:40:57:**  that protection benefit and now we have a 23 kilometre interface of plantation to pasture  
**0:40:57-0:41:05:**  so in a sort of a thing in a permaculture sense that that's where you get a lot of really  
**0:41:05-0:41:12:**  good interaction in the biology of the farming system so it's sort of quite exciting and  
**0:41:12-0:41:20:**  so in the harvest of the saw logs in those plantings and of course not all the plantations  
**0:41:20-0:41:26:**  have trees that we are managing some of them have trees that we're not managing as well  
**0:41:26-0:41:31:**  so it's a real mix batch you know but so with the harvest it's going to be done on a mosaic  
**0:41:31-0:41:36:**  over space and time so you would hardly notice that trees have been harvested from there  
**0:41:36-0:41:41:**  because the harvest and the replant and only doing small numbers as opposed to the blue  
**0:41:41-0:41:46:**  gums which is different but with the saw logs is the way that it would occur so it gives  
**0:41:46-0:41:50:**  us plenty of time to be able to come up with mechanisms and opportunities to manage this  
**0:41:50-0:41:56:**  even if we've got a contract you know or we'll mill it coming in or something like that or  
**0:41:56-0:42:00:**  even if we walk on ourselves if the girls have become really interested in this and  
**0:42:00-0:42:05:**  that might become another add-on business for the property.  
**0:42:05-0:42:10:**  And so what you're saying is that you would by harvesting kind of spot harvesting around  
**0:42:10-0:42:16:**  the shelter belt you wouldn't actually compromise the function the ecological function of the  
**0:42:16-0:42:17:**  shelter belt.  
**0:42:17-0:42:23:**  Yeah that's right it's still yeah your shelter belt would still be worth doing its work what  
**0:42:23-0:42:28:**  it's meant to do it's just got the odd tree taken out of it which of course we replant  
**0:42:28-0:42:30:**  when we take out so.  
**0:42:30-0:42:35:**  If you're sometimes just taking an individual tree that can be an act of conservation too  
**0:42:35-0:42:41:**  because you're allowing more light in the understory as well and then you can plant  
**0:42:41-0:42:44:**  another tree there a different variety if required.  
**0:42:44-0:42:49:**  The only challenge that I see with that is is the efficiency of the harvest right in  
**0:42:49-0:42:54:**  terms of that kind of harvest and that kind of plantation in the shelter belt so integrating  
**0:42:54-0:42:59:**  agroforestry and shelter belts and harvesting timber means that you know it'd be difficult  
**0:42:59-0:43:04:**  for a company to come in and efficiently you know harvest things mechanically also would  
**0:43:04-0:43:06:**  be pretty impossible right.  
**0:43:06-0:43:09:**  No that's right it's not it's not for that you know that that type of planting is not  
**0:43:09-0:43:14:**  for that I mean our blue gums is for that and our pine trees we can do that with but  
**0:43:14-0:43:21:**  I suppose we're we're we're still putting our eggs in a few baskets so we've we've got  
**0:43:21-0:43:26:**  areas that can be mechanically done and others where we would just be taking individual trees  
**0:43:26-0:43:28:**  out that we've been managing ourselves.  
**0:43:28-0:43:33:**  I think with the pine trees that because we've got quite a few of those and we probably could  
**0:43:33-0:43:42:**  do that in in one go there but they're so positioned also that there are other trees  
**0:43:42-0:43:50:**  nearby where they are which will help fill that that issue void of protection as well  
**0:43:50-0:43:54:**  while the other trees would grow after replanting.  
**0:43:54-0:44:02:**  Yeah but certainly doing the niche harvesting wouldn't be attractive to a company and that  
**0:44:02-0:44:07:**  that's got to get down to you know an individual contractor who would go around with a portable  
**0:44:07-0:44:10:**  mill to help with that.  
**0:44:10-0:44:16:**  Which is a job opportunity you know it's an opportunity for someone to set up a business  
**0:44:16-0:44:20:**  where they could go around to farmers places that are doing agroforestry like we are and  
**0:44:20-0:44:21:**  mill trees.  
**0:44:21-0:44:27:**  Based on your kind of estimates it is spot harvesting from the shelter belts and and  
**0:44:27-0:44:32:**  and creating saw logs yourself and selling them is is going to be worth your time investment  
**0:44:32-0:44:38:**  it's going to to be able to pay for your time and makes a little extra on the side as you  
**0:44:38-0:44:41:**  know I'm just trying to think is it best to do that or would it be best to just leave  
**0:44:41-0:44:43:**  the shelter belt as it is and not harvest.  
**0:44:43-0:44:47:**  Yeah well that's right so that becomes an interesting decision particularly now with  
**0:44:47-0:44:51:**  carbon sequestration and this sort of thing.  
**0:44:51-0:45:01:**  But what Rowan has demonstrated over his place there where he's milled his and air dried  
**0:45:01-0:45:09:**  them but it is economically viable to do that to justify your time and to give a profit  
**0:45:09-0:45:11:**  for that type of operation.  
**0:45:11-0:45:18:**  So as well as really got the experience with that and we haven't with that sort of in the  
**0:45:18-0:45:22:**  future for us whereas he has done quite a lot of that sort of things we speak to that  
**0:45:22-0:45:24:**  better than we would.  
**0:45:24-0:45:31:**  We would certainly we'll certainly try a few years down the track and then learn from our  
**0:45:31-0:45:37:**  experiences and then if we decide you know certain trees aren't performing well or whatever  
**0:45:37-0:45:43:**  we say well we're not going to harvest those but we'll harvest these or we might say might  
**0:45:43-0:45:48:**  go through the process and it came to the point where we couldn't make it pay we just  
**0:45:48-0:45:53:**  leave the trees there and they continue to form the function on the farm.  
**0:45:53-0:45:58:**  So it's not a lost investment because we've had all those fixed costs of doing the fencing  
**0:45:58-0:46:02:**  this service and buying the trees which we do for a normal land care planting.  
**0:46:02-0:46:06:**  It's just so happens that we've made some of those trees to get the opportunity alive  
**0:46:06-0:46:15:**  to develop a commercial product from in terms of timber and so in that sense that's our  
**0:46:15-0:46:23:**  risk management strategy and if we were just planting 10 hectares in a block for the soil  
**0:46:23-0:46:29:**  logs well that would be a high risk strategy because you really to justify the end of that  
**0:46:29-0:46:34:**  because you're getting very very few other benefits because you've got a big block in  
**0:46:34-0:46:40:**  terms of our traditional agricultural production that becomes more of a straight forestry investment  
**0:46:40-0:46:45:**  and that is a high risk proposition but if you have the trees integrated and getting  
**0:46:45-0:46:52:**  them multiple values that's low risk in fact it's an important part of the risk management  
**0:46:52-0:46:57:**  strategy of the whole farm if you turn that on its head and say that because those trees  
**0:46:57-0:47:01:**  are there it's protecting the natural resource base and providing all the other benefits  
**0:47:01-0:47:07:**  we've been talking about and so that's like a win-win.  
**0:47:07-0:47:14:**  That's really really interesting to look at tree plantation and agroforestry through that  
**0:47:14-0:47:19:**  lens because there's a lot of criticism around about how planting trees is risky it takes  
**0:47:19-0:47:26:**  away you know there's many fears as well and not necessarily always founded in the actual  
**0:47:26-0:47:29:**  you know reality that we see in the field but there is a lot of fear around this and  
**0:47:29-0:47:35:**  tree planting is often considered risky and so what you're saying here is by merging these  
**0:47:35-0:47:41:**  multiple functions together you know you're buffering risk because if you don't manage  
**0:47:41-0:47:45:**  to have a perfect saw log well you've got these other things going on and you know if  
**0:47:45-0:47:51:**  the price is right of timber at some point you know and you've got high very good prices  
**0:47:51-0:47:56:**  for certain logs native logs for example you get in there and you harvest a few and you  
**0:47:56-0:48:00:**  get a good deal out of it it gives you a lot of flexibility.  
**0:48:00-0:48:05:**  That's right it gives you flexibility because you know if the price isn't right we don't  
**0:48:05-0:48:11:**  sell the log so it's you know with these other plantations we and I mean not only that they're  
**0:48:11-0:48:16:**  monocultures those big plantations which isn't healthy for our ecosystem and for our biodiversity  
**0:48:16-0:48:22:**  so you know biodiversity is healthy and so those those plantations that we've put in  
**0:48:22-0:48:28:**  have got multi species in them as well as saw logs and so they're much healthier for  
**0:48:28-0:48:32:**  the environment and for habitat for birds and animals and you know insects and things  
**0:48:32-0:48:40:**  like that so I think that you know to us it's a healthier way for the environment to plant  
**0:48:40-0:48:45:**  and we think that's incredibly important and that also provides resilience for the farm  
**0:48:45-0:48:51:**  in the face of climate change so you know if you're planting monocultures it's well  
**0:48:51-0:48:56:**  known monocultures are not healthy in any system you know whether it be wheat or you  
**0:48:56-0:49:04:**  know three thousand three hundred bluegums so and you've got you've got all those benefits  
**0:49:04-0:49:10:**  that if you have a a multi-species system that often those things will look after each  
**0:49:10-0:49:14:**  other if you have an insect come and attacked a certain tree well one of those other things  
**0:49:14-0:49:20:**  that plantation might harbour something that will kill that insect that's that's getting  
**0:49:20-0:49:26:**  stuck into another tree so you know the biodiversity is just much healthier than that type of planting  
**0:49:26-0:49:28:**  and we see that as being very important.  
**0:49:28-0:49:35:**  You can have small monocultures within the context of a polyculture though in the mosaic  
**0:49:35-0:49:38:**  over space and time over a landscape.  
**0:49:38-0:49:42:**  The other thing I suppose, Demetra, here is that this is about fitting the trees into  
**0:49:42-0:49:53:**  the landscape to capture those multiple values and so by doing that we have the fixed costs  
**0:49:53-0:49:57:**  as described before with the fencing and establishing the trees and doing the planting and so on  
**0:49:57-0:50:02:**  which we're going to do anyway for the reasons we have spoken about.  
**0:50:02-0:50:09:**  The only added variable cost to bring that tree to a saw log is the act of doing a form  
**0:50:09-0:50:14:**  prune and the act of pruning up to six metres.  
**0:50:14-0:50:19:**  All the other costs are the fixed costs the same as you would do for straight land care  
**0:50:19-0:50:25:**  planting so that variable cost probably only amounts to probably about half an hour of  
**0:50:25-0:50:32:**  your time to do that to get it to that point maybe an hour perhaps less.  
**0:50:32-0:50:33:**  That's on each tree.  
**0:50:33-0:50:39:**  On each tree so that's a very small cost to keep the opportunity alive to potentially  
**0:50:39-0:50:46:**  harvesting an 80 centimetre tree breast height and getting two cubic metres of timber and  
**0:50:46-0:50:53:**  selling that as an air dried product for maybe a thousand dollars or something like that  
**0:50:53-0:50:59:**  which was probably a realistic statement.  
**0:50:59-0:51:04:**  So I think they're the sort of economics I carry around in my head when looking at a  
**0:51:04-0:51:12:**  tree and then we say okay one day we might harvest that and do that or we might just  
**0:51:12-0:51:13:**  leave it.  
**0:51:13-0:51:19:**  Either way it's a winning situation providing it doesn't burn down.  
**0:51:19-0:51:25:**  I see that I often have in my head the voice of the agroforestry septic.  
**0:51:25-0:51:29:**  I'm quite sold on it but I like to carry that voice of a person that's hearing about it  
**0:51:29-0:51:32:**  for the first time and that would say yes but.  
**0:51:32-0:51:37:**  One of the things that often comes up is this fixed cost of implementation and so I think  
**0:51:37-0:51:43:**  there's a multiple, there's many things that people would that would that would kind of  
**0:51:43-0:51:47:**  prevent or block a farmer from implementing agroforestry or some knowledge etc but a big  
**0:51:47-0:51:52:**  part of it is you know that initial cost to plant it and so what we're seeing is that  
**0:51:52-0:51:58:**  often people are just really waiting on subsidies for example notably in our context in Europe  
**0:51:58-0:52:04:**  to plant trees and they may not take the initiative themselves and the cost on their own businesses  
**0:52:04-0:52:11:**  to plant these shelter belts which could provide economic value in the future but if you just  
**0:52:11-0:52:14:**  focus on that that's quite risky so it's not any of you know we talked with Rowan about  
**0:52:14-0:52:18:**  this and he talks quite actively about the fact that we need to plant for conservation  
**0:52:18-0:52:25:**  not just for profit and it relates very closely to what you were saying now and so what my  
**0:52:25-0:52:30:**  question would be you know how would you approach that fixed cost problem how do you in your  
**0:52:30-0:52:35:**  context in Australia how does how does that work how do you work around that?  
**0:52:35-0:52:41:**  Well the we have a fixed cost for doing our land care planning and if we weren't doing  
**0:52:41-0:52:48:**  any agroforestry we would be doing that anyway and because we've got around about 18% of  
**0:52:48-0:52:56:**  our landscape under woody vegetation we found that it hasn't actually reduced our traditional  
**0:52:56-0:53:07:**  agricultural output in other words we're still last year we produced 1800 lands and then  
**0:53:07-0:53:13:**  you know so we're still producing as many as many lands and as much wool as we were  
**0:53:13-0:53:19:**  back 30 years ago but we've got all these trees in the landscape as well and we're getting  
**0:53:19-0:53:23:**  the other products from these trees which we've already talked about that had already  
**0:53:23-0:53:32:**  come out and more that are coming so it hasn't in that sense affected our production system  
**0:53:32-0:53:41:**  but what it has done is it actually has improved the resilience and robustness of our farm  
**0:53:41-0:53:49:**  environment in terms of providing shade and shelter for our livestock and for our sheep  
**0:53:49-0:53:54:**  and also bringing the biodiversity back into the system you know looking at our integrated  
**0:53:54-0:54:02:**  pest management as well and our waterway management and reducing erosion and reducing solving  
**0:54:02-0:54:11:**  so we're getting all these other benefits to the natural resource base so that is relevant  
**0:54:11-0:54:16:**  in terms of a straight business cost to put up this biological infrastructure for the  
**0:54:16-0:54:26:**  web of trees across the farm if it's just straight land care plantings so and also it's  
**0:54:26-0:54:31:**  generated a carbon neutral farming program for us in fact we're now carbon positive for  
**0:54:31-0:54:41:**  our system and so that's where we all want to be and I think that if you look at it like  
**0:54:41-0:54:47:**  that then you say okay if you're going to manage some of those trees you invest say  
**0:54:47-0:54:54:**  half an hour or an hour of your time per tree in the life of the tree you've kept the option  
**0:54:54-0:55:00:**  of alive actually harvesting a tree which could potentially return you the gross of  
**0:55:00-0:55:06:**  a thousand dollars and taking out harvesting expenses and dry expenses from that it still  
**0:55:06-0:55:12:**  I would think be a profitable option if it wasn't well you just leave the tree there  
**0:55:12-0:55:21:**  and so we still got our system in place so it's this system is a lot about risk management  
**0:55:21-0:55:27:**  and developing a robust and resilient farming system as Jill said in the face of climate  
**0:55:27-0:55:35:**  change so that we're better protected less likely to have major events in terms of weather  
**0:55:35-0:55:43:**  variability and what we're finding is that the farm is actually cooler in the summer  
**0:55:43-0:55:50:**  which we know from all the 23 kilometers in the face of trees to plantation every paddock  
**0:55:50-0:55:56:**  is shaded from whichever direction because of the way the planning has been done and  
**0:55:56-0:56:02:**  they're just straight lines if I was a contours of the land and it's also relatively warm  
**0:56:02-0:56:11:**  winter when you look at the chill factor on newborn lands if you can reduce the wind speed  
**0:56:11-0:56:18:**  chill factor reduction is a function of the square of the wind speed so therefore it's  
**0:56:18-0:56:23:**  far better for newborn lands if we get adverse conditions they're going to be more protected  
**0:56:23-0:56:30:**  and get a higher survival rate the last two years we've averaged 150% landing percentages  
**0:56:30-0:56:36:**  from our flock and we think that the shade and shelter helps as well as other factors  
**0:56:36-0:56:42:**  of change management and different bruising different pastures but we think that the protection  
**0:56:42-0:56:51:**  from the plantation where the trees is certainly beneficial for us in that as well so there  
**0:56:51-0:56:57:**  are all these little bits of additive values and collectively they're significant we think  
**0:56:57-0:57:02:**  and then you have the improved value of the property over time as well because of the  
**0:57:02-0:57:07:**  aesthetics and the risk management strategy that we've evolved on this farm.  
**0:57:07-0:57:13:**  I think one of the main things a lot of people don't talk about too is when you re-vegetate  
**0:57:13-0:57:19:**  your farm it's a much better place to live in so I think there's a lot of discussion  
**0:57:19-0:57:28:**  around a lot of the other benefits but over here I don't know what it's like over where  
**0:57:28-0:57:34:**  you are but there is a lot of problem with farmer depression over here particularly when  
**0:57:34-0:57:41:**  times are really tough with droughts and things like that and if you've got a really barren  
**0:57:41-0:57:48:**  wind swept sun baked landscape to go out into the works of the day it can be pretty depressing  
**0:57:48-0:57:53:**  whereas we can go out and if we're out doing work and it's really hot we can get ourselves  
**0:57:53-0:57:58:**  under a tree and get a bit of shade if it's really windy we can get behind a plantation  
**0:57:58-0:58:03:**  and get out of the freezing cold wind in winter or the driving rain we can get under a tree  
**0:58:03-0:58:10:**  or behind a plantation so it makes the quality of our working life on the farm a lot better  
**0:58:10-0:58:15:**  as well and it's just lovely working on a farm that's so beautiful you go out into the  
**0:58:15-0:58:20:**  paddock there's lots of trees there's flowers and whatever else but it's a beautiful place  
**0:58:20-0:58:26:**  to be and we get enormous amounts of comments about that from people that come and visit  
**0:58:26-0:58:32:**  the farm and just say you know it's oh there's lots of people say it's like a park so you  
**0:58:32-0:58:38:**  know just having a really nice environment to work in is a really big thing you can't  
**0:58:38-0:58:45:**  really place an economic factor on it but you certainly can place an emotional and emotional  
**0:58:45-0:58:52:**  one on so in a sense i don't know if you received help financial help for the plantation etc  
**0:58:52-0:58:57:**  but based on your position right now and your experience right now you wouldn't hesitate  
**0:58:57-0:59:05:**  to invest yourself in tree planting and riparian buffers shelter belts windbreaks etc this  
**0:59:05-0:59:10:**  is a decision as farmers that you think should be it can be justified you know can be paid  
**0:59:10-0:59:18:**  for by the farmer himself and can be justified in your context that's correct and and i think  
**0:59:18-0:59:23:**  there's been a been a and you mentioned before there's been a danger about um governments  
**0:59:23-0:59:29:**  giving our subsidies for trees and tree guards and uh sometimes that land care approach can  
**0:59:29-0:59:35:**  then help in the sort of welfare estate mentality where farmers will only plant when they get  
**0:59:35-0:59:41:**  a subsidy so we've taken the view over the last 30 years it will make an annual notation  
**0:59:41-0:59:46:**  in our budget for tree planting and we'll do that each year and we still do it we're  
**0:59:46-0:59:51:**  doing um we're doing habitat enrichment now and that will that will you know just that's  
**0:59:51-0:59:56:**  likely you need to have an annual budget for fencing we'll have an annual budget for planting  
**0:59:56-1:00:02:**  trees and and our economics we can justify that because we think it's important in terms  
**1:00:02-1:00:09:**  of um you know how we encourage people to plant trees i suppose that with the Otleaga  
**1:00:09-1:00:13:**  Forestry Network that Rowan and I have been involved with and we now have over 200 members  
**1:00:13-1:00:21:**  and we've been going since 1993 our philosophy is to is to focus on the community capacity  
**1:00:21-1:00:29:**  building the networking and giving farmers confidence and knowledge and share information  
**1:00:29-1:00:34:**  and have field days and we do peer group mentoring and Rowan involved the Master Tree Gower program  
**1:00:34-1:00:42:**  we've worked with that and so that all that any funding we get is all about if you like  
**1:00:42-1:00:49:**  working with the the software of the whole program and not the hardware and so if if  
**1:00:49-1:00:54:**  we put the farmer at the center of the decision making so they have ownership of the decision  
**1:00:54-1:00:57:**  to plant a tree they're the ones who know where they should the trees should go and  
**1:00:57-1:01:05:**  surround that farmer with you know community capacity building and good networking and  
**1:01:05-1:01:10:**  and good information good science come into that with the programs that i was just talking  
**1:01:10-1:01:16:**  about that you've got a better chance in the long term of coming up with a a program which  
**1:01:16-1:01:23:**  is going to be more robust and resilient in the future because the farmers will take ownership  
**1:01:23-1:01:28:**  of what they're doing and start off small and build their confidence and we think that's  
**1:01:28-1:01:34:**  probably the best way that's how governments should better spend their money to try and  
**1:01:34-1:01:41:**  stimulate activity and interest in these sorts of projects you know i've i'm i find that  
**1:01:41-1:01:46:**  a really fascinating approach because i've already been involved for example in switzerland  
**1:01:46-1:01:49:**  maybe listeners can will get bored of this because i think i've already mentioned this  
**1:01:49-1:01:55:**  before but um i i've gotten i've been involved with plantation of agroforestry systems funded  
**1:01:55-1:02:01:**  by the government and they basically sell a model so you have to plant this species  
**1:02:01-1:02:08:**  in this spacing um and with you know this kind of format they they have a very strict  
**1:02:08-1:02:12:**  kind of model to plant agroforestry or what they call agroforestry i wouldn't even call  
**1:02:12-1:02:17:**  it agroforestry and then so they they go out and the farmers take out some very productive  
**1:02:17-1:02:23:**  land um which already there's not a lot of in switzerland um because it's all mountains  
**1:02:23-1:02:27:**  so they take out this very productive land in the plains and they plant these these these  
**1:02:27-1:02:33:**  basically a mix of fruit trees um that are in french we call them longtage so they're  
**1:02:33-1:02:37:**  like you know tall fruit trees on vigorous root stocks they'll take years to produce  
**1:02:37-1:02:42:**  they'll be very hard to harvest it's not a fruit tortured really nor is it a silver pastoral  
**1:02:42-1:02:46:**  system because the grass is underneath but i think they'll you know often these farmers  
**1:02:46-1:02:49:**  they're not cut they're not actually they don't have sheep or cattle they're often tree  
**1:02:49-1:02:53:**  farmers and and grain crop farmers and then the government is going to pay them every  
**1:02:53-1:02:59:**  year per tree something like 130 swiss francs every year for 10 years and then after 10  
**1:02:59-1:03:02:**  years you know we were talking a lot with different farmers that are very critical of  
**1:03:02-1:03:06:**  this technique and they were saying well they're probably just going to rip the trees out and  
**1:03:06-1:03:11:**  that's like an approach to funded agroforestry which goes which i think is if i understand  
**1:03:11-1:03:16:**  correctly is the complete opposite of what you're doing in the ottway agroforestry network  
**1:03:16-1:03:20:**  which is you know how to how do you empower farmers into making decisions around trees  
**1:03:20-1:03:24:**  that will actually contribute to their farm into their business and to their lifestyle  
**1:03:24-1:03:30:**  as well right it's so that's quite extreme every farm is going to be different isn't  
**1:03:30-1:03:35:**  it because um you know the farmers have a different production system and landscapes  
**1:03:35-1:03:41:**  different topography and different objectives so it's about those farmers working how can  
**1:03:41-1:03:46:**  they best fit trees into their system to support their production system and you get all these  
**1:03:46-1:03:51:**  other values coming from it and what we found here is that some of the areas where we've  
**1:03:51-1:03:57:**  planted out such as along the riparian zones where there's been erosion you know bad for  
**1:03:57-1:04:02:**  agriculture but fantastic for trees and a lot of those places are low in the landscape  
**1:04:02-1:04:07:**  moisture concentration nutrient concentration a better wind protection as they're low in  
**1:04:07-1:04:12:**  the landscape and great place for trees and a bad place for agriculture so try and get  
**1:04:12-1:04:19:**  that matching going and you know most farms you can have five or ten or fifteen percent  
**1:04:19-1:04:24:**  trees on the property in our case really up to twenty percent without compromising a traditional  
**1:04:24-1:04:28:**  agricultural system and so you're still getting a production but you're getting these other  
**1:04:28-1:04:31:**  values and you're putting the trees where you want to put them where you think they  
**1:04:31-1:04:36:**  should go and that's the exciting part about it and then think of the diversity you can  
**1:04:36-1:04:42:**  build into the system get all these other values from it and some productive trees also  
**1:04:42-1:04:47:**  so overall this approach is taken throughout the world we'd end up with better connected  
**1:04:47-1:04:55:**  landscapes and more productive and more biodiversity and probably happier farmers.  
**1:04:55-1:04:59:**  I mean in the past ten minutes you came out with some pretty incredible statements such  
**1:04:59-1:05:05:**  as the trees have enabled you to have a carbon actually positive farm you've also gone from  
**1:05:05-1:05:10:**  three to twenty percent recovery and has not reduced your traditional crop production this  
**1:05:10-1:05:15:**  is these are some big statements here that I hope the listeners are not taking lightly  
**1:05:15-1:05:20:**  because this is some serious achievements and also some serious feedback from the field  
**1:05:20-1:05:27:**  from 30 years of experience actually doing it you know this is happening in reality it's  
**1:05:27-1:05:33:**  not just you know some studies or in a book or some theories so that's for me when I was  
**1:05:33-1:05:38:**  reading the documentation you provided I really jumped out and I was really quite impressed  
**1:05:38-1:05:43:**  and one of the things actually that came up when thinking about this you know that maintaining  
**1:05:43-1:05:48:**  this this productivity of course we're talking about suddenly we're talking about tree and  
**1:05:48-1:05:53:**  grass interactions and in agroforestry we're often trying to understand you know how do  
**1:05:53-1:05:57:**  these interact especially with eucalyptuses for example which in Europe at least are considered  
**1:05:57-1:06:02:**  to be you know everybody is scared of eucalyptuses everybody says you know eucalyptus will suck  
**1:06:02-1:06:06:**  up all the moisture from the land and and nothing grows under eucalyptus and I don't  
**1:06:06-1:06:10:**  really have a strong opinion about that because I've seen both cases happen where things were  
**1:06:10-1:06:16:**  fine and things weren't fine so but my you know I'm curious as to how what you've observed  
**1:06:16-1:06:22:**  in terms of you know pasture and shelter belt interactions do you see the grass greener  
**1:06:22-1:06:28:**  more productive less productive does it dry out sooner what's your experience with this  
**1:06:28-1:06:34:**  with this interaction yeah we certainly have noticed the eucalypts do don't promote growth  
**1:06:34-1:06:39:**  underneath them but what we've found is is around the edges of the paddocks where we've  
**1:06:39-1:06:46:**  put plantations and you've got a lack of pasture and close to the to the base of the trees  
**1:06:46-1:06:52:**  up to the fence we've used that as a vehicle runway so rather than driving across our pasture  
**1:06:52-1:06:57:**  which you shouldn't really do for compaction reasons you can drive around the edge and  
**1:06:57-1:07:01:**  not only that it's in winter it's sucking up the water and it means we can actually  
**1:07:01-1:07:05:**  get around there whereas we may not be able to get across the paddock we'll get ourselves  
**1:07:05-1:07:09:**  bulged because it's too wet so we can go around the edge we know the trees have sucked up  
**1:07:09-1:07:13:**  a bit of that moisture there's not a lot of pasture there so we're not compacting that  
**1:07:13-1:07:20:**  but we are finding that because you do get a slowing down of the wind the pasture further  
**1:07:20-1:07:26:**  out actually will often grow better and because you're not getting that wind chill factor  
**1:07:26-1:07:34:**  as much on the pasture and that slows down growth obviously when it's cooler and the  
**1:07:34-1:07:40:**  other one was so just a second joe when you say the pasture further out what do you mean  
**1:07:40-1:07:46:**  i'm a bit confused i mean the pasture that's closer to the trees after the road so if you've  
**1:07:46-1:07:53:**  if you've got a line of trees along a long a plantation in a paddock and then you've  
**1:07:53-1:07:59:**  got your fence next to next to your tree plantation and then just out from the fence for you know  
**1:07:59-1:08:05:**  maybe five to ten meters it'll be quite dry and there won't be much pasture if it's a  
**1:08:05-1:08:10:**  eucalypt plantation that you've got there because they don't that they're they're allopathic  
**1:08:10-1:08:15:**  to growth underneath them so they don't not much grows underneath them but what we've  
**1:08:15-1:08:21:**  done is instead of looking that as a negative we haven't got much pasture growth there we've  
**1:08:21-1:08:25:**  said okay well we can use that as a vehicle track and we can get we can get through there  
**1:08:25-1:08:28:**  in wet weather because we know it won't be as wet there because those trees have sucked  
**1:08:28-1:08:34:**  up a lot of that moisture but then further out into the paddock from that you'll often  
**1:08:34-1:08:39:**  get better growth because you've got a slowing down of the wind particularly really cool  
**1:08:39-1:08:45:**  wind in winter and that that will promote better growth because the ground and the pasture  
**1:08:45-1:08:52:**  and the soil is not getting as cold from cold winds and I mean and certainly also with you  
**1:08:52-1:09:00:**  know lambing and that sort of thing so I mean that's certainly something that we've found  
**1:09:00-1:09:06:**  with the other thing we've also found is people we have quite a few people say to us are you  
**1:09:06-1:09:09:**  growing all those trees you end up all the limbs over the fence well if you're doing  
**1:09:09-1:09:13:**  agroforestry and you're high pruning those trees that are against the fence you don't  
**1:09:13-1:09:17:**  end up with limb damage on your fences so that sort of makes a difference I mean obviously  
**1:09:17-1:09:20:**  where we're not doing that high pruning that's not happening we do get limb damage on the  
**1:09:20-1:09:27:**  fences that we have to clean up but agroforestry plantations certainly don't get that damage  
**1:09:27-1:09:33:**  and it does provide cover for foxes to move through and and kangaroos and kangaroo numbers  
**1:09:33-1:09:44:**  are getting fairly out of hand over here at the moment so but yeah we don't really look  
**1:09:44-1:09:48:**  at that as being a negative but it certainly it certainly does make us look into looking  
**1:09:48-1:09:54:**  at other species for some of our agroforestry that maybe do grow pasture further up against  
**1:09:54-1:09:58:**  underneath depending on where they've been planted on the farm one of those is silky  
**1:09:58-1:10:02:**  oak that'll we've been planting quite a lot of silky oak and that lets pasture grow right  
**1:10:02-1:10:07:**  up to underneath but of course your trees when you plant your trees in a plantation  
**1:10:07-1:10:11:**  there's always a certain distance back from the fence anyway where you've got your fence  
**1:10:11-1:10:16:**  so if you don't have pasture there it doesn't matter that's inside the plantation so it's  
**1:10:16-1:10:20:**  probably better for weed control it's just the bit that you've got outside that fence  
**1:10:20-1:10:26:**  in your paddock where you're not getting much growth but you know we've we haven't really  
**1:10:26-1:10:34:**  found that to be too much of a detriment just on the point of competition the um i think  
**1:10:34-1:10:40:**  this is where we need more research to to find out some of these answers um so as you  
**1:10:40-1:10:45:**  all said it is that competition zone it's there has been quite a bit of research in  
**1:10:45-1:10:52:**  cropping systems you know to look at the micro environmental differences of a crop which  
**1:10:52-1:11:00:**  has been protected by trees and one which hasn't where you have less drying more humidity  
**1:11:00-1:11:09:**  built up more protection and what has been found there there's some results show how  
**1:11:09-1:11:14:**  after you take out the competition zone for the trees and you look at the increased growth  
**1:11:14-1:11:20:**  further out like Jill was saying which has been measured that overall you know there  
**1:11:20-1:11:28:**  is an increased production further out from the trees and that the balance is that there  
**1:11:28-1:11:34:**  is actually more crop if you have appropriately designed plantations but in pasture systems  
**1:11:34-1:11:41:**  i haven't seen any research which verifies this and but i guess our gut feel is that  
**1:11:41-1:11:48:**  it probably is happening and then if you look at our system where we're now producing as  
**1:11:48-1:11:56:**  much agricultural production as we were when we had like when we had three percent woody  
**1:11:56-1:12:02:**  vegetation compared to now we've got say 18 to 20 percent woody vegetation we we haven't  
**1:12:02-1:12:08:**  reduced our agricultural output but there have been other factors there so so obviously  
**1:12:08-1:12:14:**  the sheep must still be getting the same amount of feed otherwise we wouldn't have the same  
**1:12:14-1:12:20:**  production but there have been other differences as well in this discussion because we've changed  
**1:12:20-1:12:30:**  our grazing style we changed some of the grazing species and so and now we're doing a self-replacing  
**1:12:30-1:12:37:**  flock whereas we used to buy it by a bin so there there have been other management changes  
**1:12:37-1:12:43:**  along with this so it's hard to pull out those variables to say which is the which are the  
**1:12:43-1:12:49:**  major cause of agents for the changes or will maintain the status quo for for the grazing  
**1:12:49-1:12:57:**  system so it's an area where i think that more searches more research is required yeah  
**1:12:57-1:13:04:**  yeah that's very interesting currently reading lots of papers on on on these interactions  
**1:13:04-1:13:09:**  as part of a master's degree that i'm doing and it's you know one of the things that comes  
**1:13:09-1:13:16:**  out is is it's i mean it changes from species to species from soil type to soil type from  
**1:13:16-1:13:21:**  context to context from season to season as well it's not so it's not always so clear  
**1:13:21-1:13:28:**  yeah the different climate and so on and that's quite true because here we we we can get very  
**1:13:28-1:13:36:**  cold strong winds southwesterly winds and where the trees we think are a great benefit  
**1:13:36-1:13:41:**  for sheltering the sheep but in other areas they wouldn't get that so if we measured ours  
**1:13:41-1:13:44:**  it might be different to another environment that's the sort of thing you're pointing out  
**1:13:44-1:13:49:**  i think and also the style of the shelter belt you know how what's the porosity of the  
**1:13:49-1:13:53:**  shelter belt how tall is the shelter belt you know there are a lot of variables involved  
**1:13:53-1:13:58:**  in this it's hard to tease out those variables but you know i suppose get back to our point  
**1:13:58-1:14:03:**  that we're still producing what we used to produce and and that's an indicator but it  
**1:14:03-1:14:09:**  doesn't tell the whole story and that's what you're saying and i agree with you i suppose  
**1:14:09-1:14:15:**  one thing that we could say is that we've we've got um far more choice with our lambing  
**1:14:15-1:14:20:**  paddocks now than we used to we you know there was some of our lambing paddocks where they  
**1:14:20-1:14:24:**  were really quite exposed and we and we often wouldn't lamb down in there because of that  
**1:14:24-1:14:29:**  so now we've got more choice over the whole farm as to where we can lamb down because  
**1:14:29-1:14:34:**  we've got better protection over the whole farm the last kind of small questions that  
**1:14:34-1:14:40:**  i i had um was about tree planting it's something that you know you've planted 50 000 trees  
**1:14:40-1:14:45:**  that's a lot of experience as compared to other people and i had a bit of a question  
**1:14:45-1:14:50:**  as to how you manage the weeds so how do you ensure that after the the tree is planted  
**1:14:50-1:14:55:**  and you established it how do you make sure that they're you know you're not managing  
**1:14:55-1:15:00:**  you're not weeding by hand some 50 000 trees or however it is that per year that you're  
**1:15:00-1:15:08:**  planting well most of our trees have been established with um weed control chemicals  
**1:15:08-1:15:14:**  so we've had a knockdown and a residual okay over time and um and sometimes we've gone  
**1:15:14-1:15:21:**  back and uh and have done the second round of weed control and that's about it and then  
**1:15:21-1:15:28:**  we just once we've had good weed control for 18 months we just let them go but now we're  
**1:15:28-1:15:33:**  trying to use other techniques that's i don't have to use chemical using weed mat and we're  
**1:15:33-1:15:39:**  experimenting with different ways of doing that now so that's probably it in a nutshell  
**1:15:39-1:15:45:**  it's it's more labor intensive certainly though when you don't use the chemical um you know  
**1:15:45-1:15:52:**  we're having to dig dig away an area and then put a weed mat down plant into that and then  
**1:15:52-1:15:57:**  we're having to put um you know wire holders around the edge of the weed mat so it just  
**1:15:57-1:16:02:**  doesn't get pushed up with the weed so it is it is more time consuming but we like the  
**1:16:02-1:16:08:**  fact we're not using roundup that makes sense but also the the challenge of the efficiency  
**1:16:08-1:16:14:**  there is huge yeah it is it's much quicker you can get a lot more trees than if you're  
**1:16:14-1:16:19:**  using a sprayed and if you're using weed matting but i mean we we're we're sort of to the stage  
**1:16:19-1:16:23:**  now where we're not planting huge amounts of trees like we were we're planting thousands  
**1:16:23-1:16:29:**  per year because now we're putting in you know hundreds per year so so i suppose we've  
**1:16:29-1:16:33:**  got a little bit more time we've got lots of people turn up to help so we you know we  
**1:16:33-1:16:39:**  have crews we have someone putting in putting on milk cartons we have someone digging away  
**1:16:39-1:16:43:**  the the grass and stuff and then someone putting the weed mat down and someone putting the  
**1:16:43-1:16:47:**  wires and so you've got lots of people there and you know you can do it and it is it is  
**1:16:47-1:16:51:**  nice to know we're not using that chemical anymore because it's you know it's not not  
**1:16:51-1:17:00:**  got a good good um what do you call it you know what roundup's not not got a good reputation  
**1:17:00-1:17:05:**  at the moment and it's it's but it's a short-term cost for a long-term benefit as well if you  
**1:17:05-1:17:09:**  look at the cost benefit we can go without it that's great but if we look at you know  
**1:17:09-1:17:15:**  being able to plant more trees and just use it once or twice it seems like it's also you  
**1:17:15-1:17:21:**  know through the lifetime of the of the tree which could be 50 years it seems like an interesting  
**1:17:21-1:17:27:**  approach as well interesting okay that's what i wanted to check with you uh on that and  
**1:17:27-1:17:30:**  just to have a bit of a of an understanding of how you manage that because it's one of  
**1:17:30-1:17:34:**  the biggest management problems that we come across it's how to manage the weeds after  
**1:17:34-1:17:39:**  the trees are in it's quite it's much easier to get a tree in than it is to to manage to  
**1:17:39-1:17:42:**  make sure that it survives and to and to you know make sure that the weeds don't overcome  
**1:17:42-1:17:50:**  it so so that's fantastic um i really it was a fascinating conversation um extremely interesting  
**1:17:50-1:17:55:**  we talked about some some some some yeah you brought up some great elements to the conversation  
**1:17:55-1:18:01:**  really contributing to our our understanding of agroforestry over here so a huge thank  
**1:18:01-1:18:06:**  you okay thanks for taking interest in our project Dimitri i think it's a wonderful thing  
**1:18:06-1:18:12:**  with the communication that we can talk to you when you're uh over in Portugal there  
**1:18:12-1:18:19:**  and um and it's it's great that we can you know we've shared some of your ideas and i'll  
**1:18:19-1:18:25:**  be watching um connecting with your um regenia vagroforestry program to pick up on other  
**1:18:25-1:18:29:**  interviews that you've done and we're really Jill was saying oh when we go on our holiday  
**1:18:29-1:18:35:**  we're going to play the i've seen we've got all these podcasts on Dimitri and all these  
**1:18:35-1:18:38:**  things around the world we're going to be listening to those as we're driving around  
**1:18:38-1:18:43:**  australia camping and so you're connecting with us we're connecting with you and isn't  
**1:18:43-1:18:46:**  that a fantastic thing that we can share this information and share our stories because  
**1:18:46-1:18:51:**  i know you've got some wonderful stories that in those podcasts that we're looking forward  
**1:18:51-1:18:57:**  to to hearing and uh and if we can be part of that we'll we're delighted to be part of  
**1:18:57-1:19:01:**  that as well and i will just add one other thing saying that about the carbon neutrality  
**1:19:01-1:19:11:**  is that because we're managing you know roughly half our trees for for um soil logs and for  
**1:19:11-1:19:16:**  commercial products we are trying to maximize the growth you know with spacing and species  
**1:19:16-1:19:22:**  selection and getting far more carbon sequestered in those trees which we may harvest one day  
**1:19:22-1:19:28:**  compared to a normal land care planning so therefore we're reaching carbon neutrality  
**1:19:28-1:19:34:**  at say about 18 percent of our landscape whereas if it was just all traditional land care planning  
**1:19:34-1:19:41:**  it would be a lot higher so there's another advantage of actually managing those trees  
**1:19:41-1:19:47:**  for agroforestry because even if you don't harvest them your carbon sequestration is  
**1:19:47-1:19:53:**  going to be better for the farm system and our daughter she buys lambs off us and sells  
**1:19:53-1:19:59:**  them with a special marketing program she sells a farm story with the meat and carbon  
**1:19:59-1:20:04:**  neutrality and carbon being carbon positive is one of those stories so there are those  
**1:20:04-1:20:09:**  other spin-offs in the future for our maybe our niche marketing by managing the trees  
**1:20:09-1:20:14:**  to maximize our growth and sequester more carbon and reach carbon neutrality at a lower  
**1:20:14-1:20:19:**  percentage in the landscape so that's i think an interesting point i suppose another point  
**1:20:19-1:20:26:**  to add to that too is that um actively growing trees sequester more carbon so if you're if  
**1:20:26-1:20:30:**  you are cutting down and replacing and growing all the time you're going to sequester more  
**1:20:30-1:20:36:**  carbon because you know trees reach a state where they're static and they're not absorbing  
**1:20:36-1:20:43:**  more carbon so if you've got a cycle going all the time you're absorbing more carbon  
**1:20:43-1:20:47:**  thank you so much for listening to this episode i hope you enjoy it don't hesitate to reach  
**1:20:47-1:21:14:**  out to us on social media we're waiting for you there and see you next time

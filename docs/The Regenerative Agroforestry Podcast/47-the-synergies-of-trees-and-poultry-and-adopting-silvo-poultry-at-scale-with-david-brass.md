### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:16:04)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:45:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:45-0:00:48:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:48-0:00:50:**  I'm your host Etienne.  
**0:00:50-0:00:56:**  Today I interview David Brass, the CEO of the Lakes Free Range Egg Company.  
**0:00:56-0:01:00:**  Almost 30 years ago he started planting trees in the fields to encourage his laying hens  
**0:01:00-0:01:04:**  to go and range, which makes him a pioneer in the matter.  
**0:01:04-0:01:09:**  With about 70 farmers and 2 million birds supplying eggs to his company today, this  
**0:01:09-0:01:13:**  is an example of agroforestry working at scale.  
**0:01:13-0:01:18:**  The interview brings forward both practical considerations for the layout and maintenance  
**0:01:18-0:01:22:**  of trees, as well as explains how they have scaled the tree plantations throughout their  
**0:01:22-0:01:24:**  suppliers.  
**0:01:24-0:01:29:**  David is enthusiastic about the numerous benefits of these trees that they have documented throughout  
**0:01:29-0:01:32:**  the years and various studies.  
**0:01:32-0:01:37:**  It does seem that there is a very clear case for integrating trees in all poultry production  
**0:01:37-0:01:40:**  with very limited trade-offs.  
**0:01:40-0:01:44:**  I wanted to apologize to you listeners as my English was particularly rusty for this  
**0:01:44-0:01:48:**  interview and my questions a bit fumbly at times.  
**0:01:48-0:01:50:**  I hope it will still be enjoyable to listen to.  
**0:01:50-0:01:51:**  Enjoy the episode.  
**0:01:51-0:01:54:**  Hi David, welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:54-0:01:59:**  Hello, pleased to meet you, yes, great.  
**0:01:59-0:02:07:**  Let's start by having a bit of an idea of your background and how you got to agroforestry.  
**0:02:07-0:02:08:**  Farming background really.  
**0:02:08-0:02:16:**  Started off as a farmer with chickens in the Lake District in England, north of England.  
**0:02:16-0:02:21:**  It was kind of obvious when you were farming that on lots of days the chickens weren't  
**0:02:21-0:02:22:**  going outside.  
**0:02:22-0:02:26:**  They just stayed next to the shed because it was just wide open space outside.  
**0:02:26-0:02:31:**  There would be an odd tree in the middle of a field and you would see hundreds of chickens  
**0:02:31-0:02:33:**  underneath the tree in the shade.  
**0:02:33-0:02:35:**  So we thought that they obviously liked that and we thought that they would go out and  
**0:02:35-0:02:36:**  plant a few more.  
**0:02:36-0:02:39:**  That is kind of when it started.  
**0:02:39-0:02:43:**  Back in 1997 and it has grown from them over the intervening years.  
**0:02:43-0:02:50:**  We have developed a company selling eggs that has grown to a decent sized company with another  
**0:02:50-0:02:54:**  70 or 80 farmers supplying eggs into us.  
**0:02:54-0:02:59:**  And all of those have planted trees on their ranges, again to encourage birds to go outside.  
**0:02:59-0:03:03:**  And also it is in the intervening years we have done quite a bit of science to show that  
**0:03:03-0:03:08:**  those birds, those trees are very effective at all sorts of other things as well as just  
**0:03:08-0:03:12:**  getting the birds to range outside.  
**0:03:12-0:03:16:**  Well that is a great introduction and we will make sure we go into the detail of all of  
**0:03:16-0:03:17:**  that.  
**0:03:17-0:03:22:**  Can you give us a bit more context on the company today, how you operate so we get an  
**0:03:22-0:03:28:**  idea of what scale it is at and what are your customers and how you function?  
**0:03:28-0:03:35:**  Okay, we are probably a couple of million birds supplying eggs into us now, all free  
**0:03:35-0:03:36:**  range or organic free range.  
**0:03:36-0:03:41:**  We are a specialist organic free range egg supply company now.  
**0:03:41-0:03:48:**  And those farms, 73 or 4 farms are contracted to us to supply eggs into our packing centre.  
**0:03:48-0:03:51:**  We pack them here probably a million eggs a day, something like that, a million and  
**0:03:51-0:03:52:**  a half eggs a day.  
**0:03:52-0:03:57:**  Put them into retail packs and sell them out to various retail companies in the UK or food  
**0:03:57-0:04:01:**  service companies in the UK.  
**0:04:01-0:04:08:**  Specifically those with fairly high requirements for things like woodland planting or range  
**0:04:08-0:04:10:**  enrichment or bird welfare.  
**0:04:10-0:04:16:**  So you mentioned earlier on that the initial reason why you started thinking about birds  
**0:04:16-0:04:21:**  about including trees with birds was the fact that they weren't necessarily going out much  
**0:04:21-0:04:25:**  and that you wanted them to colonise the space more effectively.  
**0:04:25-0:04:26:**  How did you get the idea?  
**0:04:26-0:04:30:**  Were you working with an organisation at the time or were other people already putting  
**0:04:30-0:04:35:**  in trees for poultry to be roaming further away from the buildings?  
**0:04:35-0:04:38:**  No, at that time there was nobody in the UK that was doing that.  
**0:04:38-0:04:47:**  We were the first to do that back in 1997, others have followed since because it became  
**0:04:47-0:04:49:**  a good idea.  
**0:04:49-0:04:52:**  It was just reputationary.  
**0:04:52-0:04:57:**  We are a reputation as a free range, one of the largest specialist free range egg companies  
**0:04:57-0:05:02:**  in the UK and to be not having birds going outside just didn't seem right so we looked  
**0:05:02-0:05:06:**  everywhere we possibly could to encourage them to go out.  
**0:05:06-0:05:12:**  And that's really where the journey started and at that time there was a charity in the  
**0:05:12-0:05:16:**  UK called the Fwag Farm Wildlife Advisory Group and they had advisors who would come  
**0:05:16-0:05:19:**  on to farm and advise what trees you should be planting and how you should be planting  
**0:05:19-0:05:20:**  them.  
**0:05:20-0:05:27:**  So there was a chap called Paul Arkel who worked for that group at the time.  
**0:05:27-0:05:32:**  They've since packed up and he set his own company up as an environmental consultant  
**0:05:32-0:05:35:**  so he still used Paul.  
**0:05:35-0:05:38:**  To be honest the first couple of years were a disaster.  
**0:05:38-0:05:42:**  We planted two or three hectares of trees for the chickens and it was just the wrong  
**0:05:42-0:05:45:**  sort of trees, the wrong sort of planting.  
**0:05:45-0:05:53:**  It's been a 25 year journey that every single year we learn something new, we change things,  
**0:05:53-0:05:58:**  we adapt things, we make them easier to look after trees, make it more sensible so farmers  
**0:05:58-0:06:02:**  will because if it involves a lot of work and expense it very quickly gets to be something  
**0:06:02-0:06:05:**  they don't want to do.  
**0:06:05-0:06:10:**  So that's been a journey that's developed over the years and it's got quite complex  
**0:06:10-0:06:13:**  and very structured now but works really well.  
**0:06:13-0:06:19:**  You know it's things like the first planting we planted in the UK was to UK Forestry Commission  
**0:06:19-0:06:26:**  standards which is random two metre spacings and they're impossible to look after.  
**0:06:26-0:06:29:**  If you do that on moorland where the undergrowth doesn't grow particularly quickly that's fine  
**0:06:29-0:06:34:**  but if you do it on grade 3 agricultural land the grass grows and swamps the trees so you  
**0:06:34-0:06:38:**  have to cut it every year but of course with random spacing the only way you can cut it  
**0:06:38-0:06:42:**  is to get there with a strimmer and strim it which is really hard work so people don't  
**0:06:42-0:06:43:**  want to do it.  
**0:06:43-0:06:50:**  So after the first couple of years we started to plant them in rows so the rows will follow  
**0:06:50-0:06:53:**  the contours of the hillside or the contours around the poultry shed so they're not straight  
**0:06:53-0:06:58:**  rows so they don't look like soldiers, they look like normal woodland but we plant the  
**0:06:58-0:07:02:**  rows 4 metres apart and the trees 2 metres within the rows and that means that you can  
**0:07:02-0:07:10:**  drive up and down with your tractor and the topper on the back to cut the grass and it's  
**0:07:10-0:07:13:**  not too much like hard work so people are quite happy to do that.  
**0:07:13-0:07:16:**  It's much easier to sit in an air conditioned cab and do that to look after the trees than  
**0:07:16-0:07:22:**  it is to be out on your feet with a strimmer and so it's things like that that we developed  
**0:07:22-0:07:25:**  over the years and those spacings we kind of developed to get cover still as rapidly  
**0:07:25-0:07:34:**  as possible but make it possible to mechanically weed them and then it's again we started planting  
**0:07:34-0:07:36:**  things like 20% fast growing.  
**0:07:36-0:07:42:**  The planting plan usually is just look around the area and see what's growing well in the  
**0:07:42-0:07:43:**  area and then just copy that.  
**0:07:43-0:07:48:**  In this particular case here it's usually upland, limestone, woodland which is largely  
**0:07:48-0:07:53:**  ash based but lots of others there's hollies and field maple, silver birch, aspen that  
**0:07:53-0:07:59:**  sort of thing really but at the same time we plant 20% fast growers because you want  
**0:07:59-0:08:04:**  the cover of the chickens quickly so we use hybrid willow and poplar as the fast growing  
**0:08:04-0:08:09:**  species to get cover really quickly and it encourages the smaller or the slower growing  
**0:08:09-0:08:16:**  trees to grow better as well and then you discover that farmers aren't looking after  
**0:08:16-0:08:17:**  them properly.  
**0:08:17-0:08:19:**  You make the mistake and everybody makes the mistake because it's a farmer they think it's  
**0:08:19-0:08:25:**  a forester and they're not it's a different skill set and we very quickly found that they  
**0:08:25-0:08:30:**  let the sheep in and the sheep would take all the bark off the trees and they die or  
**0:08:30-0:08:36:**  the cattle get in or the horse gets in and knocks them over that sort of thing so there's  
**0:08:36-0:08:40:**  a skill to thinning them out and beating them up when they die and that type of thing so  
**0:08:40-0:08:46:**  every year Paul now goes around technically it's an audit to audit the tree planting on  
**0:08:46-0:08:51:**  all our farms our supply farms but actually he's really going for is he gets a couple  
**0:08:51-0:08:57:**  of hours of the sole attention of the farmer so when he's walking around those trees he  
**0:08:57-0:09:00:**  can say you need to be thinning these ones out or you need to be tripping the branches  
**0:09:00-0:09:06:**  off the bottom of the trees and this is how we do it so the you know prime example of  
**0:09:06-0:09:10:**  that I guess was I went to a farm on Danes you need to take at least 50% of these trees  
**0:09:10-0:09:13:**  out they're thinning they're too dense we need to get some sunlight into the base of  
**0:09:13-0:09:19:**  the canopy off I went come back a month later to the same farm and the guy had chopped down  
**0:09:19-0:09:27:**  all the oaks and valuable species for biodiversity and left all the poplars and willow and it  
**0:09:27-0:09:30:**  wasn't his fault he just thought well I'm leaving the ones that's growing really well  
**0:09:30-0:09:36:**  and chopping down the ones that aren't but totally the wrong ending so hence Paul goes  
**0:09:36-0:09:40:**  around now and say thin those ones out that one that one that one and actually spray marks  
**0:09:40-0:09:44:**  the trees that sort of thing really so it's developed as a relationship as we've gone  
**0:09:44-0:09:45:**  along.  
**0:09:45-0:09:50:**  There's actually a lot of really interesting things to go into and what you've just said  
**0:09:50-0:09:53:**  one of the things I wanted to bounce back on though is the choice of species because  
**0:09:53-0:09:57:**  you mentioned that you got it really wrong in the beginning and now you seem to have  
**0:09:57-0:10:02:**  quite I wouldn't say elaborate but like a very you know good plan with the succession  
**0:10:02-0:10:07:**  of different types of species and some destined to stay long term yeah could you tell us a  
**0:10:07-0:10:13:**  bit more about what mistakes you made initially and how you bounced back and yeah the design  
**0:10:13-0:10:15:**  now nowadays.  
**0:10:15-0:10:21:**  The first plan is we did were funded by the forestry commission in the UK which is very  
**0:10:21-0:10:26:**  much based towards commercial timber so you're planting commercial timber species because  
**0:10:26-0:10:29:**  that's what the grant funding came for and actually when you looked at it wasn't suitable  
**0:10:29-0:10:33:**  for what we were wanting really.  
**0:10:33-0:10:37:**  We are much more valued towards this than the whole we're in a high animal welfare production  
**0:10:37-0:10:43:**  system with free range poultry so you really need to go out on with your biodiversity benefits  
**0:10:43-0:10:46:**  of what you're doing and that's native species local to the area because that's what the  
**0:10:46-0:10:52:**  local biodiversity wants so gradually over the years the way that those species have  
**0:10:52-0:10:56:**  been planted and the mix of them has changed and also we either we have we take we have  
**0:10:56-0:11:01:**  farms in Shropshire which is in the Midlands of the UK and farms up in Scotland in fairly  
**0:11:01-0:11:07:**  high levels so and some in Cumbrey which is where I'm based right on the seashore where  
**0:11:07-0:11:13:**  it's just pure sand up to Limestone Mountains so there's quite a quite a diversity of what  
**0:11:13-0:11:21:**  we what we plant there's no wrong tree to be fair we have an odd farmer that plants  
**0:11:21-0:11:26:**  apple trees because he wanted to have a little bit of agroforestry and make ciders as a sideline  
**0:11:26-0:11:31:**  so he does that it still suits the chickens and we're not going to die die in a ditch  
**0:11:31-0:11:37:**  over what type of trees people want to plant we suggest and then if they want to do something  
**0:11:37-0:11:40:**  else fine.  
**0:11:40-0:11:44:**  It's interesting because that was one of the questions I wanted to think through with you  
**0:11:44-0:11:50:**  I know that in your case you've gone for like essentially wild trees mainly for their ecosystem  
**0:11:50-0:11:57:**  services to your operation but I wanted to ask you with your knowledge of how poultry  
**0:11:57-0:12:02:**  functions would you find that realistic for people to include productive trees let's say  
**0:12:02-0:12:06:**  you know maybe not in your climate but in France it could be walnuts it could be different  
**0:12:06-0:12:10:**  nuts do you see that as something potentially interesting or do you kind of think well that's  
**0:12:10-0:12:15:**  a bit too complicated and at the end of the day it's already complex enough to be farming  
**0:12:15-0:12:16:**  poultry you know?  
**0:12:16-0:12:23:**  Oh no no no no almost any tree is a good tree and I think most people phrase nowadays right  
**0:12:23-0:12:28:**  tree right place and I think that's absolutely fair if people want to plant walnuts actually  
**0:12:28-0:12:34:**  have a sideline that they're very good at keeping flies away from poultry units apparently  
**0:12:34-0:12:38:**  so that the story goes so that they could be useful around poultry sheds just to keep  
**0:12:38-0:12:46:**  the flies down which you can get problems sometimes in summer with flies and neighbours.  
**0:12:46-0:12:51:**  Then the only ones that I've ever come across the obvious ones like you you have to be a  
**0:12:51-0:12:57:**  bit careful about and a lot of the willows you have to be a little bit careful of we  
**0:12:57-0:13:01:**  plant hybrid willow but it's quite quickly probably within 10 years that we fell it out  
**0:13:01-0:13:05:**  and you have to be careful what you do with those branches when you fell them because  
**0:13:05-0:13:10:**  willow has a lot of willow species have quite high oxalic acid content aspirin effectively  
**0:13:10-0:13:16:**  they have a source of aspirin but the oxalic acid will burn if hens eat too much of it  
**0:13:16-0:13:20:**  will burn their tongue and so they won't eat after that so they can starve because they  
**0:13:20-0:13:23:**  can't eat because they've got to so you have to be a little bit careful with somebody it's  
**0:13:23-0:13:30:**  very very few the vast majority of species you can use and like I said earlier it's it's  
**0:13:30-0:13:36:**  been a journey and very early on it was Forestry Commission then it was what actually grows  
**0:13:36-0:13:40:**  in the native local area and some of the work that we've done quite a bit of science and  
**0:13:40-0:13:45:**  research over the years on the benefits to poultry the benefits to biodiversity and what  
**0:13:45-0:13:48:**  it did show was you plant native species in their area and they're very good at linking  
**0:13:48-0:13:53:**  other areas of biodiversity it together into corridors that's that's a massively improves  
**0:13:53-0:13:58:**  the local biodiversity and then that was just looking after that how you look after the  
**0:13:58-0:14:02:**  farmers and how you advise the farmers to grow them was the next few years worth of  
**0:14:02-0:14:09:**  development and then we started looking at what would be best for for customers in the  
**0:14:09-0:14:17:**  sort of mid 2005-2008 ish as to make set to their profiles as to how they want to develop  
**0:14:17-0:14:23:**  for the product and then in the last probably seven seven years I think we've gone more  
**0:14:23-0:14:30:**  down the route of sequestration and the benefits to to soil health sequestration of co2 but  
**0:14:30-0:14:36:**  particularly ammonia they're very good at trees absorbing ammonia and poultry and it's  
**0:14:36-0:14:42:**  not just poultry any intensive livestock species dairy, beef, sheep, pigs all produce lots  
**0:14:42-0:14:49:**  of ammonia that trees can take 30, 40, 50 percent of it out of the plume from the production  
**0:14:49-0:14:55:**  site without any artificial input you just let the trees get on with it and that's that's  
**0:14:55-0:15:01:**  changed the mix a little bit we didn't really want to go for pine species a bit too commercial  
**0:15:01-0:15:07:**  went away from those but actually now when you want year-round greenery we plant more  
**0:15:07-0:15:11:**  probably 15-20 percent of the plantings have pine in them so at least there's some greenery  
**0:15:11-0:15:16:**  leaf area to absorb ammonia year-round and it's interesting we've just just finished  
**0:15:16-0:15:21:**  a it's the ART project it's called it's publicly published by Natural England in the UK so  
**0:15:21-0:15:27:**  it was government funded ammonia reduction from trees the ART project for quite a few  
**0:15:27-0:15:33:**  years I tend to have a reputation in the UK poultry industry for hogging trees and bunnies  
**0:15:33-0:15:40:**  and because of all the emphasis I put on planting trees and benefits to poultry and I've been  
**0:15:40-0:15:43:**  asking for quite a few years for somebody to actually do the research because the individual  
**0:15:43-0:15:50:**  scientific research had been done by the CH I've done the scientific work in that for  
**0:15:50-0:15:54:**  deaf three years ago but hadn't done it on commercial farms and so I was to say that's  
**0:15:54-0:15:58:**  fine having the science but can we actually do it on commercial farms so then we can go  
**0:15:58-0:16:02:**  to the environment agency in the UK and say look this is what actually happens on commercial  
**0:16:02-0:16:08:**  farms with trees give us some benefit for us when you're looking at the Clean Air Act  
**0:16:08-0:16:14:**  so we did that research over the last couple of years and that was quite interesting it's  
**0:16:14-0:16:17:**  fun to do I love working with scientists on those sort of projects and put the agricultural  
**0:16:17-0:16:23:**  spin into that so that's proven our benefits to ammonia reduction over the last couple  
**0:16:23-0:16:25:**  of years which is interesting.  
**0:16:25-0:16:30:**  Because you talk about testing ideas against actually what happens on commercial farms  
**0:16:30-0:16:35:**  I know that in some more let's say small scale projects or alternative projects people have  
**0:16:35-0:16:40:**  been interested in also the contribution that trees might make to chickens diet either through  
**0:16:40-0:16:45:**  like protein rich leaves or because you have fruit you know that gets full of worms and  
**0:16:45-0:16:50:**  can be valued do you see that as like idealism do you see that could it work at scale like  
**0:16:50-0:16:52:**  what's your view on that?  
**0:16:52-0:16:55:**  It's something we haven't concentrated on there will be some input to that and they  
**0:16:55-0:16:59:**  do eat some of the apples and things if you happen to have crab apple or something in  
**0:16:59-0:17:05:**  the in the planting but it's not something we've done much research on at all.  
**0:17:05-0:17:09:**  Largely you have to be a bit careful in that you don't want to dilute the diet of the chicken  
**0:17:09-0:17:14:**  too much these guys are egg laying machines they're genetic Rolls Royces you don't want  
**0:17:14-0:17:20:**  to be diluting the diet with too much bulk because that's bad for the welfare really  
**0:17:20-0:17:23:**  they will produce eggs you can't stop them producing eggs they're egg laying machines  
**0:17:23-0:17:28:**  so if you don't feed them the correct diet that can have detrimental impacts on their  
**0:17:28-0:17:31:**  health and welfare so you have to be a little bit careful with that but they do grub around  
**0:17:31-0:17:35:**  outside if they find lots of worms and grubs and insects in the undergrowth and I think  
**0:17:35-0:17:40:**  trees probably are beneficial to that compared to open grassland.  
**0:17:40-0:17:44:**  The other topic I was wondering is just you know if we have any poultry farmers listening  
**0:17:44-0:17:50:**  to us it'd be interesting for them to understand really what that implies for the day to day  
**0:17:50-0:17:57:**  operation to include trees so let's say you're a poultry farmer and all of a sudden you believe  
**0:17:57-0:18:01:**  that you should be including trees in the for the poultry what do you see are the major  
**0:18:01-0:18:08:**  things to master in terms of skills or in terms of organization of your workloads?  
**0:18:08-0:18:13:**  To be fair once they're planted they they look after themselves chickens don't bother  
**0:18:13-0:18:18:**  them too much the ones near the shed within whenever plant trees closer than 20 meters  
**0:18:18-0:18:24:**  to the shed you don't want leaves to get in the downspouts and that sort of thing really  
**0:18:24-0:18:29:**  so you'll have an area of stone or clean area between the shed and the trees at 20 meters  
**0:18:29-0:18:33:**  then you'll plant your trees and some of them they'll dig out the hens love digging and  
**0:18:33-0:18:37:**  scratching in in the dust so some of them they will dig out so you maybe protect those  
**0:18:37-0:18:43:**  with some people note an old scrap tire around them and with plastic down to protect them  
**0:18:43-0:18:50:**  it's one of these where most people have tree guards that work reasonably well unfortunately  
**0:18:50-0:18:57:**  we still end up using plastic ones because the ones that are naturally disintegrate with  
**0:18:57-0:19:01:**  times and they're not plastic based the chickens tend to eat them very quickly they quite like  
**0:19:01-0:19:09:**  them so we haven't found a substitute for plastic as yet and then it's it's relatively  
**0:19:09-0:19:13:**  simple is beating up which maybe is a couple of days in the first year for our first or  
**0:19:13-0:19:18:**  second year then for maybe five years after that there's a little bit of thinning of the  
**0:19:18-0:19:21:**  grass between the rows but I can say you can do that with a tractor and a topper so it's  
**0:19:21-0:19:28:**  not too much of a hardship then after that there's probably every now and again half  
**0:19:28-0:19:31:**  a day two or three times a year you'll take the lower branches off the trees because you  
**0:19:31-0:19:38:**  don't want them you don't want them to be too low if you get low branches things like  
**0:19:38-0:19:42:**  hawthorn which grow very close to the ground and then the grass grows up underneath them  
**0:19:42-0:19:47:**  and you get an area where the grass has reached the base level of the trees it's nice and  
**0:19:47-0:19:51:**  dark and hence will go on legs in there so you want to keep an open space between the  
**0:19:51-0:19:56:**  bottom of the leaf canopy and the top of the grass canopy so that you don't there's this  
**0:19:56-0:20:02:**  they want legs outside which isn't a problem as long as you do that but after that you  
**0:20:02-0:20:07:**  know for the next 150 years they do it themselves it's it's brilliant really the other alternative  
**0:20:07-0:20:11:**  is to put an artificial ammonia scrubber in which uses thousands and thousands of pounds  
**0:20:11-0:20:15:**  of electric costs you tens of thousands of pounds to buy and uses sulfuric acid all the  
**0:20:15-0:20:22:**  time so you look at the options which do you go for it's a no-brainer really and on the  
**0:20:22-0:20:27:**  because you mentioned that you then started planting in lines so it means you cut the  
**0:20:27-0:20:32:**  grass between the tree lines but you just leave whatever grows between trees on the  
**0:20:32-0:20:36:**  line then because you have no way of of cutting that with a strimmer yeah okay and you don't  
**0:20:36-0:20:41:**  need to yeah you're still happy with the growth and the and the protection you don't fence  
**0:20:41-0:20:46:**  and it's just tree guards there's no systematic fencing of the tree lines or whatever you  
**0:20:46-0:20:52:**  just have the tree with a plastic tree guards and whatever few trees are damaged then you  
**0:20:52-0:20:56:**  know that's just the certain percentage and moving on that's right effectively yes we  
**0:20:56-0:21:01:**  we do fence them right around the outside with stock proof fence it to keep all the  
**0:21:01-0:21:06:**  stock out sheep and cattle that sort of thing and to maybe rotate the paddocks so you'll  
**0:21:06-0:21:11:**  have three or four paddocks outside your potage and it'll go into different ones so not all  
**0:21:11-0:21:18:**  of them are where isn't puddly all winter a kind of rain here a meter of rain here so  
**0:21:18-0:21:23:**  it can be puddly in winter so you need to rotate the paddocks yeah it's it's it's really  
**0:21:23-0:21:27:**  interesting just you know kind of concluding this this part which was really aiming to  
**0:21:27-0:21:31:**  understand how you put things into place like I was wondering what technical assistance  
**0:21:31-0:21:34:**  you'd had but actually just seems like a lot of trial and error and really building that  
**0:21:34-0:21:39:**  knowledge in the house over the last you know 25 years or I'd remember exactly how many  
**0:21:39-0:21:45:**  years it's been but yeah there's been a lot of that then the trouble it's it's a problem  
**0:21:45-0:21:49:**  with being first isn't it when there is no advice on how to look after trees and how  
**0:21:49-0:21:53:**  to plant and look after trees for poultry you have to make it up as you go along and  
**0:21:53-0:22:01:**  we had a good team there's myself Paul as well and then lately Roger my head of agriculture  
**0:22:01-0:22:06:**  and between us every year we've at the end of the season we look at how those plantings  
**0:22:06-0:22:09:**  have done what they look like what we should be doing what is the next step the next development  
**0:22:09-0:22:14:**  are we happy where we are and I don't think this but a year we haven't changed something  
**0:22:14-0:22:19:**  but we can't with I think we're kind of there now we there's this massive benefits massive  
**0:22:19-0:22:23:**  benefits you may as well utilize as many of them as possibly can where are you planting  
**0:22:23-0:22:28:**  at the moment then because I assume that on your your farm or your initial sites that  
**0:22:28-0:22:32:**  was the first place where you started planting trees those number of years ago so now are  
**0:22:32-0:22:36:**  you kind of at full capacity on the number of trees you want in the landscape you're  
**0:22:36-0:22:42:**  always developing and always changing most of the range areas is planted with about 20%  
**0:22:42-0:22:46:**  of the ranges planted with trees which is about right probably some people put more  
**0:22:46-0:22:51:**  in and we'll probably end up keeping adding to that we've changed a little bit how we  
**0:22:51-0:22:57:**  how we work in that up until six or seven years ago you the aim was that you went out  
**0:22:57-0:23:04:**  into dappled sunshine so there's a sort of shady 50% shade 50% open sunshine throughout  
**0:23:04-0:23:09:**  the tree canopy that gives you a keeps the grass growing underneath the trees rather  
**0:23:09-0:23:16:**  than just being leaf litter and also is good for invertebrates so it's by diversity point  
**0:23:16-0:23:20:**  of view it was the way to do it but in the last few years we've changed that in that  
**0:23:20-0:23:25:**  you need a dense canopy to absorb the ammonia so you don't want those open spaces because  
**0:23:25-0:23:29:**  that lets the ammonia escape without having to force it through the leaves of the trees  
**0:23:29-0:23:34:**  so what we changing now is those areas that's near to the shed within sort of 50 to 80 meters  
**0:23:34-0:23:41:**  of the shed we will keep quite dense and not thin them out too much it's a dense canopy  
**0:23:41-0:23:45:**  just raise the base by taking branches off the bottom and that's meant that without now  
**0:23:45-0:23:52:**  planting further away from the shed with the more open dappled sunny gladed type planting  
**0:23:52-0:23:55:**  in the maybe the next 50 meters outside that so that's adding quite a bit more planting  
**0:23:55-0:24:03:**  to those areas at the same time it's we still get new farms or people building new units  
**0:24:03-0:24:08:**  there's always new units to keep processing and developing and adding tree planting to  
**0:24:08-0:24:16:**  so to sum up where your design is at the moment is you leave an area around the buildings  
**0:24:16-0:24:22:**  without any trees to avoid any leaves coming in and you were saying what 20 meters or are  
**0:24:22-0:24:25:**  you extending that are you extending that now are you still putting the first trees  
**0:24:25-0:24:31:**  at 20 meters 20 meters is fine yeah okay and then you you put quite a dense layer of trees  
**0:24:31-0:24:35:**  like and that would be on how many meters for example you would have several lines of  
**0:24:35-0:24:43:**  trees very close to each other then yeah about the next 50 to 50 to 100 meters okay and that  
**0:24:43-0:24:48:**  almost becomes a woodland then yes just yes just an elevated woodland and then behind  
**0:24:48-0:24:53:**  that then you'll go back will you have also clearings without any trees or do you just  
**0:24:53-0:25:02:**  go for this dappled kind of homogenous savannah planting on the rest of the land both if people  
**0:25:02-0:25:08:**  want and to some extent on our own farms it's it's what the surroundings are we have one  
**0:25:08-0:25:20:**  particular farm that's on a on a south facing sandy slope which is very good for low intensity  
**0:25:20-0:25:24:**  grassland so wildflowers grassland it's sandy areas it's not particularly fertile hasn't  
**0:25:24-0:25:29:**  been ploughed for hundreds of years so you don't want to plant trees and a lot of that  
**0:25:29-0:25:34:**  so we tend to leave open gladed spaces with just sort of trees clumps of trees dotted  
**0:25:34-0:25:43:**  around and then others is very much 50 percent glade 50 percent shade and I was wondering  
**0:25:43-0:25:48:**  I don't know if you have issues with predators then because I know that some people have  
**0:25:48-0:25:55:**  issues with prey birds of prey here in France or any other predators do the trees change  
**0:25:55-0:26:01:**  anything on that level or not really like have you noticed any difference the main aerial  
**0:26:01-0:26:08:**  predators that we have in the UK are buzzards or red kites and they will take chickens so  
**0:26:08-0:26:16:**  by planting trees you avoid that predator but the other main predator we have is foxes  
**0:26:16-0:26:21:**  and trees are good for foxes so yes you have to on the outside of the range people tend  
**0:26:21-0:26:27:**  to plant fox-proof fences to keep keep foxes out if they can it can be a challenge but  
**0:26:27-0:26:31:**  I assume that you did that before anyway no I mean that's right if you have so it's not  
**0:26:31-0:26:36:**  really a any additional cost or whatever okay no that's interesting yeah I wanted to yeah  
**0:26:36-0:26:41:**  go a bit more into how you work with farmers because one of the topics we're interested  
**0:26:41-0:26:46:**  with Dimitri is always about scaling and in a sense that's what you've done in your own  
**0:26:46-0:26:50:**  network because you've started things on your farm and then ultimately you were mentioning  
**0:26:50-0:26:56:**  that you work with 70 to 80 farmers and I assume that takes also organization and skill  
**0:26:56-0:27:02:**  and and and I'm really interested in the process of how you're able to scale those agroforestry  
**0:27:02-0:27:06:**  plantings throughout like quite a big acreage and with a lot of different people to address  
**0:27:06-0:27:15:**  and train yeah tell us a bit more about working with your network of farmers it just takes  
**0:27:15-0:27:21:**  a while I guess Paul's very good at visiting every year that's it that's a key thing but  
**0:27:21-0:27:28:**  at the same time we as a company will provide skills to show people what a planting an ideal  
**0:27:28-0:27:32:**  planting plant for their particular farm would be in consult consultation with them of course  
**0:27:32-0:27:37:**  and it's quite interesting we we do a little bit of work with the Woodland Trust in the  
**0:27:37-0:27:43:**  UK through one of our contacts one of our retail customers and about 10 years ago the  
**0:27:43-0:27:47:**  Woodland Trust asked if we would ask our farmers some questions when Paul went around and one  
**0:27:47-0:27:53:**  of the questions was would you plant any more trees and at that time we had 62 farmers and  
**0:27:53-0:28:01:**  60 of them said no and two said yes they would at that time it was probably when there was  
**0:28:01-0:28:07:**  a lot of fairly young plantings they asked the same question last year 10 years later  
**0:28:07-0:28:12:**  and it was exactly the opposite way around 60 said they would and two said they wouldn't  
**0:28:12-0:28:19:**  which I was astonished by when you think about it they grow on people they grow on you you  
**0:28:19-0:28:26:**  walk through these trees now they're 20 30 40 feet high they have barn owls living in  
**0:28:26-0:28:33:**  them they have squirrels living in them you can walk through and see red squirrels and  
**0:28:33-0:28:36:**  it leaves you can see it leaves something and I think people understand that they're  
**0:28:36-0:28:41:**  leaving something for the future it's here for 150 years it's them that did it and that  
**0:28:41-0:28:45:**  they kind of grow on people so it's initially it was it was cajoling it was chasing it was  
**0:28:45-0:28:50:**  well you can't supply eggs to us if you haven't got them we pay them significantly more for  
**0:28:50-0:28:56:**  eggs from where they have tree planting which helps they have to look after them and they  
**0:28:56-0:29:02:**  know that but it's it's just little steps it's it's not a big we have the plan with  
**0:29:02-0:29:06:**  the plan developed we know what it is that is how you can plant them we'll supervise  
**0:29:06-0:29:12:**  the plant and we buy the trees all they've got to do is plant them and then look after  
**0:29:12-0:29:16:**  them so that that's that the deal initially is like if you're if we're gonna buy your  
**0:29:16-0:29:22:**  eggs you have to plant trees or is it we give you a premium but you don't have to no no  
**0:29:22-0:29:26:**  they have to plant trees okay that's part of the part of the contract okay yeah and  
**0:29:26-0:29:31:**  then you have now all the expertise within the company then to do the design to do the  
**0:29:31-0:29:37:**  consultation you have those skills yourself or do you work with a third party that will  
**0:29:37-0:29:41:**  do that audit and do that consulting with them yeah we still work with Paul you know  
**0:29:41-0:29:46:**  25 years down the line we still work with Paul as an independent consultant he's the  
**0:29:46-0:29:51:**  guy with the knowledge he knows where the grant funding is for funding he knows what  
**0:29:51-0:29:57:**  tree needs to go where and more especially actually what tree doesn't need to go where  
**0:29:57-0:30:02:**  we're in a very area of outstanding natural beauty very sensitive landscapes you have  
**0:30:02-0:30:05:**  to be careful where you plant trees they don't all want to go everywhere you need to think  
**0:30:05-0:30:09:**  about it and that's what I try to get over to people that actually there's no one size  
**0:30:09-0:30:14:**  fits all there's no bad tree planting as long as you have thoughts about where it should  
**0:30:14-0:30:18:**  be planted and how it should be planted okay maybe don't get if you can't plant it downwind  
**0:30:18-0:30:23:**  of the chicken shed because you've got some type of particular protected pasture land  
**0:30:23-0:30:27:**  with wildflowers down there you maybe won't get the ammonia benefits but you'll still  
**0:30:27-0:30:31:**  get the welfare benefits and production and performance benefits if you have to go upwind  
**0:30:31-0:30:36:**  you know it's not the end of the world but you just have to work with your farmers sure  
**0:30:36-0:30:42:**  and you were mentioning the grants and I guess that's one big aspect of it I wonder both  
**0:30:42-0:30:47:**  you know 25 years ago when you started planting trees and now how does the funding function  
**0:30:47-0:30:52:**  you know is that something that you managed to get fully funded by private or public grants  
**0:30:52-0:30:56:**  or is that something that your company has to invest in because it sees the value as  
**0:30:56-0:31:01:**  part of the production process initially it was forestry commission planting and then  
**0:31:01-0:31:08:**  we discovered that didn't work because of the random spacing and planting they wouldn't  
**0:31:08-0:31:13:**  go to the trees in rows type funding so we just did our own thing and accepted the fact  
**0:31:13-0:31:17:**  there was no grant funding we've done quite a bit of scientific research over the years  
**0:31:17-0:31:21:**  with an organization called the farm animal initiative which is the old Oxford university  
**0:31:21-0:31:29:**  research farm is where it's based and that's 2007-2012 there's a long term plan there with  
**0:31:29-0:31:33:**  hundreds of thousands of data points on production and performance that showed that you get better  
**0:31:33-0:31:38:**  production less mortality better feather cover better production from birds that have access  
**0:31:38-0:31:43:**  to trees so it pays for itself and so you know that sells to farmers as well once they're  
**0:31:43-0:31:49:**  planted they don't have a lot of cost and it pays for itself anyway you get less mortality  
**0:31:49-0:31:55:**  you get better drainage you get the CO2 now you get the ammonia as well so it is sellable  
**0:31:55-0:31:59:**  to farmers the grant funding like you say was forestry commission to start with and  
**0:31:59-0:32:04:**  then for years and years and years there wasn't anything that was suitable probably 2018 in  
**0:32:04-0:32:09:**  fact it was outside most European single farm payment schemes it was outside of those because  
**0:32:09-0:32:15:**  forestry isn't counted which was a downside for tree planting I guess but the benefit  
**0:32:15-0:32:22:**  to the farmer outweighing what funding you would get since 2018 the UK has looked at  
**0:32:22-0:32:28:**  a lot of the ammonia reduction targets and they're not achieving them there's grant funding  
**0:32:28-0:32:35:**  for ammonia scrubbing machines for poultry sheds in Northern Ireland mainland and some  
**0:32:35-0:32:40:**  of Wales and farmers are getting the funding for them and putting them in to keep the local  
**0:32:40-0:32:44:**  planning authorities happy but couldn't afford the electric to run them so they've never  
**0:32:44-0:32:48:**  been run so it was a waste of time and I think Northern Ireland very quickly realised that  
**0:32:48-0:32:52:**  one that over the 20 years they've been funding these machines actually ammonia had gone up  
**0:32:52-0:32:58:**  and not down so like it's about five years ago they were quite keen I was speaking about  
**0:32:58-0:33:03:**  trees at a conference in Edinburgh actually Centre for Environment and Hydrology that's  
**0:33:03-0:33:08:**  a CEH it was a CEH conference in Edinburgh and a representative of their government was  
**0:33:08-0:33:15:**  there and it was interesting the fact that ammonia reduction can be helped by tree planting  
**0:33:15-0:33:21:**  so they were one of the first of the UK devolved governments to put grant funding in place  
**0:33:21-0:33:27:**  for poultry and well not just poultry intensive livestock ammonia reduction so this grant  
**0:33:27-0:33:35:**  funded in Northern Ireland has been for quite a few years now and it's looking as though  
**0:33:35-0:33:40:**  the Brexit related rewriting of regulations in the UK will mean that it will be grant  
**0:33:40-0:33:46:**  funded in England and Scotland as well and talking to Welsh government on a similar sort  
**0:33:46-0:33:50:**  of scheme so it's just coming to the fore now that you can see for all the benefits  
**0:33:50-0:33:55:**  I mean you get benefits for animal welfare you get benefits for clean air so the Clean  
**0:33:55-0:34:00:**  Air Act is coming in in the UK and they're not quite sure how people farmers will react  
**0:34:00-0:34:04:**  to that challenge they'll have to plant trees it may as well be funded and I think the grant  
**0:34:04-0:34:11:**  funding authorities understand that you pay a farmer to look after these for 15 years  
**0:34:11-0:34:15:**  and for the next 150 after that they look after them themselves so there isn't a lot  
**0:34:15-0:34:20:**  of cost to it but all the benefit is still there and growing bigger every year so it's  
**0:34:20-0:34:23:**  an area where funding is starting to come into.  
**0:34:23-0:34:29:**  But before that actually happens or before you can fund all of that your company is still  
**0:34:29-0:34:35:**  the one investing in the trees on the farms on your suppliers farms then?  
**0:34:35-0:34:39:**  That's right yes it works it's not a big cost it's interesting you mentioned that the roll  
**0:34:39-0:34:46:**  out as well that the work we did with FAI clearly showed there's a bit higher welfare  
**0:34:46-0:34:51:**  there's less mortality better production better quality of product and better welfare less  
**0:34:51-0:34:59:**  feather pecking you mentioned how do you roll trees out the the RSPC Road Society for the  
**0:34:59-0:35:04:**  Protection of Animals UK have an assurance scheme for poultry farmers and well any farmers  
**0:35:04-0:35:10:**  but mainly poultry farmers and because we clearly showed there's better welfare for  
**0:35:10-0:35:14:**  planting trees it became part of their code of practice so anybody who is RSPCA assured  
**0:35:14-0:35:20:**  as a farmer has to plant their range with trees so we've planted as a company probably  
**0:35:20-0:35:25:**  quarter of a million trees something like that there's probably a million and a half  
**0:35:25-0:35:29:**  more across the UK as part of that code of practice and it's only been done because of  
**0:35:29-0:35:32:**  the research that showed that it was higher animal welfare so it's interesting if you  
**0:35:32-0:35:36:**  want to get things like trees rolled out across the country get the codes of practice for  
**0:35:36-0:35:37:**  welfare involved.  
**0:35:37-0:35:44:**  I wonder why is that the case that it increases it decreases feather picking do you have any  
**0:35:44-0:35:47:**  hypothesis on how it affects their behavior?  
**0:35:47-0:35:53:**  The science didn't particularly show why that was and to be fair we hadn't we hadn't really  
**0:35:53-0:36:00:**  figured that into the piece of research work but the understanding probably is two things  
**0:36:00-0:36:04:**  one it makes them range better so there's less density of poultry in the shed so during  
**0:36:04-0:36:08:**  the day they're out and about running about outside rather than sat inside picking up  
**0:36:08-0:36:14:**  diseases off each other and annoying each other so they start to feather pick and at  
**0:36:14-0:36:19:**  the other side the ones that do go outside are getting much more exercise and because  
**0:36:19-0:36:24:**  they've got more space between them they don't feather pick as much they don't get bought  
**0:36:24-0:36:28:**  there's other things to do there's books and leaves to play with and trees to play with  
**0:36:28-0:36:34:**  so they don't play with eating each other so I think it's just giving them more space  
**0:36:34-0:36:35:**  really.  
**0:36:35-0:36:39:**  And that would be the same factors that explain the increase in production then I mean it's  
**0:36:39-0:36:44:**  basically everything's linked right it's because they also have more space and less stress  
**0:36:44-0:36:45:**  that they produce better.  
**0:36:45-0:36:46:**  Exactly.  
**0:36:46-0:36:50:**  I remember when we had our initial conversation before recording you mentioned a figure I  
**0:36:50-0:36:54:**  think you were able to say that in a certain amount of time you were already paying back  
**0:36:54-0:36:58:**  the trees that you planted through these gains in production could you remind me this figure  
**0:36:58-0:37:01:**  I don't know if you still have it in your mind but that was quite fascinating.  
**0:37:01-0:37:07:**  Yeah the research showed that you get 2% less mortality and 2% more class A or edible human  
**0:37:07-0:37:14:**  edible eggs in a 16,000 bird unit which is an average sort of UK free range unit that  
**0:37:14-0:37:20:**  works out at around about £3,000 per year better performance from your birds that's  
**0:37:20-0:37:28:**  before you start to count all the environmental benefits so it's that pays for around about  
**0:37:28-0:37:33:**  the tree planting you do on a normal range that's out of flock there's 8 hectares of  
**0:37:33-0:37:38:**  range you plant 20% of it so you're looking around about 2 hectares couple of thousand  
**0:37:38-0:37:43:**  trees it just about covers the trees and the guards.  
**0:37:43-0:37:47:**  Oh that's interesting yeah and then every year it gets better then.  
**0:37:47-0:37:48:**  That's right yeah.  
**0:37:48-0:37:53:**  Because here you know because we've had trees planted for a long time like maybe 30 years  
**0:37:53-0:37:59:**  they're 40 feet high so we're quite regularly thinning those trees because they're still  
**0:37:59-0:38:06:**  quite dense and that biomass is just chipped up and goes into the factory and heats the  
**0:38:06-0:38:10:**  factory and all the wash water in the factory for washing trays and floors and machines  
**0:38:10-0:38:19:**  and things so we don't actually import any solid fuel of any sort be that gas or oil  
**0:38:19-0:38:21:**  because we have our own biomass.  
**0:38:21-0:38:26:**  That's really interesting I mean recently my colleague Dimitri recorded an episode with  
**0:38:26-0:38:31:**  a company producing biomass and although you've taken a very biodiversity approach to this  
**0:38:31-0:38:37:**  problem I imagine that you could also be looking at highly productive systems where you're  
**0:38:37-0:38:41:**  getting all these benefits but you have also planted trees with a more like production  
**0:38:41-0:38:47:**  oriented goal with you know quick biomass species popular etc and have actually you  
**0:38:47-0:38:51:**  know a high production biomass system you know I mean it's just a hypothesis but it's  
**0:38:51-0:38:55:**  just interesting to see that there seems to be like a lot of options around including  
**0:38:55-0:39:00:**  trees into poultry production and a lot of potential there to build really interesting  
**0:39:00-0:39:01:**  systems.  
**0:39:01-0:39:05:**  Yes I can say that you can have just about any sort of tree the only type of biomass  
**0:39:05-0:39:07:**  that doesn't work is willow.  
**0:39:07-0:39:08:**  Okay.  
**0:39:08-0:39:15:**  Because it's in very big coppice in willow so it's lots of very dense low branches, low  
**0:39:15-0:39:20:**  stems that it's impossible to get poultry out of so in order to put them back in the  
**0:39:20-0:39:23:**  shed at night it's impossible to get them out and lots of areas where they can lay eggs  
**0:39:23-0:39:29:**  and things so we have a couple of farms that tried coppice willow and it didn't work for  
**0:39:29-0:39:34:**  poultry but that's about the only thing I can think of all the other stuff has worked  
**0:39:34-0:39:35:**  yeah pine or whatever.  
**0:39:35-0:39:41:**  And I just wanted to go back to the work you're doing with farmers because we mentioned how  
**0:39:41-0:39:45:**  their perception really changed over these last few years and I was wondering initially  
**0:39:45-0:39:50:**  what were the oppositions what were the reluctance around trees?  
**0:39:50-0:39:59:**  Primarily change of use of land at that time land in the UK was probably 30,000 pounds  
**0:39:59-0:40:07:**  a hectare something like that and woodland was five so they were looking at the value  
**0:40:07-0:40:12:**  of their farms and saying I'm turning land from 30,000 pounds a hectare into 5,000 pounds  
**0:40:12-0:40:14:**  a hectare why should I be doing that?  
**0:40:14-0:40:20:**  And there is an argument to that I guess what we have in the UK is that those values have  
**0:40:20-0:40:25:**  got very much closer together just recently because of the need for biomass and demand  
**0:40:25-0:40:32:**  for land for planting biomass and things like nature conservation for new housing developments  
**0:40:32-0:40:39:**  and ecological benefits of new housing developments and CO2 sequestration so the value of land  
**0:40:39-0:40:45:**  for woodland has gone up significantly to be almost matching agricultural land values  
**0:40:45-0:40:50:**  so that reason has largely gone but even so in a big scheme of things we were paying these  
**0:40:50-0:40:55:**  guys five pence a dozen each more for their eggs for planting trees and that would way  
**0:40:55-0:41:03:**  outweigh for the sake of planting two hectares of your land for a chicken shed the loss in  
**0:41:03-0:41:09:**  capital cost of that of planting trees on it.  
**0:41:09-0:41:13:**  The only areas where we have significant problems really is on rented land where it isn't the  
**0:41:13-0:41:17:**  farmers own land and then it can be more of a challenge if the landlord just does not  
**0:41:17-0:41:18:**  want trees.  
**0:41:18-0:41:21:**  Not like you can do then.  
**0:41:21-0:41:25:**  But it's interesting because that premium is actually quite significant and I'm wondering  
**0:41:25-0:41:32:**  what your motivations are and were is it at some point did you are you doing this really  
**0:41:32-0:41:39:**  out of your values and you're out of care for you know the environment and biodiversity  
**0:41:39-0:41:43:**  or do you really see a business case for doing this and a way of also distinguishing yourself  
**0:41:43-0:41:48:**  from your competitors like I'm really interesting to see because you know it's quite a strong  
**0:41:48-0:41:49:**  statement.  
**0:41:49-0:41:54:**  If I'm being totally honest no it's not the saving the planners biodiversity angle it's  
**0:41:54-0:41:59:**  driving it and an ecological benefit angle it's driving it it's pure commercial farming  
**0:41:59-0:42:06:**  staying in business and selling a product for a higher value than you would if you didn't  
**0:42:06-0:42:11:**  have all of that in place but at the same time it's a nice that comes for free alongside  
**0:42:11-0:42:12:**  what you're doing.  
**0:42:12-0:42:19:**  Of course because that's something then you that you're able to you're able to sell your  
**0:42:19-0:42:24:**  eggs at a premium I think compared because of this of these trees because of what you're  
**0:42:24-0:42:27:**  showing in terms of animal welfare etc.  
**0:42:27-0:42:32:**  I have no idea how you know the your egg business functions and who you who you're selling to  
**0:42:32-0:42:35:**  but that's really something today that's valued by your customers.  
**0:42:35-0:42:37:**  Absolutely absolutely.  
**0:42:37-0:42:44:**  Some of our particular customers are some of the food service and retail in the UK that  
**0:42:44-0:42:50:**  prides themselves on not just their the quality of their product but how it's produced and  
**0:42:50-0:42:58:**  we particularly concentrate on that market it's it's it's not a commodity market and  
**0:42:58-0:43:02:**  if you're producing a non commodity product a high welfare high provenance ethically produced  
**0:43:02-0:43:07:**  product you may as well be selling it to the people who are demanding that as part of their  
**0:43:07-0:43:09:**  offering.  
**0:43:09-0:43:13:**  But in a sense you were almost one step before everyone because I don't know when you know  
**0:43:13-0:43:17:**  twenty five years ago I was like five years old or four years old so I don't remember  
**0:43:17-0:43:22:**  much about that time but I'm assuming that this whole concern about food quality has  
**0:43:22-0:43:27:**  increased dramatically in the last few years and that has changed a lot.  
**0:43:27-0:43:31:**  Was there already that customer base that was ready to pay for that premium at the time  
**0:43:31-0:43:33:**  you started planting trees?  
**0:43:33-0:43:40:**  I'll have to say I'm a business genius but actually it's just blind luck.  
**0:43:40-0:43:48:**  1995 when we set the company off we were selling only high welfare free range organic free  
**0:43:48-0:43:54:**  range product from ethically produced that was the business statement at the time and  
**0:43:54-0:44:01:**  that just asked us to look that the rest of the world has come down that road and met  
**0:44:01-0:44:02:**  us.  
**0:44:02-0:44:09:**  And do you see other actors in the poultry production starting to bring in trees is that  
**0:44:09-0:44:13:**  something that's picking up you would say in general because it's there seems to be  
**0:44:13-0:44:19:**  quite a strong case for it or are you still are you still quite unique in that respect?  
**0:44:19-0:44:24:**  No with the rollout in some of the welfare organizations demanding range planting that  
**0:44:24-0:44:29:**  certainly helped a lot of people on that route but you think of the things that it does it  
**0:44:29-0:44:33:**  gives you better performance so you make more money so that's a good start.  
**0:44:33-0:44:38:**  It reduces the runoff from your range so it reduces flooding and improves the percolation  
**0:44:38-0:44:41:**  rate of water into your range so it's drier.  
**0:44:41-0:44:45:**  It absorbs ammonia which is clean air is a huge thing at the moment it sequesters carbon  
**0:44:45-0:44:49:**  dioxide which everybody is demanding at the moment so you can plough your chicken range  
**0:44:49-0:44:53:**  but at the same time it can make you money from absorbing carbon dioxide so every single  
**0:44:53-0:45:01:**  piece of COP26 environmental provenance reducing carbon save the planet it fits with planting  
**0:45:01-0:45:09:**  trees for your chickens as well as things like nitrate runoff is significant or is a  
**0:45:09-0:45:13:**  significant problem in the UK from some of these intensive farms.  
**0:45:13-0:45:16:**  If you get the right if you plant the right type of trees that puts more carbon into the  
**0:45:16-0:45:21:**  ground the you put more carbon into the ground there's a direct link with the carbon nitrogen  
**0:45:21-0:45:28:**  ratio so you store more nitrogen in the ground so there's just numerous benefits for planting  
**0:45:28-0:45:35:**  trees that has meant that it's a sensible thing for farmers to do going forward.  
**0:45:35-0:45:40:**  We've mentioned a few times carbon sequestration and because you're giving talks and you're  
**0:45:40-0:45:45:**  talking with people from government I was wondering do you see carbon credits or payment  
**0:45:45-0:45:50:**  for ecosystem services as becoming part of your business model because there's been talks  
**0:45:50-0:45:56:**  about this for a while about exactly paying premiums to farmers or subsidies for sequestering  
**0:45:56-0:46:04:**  carbon for delivering good quality water for potentially reducing ammonia pollution all  
**0:46:04-0:46:09:**  these things seem obvious but it's quite hard to put into place because you obviously need  
**0:46:09-0:46:13:**  to quantify things you need to measure them you need to certify and I'm wondering how  
**0:46:13-0:46:16:**  you see these things evolving in the future.  
**0:46:16-0:46:22:**  You're right it's very early days it's baby steps at the moment isn't it but there's just  
**0:46:22-0:46:26:**  it's things like ammonia reduction it's a legal requirement by 2030 you have to reduce  
**0:46:26-0:46:32:**  your ammonia by 15 percent simple government legislation so you need to comply with that  
**0:46:32-0:46:33:**  type of thing.  
**0:46:33-0:46:42:**  Carbon dioxide there's just starting to be early days in carbon credit government sponsored  
**0:46:42-0:46:47:**  carbon credit so you sell your carbon credits to the government on a formula that they have  
**0:46:47-0:46:52:**  and then they supply them on to whoever wants carbon credits so that's a market that's just  
**0:46:52-0:46:57:**  starting to develop and I think will get bigger as it becomes more important and people need  
**0:46:57-0:47:04:**  to get near a net zero and another thing that's kind of coming into it is new developments  
**0:47:04-0:47:11:**  new housing developments in particular in the UK have to have a nitrate plan nowadays  
**0:47:11-0:47:17:**  which and trees are good at holding groundwater and storing nitrates and at the same time  
**0:47:17-0:47:20:**  they all have to have an environmental plan so you're not allowed to go and chop down  
**0:47:20-0:47:26:**  trees and woods and hedges and greenfield sites and put houses on it and have no benefit  
**0:47:26-0:47:31:**  for the environment so a lot of those particularly in the inner city areas where you can't plant  
**0:47:31-0:47:38:**  lots of trees within the estate to recoup that they're looking to purchase those credits  
**0:47:38-0:47:45:**  from farmers out in the countryside so again that's a market that hasn't it's there and  
**0:47:45-0:47:50:**  people pay money for it but the background that you were saying earlier about having  
**0:47:50-0:47:55:**  it accredited and counted for and assessed so you can't sell the same carbon 15 times  
**0:47:55-0:48:01:**  is that area regulation still to be developed it's early days.  
**0:48:01-0:48:05:**  But you know if it does develop and if they do manage to do that it could become a significant  
**0:48:05-0:48:12:**  source of income for farmers and tree plantations.  
**0:48:12-0:48:16:**  But listening to you it seems like such a no brainer to put trees and integrate trees  
**0:48:16-0:48:22:**  into poultry production do you see any kind of obstacles or reason why people wouldn't  
**0:48:22-0:48:28:**  do it either in terms of legal you were mentioning the type of land that's really interesting  
**0:48:28-0:48:33:**  I don't know if you see any other kind of big picture issues that might prevent that  
**0:48:33-0:48:35:**  from being scaled up.  
**0:48:35-0:48:42:**  A lot of the big picture issues are quietly being whittled away by the changing government  
**0:48:42-0:48:51:**  regulation as to the benefits of trees and tree planting the government is keen to have  
**0:48:51-0:48:57:**  people planting trees so there's less issues with things like the single farm payment where  
**0:48:57-0:49:01:**  you just didn't get any payment at all if you planted trees on it well any new grant  
**0:49:01-0:49:07:**  schemes that's coming ahead tend to encourage trees rather than discourage them.  
**0:49:07-0:49:13:**  I think the whole atmosphere has changed in the last five years and I think one of the  
**0:49:13-0:49:19:**  other things you're getting is that a lot of NGOs that over the past 20 years have constantly  
**0:49:19-0:49:25:**  battled for their little bit of NGO land and now on a bigger picture they all kind of try  
**0:49:25-0:49:31:**  to work together on the whole environmental linking networks of environmentally different  
**0:49:31-0:49:37:**  schemes be that wildflowers or wildlife welfare or biodiversity so we're all kind of going  
**0:49:37-0:49:40:**  in the same direction rather than everybody pulling in different directions I think it's  
**0:49:40-0:49:45:**  been a big change in the last five years.  
**0:49:45-0:49:51:**  But you need to have someone that's acting a bit like your company as a broker in between  
**0:49:51-0:49:55:**  and that is able to go and see the farmers and say listen we have the technical expertise  
**0:49:55-0:49:59:**  we have the person who can help you we have the trees we know the nurseries and it's just  
**0:49:59-0:50:05:**  a question of and we have the economic incentive in a sense like there would need to be many  
**0:50:05-0:50:10:**  other companies or the government should take that role of a kind of broker but I guess  
**0:50:10-0:50:15:**  that that role that you had is very crucial because probably that the farmers that now  
**0:50:15-0:50:19:**  have plants and trees working with you wouldn't have already maybe they would have one day  
**0:50:19-0:50:21:**  but you know that accelerated a lot.  
**0:50:21-0:50:30:**  Yes you're absolutely right but there's quite a few companies in the UK now major retail  
**0:50:30-0:50:35:**  which are insisting on that being part of their supply chain or some of the bigger other  
**0:50:35-0:50:41:**  egg companies in the UK are seeing the benefits and what will really drive a lot of that is  
**0:50:41-0:50:45:**  that particularly in the UK I don't know if it's the same across the rest of Europe is  
**0:50:45-0:50:53:**  that eggs are relatively carbon efficient so a lot of retail who have all their net  
**0:50:53-0:51:00:**  zero targets and will be net zero in eggs by 2035 or whatever it's an easy option to  
**0:51:00-0:51:05:**  start with and so a lot of those farmers are now getting the supply to those type of companies  
**0:51:05-0:51:12:**  are now getting carbon audits and on the back of that things like solar panels and trees  
**0:51:12-0:51:18:**  can become very much to the full and so if those farmers who had resisted and just planted  
**0:51:18-0:51:23:**  the minimum out that the welfare organizers recommend they'll be planting more because  
**0:51:23-0:51:28:**  of all the incentive is there to do that.  
**0:51:28-0:51:33:**  But from what I understand it seems that the change at least in the poultry sector is coming  
**0:51:33-0:51:39:**  more from the top down by buyers saying listen this is you know our list of criteria and  
**0:51:39-0:51:42:**  this is the conditions we want in our products that's where the most change is coming from  
**0:51:42-0:51:44:**  is that correct?  
**0:51:44-0:51:50:**  At the moment yes probably at the moment yes yeah it's big picture is that's one of those  
**0:51:50-0:51:54:**  drivers the other one is government and a lot of the way their subsidies and funding  
**0:51:54-0:52:01:**  is going is another driver public perception of the actual farming communities probably  
**0:52:01-0:52:05:**  another driver there's you know there's lots of drivers that they weren't there five years  
**0:52:05-0:52:11:**  ago so it's somebody with the head in the sand who doesn't seriously think about at  
**0:52:11-0:52:15:**  least planting some of their range in trees at the moment.  
**0:52:15-0:52:20:**  And what you said about government it seems that in that sense Brexit was positive at  
**0:52:20-0:52:26:**  least in terms of agroforestry that it was maybe easier to get that message through to  
**0:52:26-0:52:30:**  the government because it was maybe less of a big structure I don't know is that how you  
**0:52:30-0:52:36:**  see the that has evolved linked to before when it was the cap payment system?  
**0:52:36-0:52:42:**  I think government can probably react quicker I would imagine that Europe will get down  
**0:52:42-0:52:50:**  the same road eventually but having one government and not having to talk to every other 27 to  
**0:52:50-0:52:55:**  decide what you're going to do is mainly we can react quicker although we're still there's  
**0:52:55-0:52:59:**  still a long way to go on that there's still quite a bit that needs changing that doesn't  
**0:52:59-0:53:06:**  get changed but certainly from an agricultural point of view I think we get lighter touch  
**0:53:06-0:53:07:**  quicker movement.  
**0:53:07-0:53:12:**  And it means that you know people working with agroforestry or convinced of its benefits  
**0:53:12-0:53:17:**  have been effective in delivering that story and that message through to government which  
**0:53:17-0:53:21:**  is I guess the point of effective lobbying and when you're trying to bring in positive  
**0:53:21-0:53:26:**  change so it is interesting to see that this message seems to be going through then.  
**0:53:26-0:53:29:**  It's not a difficult message though is it?  
**0:53:29-0:53:35:**  You know you can have your acid scrubber with concentrated sulfuric acid going on to farm  
**0:53:35-0:53:38:**  using tens of thousands of pounds of electric every year and costing you hundreds of thousands  
**0:53:38-0:53:43:**  to buy in the first place or you can have some trees and they'll do pretty well the  
**0:53:43-0:53:46:**  same job and they'll do it for 150 years for free.  
**0:53:46-0:53:49:**  Okay they'll only take 50% of it they won't take all of it but you know that's just an  
**0:53:49-0:53:55:**  argument they just as well as all the other stuff you need like manure treatment and dietary  
**0:53:55-0:54:00:**  change for proteins and that sort of stuff it's just such an easy win and so obvious  
**0:54:00-0:54:03:**  that even government has to take notice of that.  
**0:54:03-0:54:12:**  There's still challenges you know you plant a tree and it's a whip in a tube for three  
**0:54:12-0:54:21:**  or four years so you have to work on crediting people before the trees are actually sequestering  
**0:54:21-0:54:25:**  ammonia because they don't start sequestering much ammonia for at least the first ten years  
**0:54:25-0:54:29:**  so there's still that step that the government hasn't taken us yet.  
**0:54:29-0:54:33:**  We just alluded a few times to the research I don't know if you feel like it's necessary  
**0:54:33-0:54:38:**  that we synthesize or have you know just that you make sure that you talked about all the  
**0:54:38-0:54:42:**  different research you did or if you feel like we've mentioned it enough because we've  
**0:54:42-0:54:46:**  mentioned it in different topics but it was interesting the type of research you carried  
**0:54:46-0:54:50:**  out do you feel like there's anything to add on that or are you just happy with what we  
**0:54:50-0:54:53:**  said so far?  
**0:54:53-0:54:56:**  To be honest with you we've covered most of the research work we did there was the obviously  
**0:54:56-0:55:02:**  the production health and welfare and benefits of trees research there's various other bits  
**0:55:02-0:55:08:**  and pieces of ammonia research which we discussed and the other was biodiversity work looking  
**0:55:08-0:55:12:**  at the different biodiversity and that's a big message on the biodiversity work that  
**0:55:12-0:55:16:**  was done with the Woodland Trust and Paul again just surveying detailed surveys of biodiversity  
**0:55:16-0:55:21:**  on farms for the first few years when you've got open sunny areas between the rows of trees  
**0:55:21-0:55:25:**  very good for bats the whole of the planted area becomes woodland edge effectively because  
**0:55:25-0:55:29:**  you have these alleyways up and down through the woodland so it's very good for bats and  
**0:55:29-0:55:35:**  bugs but that tends to go away as the canopy coalesces and you get more bird species coming  
**0:55:35-0:55:40:**  in and less of the invertebrates and bats but you get much more woodland resident type  
**0:55:40-0:55:47:**  birds a lot of which in the UK are red list species so that the ones that are in danger  
**0:55:47-0:55:53:**  of becoming extinct are certainly red list so that was quite an interesting piece of  
**0:55:53-0:55:57:**  research to show that benefit because it's not something that farmers really see or anybody  
**0:55:57-0:56:01:**  really think about but it clearly works but other than that we've talked about most of  
**0:56:01-0:56:02:**  the research I guess.  
**0:56:02-0:56:08:**  Great okay well David thank you so much for your time and thank you so much for all these  
**0:56:08-0:56:10:**  you know fascinating points that we covered today.  
**0:56:10-0:56:15:**  What we have to say is plant trees don't we?  
**0:56:15-0:56:20:**  Thank you for making it until the end I really hope you enjoyed the episode as usual you'll

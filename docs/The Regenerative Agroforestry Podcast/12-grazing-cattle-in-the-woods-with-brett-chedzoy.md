### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Sat, 26 Dec 2020 14:04:31)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:44:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:44-0:00:47:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:53:**  We're your hosts Dimitri and Etienne and today we're interviewing Brett Chedzoy.  
**0:00:53-0:00:58:**  Brett is a forester working for the Cornell Cooperative Extension as well as the owner  
**0:00:58-0:01:05:**  and manager of Angus Glen's farm in New York state and a large ranch in Argentina.  
**0:01:05-0:01:09:**  It's been a while now that Etienne and I wanted to get into silver pasture.  
**0:01:09-0:01:16:**  We haven't had an episode focused only on this yet and today Brett gave us an amazing  
**0:01:16-0:01:22:**  interview to get started because he really provided a really good overview of the differences  
**0:01:22-0:01:29:**  between standard rotational grazing on pasture and rotational grazing in a silver pasture  
**0:01:29-0:01:30:**  system.  
**0:01:30-0:01:36:**  And he's going to talk about his experience in two very different contexts, both in Argentina  
**0:01:36-0:01:43:**  and in New York state in the USA, which provides a really, really interesting overview of silver  
**0:01:43-0:01:50:**  pasture for people that just want to get started in understanding what are the basic concepts.  
**0:01:50-0:01:58:**  So we do also go in a bit of depth, but this is really a big picture overview of some of  
**0:01:58-0:01:59:**  the key concepts.  
**0:01:59-0:02:01:**  So we hope you enjoy it.  
**0:02:01-0:02:08:**  So Brett, welcome to the podcast and yeah, maybe you could start by just telling us a  
**0:02:08-0:02:13:**  bit about how you got into silver pasture and the story of your farm.  
**0:02:13-0:02:14:**  Very good.  
**0:02:14-0:02:20:**  My experience with silver pasturing started almost 30 years ago.  
**0:02:20-0:02:29:**  I worked as a forester in central Argentina in the early 1990s and had the good fortune  
**0:02:29-0:02:39:**  to work with some large cattle ranchers who were also foresters and they were doing large  
**0:02:39-0:02:45:**  afforestation projects in the Sierra mountains of central Argentina.  
**0:02:45-0:02:52:**  So as a young forester, that was really my first exposure to silver pasturing and opened  
**0:02:52-0:03:05:**  my eyes to the beneficial aspects of grazing livestock together on forested landscapes.  
**0:03:05-0:03:09:**  You mentioned to me that you have two farms and how did you bring back that journey to  
**0:03:09-0:03:12:**  the US then?  
**0:03:12-0:03:22:**  So I worked much of the 1990s in South America and in 1994 when my wife Maria and I were  
**0:03:22-0:03:29:**  married we purchased our own ranch in the Sierra mountains in Argentina.  
**0:03:29-0:03:37:**  Maria's family are farmers in central Argentina and I really fell in love with that whole  
**0:03:37-0:03:40:**  region.  
**0:03:40-0:03:48:**  So in 2002 we moved back to where I grew up in central New York in the Watkins Glen area  
**0:03:48-0:03:52:**  which is part of New York's Finger Lakes region.  
**0:03:52-0:04:00:**  And our family farm had been a dairy up until the early 1980s but much of the time that  
**0:04:00-0:04:08:**  I was gone it sat being used by another farm that was leasing the tillable acreage on the  
**0:04:08-0:04:10:**  farm.  
**0:04:10-0:04:16:**  When we settled back here we wanted to do something that would be enjoyable and profitable  
**0:04:16-0:04:24:**  and grazing livestock seemed to be the best fit for our farm.  
**0:04:24-0:04:30:**  Could you tell us a bit about your local context both in terms of your climate and also your  
**0:04:30-0:04:32:**  markets for your produce?  
**0:04:32-0:04:34:**  Sure.  
**0:04:34-0:04:44:**  So the farms both here in New York and in Argentina are, they have obviously some similarities  
**0:04:44-0:04:47:**  but some big differences as well.  
**0:04:47-0:04:54:**  Interestingly though it rains about the same amount at both of the farms.  
**0:04:54-0:05:00:**  So both here in New York and in Argentina we get about 40 inches of rainfall a year.  
**0:05:00-0:05:07:**  But that rainfall in Argentina is more seasonal in nature and it comes in very heavy rain  
**0:05:07-0:05:09:**  storms typically.  
**0:05:09-0:05:16:**  So one of the big benefits of the civil pasturing in Argentina is that the trees really help  
**0:05:16-0:05:26:**  to buffer the heavy rainfall events and reduce the amount of runoff and flash flooding and  
**0:05:26-0:05:32:**  allow more of that precious moisture to infiltrate into the soil.  
**0:05:32-0:05:41:**  We raise black Angus cattle at both of the farms and in Argentina it's much more of a  
**0:05:41-0:05:52:**  commodity market where we market our yearling animals into the, usually it's private sales  
**0:05:52-0:05:59:**  to other farm operations that will then finish those animals as grass-fed beef.  
**0:05:59-0:06:08:**  Here in New York we also sell most of our yearlings to other finishing farms and so  
**0:06:08-0:06:14:**  I guess the cattle would look very similar in both locations but the landscape and the  
**0:06:14-0:06:21:**  types of trees growing on the two different farms are quite different.  
**0:06:21-0:06:27:**  And so yourself, you're kind of traveling frequently between Argentina and New York  
**0:06:27-0:06:29:**  State?  
**0:06:29-0:06:34:**  I don't travel as frequently as I would like to to Argentina.  
**0:06:34-0:06:37:**  We try to make it there once a year.  
**0:06:37-0:06:45:**  Our children are now in college or beyond so they have more flexibility to spend time  
**0:06:45-0:06:47:**  there than we do.  
**0:06:47-0:06:56:**  We hope to start spending about half of our year in Argentina here and maybe another five  
**0:06:56-0:07:01:**  years when my wife and I are semi-retired.  
**0:07:01-0:07:08:**  So Brett, what we wanted to understand with you today is already have an overview of silvopasture,  
**0:07:08-0:07:14:**  some of its opportunities and challenges, and really understand the interaction between  
**0:07:14-0:07:15:**  the different elements.  
**0:07:15-0:07:22:**  By that I mean between the forestry aspect and also the animal aspect.  
**0:07:22-0:07:28:**  And if that's okay with you, maybe we can start by looking at the impact that animals  
**0:07:28-0:07:36:**  have on the forest when you make the decision to include them in a forest.  
**0:07:36-0:07:42:**  You know, I know that sometimes this has bad reputation that people think that including  
**0:07:42-0:07:45:**  animals will actually damage the forest.  
**0:07:45-0:07:49:**  Could you give us a bit more information on that aspect?  
**0:07:49-0:07:58:**  The whole key behind silvopasturing is that we are grazing the animals in a way that doesn't  
**0:07:58-0:08:04:**  cause short-term or long-term harm to the trees or any of the other resources like the  
**0:08:04-0:08:07:**  soil.  
**0:08:07-0:08:14:**  And intensive rotational grazing is really a fundamental part of any successful silvopasturing  
**0:08:14-0:08:24:**  system and that's what allows us to minimize or completely eliminate any of the negative  
**0:08:24-0:08:32:**  impacts that were traditionally associated with woodland grazing.  
**0:08:32-0:08:40:**  Here in the northeastern United States, such as New York, we had a long history of teaching  
**0:08:40-0:08:48:**  farmers to not graze their livestock in wooded areas and that was because our small family  
**0:08:48-0:08:55:**  dairy farms and livestock farms were often treating their farm woodlots as sacrifice  
**0:08:55-0:08:57:**  paddocks on the farm.  
**0:08:57-0:09:07:**  And when you allow livestock, especially heavy livestock like cattle, to access natural woodlands  
**0:09:07-0:09:13:**  for weeks or months at a time, year after year after year, in other words there's really  
**0:09:13-0:09:22:**  no rotation or period of rest and recovery, over time that will start to negatively affect  
**0:09:22-0:09:23:**  the trees.  
**0:09:23-0:09:30:**  And here in upstate New York we have the most viable hardwood forest in the world.  
**0:09:30-0:09:38:**  We grow walnut and cherry and maple and ash and oak, woods that are widely exported to  
**0:09:38-0:09:39:**  the rest of the world.  
**0:09:39-0:09:49:**  So if we cause damage to these high-value trees or damage their root system or compact  
**0:09:49-0:09:58:**  the soil and cause decline in the trees' health and quality, that can have some very significant  
**0:09:58-0:10:01:**  economic impacts.  
**0:10:01-0:10:07:**  It's a little different than where silvopasturing is widely practiced in other parts of the  
**0:10:07-0:10:13:**  United States, such as the southeastern or western parts of the United States or where  
**0:10:13-0:10:20:**  our ranch is in central Argentina, those are primarily conifer forests.  
**0:10:20-0:10:32:**  And conifers are not only lower in value on a per-tree or per-ton basis, so there's still  
**0:10:32-0:10:41:**  economic loss, but it may not be as significant as when you have a loss of a high-value, say,  
**0:10:41-0:10:47:**  oak tree that might be worth hundreds of dollars versus a pine tree that might be worth only  
**0:10:47-0:10:48:**  a few dollars.  
**0:10:48-0:11:00:**  Pines, however, are also on the higher range in terms of resistance to some of the potential  
**0:11:00-0:11:03:**  impacts from livestock grazing.  
**0:11:03-0:11:13:**  They have deep root systems and are often associated with soils and sites where compaction  
**0:11:13-0:11:17:**  may be an issue or lower fertility may be an issue.  
**0:11:17-0:11:23:**  But the message I'd like to share is that silvopasturing can be done in any forest type  
**0:11:23-0:11:25:**  with any kind of trees.  
**0:11:25-0:11:36:**  It's just a matter of managing the grazing in a way that doesn't cause a long-term decline  
**0:11:36-0:11:41:**  in the value and health and vigor of those trees.  
**0:11:41-0:11:49:**  And you just mentioned that coniferous trees are more resistant to compaction.  
**0:11:49-0:11:50:**  How does that occur?  
**0:11:50-0:11:54:**  Is it just in general coniferous trees are more resistant and deciduous trees are less?  
**0:11:54-0:11:59:**  Or could you give us an idea of the different resistance of different trees in silvopasture  
**0:11:59-0:12:05:**  systems?  
**0:12:05-0:12:14:**  If you look where these different tree species and tree types such as hardwoods versus conifers  
**0:12:14-0:12:19:**  naturally occur, you start to see a pattern.  
**0:12:19-0:12:25:**  And there are some tree species, and I'll talk about the tree species that I know here  
**0:12:25-0:12:27:**  in New York.  
**0:12:27-0:12:39:**  So we often associate species like maple and birch and ash with our best quality fertile  
**0:12:39-0:12:40:**  sites.  
**0:12:40-0:12:51:**  Then on the lower quality sites where you have more rock, maybe lower fertility, maybe  
**0:12:51-0:12:57:**  more shallow soil, that's where you start to see other hardwood species like the oaks  
**0:12:57-0:12:58:**  dominate.  
**0:12:58-0:13:04:**  But also we have some native pine species that also thrive in those kinds of sites.  
**0:13:04-0:13:14:**  And so when you're thinking about what trees to promote in your silvopasture, you first  
**0:13:14-0:13:20:**  have to understand what the inherent site quality is of that silvopasture and work with  
**0:13:20-0:13:26:**  species that seem to be better suited for that given site.  
**0:13:26-0:13:28:**  Diversity is good.  
**0:13:28-0:13:35:**  I like to maintain as many different species of trees as possible in our silvopasture,  
**0:13:35-0:13:45:**  but I want to favor trees that seem to be best suited for any given portion of our silvopasture.  
**0:13:45-0:13:49:**  Nice, that's fascinating.  
**0:13:49-0:13:56:**  Just to go one step back on the compaction that you talked about, or let's say the damage  
**0:13:56-0:14:01:**  of the animals in the trees, what are the key things to watch out for?  
**0:14:01-0:14:05:**  You mentioned compaction, but is that the main one, the most important one, or are there  
**0:14:05-0:14:07:**  others as well?  
**0:14:07-0:14:20:**  The issues that can be associated with overgrazing or poorly managed grazing in silvopasture  
**0:14:20-0:14:33:**  areas would include soil compaction, physical damage to the trees, and in some cases, animals  
**0:14:33-0:14:37:**  eating young trees that are part of the regeneration system.  
**0:14:37-0:14:46:**  However, regeneration is something that foresters, we think of regeneration as an event in the  
**0:14:46-0:14:48:**  life cycle of a forest.  
**0:14:48-0:14:58:**  So we often don't worry about animals browsing or eating young trees if we're still decades  
**0:14:58-0:15:05:**  away from needing to recruit new young trees to make the next generation of forest.  
**0:15:05-0:15:12:**  That's a silvicultural principle that I don't really want to go into today, but compaction  
**0:15:12-0:15:21:**  and physical damage such as girdling trees or chewing the bark off trees or damaging  
**0:15:21-0:15:30:**  the shallow feeder roots on trees, those are all avoidable issues through proper grazing  
**0:15:30-0:15:32:**  management.  
**0:15:32-0:15:38:**  And if you think about a rotational grazing system where animals are constantly on the  
**0:15:38-0:15:46:**  move and where we have the ability to put animals in the right spot at the right time,  
**0:15:46-0:15:54:**  there's really no reason why we should see compaction or damage to the trees in our silvopasture  
**0:15:54-0:15:56:**  system.  
**0:15:56-0:16:03:**  Compaction is really going to be a reflection of having animals there far too long.  
**0:16:03-0:16:11:**  And in the rotational grazing that we do with silvopasture management, the animals are being  
**0:16:11-0:16:21:**  moved frequently, in some cases daily, maybe even multiple times a day, but probably at  
**0:16:21-0:16:23:**  least once a week.  
**0:16:23-0:16:33:**  And that's also what really eliminates the issue of animals damaging trees because when  
**0:16:33-0:16:40:**  we leave animals too long in any given spot, bored and restless animals become destructive  
**0:16:40-0:16:42:**  animals.  
**0:16:42-0:16:53:**  So if animals are being continuously moved to fresh pasture and fresh forages and browse,  
**0:16:53-0:16:59:**  they will do what they should be doing, which is grazing and eating.  
**0:16:59-0:17:08:**  They won't be looking to go and start trying to chew the bark off of our trees because  
**0:17:08-0:17:12:**  they just were bored.  
**0:17:12-0:17:14:**  And humans behave the same way.  
**0:17:14-0:17:21:**  When we're bored, we start crumpling up papers or chewing bark trees as well.  
**0:17:21-0:17:26:**  It happens to me sometimes.  
**0:17:26-0:17:27:**  Yeah that's great.  
**0:17:27-0:17:35:**  So it's very similar to intensive rotational grazing on pasture.  
**0:17:35-0:17:40:**  And I'd be curious to know more about how it differentiates itself to pasture intensive  
**0:17:40-0:17:43:**  rotational grazing.  
**0:17:43-0:17:53:**  So again, silvopasturing and intensive rotational grazing are, in my opinion, synonymous.  
**0:17:53-0:17:59:**  We can't really be talking about silvopasturing without talking about intensively managed  
**0:17:59-0:18:02:**  rotational grazing.  
**0:18:02-0:18:09:**  And it's interesting you ask how they might differ.  
**0:18:09-0:18:18:**  I think the one area where they might differ is here in New York, for example, and it's  
**0:18:18-0:18:26:**  not the same all across the world, but we definitely have wet rainy seasons where we  
**0:18:26-0:18:30:**  can have saturated soil conditions.  
**0:18:30-0:18:38:**  And typically what we do in our treeless pastures is we speed up the rotation.  
**0:18:38-0:18:46:**  When the soil conditions are really wet, because we don't want to leave the animals there  
**0:18:46-0:18:55:**  too long where they're starting to compact the soil and really puncture into the soil  
**0:18:55-0:18:56:**  surface.  
**0:18:56-0:19:02:**  In silvopastures, on the other hand, where we have to also be thinking about the fine  
**0:19:02-0:19:11:**  tree roots that won't recover as quickly and as well as grass roots, we may want to just  
**0:19:11-0:19:19:**  simply keep animals out of our silvopastures when the ground conditions are really poor.  
**0:19:19-0:19:29:**  In some situations we don't have a choice, but we like to save our silvopastures for periods  
**0:19:29-0:19:36:**  of the grazing season when the ground conditions are quite dry and firm, versus like early  
**0:19:36-0:19:44:**  spring or late fall where the ground conditions are going to be saturated and soft.  
**0:19:44-0:19:54:**  So you would say that the tree or the silvopasture system is more sensitive than a simple pasture  
**0:19:54-0:19:56:**  system in general?  
**0:19:56-0:20:04:**  I think a silvopasture system has, I don't believe saying that it's more sensitive is  
**0:20:04-0:20:11:**  quite the way I would phrase it, because I really think silvopastures in many ways are  
**0:20:11-0:20:16:**  more resilient and robust than treeless pastures.  
**0:20:16-0:20:25:**  But there are, we have to always be thinking about how the grazing is going to affect the  
**0:20:25-0:20:26:**  trees.  
**0:20:26-0:20:32:**  We have to go in there and graze in less than ideal conditions when the ground is soft and  
**0:20:32-0:20:39:**  the animals may be punching things up a little bit and perhaps damaging the shallow feeder  
**0:20:39-0:20:41:**  roots of the trees.  
**0:20:41-0:20:50:**  Trees can recover fine from a short term or short lived or an acute stress like that.  
**0:20:50-0:20:59:**  But if we do it frequently or continuously, the trees are very long lived and resilient  
**0:20:59-0:21:09:**  organisms so we might really beat up on our trees for years and years, even decades before  
**0:21:09-0:21:10:**  we see the symptoms of that.  
**0:21:10-0:21:16:**  But once we see that we pushed it too far and that we really did damage, lasting damage  
**0:21:16-0:21:19:**  to our trees, we can't reverse that.  
**0:21:19-0:21:28:**  So in an open pasture or a treeless pasture, if we really beat up on our grass and our  
**0:21:28-0:21:38:**  forbs, we can usually undo that harm that we caused by letting it rest longer or reseeding  
**0:21:38-0:21:47:**  it or possibly fertilizing it or delaying the next time the animals graze it.  
**0:21:47-0:21:55:**  But if we start to see decline in the health of our trees that are part of our civil pastures,  
**0:21:55-0:21:56:**  it's too late.  
**0:21:56-0:22:02:**  The damage is done and there really is no practical fix to that.  
**0:22:02-0:22:08:**  And when you think about the decades, many decades it might take to establish new trees  
**0:22:08-0:22:13:**  in there, that's a mistake that you have to live with for a long time.  
**0:22:13-0:22:17:**  That's a very costly mistake.  
**0:22:17-0:22:24:**  But you mentioned now that you, in your opinion, the civil pasture system is more resilient  
**0:22:24-0:22:29:**  than a pastured system and I'd love to know a bit more about that.  
**0:22:29-0:22:35:**  The reason I say that I believe civil pastures are in many ways more resilient than treeless  
**0:22:35-0:22:44:**  pastures is that, well, I'll point out some examples that come to mind in the context  
**0:22:44-0:22:47:**  of our farms here in New York and in Argentina.  
**0:22:47-0:22:58:**  The trees certainly add plant diversity to the grazing system and along with that plant  
**0:22:58-0:23:02:**  diversity comes soil microbial diversity.  
**0:23:02-0:23:16:**  We also have these large plants called trees that might handle weather extremes such as  
**0:23:16-0:23:23:**  droughts better than our small plants like the grasses and forbs.  
**0:23:23-0:23:36:**  But I feel that civil pastures have a high degree of, I think of it as biomimicry.  
**0:23:36-0:23:47:**  These are grazing systems that simulate natural savanna-like ecosystems and they don't require  
**0:23:47-0:24:00:**  a lot of energy input to maintain trees naturally want to grow in this part of the world.  
**0:24:00-0:24:10:**  In many areas where we graze, forest is just part of the natural vegetative landscape.  
**0:24:10-0:24:16:**  So instead of spending a lot of energy trying to keep the woody plants from growing back  
**0:24:16-0:24:21:**  into our pastures, I think of civil pasturing as a way of just working with those woody  
**0:24:21-0:24:25:**  plants that want to naturally occur in our pastures.  
**0:24:25-0:24:33:**  BRET, I'm curious to understand, obviously you need some flexibility to be able to bring  
**0:24:33-0:24:38:**  the animals in at some point and then exclude them from a silver pasture at other points.  
**0:24:38-0:24:44:**  So how much out of your total acreage, how much do you have of kind of straight pasture  
**0:24:44-0:24:50:**  and how much do you have in silver pasture?  
**0:24:50-0:24:57:**  So on our farm here in New York, our farm is about half silver pasture and half open  
**0:24:57-0:24:58:**  pasture.  
**0:24:58-0:25:08:**  We're grazing a total of almost 500 acres and so half of that is silver pasture.  
**0:25:08-0:25:15:**  And our long term goal though is to have the entire 500 acres look like silver pasture.  
**0:25:15-0:25:23:**  Some of it is going to be plantation silver pasture where we planted the trees into pasture  
**0:25:23-0:25:34:**  and other portions of it is where we've taken a naturally existing woods or forest and thinned  
**0:25:34-0:25:40:**  it out and managed it in a way that we could grow forages underneath it as well.  
**0:25:40-0:25:48:**  And I think that those two directions of silver pasturing exist all across the world.  
**0:25:48-0:25:54:**  By contrast though, where our ranch is in Argentina, even though that's a high rainfall  
**0:25:54-0:26:04:**  area of receiving about 1000 millimeters of rain a year, the Argentines like to joke that  
**0:26:04-0:26:12:**  God gave them great soil and climate and moisture but then forgot to put the trees there.  
**0:26:12-0:26:21:**  So they almost saw it as like their duty to finish the job and incorporate large afforestations  
**0:26:21-0:26:26:**  into these natural rangelands.  
**0:26:26-0:26:32:**  I think of it as a real win-win situation there.  
**0:26:32-0:26:36:**  It certainly changed the appearance of the landscape to see forest where there really  
**0:26:36-0:26:43:**  wasn't forest before but it's been so beneficial both from an environmental standpoint and  
**0:26:43-0:26:49:**  also a social and economic development standpoint.  
**0:26:49-0:26:55:**  Actually I was curious, it's really interesting what you're telling us, but I'm wondering  
**0:26:55-0:27:00:**  you don't see the need to then keep some part of your farm as a straight pasture.  
**0:27:00-0:27:05:**  I'm thinking of some objections sometimes, I remember hearing some objections to silver  
**0:27:05-0:27:11:**  pasture in the sense that having trees makes it harder to cut hay and to dry it homogeneously.  
**0:27:11-0:27:18:**  And I'm just wondering if you would see any point in keeping full pasture to have that  
**0:27:18-0:27:25:**  diversity of ecosystems and use it for managing the cattle.  
**0:27:25-0:27:34:**  I feel that there's always good reasons and benefits to keeping a little bit of everything  
**0:27:34-0:27:37:**  on a farm ecosystem.  
**0:27:37-0:27:44:**  And you're right in that if we were trying to produce hay in the same silver pasture  
**0:27:44-0:27:49:**  areas the trees would be a bit of an impediment.  
**0:27:49-0:27:55:**  Much of our hay production to feed our animals in the wintertime is done on leased land and  
**0:27:55-0:28:03:**  we just happen to lease that land from neighbors that have no interest in alley cropping or  
**0:28:03-0:28:11:**  silver pasturing or putting any trees into their hay fields and that's fine with us.  
**0:28:11-0:28:17:**  But here in upstate New York we really farm in the forest.  
**0:28:17-0:28:24:**  So we have trees, two-thirds of New York State is covered by forest land so our agricultural  
**0:28:24-0:28:28:**  land is really the minority of the landscape.  
**0:28:28-0:28:38:**  But in terms of the grazing, which is the focus of what we do on both of our farms,  
**0:28:38-0:28:46:**  we feel that the silver pastures give us the greatest good for every acre of land versus  
**0:28:46-0:28:55:**  managing it as simply as woods or as treeless pasture.  
**0:28:55-0:29:03:**  And if we manage our silver pastures well I feel that we can still be getting largely  
**0:29:03-0:29:14:**  the same benefits in terms of plant diversity and richness and wildlife habitat but we're  
**0:29:14-0:29:22:**  in essence layering multiple beneficial production systems on top of each other.  
**0:29:22-0:29:32:**  So we have a productive forest growing together with a productive pasture and then the animals  
**0:29:32-0:29:43:**  are able to utilize both the trees and the forages, primarily the forages, but our animals  
**0:29:43-0:29:49:**  do browse in our silver pasture systems as well.  
**0:29:49-0:29:55:**  The animals benefit even more so though from the trees just from the shelter and the shade  
**0:29:55-0:29:56:**  that they get.  
**0:29:56-0:30:02:**  And if you look at any grazing animal, it doesn't matter if it's black cattle like ours  
**0:30:02-0:30:14:**  or white sheep or goats, any time it's much above 70 degrees Fahrenheit or about 22 degrees  
**0:30:14-0:30:18:**  Celsius the animals are seeking out shade.  
**0:30:18-0:30:27:**  So just watch what your animals do in warmer weather and you quickly realize that silver  
**0:30:27-0:30:32:**  pastures are providing those animals with what they really want which is to get out  
**0:30:32-0:30:35:**  of the hot sun and be comfortable.  
**0:30:35-0:30:41:**  Well actually this is the next set of questions is really trying to understand the benefits  
**0:30:41-0:30:46:**  from the perspective of the animals but before we go there I kind of wanted to conclude this  
**0:30:46-0:30:53:**  section on trees and the sections where you are planting trees into pasture, what kind  
**0:30:53-0:30:58:**  of spacing are you using?  
**0:30:58-0:31:07:**  We've planted extensively on both farms here in New York and in central Argentina and the  
**0:31:07-0:31:14:**  spacing and the design of the planting really depends on the species that you're planting  
**0:31:14-0:31:24:**  but also on the site quality and also thinking about the eventual uses or markets for the  
**0:31:24-0:31:26:**  trees that you're planting.  
**0:31:26-0:31:34:**  To give you an example, here in New York we typically planted a much tighter spacing,  
**0:31:34-0:31:41:**  probably something less than 3 by 3 meters on average and that's because we feel that  
**0:31:41-0:31:47:**  we will have the opportunity to go in and harvest those trees at a fairly young age  
**0:31:47-0:31:55:**  or small size to start thinning out these young plantations and planting more trees  
**0:31:55-0:32:02:**  initially per hectare gives us more options in terms of nurturing and selecting and leaving  
**0:32:02-0:32:04:**  the best trees.  
**0:32:04-0:32:14:**  On our ranch in Argentina, 4 by 4 meter spacing is about the minimum spacing that we would  
**0:32:14-0:32:17:**  use now and that's for two reasons primarily.  
**0:32:17-0:32:23:**  One is that there are no markets that allow us to go in and profitably thin out young  
**0:32:23-0:32:32:**  plantations so we want to delay that thinning as long as possible in hopes that we can do  
**0:32:32-0:32:38:**  it when we can at least break even by selling the trees that are being initially thinned  
**0:32:38-0:32:39:**  out.  
**0:32:39-0:32:44:**  With thinning, we use the term thinning in forestry the same as a gardener would use  
**0:32:44-0:32:45:**  the term weeding.  
**0:32:45-0:32:51:**  So when I say thinning, I'm talking about really weeding out the young forest that we've  
**0:32:51-0:32:58:**  created and the other reason though that we have a fairly wide spacing when we're planting  
**0:32:58-0:33:09:**  these mostly pine mixtures in central Argentina is because pine is a sun loving tree species  
**0:33:09-0:33:17:**  and it really the growth of it can slow down very quickly if it starts to get too crowded  
**0:33:17-0:33:24:**  amongst itself so we want to plant it at a nice wide spacing.  
**0:33:24-0:33:29:**  The pine species that we're using there are ones that come largely from the southeastern  
**0:33:29-0:33:39:**  United States like slash and loblolly pine, pinus ilioti and pinus taeda and those trees  
**0:33:39-0:33:45:**  don't need a lot of competition or crowding to grow nice and straight and prune their  
**0:33:45-0:33:53:**  lower branches naturally whereas many hardwood species like oak for example or walnut that  
**0:33:53-0:33:58:**  you would commonly see in silvopasture plantings if we don't plant them with enough density  
**0:33:58-0:34:04:**  they want to grow like a big bushy tree and we would have to invest a lot of time and  
**0:34:04-0:34:09:**  money into correctively pruning those trees.  
**0:34:09-0:34:15:**  And that's actually one of my questions is what kind of impact can you expect on tree  
**0:34:15-0:34:21:**  growth and quality when you include animals in the management of your forest and by that  
**0:34:21-0:34:27:**  I mean both by thinning an existing woods and including in forestry practices and also  
**0:34:27-0:34:32:**  when you're planting out trees in silvopasture systems in the pasture.  
**0:34:32-0:34:40:**  The livestock play a essential role in both our New York and our Argentine silvopastures  
**0:34:40-0:34:54:**  in Argentina the greatest risk to our trees there is fire in the winter time.  
**0:34:54-0:34:58:**  Even though we get a thousand millimeters of rain that rain comes from spring through  
**0:34:58-0:35:12:**  fall and then we have a very notable dry period in the winter and fire is the constant challenge  
**0:35:12-0:35:21:**  and if it wasn't for the grazing animals that go in there and eat a lot of the grass and  
**0:35:21-0:35:25:**  control the fuel loads the fire risk would be much greater.  
**0:35:25-0:35:35:**  Here in New York our biggest challenge are the non-native so-called invasive species  
**0:35:35-0:35:42:**  and every time there's a disturbance in our woods or our silvopasture whether it's a human  
**0:35:42-0:35:48:**  caused disturbance like we went in there and thinned trees out or weeded trees out or it's  
**0:35:48-0:35:56:**  a naturally occurring disturbance such as a windstorm blew some of the trees down or  
**0:35:56-0:36:03:**  a non-native pest like currently we're losing all of our ash trees in this area because  
**0:36:03-0:36:09:**  of a non-native pest called emerald ash borer but anytime there's this disturbance and more  
**0:36:09-0:36:15:**  sunlight reaches the ground level plants start to grow and it's not just grasses and clover  
**0:36:15-0:36:24:**  and baby oak trees it's grasses and clover and lots of stuff that we really don't want  
**0:36:24-0:36:33:**  overrunning the landscape like multiflora rose or European buckthorn is another very  
**0:36:33-0:36:40:**  common problematic species here but we have native species as well that can just overtake  
**0:36:40-0:36:50:**  an area if not managed so the livestock in both of those cases though is really our workforce  
**0:36:50-0:37:00:**  that is helping us manage that vegetation to have a healthier more productive and lower  
**0:37:00-0:37:06:**  risk system than if the animals were not there.  
**0:37:06-0:37:13:**  I can imagine as well that the activation of the nutrient cycles right by with the manure  
**0:37:13-0:37:18:**  that there is that also accelerating somehow?  
**0:37:18-0:37:25:**  That's an interesting question I believe that there is in a well-managed silvopasture there's  
**0:37:25-0:37:36:**  going to be a symbiosis between the animals the forages in the trees an area that's probably  
**0:37:36-0:37:50:**  very understudied is this nutrient cycling between the livestock and the plants any grazing  
**0:37:50-0:38:02:**  animal needs three crucial things to survive they need food they need water and they need  
**0:38:02-0:38:13:**  minerals and I've read that a good portion of the minerals that are being given to livestock  
**0:38:13-0:38:21:**  are passed through the livestock and so there's no doubt that there's going to be some importing  
**0:38:21-0:38:27:**  of minerals and nutrients just through that grazing to what extent those minerals and  
**0:38:27-0:38:36:**  nutrients actually benefit the trees I'm not aware of any studies at least not here in  
**0:38:36-0:38:43:**  New York or Argentina where they've looked at that but I think over time you're going  
**0:38:43-0:38:51:**  to see an increase in soil health so I think of silvopasturing as a very regenerative system  
**0:38:51-0:39:01:**  and that's certainly the case for us in Argentina where the trees are providing a huge amount  
**0:39:01-0:39:05:**  of organic matter input to the soils in a relatively short period of time and that organic  
**0:39:05-0:39:15:**  matter is a big part of what helps increase the capacity for the soil to retain that moisture  
**0:39:15-0:39:22:**  that we get in those hard summer storms and allow it to infiltrate.  
**0:39:22-0:39:29:**  Okay very interesting there's so many things that we would love to go in more depth about  
**0:39:29-0:39:33:**  on basically every sentence that you say and that's not really possible because it would  
**0:39:33-0:39:41:**  just be a 25-hour podcast but we wanted to go back to what Etienne had mentioned earlier  
**0:39:41-0:39:46:**  on which is the or to move on to what Etienne had mentioned which is looking more about  
**0:39:46-0:39:52:**  you know how the animals behave and looking more the animal aspects inside the silvopasture  
**0:39:52-0:39:57:**  system and you started talking about it a bit when you mentioned you know the behavior  
**0:39:57-0:40:02:**  of the animals when they are stressed for example and they attack the they eat the bark  
**0:40:02-0:40:08:**  of the trees creating damage so in a more general way how do cattle how does cattle  
**0:40:08-0:40:16:**  behavior change when it's put inside a silvopasture system as compared to a simple a pasture system  
**0:40:16-0:40:21:**  for example?  
**0:40:21-0:40:26:**  I'm trying to think of animal behavior is really that much different in a open pasture  
**0:40:26-0:40:34:**  versus a silvopasture I think the first thing you notice though is that animals seek out  
**0:40:34-0:40:40:**  the plants that appeal to them and it may not be really a conscious effort to seek out  
**0:40:40-0:40:50:**  those plants grazing animals have strong sensory feedback systems so often when we move our  
**0:40:50-0:40:55:**  animals into a fresh silvopasture area which is pretty much every day on the farm here  
**0:40:55-0:41:03:**  in New York the first five to ten minutes many of the animals spend browsing woody plants  
**0:41:03-0:41:12:**  it might be low hanging tree branches it might be shrubs it might be rose bush but it might  
**0:41:12-0:41:17:**  be young tree seedlings that are trying to come up but there's something in that woody  
**0:41:17-0:41:24:**  browse that those animals are craving I don't know what it is I don't think the animals  
**0:41:24-0:41:32:**  know what it is but it's probably minerals and nutrients that are less available in the  
**0:41:32-0:41:39:**  grass and forbs and then after maybe a few minutes of that then the animals turn their  
**0:41:39-0:41:46:**  attention towards grazing the other plants the herbaceous plants or the forage plants  
**0:41:46-0:41:54:**  and they often then go back after a while and eat a little bit more browse so the animals  
**0:41:54-0:42:06:**  have this very strong innate ability to seek out whatever is best for their needs and that's  
**0:42:06-0:42:13:**  something that silvopastures offer very well is just that wider variety of plants that  
**0:42:13-0:42:22:**  they can choose and select from another thing though that we see in our silvopastures in  
**0:42:22-0:42:29:**  both ends of the world is that the animals they have fairly uniform shade it's ideally  
**0:42:29-0:42:34:**  light shade because we still need enough dappled sunlight or filtered sunlight reaching the  
**0:42:34-0:42:43:**  ground to productively grow forage plants but the animals are comfortable grazing throughout  
**0:42:43-0:42:52:**  the entire pasture area because it's shaded throughout whereas when we turn the animals  
**0:42:52-0:42:58:**  into one of our pastures that does not have trees or only has trees along the edge they'll  
**0:42:58-0:43:05:**  eat for a little while but then they're either clumping together trying to seek some protection  
**0:43:05-0:43:11:**  from each other for flies or they're trying to seek out the little bit of shade that there  
**0:43:11-0:43:19:**  might be on the edge of the pasture so you get less clumping together of the animals  
**0:43:19-0:43:26:**  or congregation of the animals in silvopasture areas.  
**0:43:26-0:43:35:**  That's really interesting and do you you mentioned so we would call it tree fodder as we usually  
**0:43:35-0:43:41:**  hear about it when they're eating from when they're browsing from the perennial plants  
**0:43:41-0:43:47:**  that are around do you have techniques to make those more available for example you  
**0:43:47-0:43:53:**  know in the in the peak of the summer when the grasses are a bit less vigorous do you  
**0:43:53-0:43:57:**  come in and do you do you manage the forest in a way to make available some of the leaves  
**0:43:57-0:44:02:**  of the of the various trees there for example?  
**0:44:02-0:44:13:**  Fodder systems are prevalent throughout the entire grazing world we do not use much on  
**0:44:13-0:44:18:**  either of our silvopasturing operations in New York or Argentina for the simple reason  
**0:44:18-0:44:25:**  that we don't have a lot of extra time so I think fodder I think of fodder systems is  
**0:44:25-0:44:32:**  fairly management intensive fairly time intensive because you have to be out there pruning trees  
**0:44:32-0:44:42:**  or managing the trees for that fodder and we let the animals do the work for themselves  
**0:44:42-0:44:51:**  so now one exception to that was this past summer we had a historic drought here in New  
**0:44:51-0:44:59:**  York we received only about a quarter of the normal rainfall from late spring till early  
**0:44:59-0:45:06:**  fall that we would normally receive and as a result of that our pastures were much less  
**0:45:06-0:45:12:**  productive than normal so towards the end of the summer where the pasture was really  
**0:45:12-0:45:19:**  struggling to keep up with the rotation we decided that we were going to cut a bunch  
**0:45:19-0:45:25:**  of the small trees trees that we had intended to gradually thin out of our silvopastures  
**0:45:25-0:45:33:**  anyhow the last major thinning that we did in our silvopastures was in 2015 so five years  
**0:45:33-0:45:39:**  ago and in that five year period the trees continued to grow and the sunlight levels  
**0:45:39-0:45:45:**  at the ground level where we needed that sunlight to grow forage had continued to diminish so  
**0:45:45-0:45:53:**  it was we were due to do another thinning in our silvopastures and the drought became  
**0:45:53-0:46:00:**  the perfect opportunity to do that thinning because we went out every day and spent an  
**0:46:00-0:46:06:**  hour cutting small trees but when I say small trees I'm not talking about nice young trees  
**0:46:06-0:46:14:**  with high potential for the future I'm talking about the suppressed trees the slow growing  
**0:46:14-0:46:24:**  trees the defective trees the trees that needed to be called out and by cutting maybe somewhere  
**0:46:24-0:46:32:**  between 50 and 150 of these small trees every day it not only supplemented the cattle with  
**0:46:32-0:46:38:**  something green and nutritious but it also gave them something to do and help take the  
**0:46:38-0:46:43:**  pressure off the other forage plants.  
**0:46:43-0:46:53:**  Okay and just to clarify outside of this context the plants that they're browsing on are just  
**0:46:53-0:47:00:**  the brush and the young seedlings that are the regrowth that's low and that's available  
**0:47:00-0:47:01:**  right?  
**0:47:01-0:47:11:**  No, no not so what they're normally grazing on the silvopasture would be herbaceous plants  
**0:47:11-0:47:21:**  so grasses and forbs there are woody plants scattered and beyond the trees there are woody  
**0:47:21-0:47:27:**  plants scattered throughout our silvopasture some are shrubs some are invasive shrubs some  
**0:47:27-0:47:40:**  are seedlings or saplings that's to say young trees but the majority of the forage base  
**0:47:40-0:47:47:**  is in the form of herbaceous plants.  
**0:47:47-0:47:53:**  And talking about these herbaceous plants I was wondering how do they differ from the  
**0:47:53-0:47:59:**  ones in open pasture because I assume you've been able to observe differences both in terms  
**0:47:59-0:48:05:**  of the types of forages that develop in the shade and maybe in terms of quantity and quality  
**0:48:05-0:48:09:**  as well?  
**0:48:09-0:48:17:**  That's a good observation and you know the tricky part of doing this when I'm talking about  
**0:48:17-0:48:23:**  two really different types of silvopasture and two really different parts of the world  
**0:48:23-0:48:28:**  is that you get a different answer for both of our farms.  
**0:48:28-0:48:41:**  So what we observe growing in our silvopastures here in New York is similar to what we would  
**0:48:41-0:48:47:**  see in the treeless pastures but most of our forage plants here in New York are what we  
**0:48:47-0:48:50:**  call cool season forages.  
**0:48:50-0:48:58:**  They grow very well in May and September that's to say late spring and early fall that's where  
**0:48:58-0:49:02:**  almost all the annual growth of those plants occur.  
**0:49:02-0:49:10:**  So these same plants grow very little if at all during the hot summer period.  
**0:49:10-0:49:17:**  Under the silvopastures we see the same cool season forages but they tend to behave a little  
**0:49:17-0:49:25:**  differently in that they often start growing about the same time in the spring but they  
**0:49:25-0:49:32:**  continue growing later into the early summer and I would attribute that to it just simply  
**0:49:32-0:49:38:**  being cooler, moister, shadier in the silvopastures.  
**0:49:38-0:49:43:**  The studies that have been done in this part of the world show that the ground temperatures  
**0:49:43-0:49:50:**  average about 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit cooler at the soil surface in a silvopasture  
**0:49:50-0:49:53:**  versus in a treeless pasture.  
**0:49:53-0:50:01:**  That makes sense, likewise those same cool season forages will often start to grow back  
**0:50:01-0:50:09:**  a little bit earlier in the summer as long as they haven't run out of moisture.  
**0:50:09-0:50:15:**  So I think we're extending both the spring and the fall growth period for our cool season  
**0:50:15-0:50:26:**  forages by probably two to three weeks in both of those periods in our silvopastures  
**0:50:26-0:50:39:**  and that is what offsets possibly slightly lower overall growth of those same forages  
**0:50:39-0:50:43:**  simply because they're growing in less sunlight.  
**0:50:43-0:50:48:**  However many cool season forages grow better in light shade than they do in full sun.  
**0:50:48-0:50:57:**  So in Argentina in our silvopastures there what we've noticed over the years is a transition  
**0:50:57-0:51:06:**  from what I call wire grasses or bunch grasses and these are small very coarse high silica  
**0:51:06-0:51:16:**  type grasses that can tolerate the hot exposed conditions in soil that has very low organic  
**0:51:16-0:51:27:**  matter and under the pine silvopastures so the grasses and forbs that start to dominate  
**0:51:27-0:51:35:**  our broad season grasses and some are cool season grasses, others are just broadleaf  
**0:51:35-0:51:38:**  warm season grasses.  
**0:51:38-0:51:42:**  Many of the warm season grasses though tend to have a lower degree of shade tolerance  
**0:51:42-0:51:46:**  than cool season grasses.  
**0:51:46-0:51:53:**  I'm wondering does the increase in terms of growth later in the season when they're benefiting  
**0:51:53-0:52:00:**  from shade and cool is that offset by the fact that they might start growing slower  
**0:52:00-0:52:04:**  at the beginning of the season for the exact same reasons that the soil might take a longer  
**0:52:04-0:52:08:**  time to warm up?  
**0:52:08-0:52:15:**  I don't think the spring growth period starts any later in our silvopastures and that's  
**0:52:15-0:52:21:**  because these grasses are normally starting to grow well before the tree leaves come out  
**0:52:21-0:52:31:**  so I really don't think that the trees are keeping the soil that much cooler in the early  
**0:52:31-0:52:37:**  to mid spring period when the forage plants are starting to wake up.  
**0:52:37-0:52:46:**  It's not really until they leaf out that they're having any appreciable effect on the soil  
**0:52:46-0:52:48:**  temperature.  
**0:52:48-0:52:58:**  I have not closely compared the green up period between the silvopastures and the open pastures  
**0:52:58-0:53:03:**  but I would say that they're just about the same.  
**0:53:03-0:53:09:**  If there's any difference though it would be mostly just because you might encounter  
**0:53:09-0:53:17:**  some plants growing in the silvopastures that green up early, plants that might not be as  
**0:53:17-0:53:25:**  prevalent out in the open pastures.  
**0:53:25-0:53:32:**  There's largely an overlap in the grass and forb species but there are some that seem  
**0:53:32-0:53:37:**  to be more common in the silvopastures.  
**0:53:37-0:53:45:**  I wanted to know if you had maybe measured Brix levels in the forages for similar plants  
**0:53:45-0:53:48:**  that are underneath the trees, yes, underneath the pasture.  
**0:53:48-0:53:53:**  I would be curious to know if there's like a difference in their sugar content for example  
**0:53:53-0:53:59:**  because from what I understand we don't graze animals on our farm but this is something  
**0:53:59-0:54:07:**  that graziers measure quite often to measure the quality of their pasture.  
**0:54:07-0:54:14:**  So I'm not aware of anybody who has compared Brix levels from silvopasture forages to open  
**0:54:14-0:54:17:**  pasture forages.  
**0:54:17-0:54:23:**  I think you're right in that you might see slightly lower Brix levels in the light shade  
**0:54:23-0:54:32:**  of silvopastures but I've never read or heard anybody who has taken the time to compare.  
**0:54:32-0:54:39:**  We do not measure the Brix levels in our forages because we just do the best management possible  
**0:54:39-0:54:42:**  and it is what it is.  
**0:54:42-0:54:47:**  So likewise we don't measure or we don't test our hay quality.  
**0:54:47-0:54:52:**  We just go out and try to harvest and grow the best hay that we can to feed our cattle  
**0:54:52-0:54:58:**  in the winter and testing it would give us useful information but it isn't going to change  
**0:54:58-0:55:00:**  the quality of our hay.  
**0:55:00-0:55:04:**  I was going to ask a question a bit along the same lines but you might not have the  
**0:55:04-0:55:06:**  answer and that's totally okay.  
**0:55:06-0:55:12:**  But I remember reading that some crops had a higher protein level when they were growing  
**0:55:12-0:55:18:**  in partial shade and I'm wondering if some studies have come out showing that quality  
**0:55:18-0:55:23:**  is higher in terms of protein for forages growing in partial shade.  
**0:55:23-0:55:33:**  Yeah, so forage quality is not my area of expertise but you're right in that light shade  
**0:55:33-0:55:38:**  can boost crude protein levels in some forage plants.  
**0:55:38-0:55:47:**  I don't believe it's a uniform reaction amongst all forage plants but the other way that shade  
**0:55:47-0:55:59:**  can affect forage quality is that heat stress can lignify many forage plants.  
**0:55:59-0:56:12:**  So I've heard experts on forage quality say that there's less lignification and greater  
**0:56:12-0:56:20:**  digestibility in forages that are growing in lightly shaded silvopastures but I have  
**0:56:20-0:56:30:**  no data or personal experience of my own to really say that that's true.  
**0:56:30-0:56:41:**  We were curious to find out how basically what are the skills and also the type of equipment  
**0:56:41-0:56:51:**  that a farmer or rancher needs in order to shift from grazing animals on pasture to grazing  
**0:56:51-0:57:00:**  animals in a silvopasture system or in a wood.  
**0:57:00-0:57:07:**  So the grazing skills are the most important and I would expect any livestock farmer to  
**0:57:07-0:57:15:**  be able to develop the necessary grazing skills to manage their silvopastures well.  
**0:57:15-0:57:24:**  The forestry skills and knowledge, that's something that it's useful to have a basic  
**0:57:24-0:57:33:**  understanding of how trees grow and forestry principles but in many areas you can find  
**0:57:33-0:57:44:**  forestry experts, we call them consulting foresters and that's what they do.  
**0:57:44-0:57:52:**  They're there to help you figure out how to achieve your objectives with regards to your  
**0:57:52-0:57:53:**  woods.  
**0:57:53-0:58:03:**  So when we think of silvopasturing as taking an existing plantation or natural existing  
**0:58:03-0:58:12:**  woods and managing it in a way or thinning out trees to develop it into a productive  
**0:58:12-0:58:21:**  silvopasture, that could be a very daunting task if you don't feel comfortable with woodlot  
**0:58:21-0:58:24:**  management or forest management.  
**0:58:24-0:58:32:**  In that case I would seek out a local expert or professional and utilize the expertise  
**0:58:32-0:58:40:**  of that forester to get that part of the project done and done well.  
**0:58:40-0:58:49:**  Okay, and are there different types of equipment that we need to use?  
**0:58:49-0:58:56:**  For example, I'm thinking of moving fencing in rotational grazing, that's one of the big  
**0:58:56-0:59:02:**  challenges on pasture and I can just imagine it being even more challenging in a forest  
**0:59:02-0:59:04:**  context.  
**0:59:04-0:59:11:**  So, setting up and moving fencing in an open pasture is challenging enough and it's even  
**0:59:11-0:59:20:**  more so in silvopastures, not only because of the more limited access but anybody who  
**0:59:20-0:59:28:**  uses portable fencing like Electronet realizes that Electronet likes to catch on or snag  
**0:59:28-0:59:33:**  on every little tree and branch and stump.  
**0:59:33-0:59:41:**  So Electronet is an awesome tool for grazing many livestock species, especially the more  
**0:59:41-0:59:47:**  difficult to control species like pigs or goats or sheep.  
**0:59:47-0:59:54:**  And all livestock species can be very useful in silvopastures but one of the reasons that  
**0:59:54-1:00:00:**  we raise primarily cattle in our silvopastures is that they're very easy to contain or keep  
**1:00:00-1:00:06:**  fenced in with single strands of electrified fence.  
**1:00:06-1:00:11:**  If we were going to go back to raising sheep and goats, we used to raise a lot of sheep  
**1:00:11-1:00:19:**  and goats on our farm or expand our pig production, we would probably be using Electronet fencing  
**1:00:19-1:00:27:**  and Electronet, if I had to put up Electronet in my silvopastures, I would have dedicated  
**1:00:27-1:00:33:**  alleyways or trails where we set that fence up because I'm not going to try to set up  
**1:00:33-1:00:38:**  Electronet in a brushy, woody silvopasture.  
**1:00:38-1:00:48:**  Brett, could you give us a bit of a comparison between a normal rotational grazing in pasture  
**1:00:48-1:00:54:**  and in silvopasture, especially on the elements of stocking density and the timing of moving  
**1:00:54-1:00:57:**  them around?  
**1:00:57-1:01:06:**  In both of our silvopastures and open pastures, we try to periodically graze at a very high  
**1:01:06-1:01:11:**  density and that might only be during one rotation or part of a rotation every grazing  
**1:01:11-1:01:12:**  season.  
**1:01:12-1:01:18:**  And the reason that we do so goes back to what I was saying earlier about using livestock  
**1:01:18-1:01:26:**  impact as your main tool to manage the vegetation in a silvopasture area.  
**1:01:26-1:01:32:**  If I don't graze at a high enough density in my open pastures and they become very weedy  
**1:01:32-1:01:40:**  or we start to see an encroachment of woody plants, we can go out there with machinery  
**1:01:40-1:01:46:**  or chemicals or some other method and correct that.  
**1:01:46-1:01:51:**  It's much more difficult to do so in silvopastures because we can't go out there and just readily  
**1:01:51-1:01:57:**  mow or reseed.  
**1:01:57-1:02:02:**  But achieving high density in silvopastures is more challenging than in open pastures  
**1:02:02-1:02:08:**  because animals tend to avoid all the little objects that are in the way, the trees, the  
**1:02:08-1:02:11:**  stumps, the tree branches, the shrubs.  
**1:02:11-1:02:22:**  So in order to get about the same impact in a treeless pasture versus a silvopasture,  
**1:02:22-1:02:26:**  you would actually have to have a much higher density.  
**1:02:26-1:02:34:**  And consequently, here in New York we've come to accept that we often cannot get a high  
**1:02:34-1:02:40:**  enough density to control the really noxious and problematic plants in our silvopastures  
**1:02:40-1:02:47:**  during the growing portion of the year, the green portion of the year.  
**1:02:47-1:02:55:**  So what we try to do there is utilize our rotational bale grazing in the winter to target  
**1:02:55-1:02:58:**  those undesirable plants.  
**1:02:58-1:03:05:**  And a very common example on our farm are the invasive blackberries and the multiflora  
**1:03:05-1:03:07:**  rose.  
**1:03:07-1:03:14:**  So we like to put round bales in the center of those patches of soft brush.  
**1:03:14-1:03:20:**  And a friend of mine, another forester, an agroforester by the name of Joe Orrifici calls  
**1:03:20-1:03:22:**  them bale bombs.  
**1:03:22-1:03:28:**  And I think that's a great image where you're putting this round bale that then draws maybe  
**1:03:28-1:03:34:**  up to a couple dozen hungry cows to stand around it for hours at a time devouring that  
**1:03:34-1:03:40:**  400 kilo round bale.  
**1:03:40-1:03:48:**  And you're creating well over a million pounds per acre of density for that period of time,  
**1:03:48-1:03:54:**  which is much higher than we can achieve even through the best intensive rotational grazing  
**1:03:54-1:03:55:**  in the summertime.  
**1:03:55-1:04:03:**  So it's just a way of using something that we had to be doing anyhow, which is feeding  
**1:04:03-1:04:09:**  hay to our cows during the four months of winter that we have to feed hay and doing  
**1:04:09-1:04:13:**  it in a way that it helps improve our silvopastures.  
**1:04:13-1:04:20:**  The other nice thing about feeding the hay in our silvopastures when the ground is frozen,  
**1:04:20-1:04:27:**  we try to stay out of there if things are soft and muddy, is that every place where  
**1:04:27-1:04:33:**  we feed a bale of hay, we're importing nutrients and seed and organic matter.  
**1:04:33-1:04:39:**  And that in turn helps create a new patch of nice lush grass.  
**1:04:39-1:04:49:**  And that grass will also help keep the undesirable woody plants from coming back in in that spot.  
**1:04:49-1:04:56:**  So to give you a personal illustration from the farm in New York, we across the 500 acres,  
**1:04:56-1:05:01:**  we have about 130 permanent paddocks.  
**1:05:01-1:05:11:**  And so if the animals are moving daily, that's on paper about a four month rest and recovery  
**1:05:11-1:05:12:**  period.  
**1:05:12-1:05:20:**  So the animals are only grazing on any given acre of our farm or any given paddock, just  
**1:05:20-1:05:27:**  a handful of times throughout the entire grazing season.  
**1:05:27-1:05:36:**  And having that many paddocks not only allows us to graze at a very high density, but it  
**1:05:36-1:05:41:**  also gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of when we put animals where.  
**1:05:41-1:05:51:**  So if the animals are about to move into some silvopasture areas, but that happens to be  
**1:05:51-1:05:58:**  the same week that we get very high rainfalls and the ground is very saturated, we can bounce  
**1:05:58-1:06:04:**  them in a different direction and then maybe delay moving into that silvopasture till the  
**1:06:04-1:06:10:**  ground conditions improve again.  
**1:06:10-1:06:17:**  In the summertime, we expect ground conditions to change very quickly in the winter.  
**1:06:17-1:06:25:**  Where we are now, the ground conditions change more slowly.  
**1:06:25-1:06:31:**  There's periods where it freezes up and then we have frozen ground, which is very resistant  
**1:06:31-1:06:38:**  to compaction, but we might also have weeks of soft, muddy conditions.  
**1:06:38-1:06:46:**  Brett to kind of conclude this interview, would you mind giving us a bit of a step by  
**1:06:46-1:06:52:**  step how-to of establishing a silvopasture system?  
**1:06:52-1:06:58:**  When we're establishing silvopastures in areas where we already have trees, either trees  
**1:06:58-1:07:03:**  that we planted or trees that nature put there for us, there's three steps.  
**1:07:03-1:07:10:**  The first step is that we have to thin those trees out to allow a sufficient level of sunlight  
**1:07:10-1:07:12:**  to reach the ground.  
**1:07:12-1:07:19:**  And what we're doing there really is we're reallocating sunlight from all the trees that  
**1:07:19-1:07:23:**  occur to just the best trees that occur.  
**1:07:23-1:07:29:**  And the great news about silvopasturing is that we can often be growing just as many  
**1:07:29-1:07:39:**  good trees per hectare as if we were managing it strictly as a woods or for timber production.  
**1:07:39-1:07:47:**  And here in New York, and it's really about the same numbers in Argentina, we're really  
**1:07:47-1:07:56:**  trying to grow the best 30 to 50 trees per acre, so roughly the best 100 or so trees  
**1:07:56-1:07:59:**  per hectare.  
**1:07:59-1:08:06:**  But when we take out all of those lower quality trees and the slower growing trees, the rut  
**1:08:06-1:08:14:**  trees, the suppressed trees, the defective trees, the diseased trees, then instead of  
**1:08:14-1:08:20:**  giving that sunlight to those less desirable trees, we can then give it to the forage plants  
**1:08:20-1:08:21:**  on the ground.  
**1:08:21-1:08:27:**  So the first step is thinning out the woods to reallocate sunlight to the ground level.  
**1:08:27-1:08:35:**  The second step is creating conditions so that forage plants will germinate in the silvopasture  
**1:08:35-1:08:37:**  understory.  
**1:08:37-1:08:44:**  And in order for that to happen, we have to be thinking about some soil scarification,  
**1:08:44-1:08:45:**  but not too much.  
**1:08:45-1:08:52:**  We don't want deep rutting or mud, but we often need to have some soil scarification  
**1:08:52-1:08:58:**  because many of our forage seeds will not germinate well if there's a thick layer of  
**1:08:58-1:09:04:**  undecomposed pine needles or oak leaves on top of the soil surface.  
**1:09:04-1:09:07:**  That's like having a mulch layer on top of the soil.  
**1:09:07-1:09:13:**  So the timing for going in and doing the thinning can be very important to make sure that we  
**1:09:13-1:09:19:**  get adequate soil scarification.  
**1:09:19-1:09:25:**  In a common situation that happens here in New York is that we do a lot of our forest  
**1:09:25-1:09:31:**  thinning in the winter time, often on frozen ground and on top of snow.  
**1:09:31-1:09:38:**  And if that's the case, when spring comes, we thin the woods out, but we still have that  
**1:09:38-1:09:47:**  thick leaf layer we call the duff layer and we're just not going to get good germination.  
**1:09:47-1:09:52:**  Now sometimes it helps to go in and do some sort of supplemental seeding, either just  
**1:09:52-1:09:56:**  before harvesting or just after harvesting.  
**1:09:56-1:10:01:**  It's often more easy to do it just before harvesting because now you don't have to contend  
**1:10:01-1:10:08:**  with all the tree tops or logging debris, we call that slash that's in the way.  
**1:10:08-1:10:16:**  Plus the logging activity can help incorporate that forage seed into the soil surface.  
**1:10:16-1:10:22:**  But in many farm woodlots and plantations, there's already a good existing seed bank  
**1:10:22-1:10:25:**  of desirable forage plants.  
**1:10:25-1:10:33:**  So unless you really think that you need to augment that with some sort of broadcast seeding,  
**1:10:33-1:10:40:**  I would try to rely in most cases on the natural existing seed bank.  
**1:10:40-1:10:49:**  The third and kind of final phase of the silvopasture establishment is that once you get all this  
**1:10:49-1:10:54:**  green stuff growing in the silvopasture understory, we have to keep in mind that it's going to  
**1:10:54-1:11:01:**  be a mix of the good stuff that we wanted to see growing there and the not so good stuff  
**1:11:01-1:11:08:**  that is just taking advantage of this void that we've created and this increased sunlight.  
**1:11:08-1:11:14:**  So this is where the intensive rotational grazing and the animal density and impact  
**1:11:14-1:11:27:**  come in because we need to graze that silvopasture understory in a way that we're either promoting  
**1:11:27-1:11:33:**  the growth of the good stuff or we're discouraging the growth of the bad stuff.  
**1:11:33-1:11:41:**  And a common example of how that's accomplished in the grazing world is through this mob grazing  
**1:11:41-1:11:48:**  or high density grazing where the animals are put into a paddock for a short period  
**1:11:48-1:11:51:**  of time at a high density.  
**1:11:51-1:11:56:**  The animals eat the best portion of what's there but there's enough animals that they're  
**1:11:56-1:12:04:**  trampling and smashing and knocking down all the other plants that they might not want  
**1:12:04-1:12:05:**  to eat.  
**1:12:05-1:12:12:**  And in other words, every time they go in, they kind of wipe the slate clean and set  
**1:12:12-1:12:14:**  everything back to an equal footing.  
**1:12:14-1:12:22:**  And that sounds easier than it is to actually achieve but any skilled grazer can get to  
**1:12:22-1:12:30:**  the point where they can use their animal workforce to largely accomplish that through  
**1:12:30-1:12:35:**  their rotational grazing system.  
**1:12:35-1:12:45:**  And then one of the natural steps that we often think about is allowing for forest regeneration,  
**1:12:45-1:12:50:**  for the next generation of trees to come in after harvest of the trees.  
**1:12:50-1:12:59:**  Could you quickly comment on how that works in a system that's so disturbed by the animals,  
**1:12:59-1:13:01:**  by the cattle?  
**1:13:01-1:13:06:**  Probably one of the most frequently asked questions anytime we talk about silvopasturing,  
**1:13:06-1:13:12:**  especially to a non-forester audience, is what do you do about regenerating young trees?  
**1:13:12-1:13:19:**  So a silvopasture is defined as a sustainable system.  
**1:13:19-1:13:27:**  That's to say that we can perpetuate this balanced mix of trees and forages and livestock  
**1:13:27-1:13:28:**  over time.  
**1:13:28-1:13:33:**  It's not an area where we're just putting the animals in there to graze today until  
**1:13:33-1:13:40:**  we get around to clearing all the trees off or the trees die of old age or some disease  
**1:13:40-1:13:43:**  issue.  
**1:13:43-1:13:47:**  It's not that the silvopasture is always going to look the same over time.  
**1:13:47-1:13:48:**  These are dynamic systems.  
**1:13:48-1:13:55:**  So in the early stages, we may have more trees and less forage and a more mature silvopasture.  
**1:13:55-1:14:01:**  It may look like more forage and less trees or vice versa.  
**1:14:01-1:14:08:**  But I made a comment earlier and I'd like to go back to it in that regeneration is an  
**1:14:08-1:14:10:**  event in the life cycle of a forest.  
**1:14:10-1:14:17:**  So many of the tree species that we would value in our silvopasture systems are sun-loving  
**1:14:17-1:14:18:**  species.  
**1:14:18-1:14:26:**  It doesn't matter if you're talking about pines and firs or oaks and maples or beech  
**1:14:26-1:14:33:**  or whatever your chestnut trees, your walnut trees, your apple trees.  
**1:14:33-1:14:39:**  Almost all tree species need full sunlight conditions to develop beyond the seedling  
**1:14:39-1:14:40:**  stage.  
**1:14:40-1:14:47:**  Consequently, we're not going to grow the next generation of forest under the canopy  
**1:14:47-1:14:51:**  of the current generation of forest.  
**1:14:51-1:14:59:**  In forestry, we use what are called even age regeneration systems to establish a new age  
**1:14:59-1:15:06:**  class of trees and then eventually recruit that young age class of trees up into the  
**1:15:06-1:15:11:**  next forest.  
**1:15:11-1:15:19:**  In our silvopastures, we feel that we're still decades away from needing to replace the current  
**1:15:19-1:15:22:**  trees with new young trees.  
**1:15:22-1:15:35:**  So in that period of time until we need to regenerate, we don't really value having regeneration  
**1:15:35-1:15:36:**  in the understory.  
**1:15:36-1:15:44:**  If it happens, it happens and in some cases we may see opportunities to free up or release  
**1:15:44-1:15:51:**  small patches of that regeneration so we can have this mosaic of younger age classes starting  
**1:15:51-1:15:56:**  to pop up across our entire silvopasture base.  
**1:15:56-1:16:02:**  And the fences that keep our animals in our silvopastures today can also keep our animals  
**1:16:02-1:16:08:**  out of our silvopastures tomorrow when we feel that there's a need to regenerate.  
**1:16:08-1:16:14:**  But the bigger issue for regeneration in this part of the world is not the livestock, it's  
**1:16:14-1:16:20:**  actually the whitetail deer that browse to death all of the desirable young tree species  
**1:16:20-1:16:24:**  that we would like to replace in our forest.  
**1:16:24-1:16:36:**  Listen, Brett, I think we're gonna take this interview to an end and thank you so much  
**1:16:36-1:16:38:**  for your generous time.  
**1:16:38-1:16:43:**  I would like to know, because we've read a few of the documents that you shared with  
**1:16:43-1:16:48:**  us, but I'd like to know if the audience could or where the audience could get a hold of  
**1:16:48-1:16:55:**  extra resources, extra reading, if they're interested in delving deeper into this topic.  
**1:16:55-1:16:56:**  Sure.  
**1:16:56-1:17:02:**  So it'd probably be easiest to email those to you, but if you'd like them on the recording,  
**1:17:02-1:17:07:**  I can cover those really quickly.  
**1:17:07-1:17:13:**  So we have a couple of different resource websites for silvopasturing.  
**1:17:13-1:17:27:**  One is, we call it the Silvopasture Forum, the URL is silvopasture.ning, that's N-I-N-G.com,  
**1:17:27-1:17:29:**  it's a Ning forum.  
**1:17:29-1:17:33:**  And this is a network of people interested in silvopasturing.  
**1:17:33-1:17:43:**  We try to archive good articles and resource documents also on that forum, but the main  
**1:17:43-1:17:49:**  purpose of the forum is to share personal experiences and ask questions and tap into  
**1:17:49-1:17:52:**  other people's learning curves.  
**1:17:52-1:18:00:**  The other resource website that we have for silvopasturing information is the Cornell  
**1:18:00-1:18:06:**  University Cooperative Extension, Forestry Extension website.  
**1:18:06-1:18:22:**  The URL for that is forestconnect.info, forestconnect.info, and under the publications section, you have  
**1:18:22-1:18:28:**  to dig a little bit, but there's a whole section on silvopasturing, including the presentations  
**1:18:28-1:18:34:**  from silvopasturing conferences in 2011 and 2014.  
**1:18:34-1:18:42:**  There's also a link there to a number of silvopasturing webinars, also documents that we feel would  
**1:18:42-1:18:49:**  be useful for any silvopasture practitioner.  
**1:18:49-1:18:53:**  Thank you so much for listening to this episode, we really hope you enjoyed it.  
**1:18:53-1:19:00:**  As always, all the links will be posted in the description below, and again, please get  
**1:19:00-1:19:05:**  in touch with us if there's any recommendations, any feedback, or anybody you'd like us to  
**1:19:05-1:19:09:**  interview, so don't hesitate, you can find all of the contact forms on our website.  
**1:19:09-1:19:36:**  Thank you so much, and see you next time.

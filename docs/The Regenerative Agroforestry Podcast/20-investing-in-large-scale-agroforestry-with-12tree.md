### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 10 May 2021 17:02:56)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:47:**  Hi everyone and welcome back to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:47-0:00:50:**  I'm your host today Etienne.  
**0:00:50-0:00:54:**  Today we welcome Oliver Hanke from 123 Finance.  
**0:00:54-0:00:59:**  We wanted to have them on the show to understand what scaling agroforestry looks like in practice  
**0:00:59-0:01:03:**  and how investment in such large projects actually works.  
**0:01:03-0:01:08:**  This interview enables us to understand how 123 operates but also to zoom out a bit from  
**0:01:08-0:01:12:**  the farm scale and think about some of the questions we have to tackle if we are to scale  
**0:01:12-0:01:14:**  agroforestry.  
**0:01:14-0:01:20:**  Is there a tension between delivering a return to investors and more complex production systems?  
**0:01:20-0:01:23:**  Is agroforestry delivering the benefits they had planned for?  
**0:01:23-0:01:27:**  Oliver does a great job at answering sincerely these questions and many more.  
**0:01:27-0:01:28:**  Enjoy.  
**0:01:28-0:01:31:**  Hi Oliver, welcome to the podcast.  
**0:01:31-0:01:32:**  Hello Etienne, how are you?  
**0:01:32-0:01:34:**  I'm great, thanks.  
**0:01:34-0:01:36:**  Thanks for joining us today.  
**0:01:36-0:01:42:**  Maybe we could kick off things with an introduction of who you are and how you got involved with  
**0:01:42-0:01:43:**  123.  
**0:01:43-0:01:45:**  Of course, of course.  
**0:01:45-0:01:47:**  My name is Oliver Hanke.  
**0:01:47-0:01:54:**  I'm the chief sustainability officer and also responsible for the marketing, basically selling  
**0:01:54-0:01:59:**  the production that we have at 123.  
**0:01:59-0:02:06:**  And I've been with 123 for several years now, basically since the foundation of the company.  
**0:02:06-0:02:16:**  I was involved with the processes that led to setting up 123 and yeah, been part of a  
**0:02:16-0:02:19:**  management team ever since.  
**0:02:19-0:02:23:**  And from the background, I'm not necessarily a farmer.  
**0:02:23-0:02:34:**  I had 10 years in finance before I was in real estate business, but not as a broker,  
**0:02:34-0:02:40:**  but doing actually quantitative analysis, sort of structuring big real estate deals.  
**0:02:40-0:02:45:**  My background is more economics than agronomics, if you see what I mean.  
**0:02:45-0:02:46:**  Yeah.  
**0:02:46-0:02:54:**  Maybe you can tell us how 123 started and how did you and I know Richard, I don't know  
**0:02:54-0:03:00:**  the other teams of the management team, but how you got all interested in agroforestry  
**0:03:00-0:03:02:**  and how it all started?  
**0:03:02-0:03:07:**  As you know, it's not, I mean, it's gaining a lot of traction now, which is great to see,  
**0:03:07-0:03:15:**  but it isn't exactly a topic that was on the main investor agenda, I don't know, 10 years  
**0:03:15-0:03:18:**  ago, not even five years ago.  
**0:03:18-0:03:20:**  So it's been changing a lot.  
**0:03:20-0:03:25:**  123 has been set up at the end of 2016.  
**0:03:25-0:03:31:**  So it's a fairly young company, but it didn't come out of nowhere basically.  
**0:03:31-0:03:38:**  So we, Richard, myself, a couple of other people, we had been in the space already for  
**0:03:38-0:03:47:**  several years working for a German company and with a German company called Forest Finance,  
**0:03:47-0:03:55:**  which is all about establishing mixed sustainable forests in tropical regions.  
**0:03:55-0:04:01:**  And this is what we did already for several years, sort of raising funds from more the  
**0:04:01-0:04:04:**  private sector individuals.  
**0:04:04-0:04:11:**  I always say they did crowdfunding before crowdfunding even existed.  
**0:04:11-0:04:17:**  And that gradually moved from reforestation and afforestation projects, which of course  
**0:04:17-0:04:26:**  is super important to looking at agroforestry, how agroforestry components can be introduced  
**0:04:26-0:04:34:**  into those forestry systems, make them a bit more financially interesting and attractive.  
**0:04:34-0:04:39:**  And that led to a particular focus on cocoa.  
**0:04:39-0:04:46:**  And the objective was obviously always to scale this up to see if institutional investors  
**0:04:46-0:04:53:**  can be interested for these topics of agroforestry, sustainable forestry, regenerative agricultural  
**0:04:53-0:04:55:**  practices.  
**0:04:55-0:05:07:**  And there was a long, long hard way and it was rewarded around 2016 with winning or convincing  
**0:05:07-0:05:13:**  a group of German pension funds to establish a sustainable forestry mandate.  
**0:05:13-0:05:20:**  And that was a big success, of course, to convince an institutional investor of that  
**0:05:20-0:05:30:**  size to focus on the topic, to invest into this subject and to establish a portfolio  
**0:05:30-0:05:32:**  of projects that does it.  
**0:05:32-0:05:43:**  And on the back of these discussions, we set up 1-2-3 as a company that is dedicated to  
**0:05:43-0:05:52:**  investments into sustainable agroforestry with regenerative practices in the institutional  
**0:05:52-0:05:53:**  investor space.  
**0:05:53-0:06:00:**  But we needed a fresh setup with particular processes and that's how we set it up and  
**0:06:00-0:06:04:**  set up the company in Berlin at the time.  
**0:06:04-0:06:08:**  Could you give us an idea of the size of 1-2-3 at the moment?  
**0:06:08-0:06:12:**  I mean, how many projects are you running and in what countries?  
**0:06:12-0:06:15:**  Sure, sure, sure.  
**0:06:15-0:06:21:**  So we have, I already mentioned cocoa as one of our core competitors.  
**0:06:21-0:06:25:**  So you may guess what kind of climate zones we are active in.  
**0:06:25-0:06:32:**  So there's a strong focus on tropical and subtropical areas.  
**0:06:32-0:06:38:**  Not necessarily because it has to be in the tropics, we're just basically saying, okay,  
**0:06:38-0:06:44:**  which commodity value chains are broken.  
**0:06:44-0:06:49:**  So it's not only about regenerative agriculture, it's also about the social agenda, trying  
**0:06:49-0:06:55:**  to fix commodity value chains such as the cocoa industry.  
**0:06:55-0:07:04:**  And we found that in particular in the tropics, the social makeup of the production value  
**0:07:04-0:07:10:**  chain is very unjust, be it in cocoa, be it in coffee, be it in other crops like these.  
**0:07:10-0:07:19:**  And so what we have established now is a portfolio of 12 projects, which are predominantly in  
**0:07:19-0:07:23:**  Latin America around the tropical belt.  
**0:07:23-0:07:30:**  So we have made investments from Ecuador to Guatemala.  
**0:07:30-0:07:35:**  And we also have started in very arid zones.  
**0:07:35-0:07:40:**  So we have started an organic dates project in Morocco.  
**0:07:40-0:07:43:**  So it's the one that is not in Latin America.  
**0:07:43-0:07:49:**  And so I wouldn't say that we are focused on tropical areas, we're focused on very vulnerable  
**0:07:49-0:07:51:**  environments if you see what I mean.  
**0:07:51-0:08:01:**  In terms of size, we have so far invested into the ground about 160 million US dollars.  
**0:08:01-0:08:08:**  And we have commitments from investors at around 500 million.  
**0:08:08-0:08:10:**  So that's a great achievement.  
**0:08:10-0:08:17:**  So what that means is basically we have commitment to invest, but as you know, these systems  
**0:08:17-0:08:20:**  aren't built overnight, it takes a lot of time.  
**0:08:20-0:08:23:**  And so over the years, the money is put into the ground.  
**0:08:23-0:08:28:**  And so far, basically 160 million have been put into the ground.  
**0:08:28-0:08:35:**  What do you mean by put into the ground compared to, I mean, committed and what you've actually  
**0:08:35-0:08:36:**  spent?  
**0:08:36-0:08:43:**  Well, I mean, how does a typical agriculture project look like?  
**0:08:43-0:08:46:**  You need your farm infrastructure.  
**0:08:46-0:08:51:**  You need road access, you need processing facilities.  
**0:08:51-0:08:54:**  But obviously also you need to plant a lot.  
**0:08:54-0:09:06:**  And planting in biodiverse agroforest is neither fast nor is it cheap because you have to design,  
**0:09:06-0:09:12:**  you want one or several cash crops in the system, you want a multi-species approach.  
**0:09:12-0:09:18:**  So you're not planting everything overnight and then you get the results the next day.  
**0:09:18-0:09:21:**  It basically takes time, a lot of planning.  
**0:09:21-0:09:26:**  Some of the areas are irrigated, so you need to install irrigation systems.  
**0:09:26-0:09:31:**  You need to look at the water infrastructure, where does the water come from?  
**0:09:31-0:09:37:**  And all of this needs to be planned and designed and implemented.  
**0:09:37-0:09:41:**  And that's what I mean with put into the ground.  
**0:09:41-0:09:45:**  It is basically that the money is spoken.  
**0:09:45-0:09:51:**  So in the sense that if you have a project and you know it will cost you, I don't know,  
**0:09:51-0:10:01:**  I just say a number $30 million to develop a large farm, then that is an investment plan  
**0:10:01-0:10:04:**  that takes several years.  
**0:10:04-0:10:06:**  So that funding is secured basically.  
**0:10:06-0:10:10:**  So you can draw on that way, it's been committed.  
**0:10:10-0:10:16:**  But it's not sitting there for years to wait to be used.  
**0:10:16-0:10:20:**  So that's the difference between invested and committed basically.  
**0:10:20-0:10:26:**  So at the moment you're saying that $160 million, you're working with that money, injecting  
**0:10:26-0:10:30:**  it into different projects like it's already happening now.  
**0:10:30-0:10:31:**  Well that's been done.  
**0:10:31-0:10:33:**  It's a big achievement.  
**0:10:33-0:10:40:**  It's 12 projects and a part of that involves obviously buying land.  
**0:10:40-0:10:48:**  We don't only use land or lease land or work with cooperatives, we predominantly buy land.  
**0:10:48-0:10:54:**  And there's a whole discussion to be had around that obviously, but you acquire the land and  
**0:10:54-0:10:59:**  the first thing you do is improve the infrastructure that you have there.  
**0:10:59-0:11:06:**  So there's a lot of spending happening very fast after you start a project.  
**0:11:06-0:11:13:**  And then over the next two, three, four, five years, you establish your actual farming.  
**0:11:13-0:11:16:**  And that's how it works basically.  
**0:11:16-0:11:21:**  We'll come back to a lot of the things you said, because I think there's many fascinating  
**0:11:21-0:11:22:**  things to unpack there.  
**0:11:22-0:11:28:**  But first I wanted us to maybe take an example of one of your projects and that you kind  
**0:11:28-0:11:31:**  of walk us through that project.  
**0:11:31-0:11:36:**  You know, it's when you implemented it, its size, its productions, just that we can have  
**0:11:36-0:11:40:**  a really clear idea of what your work looks like on the ground.  
**0:11:40-0:11:43:**  Absolutely happy to do so.  
**0:11:43-0:11:48:**  I think that the best example that I can walk you through is actually our largest farm.  
**0:11:48-0:11:58:**  It's a diversified estate in Guatemala, which is called Ximel.  
**0:11:58-0:12:02:**  It's a beautiful farm which has 5,000 hectares.  
**0:12:02-0:12:05:**  So it's huge.  
**0:12:05-0:12:10:**  In difficult terrain, it's in the Altavera Pass of Guatemala.  
**0:12:10-0:12:16:**  So the altitude change on the farm ranges from, I think it's 500 meters above sea level  
**0:12:16-0:12:19:**  up to 1200 meters.  
**0:12:19-0:12:24:**  So this is not a plane where we establish something.  
**0:12:24-0:12:30:**  It's a whole three dimensional system, if you see what I mean.  
**0:12:30-0:12:33:**  You have to think about what grows where.  
**0:12:33-0:12:39:**  You have lower elevations, you have higher elevations and not every crop and not every  
**0:12:39-0:12:43:**  system is suitable to those different elevations.  
**0:12:43-0:12:47:**  It can be very hot and sticky in the low elevations.  
**0:12:47-0:12:51:**  It can be very cold and exposed in the high elevations.  
**0:12:51-0:12:56:**  And as you know, that's what regenerative agriculture is all about.  
**0:12:56-0:12:57:**  It's always site specific.  
**0:12:57-0:13:05:**  It's always about understanding where you're acting, where you're planting and not only  
**0:13:05-0:13:11:**  understanding the soil, but also obviously the climate and the extremes that you're acting  
**0:13:11-0:13:12:**  in there.  
**0:13:12-0:13:16:**  So I think this is the best example I can give you.  
**0:13:16-0:13:23:**  Every project we have is unique and different and in different environments from very wet  
**0:13:23-0:13:25:**  tropics to very dry environments.  
**0:13:25-0:13:36:**  But I think talking to Fushimelt illustrates best what we do on the ground, basically.  
**0:13:36-0:13:43:**  And digging a bit more into this example, what are the main productions already there  
**0:13:43-0:13:47:**  or that you're planning in the design?  
**0:13:47-0:13:50:**  So this place is not new.  
**0:13:50-0:14:00:**  So it's a farm that has been established in some shape for several decades already.  
**0:14:00-0:14:13:**  And half of it is forest and predominantly natural forest, but also some plantations.  
**0:14:13-0:14:19:**  And the rest is predominantly about coffee.  
**0:14:19-0:14:22:**  So originally Arabica coffee.  
**0:14:22-0:14:28:**  And when we got involved a few years ago, we looked at what can be done there.  
**0:14:28-0:14:34:**  Also what, well, first of all, what grows well in that particular environment, but also  
**0:14:34-0:14:36:**  what is Guatemala about?  
**0:14:36-0:14:42:**  What does Guatemala stand for in terms of marketable products?  
**0:14:42-0:14:54:**  And it's very good for cocoa, for coffee, for cardamom and rubber as well.  
**0:14:54-0:15:00:**  So those are the main cash crops that you will see in the farm.  
**0:15:00-0:15:10:**  You see in the higher elevations very extensive coffee plantations, Arabica coffee.  
**0:15:10-0:15:19:**  In the medium elevations, you see more robusta, you see some rubber plantations.  
**0:15:19-0:15:26:**  And in the lower elevations, you will find more cocoa and now also a bit more banana  
**0:15:26-0:15:28:**  planting.  
**0:15:28-0:15:33:**  And when I name one of those, it's always in an agroforestry system.  
**0:15:33-0:15:38:**  So a hectare always produces more than just one thing.  
**0:15:38-0:15:45:**  So we like to combine with rubber trees, culture basically with rubber trees a lot.  
**0:15:45-0:15:56:**  So what you typically see is, for example, rows of cocoa intercropped with rubber trees,  
**0:15:56-0:16:03:**  some planting or banana in between for the early shade.  
**0:16:03-0:16:11:**  In the higher elevations, you see more forestry models, you see pine combined with cardamom.  
**0:16:11-0:16:18:**  Cardamom is, for those who don't know or don't like it, it's a spice that is very much used  
**0:16:18-0:16:22:**  in the Arab and Indian world.  
**0:16:22-0:16:28:**  And funnily enough, Guatemala is the largest exporter of cardamom.  
**0:16:28-0:16:32:**  So it's a very unique environment.  
**0:16:32-0:16:39:**  It's not something that is grown in many places, but in Guatemala it is widespread and it grows  
**0:16:39-0:16:43:**  well and attracts good prices.  
**0:16:43-0:16:46:**  So yeah, that's what this farm is about basically.  
**0:16:46-0:16:50:**  Coffee, cardamom, cacao, free seeds if you want something.  
**0:16:50-0:16:51:**  Wow.  
**0:16:51-0:16:56:**  And to understand the situation when you took over the farm, what were the main problems  
**0:16:56-0:16:57:**  you were facing?  
**0:16:57-0:17:03:**  You know, what kind of solutions did you design to face these problems?  
**0:17:03-0:17:04:**  Yeah.  
**0:17:04-0:17:07:**  So I mean, there are so many dimensions to it.  
**0:17:07-0:17:16:**  You can imagine a 5,000 hectare stayed in such a difficult terrain.  
**0:17:16-0:17:18:**  It's not easy to manage.  
**0:17:18-0:17:26:**  And the previous owner family, they had already done actually a multi-generation project,  
**0:17:26-0:17:33:**  a great job at establishing first plantations.  
**0:17:33-0:17:37:**  And they had a good social agenda.  
**0:17:37-0:17:42:**  Many communities, many people actually got there to work in the farms.  
**0:17:42-0:17:52:**  The whole small villages got set up by the workers and people have been given land.  
**0:17:52-0:17:59:**  They had done a lot of work already with the indigenous, catchy communities.  
**0:17:59-0:18:03:**  And so a good groundwork was already done.  
**0:18:03-0:18:12:**  What was needed was to scale it up and to create more value from the production, which  
**0:18:12-0:18:19:**  by and large was sold locally to local traders, not exclusively.  
**0:18:19-0:18:24:**  I mean, they'd done a good job already at marketing some of the production, but there's  
**0:18:24-0:18:31:**  so much more coffee and cocoa and rubber and cardamom to be produced now that we're looking  
**0:18:31-0:18:37:**  to establish those big export relationships.  
**0:18:37-0:18:45:**  A lot of detailed work had to happen, more design in agroforestry systems, sort of how  
**0:18:45-0:18:49:**  can these biodiverse systems be optimized?  
**0:18:49-0:18:54:**  How can they produce more, whilst at the same time using less inputs?  
**0:18:54-0:18:59:**  When you took over the farm, the systems were separated, like you had forest on one side  
**0:18:59-0:19:03:**  and then cacao production on the other, or was there already some agroforestry practices  
**0:19:03-0:19:05:**  that were implemented?  
**0:19:05-0:19:06:**  There were some.  
**0:19:06-0:19:08:**  So how do you have to imagine it?  
**0:19:08-0:19:16:**  So what you see is the coffee, the arabica, you can grow it under shade, you can grow  
**0:19:16-0:19:19:**  it without shade.  
**0:19:19-0:19:26:**  And because it's such a large system, it's very hard to establish all of that under shade.  
**0:19:26-0:19:32:**  Then you have the hilltops where you really have native forest and that needs needed to  
**0:19:32-0:19:37:**  be protected and connected to each other so that you don't have like isolated hilltops,  
**0:19:37-0:19:45:**  but that the animals that live there can migrate from one place to the other.  
**0:19:45-0:19:51:**  There was some cocoa plantations, but the infrastructure wasn't so great.  
**0:19:51-0:19:59:**  And a lot of emphasis was put on designing those agroforestry systems I was talking about  
**0:19:59-0:20:06:**  to bring in more biodiversity and the whole topic of cardamom in the forest.  
**0:20:06-0:20:13:**  So basically having more of a forestry model that is enriched with spices production.  
**0:20:13-0:20:19:**  There were some test plots, let's say, but it wasn't done at scale.  
**0:20:19-0:20:21:**  And this is what we took up.  
**0:20:21-0:20:26:**  So I think a lot of good ideas were already there that were then really scaled up with  
**0:20:26-0:20:31:**  the institutional capital that I've been talking about earlier.  
**0:20:31-0:20:34:**  That's what makes it so great.  
**0:20:34-0:20:37:**  I'm not saying we invented everything that has been done there.  
**0:20:37-0:20:41:**  We have a very good team there.  
**0:20:41-0:20:52:**  But we allowed it to scale up, to professionalize more, to have different trials.  
**0:20:52-0:20:55:**  Just as an example, I've just been there, actually.  
**0:20:55-0:21:02:**  I've been there in February and they showed me a new test plot they have with pineapple.  
**0:21:02-0:21:06:**  It's actually five different crops in that system.  
**0:21:06-0:21:16:**  Pineapple, the rubber I mentioned, and banana, and cocoa, and another tree species.  
**0:21:16-0:21:20:**  So it's great to see these test plots, to see how they behave, and then to have the  
**0:21:20-0:21:25:**  ability and the available capital to scale that up if it works and it creates the benefits  
**0:21:25-0:21:28:**  that you want to see.  
**0:21:28-0:21:31:**  So just to sum up, and correct me if I'm wrong.  
**0:21:31-0:21:36:**  But at the moment, you're at a phase where you're testing different possibilities, but  
**0:21:36-0:21:40:**  still the main production system remains.  
**0:21:40-0:21:48:**  And then the plan is to, once you've identified promising diversification strategies, then  
**0:21:48-0:21:51:**  upscale that on the whole farm.  
**0:21:51-0:21:53:**  Yes.  
**0:21:53-0:21:54:**  So that's already happening.  
**0:21:54-0:21:55:**  So we did that.  
**0:21:55-0:21:59:**  I'm talking a little bit about the past here.  
**0:21:59-0:22:03:**  We did, for example, introduce Robusta coffee.  
**0:22:03-0:22:07:**  That wasn't something that was grown there in the past.  
**0:22:07-0:22:11:**  So they had a lot of experience with Arabica coffee in the high elevations, as I mentioned.  
**0:22:11-0:22:14:**  It's quite a big coffee farm.  
**0:22:14-0:22:19:**  The Robusta is something new and that's been planted this year and there'll be more to  
**0:22:19-0:22:20:**  come.  
**0:22:20-0:22:24:**  And Robusta, well, the name indicates it.  
**0:22:24-0:22:32:**  It can deal much better with changing temperatures and also thrive.  
**0:22:32-0:22:39:**  The Arabica needs cooler temperatures and Robusta is a good solid one, sort of to connect  
**0:22:39-0:22:41:**  the low elevations with the high elevations.  
**0:22:41-0:22:46:**  So that's tested and it's rolled now out at scale.  
**0:22:46-0:22:49:**  The cocoa, obviously, also they did that already quite a bit.  
**0:22:49-0:22:58:**  They have an interesting mix of aromatic cocoa varieties and that's being scaled up now.  
**0:22:58-0:23:02:**  But there's still, I mean, this used to be a cattle ranch and there's still so much area  
**0:23:02-0:23:12:**  that can be converted from degraded cattle ranch to agroforestry systems.  
**0:23:12-0:23:21:**  We're also thinking about silvopastoral systems, basically, but we haven't done that yet.  
**0:23:21-0:23:26:**  So you're right in a way that we're trying different things and then there's still so  
**0:23:26-0:23:31:**  much area that can be developed that we can put that into practice at larger scale.  
**0:23:31-0:23:33:**  But the plan is there.  
**0:23:33-0:23:35:**  The plan is established.  
**0:23:35-0:23:41:**  The natural forest obviously gets protected and some areas enriched again.  
**0:23:41-0:23:45:**  And so it's clear what we want to do.  
**0:23:45-0:23:48:**  Where do you get this knowledge?  
**0:23:48-0:23:54:**  Because agroforestry, although it's practice, probably more in the tropics than in Europe.  
**0:23:54-0:24:00:**  So maybe there's already more knowledge generated in those types of climates, but it still remains  
**0:24:00-0:24:06:**  quite experimental compared to other production methods, at least at large scale.  
**0:24:06-0:24:13:**  So how are you going about discovering what works and also what kind of knowledge are  
**0:24:13-0:24:14:**  you using?  
**0:24:14-0:24:16:**  Yeah, that's a good point.  
**0:24:16-0:24:26:**  I mean, agroforestry, regenerative practices, there's quite a lot of, as you say, it's still  
**0:24:26-0:24:32:**  something that is in development, but there has been a lot of research in temperate climate  
**0:24:32-0:24:37:**  zones when it comes to tropical agriculture.  
**0:24:37-0:24:39:**  There isn't that much research out there.  
**0:24:39-0:24:41:**  There isn't that much experience out there.  
**0:24:41-0:24:49:**  This obviously traditional practices which we're learning from, but those need to be  
**0:24:49-0:24:57:**  adapted and improved on without losing the core elements of them.  
**0:24:57-0:25:05:**  So what we have built internally is a team of technical experts on exactly those topics.  
**0:25:05-0:25:14:**  So we have a team, technical services team, we call it, which consists of specialists  
**0:25:14-0:25:18:**  in different professions within agriculture.  
**0:25:18-0:25:28:**  So be it on soil health, be it on fetus sanitary management, be it on water management.  
**0:25:28-0:25:36:**  We have a GIS expert to help us with the design of those systems, a couple of others.  
**0:25:36-0:25:39:**  So it's quite a sizable team by now.  
**0:25:39-0:25:46:**  And this team is deeply involved in the project design together with the local teams.  
**0:25:46-0:25:54:**  So the local teams bring the local knowledge, reference data and experience simply with  
**0:25:54-0:26:00:**  working with this environment, what grows there, how it can be designed.  
**0:26:00-0:26:08:**  And the central team brings in the experience from many projects, smaller, larger, conventional  
**0:26:08-0:26:16:**  agriculture regenerative projects, and brings all of this together to design something better.  
**0:26:16-0:26:17:**  And that's part of our mission.  
**0:26:17-0:26:23:**  And our mission is not just to build good farms, it's also to change the way farming  
**0:26:23-0:26:27:**  is practiced within our farms, of course, but also beyond.  
**0:26:27-0:26:33:**  We want to be role models to an extent for other farmers who look at what we're doing,  
**0:26:33-0:26:37:**  they see that it works, and they can embrace those practices.  
**0:26:37-0:26:43:**  I wanted to understand who exactly is working on the farm then because 5000 hectares seems  
**0:26:43-0:26:52:**  so big and how many farmers are working the land and what does the local team look like?  
**0:26:52-0:26:54:**  Yeah, sure.  
**0:26:54-0:26:57:**  So we're not cooperative setups.  
**0:26:57-0:27:08:**  So we actually own land, we establish professional farm teams, but we work with cooperatives,  
**0:27:08-0:27:10:**  we partner with communities and so on.  
**0:27:10-0:27:15:**  So it's quite an elaborate setup that we established there.  
**0:27:15-0:27:23:**  So you have to imagine a local management team with a permanent staff base, in this  
**0:27:23-0:27:29:**  case of Schimeld, we're talking about roughly 300 people that are permanently employed,  
**0:27:29-0:27:33:**  they're full time employees working in the farm.  
**0:27:33-0:27:39:**  And then, yes, you obviously have peak times, harvest seasons, where you're bringing in  
**0:27:39-0:27:49:**  some temporary workers, several hundreds, in this particular case, who help with harvest.  
**0:27:49-0:27:54:**  And our objective obviously is to create as many permanent jobs as possible.  
**0:27:54-0:27:59:**  But also those temporary jobs are incredibly important for those communities.  
**0:27:59-0:28:08:**  In particular, in those traditional catchy communities.  
**0:28:08-0:28:15:**  Originally it's not seen that a woman has a formal job and formal employment.  
**0:28:15-0:28:21:**  And that's something, for example, that changed so that the women in the communities, they  
**0:28:21-0:28:28:**  get an opportunity to earn a living as well, to get into those farms during the harvest.  
**0:28:28-0:28:30:**  And so that's what you typically see.  
**0:28:30-0:28:34:**  And then this is complemented with our one to three teams.  
**0:28:34-0:28:39:**  I mentioned this technical services team, but there's also, of course, there are controllers,  
**0:28:39-0:28:46:**  there are project supervisors who are making sure that the financials are okay, that the  
**0:28:46-0:28:48:**  plan is implemented.  
**0:28:48-0:28:54:**  We have certain audit layers, the investors want to make sure that the money is used in  
**0:28:54-0:28:55:**  the right way.  
**0:28:55-0:29:00:**  So we bring in external experts, we bring in external auditors.  
**0:29:00-0:29:10:**  So it's quite an elaborate setup of doing and also layers of control that happen all  
**0:29:10-0:29:14:**  in a good spirit, all in a partnership spirit, of course.  
**0:29:14-0:29:19:**  And then all of this is connecting with the surroundings.  
**0:29:19-0:29:27:**  So we have actually in that particular farm, we have two smallholder programs running.  
**0:29:27-0:29:37:**  One is called the Unupa Unu program where coffee farmers are organized, small farmers.  
**0:29:37-0:29:46:**  And this farm, but also other farms help them to produce better and to also sell the product.  
**0:29:46-0:29:48:**  And there's another project which is relatively new.  
**0:29:48-0:29:51:**  It's called the Cacao forest.  
**0:29:51-0:29:55:**  So it's about cacao and caramu.  
**0:29:55-0:30:04:**  And again, it's about helping farmers to have planting material that is high quality, to  
**0:30:04-0:30:09:**  teach them how to plant it, when to harvest it, how to treat it and tend the production  
**0:30:09-0:30:12:**  over time and then to help market it.  
**0:30:12-0:30:18:**  So there's the central team, but there's a lot of community interaction happening as  
**0:30:18-0:30:19:**  well.  
**0:30:19-0:30:23:**  I wanted to ask you about the investor side.  
**0:30:23-0:30:29:**  Could you give us an explanation of who is exactly investing in projects like the one  
**0:30:29-0:30:33:**  you just described and what is the deal?  
**0:30:33-0:30:40:**  What can they expect out of it and what is their expectations and the advantages for  
**0:30:40-0:30:45:**  them to go and invest in a project like this one instead of any other project?  
**0:30:45-0:30:54:**  Okay, so who are typical investor groups or types of investors that are willing to look  
**0:30:54-0:31:00:**  at this kind of project, which certainly isn't straightforward.  
**0:31:00-0:31:05:**  You need someone who has to an extent patient capital.  
**0:31:05-0:31:11:**  So investing in any real asset is not something that realizes value overnight.  
**0:31:11-0:31:19:**  You need someone who has experience with alternative investments or private equity.  
**0:31:19-0:31:29:**  So in the sense that you are buying land values, infrastructure in countries, in this case  
**0:31:29-0:31:39:**  in Guatemala, but basically those are emerging markets with let's say imperfect market structures.  
**0:31:39-0:31:43:**  So you need investors who understand the risks that they are entering into.  
**0:31:43-0:31:47:**  It's not only at the farm level, you know, you have country risks, you have currency  
**0:31:47-0:31:48:**  risks.  
**0:31:48-0:31:54:**  You need to understand how the money flows into those countries, how money is taxed there,  
**0:31:54-0:31:58:**  how it flows back to you as an investor ultimately.  
**0:31:58-0:32:06:**  So we're talking about professional investors and we're talking about larger investors who  
**0:32:06-0:32:10:**  have specialists in-house who understand these risks.  
**0:32:10-0:32:17:**  This can be pension funds, this can be endowments.  
**0:32:17-0:32:24:**  It can also be a large specialized asset managers in the sustainable investment space and large  
**0:32:24-0:32:34:**  family offices who you often find that family offices, they have a strong agenda.  
**0:32:34-0:32:40:**  You know, content wise, so as you say, the principal, basically the family, the owners  
**0:32:40-0:32:50:**  behind the capital behind it may have very specific investment objectives and they often  
**0:32:50-0:32:52:**  don't shy away from real assets.  
**0:32:52-0:32:58:**  They think intergenerational, so they have a long term vision of how their money should  
**0:32:58-0:33:01:**  be used and hopefully in a good way.  
**0:33:01-0:33:07:**  And so you're looking for these kind of investor groups that are professional, have experience  
**0:33:07-0:33:09:**  with risk management.  
**0:33:09-0:33:16:**  They understand the challenges ahead and they have in this particular case, a strong sustainability  
**0:33:16-0:33:23:**  agenda because else why would you invest into something that is a bit more complicated than  
**0:33:23-0:33:28:**  just buying into a, let's say a very modern, very professionally run, but conventional  
**0:33:28-0:33:32:**  farm, which is much better documented.  
**0:33:32-0:33:39:**  You have more data out there, it's easier to sell the product and so on and so on.  
**0:33:39-0:33:42:**  So that's what you need, those groups.  
**0:33:42-0:33:48:**  And now here's the challenge with these kinds of projects that we have.  
**0:33:48-0:33:55:**  And as you are very active in the field of regenerative agriculture, you know that the  
**0:33:55-0:33:59:**  kinds of projects that are very good on these practices, they tend to be not so big.  
**0:33:59-0:34:09:**  So we're talking about small projects because the work is very detailed, very detail oriented.  
**0:34:09-0:34:15:**  And at the same time, the kind of capital that has these abilities that are described  
**0:34:15-0:34:16:**  are big groups.  
**0:34:16-0:34:21:**  You know, they have to manage billions of dollars, billions of Euro.  
**0:34:21-0:34:24:**  And that is not a good match.  
**0:34:24-0:34:31:**  You know, you have investment groups who need to manage billions of assets and they cannot  
**0:34:31-0:34:34:**  make a 1 million investment.  
**0:34:34-0:34:38:**  It just doesn't work from the setup.  
**0:34:38-0:34:43:**  So what you need on the one hand is that the models and regenerative agriculture need to  
**0:34:43-0:34:49:**  be able to be scaled up, make them bigger so they become investable and they become  
**0:34:49-0:34:51:**  worth the time of these investors.  
**0:34:51-0:34:57:**  And on the other hand, these investors need to work or come around the reality that those  
**0:34:57-0:35:00:**  types of investments are smaller.  
**0:35:00-0:35:08:**  You know, it's not a 500 million infrastructure investment or renewable energy investment.  
**0:35:08-0:35:14:**  It's a farm and we can bring it up maybe to a 40 or 50 million dollar investment.  
**0:35:14-0:35:17:**  But beyond that, it gets a bit difficult.  
**0:35:17-0:35:24:**  So this is where we see our role to close this gap, you know, to bring up those practices  
**0:35:24-0:35:30:**  to scale and at the same time to make it accessible for investors.  
**0:35:30-0:35:36:**  That's fascinating because it's true that agroforestry and regenerative agriculture  
**0:35:36-0:35:42:**  in general requires such careful management and often is still at a stage where it's fairly  
**0:35:42-0:35:48:**  experimental and it's more the case of individuals finding solutions that work in their local  
**0:35:48-0:35:54:**  context rather than having one fit all methodology that we could, you know, unroll without any  
**0:35:54-0:35:55:**  risk.  
**0:35:55-0:36:00:**  And I'm just wondering, how are your investors capable of accepting that risk?  
**0:36:00-0:36:06:**  Because fundamentally today it is still risky in a way because we don't have, you know,  
**0:36:06-0:36:11:**  as you were saying, like it's much safer a conventional farm that has a lot of data.  
**0:36:11-0:36:13:**  And here it's still something very innovative.  
**0:36:13-0:36:19:**  So are you still able to really make a financial case or is it more that you convince these  
**0:36:19-0:36:25:**  investors that it's something that's, you know, risky but worth developing?  
**0:36:25-0:36:29:**  Yeah, I mean, let's be honest about this.  
**0:36:29-0:36:37:**  So I would not say that, you know, all of the farming we do is fully regenerative agriculture.  
**0:36:37-0:36:45:**  You know, we are trying to incorporate more and more principles, actions, activities,  
**0:36:45-0:36:52:**  research into our projects, you know, and some of the purists in your community, they  
**0:36:52-0:36:54:**  will say like, yeah, okay, that's good.  
**0:36:54-0:36:58:**  But you know, it's not what I would describe what I'm doing is different, you know, and  
**0:36:58-0:36:59:**  that's true.  
**0:36:59-0:37:11:**  So what we're doing is in a managed risk approach to bring in more and more practices that don't  
**0:37:11-0:37:20:**  come at the sacrifice of profitability, at least not, you know, unknowingly, you know,  
**0:37:20-0:37:26:**  we're not risking the capital of the investors starting to experiment with the money.  
**0:37:26-0:37:28:**  You know, let's see how this goes.  
**0:37:28-0:37:33:**  We had a one hectare plot, let's scale it up to 1000 and see what goes.  
**0:37:33-0:37:34:**  Work like that.  
**0:37:34-0:37:41:**  So, and also you have to see not all of the projects that we have, the 12 farms that I  
**0:37:41-0:37:47:**  mentioned, or some of them are forestry projects, but say that the 12 projects we have, some  
**0:37:47-0:37:53:**  of them started their life out as conventional monocultures, you know.  
**0:37:53-0:38:01:**  And it's not that easy to change a 10 year old monoculture to a biodiverse agroforestry  
**0:38:01-0:38:03:**  system, at least not overnight.  
**0:38:03-0:38:11:**  But what you can always do is to start using regenerative practices.  
**0:38:11-0:38:13:**  And for that, we were looking at that as well.  
**0:38:13-0:38:19:**  You know, we've established a whole curriculum and internal training program for all our  
**0:38:19-0:38:30:**  staff to fully embrace those practices because, you know, they come, some of them come from  
**0:38:30-0:38:34:**  conventional farming, you know, and they have to embrace those principles and have to understand  
**0:38:34-0:38:36:**  how to change their ways.  
**0:38:36-0:38:43:**  And so we designed a whole curriculum around, you know, soil organic matter, how to manage  
**0:38:43-0:38:52:**  it, how to maintain it, how to increase it, how different plant combinations are beneficial  
**0:38:52-0:38:53:**  or not.  
**0:38:53-0:39:00:**  And all of this, we thought about it like, yeah, should we have like a clear policy that  
**0:39:00-0:39:05:**  says this needs to be applied, this needs to be applied, or should it always be in the  
**0:39:05-0:39:06:**  local context?  
**0:39:06-0:39:09:**  And you know the answer.  
**0:39:09-0:39:11:**  It's always of the local context.  
**0:39:11-0:39:19:**  So you cannot have a one size fits all activity plan, basically, where you say, okay, everywhere  
**0:39:19-0:39:22:**  we farm, we do these three things, you know, it doesn't work like that.  
**0:39:22-0:39:27:**  You need to look at the very specific environment, you need to look at that plot, you need to  
**0:39:27-0:39:34:**  look at that sub farm, the 50 hectare area close to the river or up on the hill and make  
**0:39:34-0:39:38:**  some decisions in the field on a day to day basis, basically.  
**0:39:38-0:39:40:**  But how do you balance this?  
**0:39:40-0:39:46:**  I mean, when you take a project, you know, how do you decide, you know, how quickly do  
**0:39:46-0:39:47:**  we go?  
**0:39:47-0:39:48:**  How innovative do we go?  
**0:39:48-0:39:53:**  Because at the end of the day, that's a question that most farmers face at some points, unless  
**0:39:53-0:39:59:**  you start something, you know, completely regenerative, if that means anything from  
**0:39:59-0:40:03:**  the beginning, but you know, that doesn't guarantee you an economic model.  
**0:40:03-0:40:04:**  You know, that's a possibility.  
**0:40:04-0:40:10:**  But often people have, you know, a production system, which has, you know, pros and cons,  
**0:40:10-0:40:11:**  and might not be perfect.  
**0:40:11-0:40:15:**  And then you're trying to slowly move towards regenerative practices.  
**0:40:15-0:40:19:**  But the speed at which you go and the amount of risk you take is always the question.  
**0:40:19-0:40:21:**  And you know, how do you assess that?  
**0:40:21-0:40:23:**  Yeah, that's a very good question.  
**0:40:23-0:40:29:**  I mean, you're right, when you get the chance to design something completely new from scratch,  
**0:40:29-0:40:31:**  that's the most convenient situation to be in.  
**0:40:31-0:40:35:**  You know, we have knowledgeable people, we have access to a lot of research.  
**0:40:35-0:40:39:**  And so we can design hopefully the best possible system.  
**0:40:39-0:40:45:**  But if you have a running farm, you know, and that farm needs to make a profit, I mean,  
**0:40:45-0:40:52:**  it needs to pay for, it needs to pay the wages, it needs to pay the bills, basically, how  
**0:40:52-0:40:55:**  do you take those risks?  
**0:40:55-0:41:00:**  So we're looking for opportunities for change.  
**0:41:00-0:41:08:**  So with our partners and consultants and advisors together, we define a theory of change for  
**0:41:08-0:41:10:**  every farm.  
**0:41:10-0:41:15:**  So there's a theory of change on the social side, you know how a farm should change.  
**0:41:15-0:41:19:**  And there's a theory of change on the biodiversity side of things.  
**0:41:19-0:41:27:**  And that theory of change is obviously a long term vision of how to go from A to B to Z  
**0:41:27-0:41:29:**  over time.  
**0:41:29-0:41:38:**  And what you need to do is to check your progress against that vision periodically and frequently  
**0:41:38-0:41:42:**  and say like, am I actually progressing or am I not doing the things that I should be  
**0:41:42-0:41:46:**  doing to achieve my theory of change?  
**0:41:46-0:41:53:**  And at the same time, you cannot just fully embrace your theory of change at the sacrifice  
**0:41:53-0:41:54:**  of profitability.  
**0:41:54-0:41:56:**  That's correct.  
**0:41:56-0:42:02:**  So you need those opportunities where either an area has been aging and it needs to be  
**0:42:02-0:42:15:**  replanted or regrafted anyway, or you're looking at maybe a crop that doesn't sell that well  
**0:42:15-0:42:18:**  anymore so you decide to introduce something new.  
**0:42:18-0:42:24:**  And those redesign opportunities give you an opportunity to change the system there  
**0:42:24-0:42:29:**  and to embrace the research that you maybe have conducted on a smaller plot for the last  
**0:42:29-0:42:37:**  couple of years and say like, okay, yes, I can actually produce less, sorry, produce  
**0:42:37-0:42:40:**  more but with less inputs.  
**0:42:40-0:42:47:**  So we test those different systems and then we're gradually moving from the established  
**0:42:47-0:42:53:**  plot or the established approach to a new approach, if you see what I mean.  
**0:42:53-0:42:58:**  And so you're not experimenting in the blind, you're actually going into a change situation  
**0:42:58-0:42:59:**  knowingly.  
**0:42:59-0:43:06:**  At the same time, you can introduce many practices without entering risks.  
**0:43:06-0:43:11:**  So just, I mean, I don't want to start talking about another farm, but there's a farm in  
**0:43:11-0:43:14:**  Panama called Kwangwo.  
**0:43:14-0:43:15:**  It's also about cocoa.  
**0:43:15-0:43:21:**  It's a very wet and tropical environment at the Atlantic coast.  
**0:43:21-0:43:30:**  So it's cocoa, it's native forest, it's plantain, a lot of plantain production there.  
**0:43:30-0:43:40:**  So we looked at how to develop that farm and we went from the principle do not disturb.  
**0:43:40-0:43:46:**  So rather than doing deep tilling and all of this, we actually decided, no, let's do  
**0:43:46-0:43:47:**  it differently.  
**0:43:47-0:43:56:**  Let's plant the cocoa actually just carefully opening up the soil, leaving the top cover,  
**0:43:56-0:44:05:**  the ground cover, sorry, undisturbed and putting the cocoa in and leaving basically just opening  
**0:44:05-0:44:11:**  it up, planting the cocoa in, obviously carefully tending for it, but not going the traditional  
**0:44:11-0:44:16:**  way of land preparation, but do it in a very careful way.  
**0:44:16-0:44:18:**  And it seems to work very well.  
**0:44:18-0:44:20:**  It's progressing well.  
**0:44:20-0:44:25:**  And so we're embracing those practices and we don't think it's a big risk.  
**0:44:25-0:44:30:**  It's something that we try and we have the big benefit that we have 12 farms.  
**0:44:30-0:44:35:**  So you can try things in different places and you have a network, a knowledge network  
**0:44:35-0:44:38:**  that exchanges amongst each other.  
**0:44:38-0:44:43:**  And so you don't have to do all the experiments in the same place.  
**0:44:43-0:44:51:**  You can learn from what, I don't know, the farming team in Chinalp did and compare that  
**0:44:51-0:44:57:**  with what the farming team in Kwangwo does or what the guys in the Amposia project in  
**0:44:57-0:45:00:**  the Dominican Republic do.  
**0:45:00-0:45:08:**  So I think there the portfolio thought helps a lot to de-risk and say like, yeah, oh, we  
**0:45:08-0:45:11:**  already did this last year and it works very well.  
**0:45:11-0:45:16:**  And that gives the local team the confidence to do that as well because it's been tested  
**0:45:16-0:45:22:**  and it's been tried and it's been tried by someone you trust because you know them, you  
**0:45:22-0:45:26:**  work with them, you meet them at workshops regularly.  
**0:45:26-0:45:30:**  And yeah, that's what we're trying to establish.  
**0:45:30-0:45:35:**  How is that a theory of change comparing to what you're seeing on the ground then?  
**0:45:35-0:45:40:**  Because to clarify my thoughts, I think if we go back to agroforestry specifically, the  
**0:45:40-0:45:45:**  theory of change of agroforestry is clear and often available.  
**0:45:45-0:45:53:**  Let's say we can make more resilient agricultural systems, reduce inputs, reduce pest pressures,  
**0:45:53-0:45:54:**  diversify production.  
**0:45:54-0:46:00:**  All of this sounds amazing and I'm not saying that it's not happening, but we also see the  
**0:46:00-0:46:06:**  flip side of it, which is diverse systems require more knowledge, require more management  
**0:46:06-0:46:12:**  time, require more marketing time sometimes because you have different products or commodities  
**0:46:12-0:46:18:**  to sell depending on which scale we're talking about and many kind of practical problems.  
**0:46:18-0:46:23:**  And this is what I find exciting talking to you today is to really understand, you know,  
**0:46:23-0:46:29:**  obviously you set up this project with the hypothesis that agroforestry could deliver  
**0:46:29-0:46:35:**  all of this and could at the same time regenerate these farms and deliver financial returns.  
**0:46:35-0:46:37:**  Do you think that's happening?  
**0:46:37-0:46:44:**  Are you validated in there or do you see that tension between the regenerative dimension  
**0:46:44-0:46:47:**  and the financial return dimension?  
**0:46:47-0:46:51:**  Well, there is a certain clash, I agree.  
**0:46:51-0:46:56:**  And I mean, well, first of all, you have to ask yourself what none of this means anything  
**0:46:56-0:47:01:**  per se, you know, agroforestry, you know, there's no way.  
**0:47:01-0:47:05:**  Of course, there's a definition of that, but it's such a wide field that you can interpret  
**0:47:05-0:47:09:**  it in many ways, you know, it's the same with regenerative agriculture.  
**0:47:09-0:47:11:**  Suddenly everyone is regenerative.  
**0:47:11-0:47:15:**  It's amazing how they change overnight.  
**0:47:15-0:47:19:**  And so those terms aren't defined.  
**0:47:19-0:47:24:**  So you have to, you have to find your own definition of what that means to you.  
**0:47:24-0:47:29:**  If you are a group that is serious about that, you need to obviously defend that about two  
**0:47:29-0:47:35:**  to against other people who have maybe a different opinion about that.  
**0:47:35-0:47:42:**  But so first of all, it's about defining what you're doing there and how far you go down  
**0:47:42-0:47:45:**  the rabbit hole if you want.  
**0:47:45-0:47:54:**  But secondly, and I believe we are genuine about this and pushing the boundaries of what  
**0:47:54-0:47:55:**  is possible.  
**0:47:55-0:48:00:**  So here we come to your question, what is possible is in the context of profitability,  
**0:48:00-0:48:07:**  you know, in the sense of, am I willing to sacrifice or to bring the costs up to such  
**0:48:07-0:48:16:**  an high level because the attention of detail for these systems is so high that, you know,  
**0:48:16-0:48:24:**  my labour costs, the time I spend on tending to a particular area is so high that overall  
**0:48:24-0:48:29:**  it doesn't translate into the profitability I need to bring in the capital.  
**0:48:29-0:48:34:**  So that's a trade off to be found or an optimum to be found.  
**0:48:34-0:48:42:**  And what our head of operations always says, you know, what we're about is to find that  
**0:48:42-0:48:43:**  optimum.  
**0:48:43-0:48:49:**  It's not about short term maximisation of yields, nor is it about short term optimization  
**0:48:49-0:48:56:**  of regenerative practice, maximisation of regenerative practices.  
**0:48:56-0:49:03:**  It is about finding that optimum where you can be in a healthy profitable zone and you're  
**0:49:03-0:49:10:**  running your farm in a credible way and a very transparent way and you communicate what  
**0:49:10-0:49:17:**  you're doing to the investors and you find those groups who are willing to invest in  
**0:49:17-0:49:25:**  those models and they don't expect the double digit returns that they may be able to squeeze  
**0:49:25-0:49:31:**  out of high yielding conventional agriculture, but they want to see some returns and they  
**0:49:31-0:49:33:**  want to see the returns that you communicated to them.  
**0:49:33-0:49:37:**  So it's very much about trust and transparency.  
**0:49:37-0:49:39:**  You need to explain what you're doing.  
**0:49:39-0:49:44:**  You need to explain what impact that may have on your costs.  
**0:49:44-0:49:50:**  You may also, you need to sell better.  
**0:49:50-0:49:54:**  You know, if it costs more to do it, then you need to find those buyers who are willing  
**0:49:54-0:49:57:**  to pay more for the product.  
**0:49:57-0:50:02:**  So that's why we also build a sales team, you know, product sales team, because it's,  
**0:50:02-0:50:07:**  you cannot just have higher costs, but then still sell to the local trader and it gives  
**0:50:07-0:50:13:**  you the same price as it gives to the conventional team.  
**0:50:13-0:50:18:**  So you need to find those buyers in the market that are acting more ethically and they are  
**0:50:18-0:50:26:**  interested in products that have been sourced, you know, traceable, but also they care about  
**0:50:26-0:50:30:**  the way it's been produced and those buyers exist and you need to find them, you need  
**0:50:30-0:50:32:**  to convince them.  
**0:50:32-0:50:37:**  So it's that holistic management, but first and foremost, you need to explain what you're  
**0:50:37-0:50:42:**  doing to the investors and then you will find that there are groups out there who buy into  
**0:50:42-0:50:49:**  that and they see that there is the long-term value in that change because I believe, and  
**0:50:49-0:50:54:**  we as a group believe that in the long term, what we're doing will become the standard  
**0:50:54-0:50:59:**  model of farming, you know, or there will be no farming anymore.  
**0:50:59-0:51:02:**  That's the alternative, you know.  
**0:51:02-0:51:08:**  So let's not get into this sort of preaching kind of discussion.  
**0:51:08-0:51:12:**  But I wanted to, I mean, sorry to interrupt, but you know, I definitely want to go into  
**0:51:12-0:51:16:**  the sales bit, but I wanted to finish a bit on the investor bit because you're saying  
**0:51:16-0:51:23:**  finding that optimum between profitability and let's say, you know, environmental services  
**0:51:23-0:51:29:**  or regeneration, I don't know how we want to call it, but how do you make that optimum  
**0:51:29-0:51:30:**  then?  
**0:51:30-0:51:35:**  Do you kind of have this analysis before where you decide on a certain return on investments  
**0:51:35-0:51:40:**  and then, you know, you have to fix yourself to delivering that and then you allow yourself  
**0:51:40-0:51:45:**  some experimentation that stay within that target of profitability or, you know, how  
**0:51:45-0:51:47:**  do you tackle the optimum?  
**0:51:47-0:51:52:**  How do you calculate your kind of, what is your planning process?  
**0:51:52-0:51:59:**  Yeah, well, it's, well, first of all, you start with some return expectations that are  
**0:51:59-0:52:00:**  communicated.  
**0:52:00-0:52:02:**  So you know what the investor needs.  
**0:52:02-0:52:10:**  I mean, I mentioned, I mentioned pension funds, you know, you also have to see that a lot  
**0:52:10-0:52:15:**  of investors, well, they have their own investment or their own return objectives in the sense  
**0:52:15-0:52:18:**  that they are working for other people.  
**0:52:18-0:52:24:**  It's not their money either, you know, it's the money of the people who will be pensioners  
**0:52:24-0:52:27:**  in this fund, the beneficiary.  
**0:52:27-0:52:35:**  So they have returns that they need to deliver to, you know, pay for your pension or my pension.  
**0:52:35-0:52:41:**  And that's what they need to see in terms of return.  
**0:52:41-0:52:48:**  And you, in order to deliver that, there is a big transition, a transmission mechanism  
**0:52:48-0:52:55:**  between, you know, what is being sold as cocoa or coffee or timber and what ends up in the  
**0:52:55-0:52:58:**  pocket of the investor basically from that.  
**0:52:58-0:52:59:**  Sure.  
**0:52:59-0:53:03:**  In terms of overheads and taxation and what you all have.  
**0:53:03-0:53:06:**  So you can work backwards and say like, okay, this is what I need to achieve at the farm  
**0:53:06-0:53:07:**  level.  
**0:53:07-0:53:12:**  Now, and then the question is, is that achievable with the practices that we have in mind with  
**0:53:12-0:53:15:**  that change agenda?  
**0:53:15-0:53:21:**  And there you are in a constant iteration where you have to see like, okay, if I do  
**0:53:21-0:53:25:**  this, it's not only a question about, am I doing it?  
**0:53:25-0:53:28:**  The second question is, am I doing it now?  
**0:53:28-0:53:30:**  Should I do it now or should I do it later?  
**0:53:30-0:53:35:**  Or should I do it over time or should I do it in one go?  
**0:53:35-0:53:41:**  And are there also other sources of funding out there, grant-based and so on that may  
**0:53:41-0:53:46:**  be able to finance those transitions, you know?  
**0:53:46-0:53:52:**  Because usually the transition phase is the most difficult part.  
**0:53:52-0:54:01:**  I believe that a fully productive, biodiverse, regeneratively managed plot of land that is  
**0:54:01-0:54:09:**  fully productive, it can deliver the same financial results as a conventional monoculture  
**0:54:09-0:54:11:**  or more.  
**0:54:11-0:54:15:**  But to get there takes an awful lot of time.  
**0:54:15-0:54:21:**  And that period of time, that is hard to get through because there you don't make that  
**0:54:21-0:54:26:**  much money and it costs more to establish it and some things fail and then you need  
**0:54:26-0:54:29:**  to start from scratch.  
**0:54:29-0:54:32:**  And that process basically that needs, that is difficult.  
**0:54:32-0:54:41:**  I'm not saying we have all the answers there, but we plan some of that into our financial  
**0:54:41-0:54:42:**  models.  
**0:54:42-0:54:44:**  We communicate that, ramp up time.  
**0:54:44-0:54:50:**  We have investors who have that patience that they don't expect, you know, planting today  
**0:54:50-0:54:53:**  returns tomorrow.  
**0:54:53-0:54:56:**  But also that patience is limited, you know?  
**0:54:56-0:55:02:**  So you cannot do all that you wish to do at the same time.  
**0:55:02-0:55:11:**  And we're currently working on also bringing in other sources of funding, match funding,  
**0:55:11-0:55:19:**  where you basically bring your own money and you find a grant or public donor who's willing  
**0:55:19-0:55:25:**  to invest into that research together with you, you know, to have research plots, to  
**0:55:25-0:55:31:**  have test areas on different topics.  
**0:55:31-0:55:38:**  And then once you've established, okay, this works, it's an optimum, it's different to  
**0:55:38-0:55:44:**  that, and sometimes there are different optimums, you know, there's the, okay, I've put in maximum  
**0:55:44-0:55:47:**  inputs and I get the highest yields.  
**0:55:47-0:55:51:**  And there's the other extreme of, no, I don't touch that land and I just reap whatever is  
**0:55:51-0:55:52:**  coming out of there.  
**0:55:52-0:55:57:**  And we're looking obviously at something in between that.  
**0:55:57-0:56:04:**  But I imagine that must be difficult because there's so little data on the actual financial  
**0:56:04-0:56:07:**  viability of these innovative production models.  
**0:56:07-0:56:12:**  It must be quite difficult for you then to be able to give a really precise number in  
**0:56:12-0:56:18:**  terms of return and incorporating that complexity into the projects.  
**0:56:18-0:56:21:**  Well, yes and no.  
**0:56:21-0:56:33:**  I mean, to be honest, I think quite good on the cost projections in terms of, you know,  
**0:56:33-0:56:42:**  I mean, ultimately you have a permanent level of staff there that knows what they're doing.  
**0:56:42-0:56:48:**  So those labor costs are clear, you know, I mean, those are the people you're working  
**0:56:48-0:56:53:**  with and the question is more, what can they achieve?  
**0:56:53-0:56:57:**  So is your timing right?  
**0:56:57-0:57:03:**  I think so I'm less concerned about the cost planning, for example, and more about, you  
**0:57:03-0:57:08:**  know, is the change agenda, is it not too ambitious?  
**0:57:08-0:57:10:**  You know, are we not moving too fast?  
**0:57:10-0:57:16:**  Is it possible to do several hundred hectares in that way every year, you know, or does  
**0:57:16-0:57:18:**  it take more time?  
**0:57:18-0:57:25:**  And that you also know what you can sell the products for, you know, I mean, by now we  
**0:57:25-0:57:31:**  have a good portfolio of buyers who like our products and so we know what we can achieve  
**0:57:31-0:57:33:**  price-wise in the market.  
**0:57:33-0:57:37:**  So you have a good understanding of your costs and you have a good understanding of the prices  
**0:57:37-0:57:39:**  you can achieve in the market.  
**0:57:39-0:57:47:**  The question mark in between is the change agenda, you know, so like how fast can your  
**0:57:47-0:57:50:**  production change and ramp up?  
**0:57:50-0:57:53:**  So and how much will it actually produce?  
**0:57:53-0:57:59:**  And those are the question marks that you have because those systems haven't been tried  
**0:57:59-0:58:03:**  and tested for decades and centuries, you know.  
**0:58:03-0:58:07:**  So if you have a, to come back to that, you may have example, if you have a system where  
**0:58:07-0:58:19:**  you have robusta, cacao, rubber, plantain, or sort of on the same hectare planted in  
**0:58:19-0:58:24:**  innovative ways and tended in a very careful manner, you know, like looking at managing  
**0:58:24-0:58:33:**  the nutrient cycle, the water cycle, all of that very carefully.  
**0:58:33-0:58:41:**  You have an expectation of how your yields will look like, but that's difficult to manage,  
**0:58:41-0:58:46:**  you know, how will the yield exactly look like in year four after planting or year five  
**0:58:46-0:58:47:**  after planting.  
**0:58:47-0:58:53:**  And that's where we're still gathering data and getting better and where we're also sometimes  
**0:58:53-0:58:58:**  realizing, hey, it's been slower, you know, it's been slower.  
**0:58:58-0:59:02:**  We don't have the production yet that we thought we would have.  
**0:59:02-0:59:08:**  But I'm impressed at the fact that you're managing this on such a large scale because  
**0:59:08-0:59:14:**  already on the scale of an individual small farm, it's already sometimes difficult, you  
**0:59:14-0:59:20:**  know, to anticipate what you can actually get out of it because you might have anticipate  
**0:59:20-0:59:25:**  in theory that your inputs will reduce because you'll have a more resilient production system  
**0:59:25-0:59:29:**  that will require less pest control or whatever.  
**0:59:29-0:59:35:**  But actually anticipating that and how that expresses in the local context is so difficult.  
**0:59:35-0:59:41:**  And yeah, if you guys managed to pull that off on multiple projects at the same time,  
**0:59:41-0:59:42:**  congratulations.  
**0:59:42-0:59:45:**  Well, I mean, don't congratulate us too early.  
**0:59:45-0:59:50:**  I mean, we've a couple of years, well, a bit more than a couple, but a few years into this  
**0:59:50-0:59:53:**  process and it takes time.  
**0:59:53-0:59:59:**  But you know, so far we're doing I think well.  
**0:59:59-1:00:04:**  But you're absolutely right because you have your theory, you're like, okay, I do this  
**1:00:04-1:00:07:**  and then this effect will happen and that will bring down costs or I can reduce that  
**1:00:07-1:00:09:**  input, you know.  
**1:00:09-1:00:15:**  So that's your theory and in principle everything's fine with that theory, but then the realities  
**1:00:15-1:00:17:**  were acting in nature, you know.  
**1:00:17-1:00:25:**  So your theory gets thrown into the bin because suddenly it's a drought year or it's super  
**1:00:25-1:00:30:**  wet, it's been raining like crazy or I don't know, you're doing well and then the hurricane  
**1:00:30-1:00:31:**  goes through.  
**1:00:31-1:00:36:**  So which is probably not what happens too much in the south of France, but it also happens  
**1:00:36-1:00:37:**  there.  
**1:00:37-1:00:39:**  It's maybe a bit more temperate, but...  
**1:00:39-1:00:41:**  We have droughts, don't worry.  
**1:00:41-1:00:46:**  We have our own challenges as well.  
**1:00:46-1:00:54:**  So you know, your plans go well and then you need to deal with just realities in the farm  
**1:00:54-1:00:59:**  and that happens to us as it happens to a smaller farm.  
**1:00:59-1:01:05:**  The difference is if you are a small farm team, then you're one, two or three people  
**1:01:05-1:01:11:**  with all this knowledge and to react to that.  
**1:01:11-1:01:14:**  And in our case, we are more, you know.  
**1:01:14-1:01:18:**  You have knowledgeable people on the farms who can take fast actions.  
**1:01:18-1:01:24:**  You have that support team, technical services team that can bring in specialists to say  
**1:01:24-1:01:29:**  like, okay, look, I need to improve on that irrigation system.  
**1:01:29-1:01:32:**  How am I going to do it?  
**1:01:32-1:01:36:**  And these people have the experience of many projects, you know.  
**1:01:36-1:01:41:**  So that's a support layer that you may not have as a standalone farmer.  
**1:01:41-1:01:46:**  You have to rely on Google or hire expensive consultants.  
**1:01:46-1:01:53:**  But I imagine that as an organization, it must be very difficult to combine both kind  
**1:01:53-1:01:58:**  of a centralized decision-making process in the sense that you still have, you know, one,  
**1:01:58-1:02:05:**  two trie with your central team managing different projects, managing the relationship with investors.  
**1:02:05-1:02:08:**  So keeping that cohesive structure.  
**1:02:08-1:02:15:**  But at the same time, having decentralized structures as well so that you can be responsive  
**1:02:15-1:02:19:**  to local conditions and things that come up because, you know, a big advantage you have  
**1:02:19-1:02:25:**  if you're just one farmer on your land is that you're able to react to situations very  
**1:02:25-1:02:31:**  quickly and to make decisions that only involve a few people and observe very closely the  
**1:02:31-1:02:36:**  feedback loops between what you're implementing and what you're observing and how the land  
**1:02:36-1:02:37:**  is responding.  
**1:02:37-1:02:41:**  And doing that at such a scale seems really complex.  
**1:02:41-1:02:42:**  Yeah.  
**1:02:42-1:02:47:**  And I think you're mentioning a very important point.  
**1:02:47-1:02:53:**  You need to, if you want to do this in a good way, then you need good local trusted partners  
**1:02:53-1:03:00:**  who know what they're doing and are also able and willing to take decisions when they are  
**1:03:00-1:03:09:**  required, you know, and those decisions need to be aligned with your corporate thinking  
**1:03:09-1:03:13:**  and strategy and development process, if you see what I mean.  
**1:03:13-1:03:23:**  So what I think doesn't work is if you just treat those farms as sort of contract farming,  
**1:03:23-1:03:29:**  you know, and the people, the local people are not empowered to take, you know, to think  
**1:03:29-1:03:33:**  for themselves and to take those decisions.  
**1:03:33-1:03:38:**  That doesn't work in practice because you have to take a million decisions every day.  
**1:03:38-1:03:45:**  And if the local manager ultimately doesn't care because, you know, he doesn't feel like  
**1:03:45-1:03:53:**  he's taking ownership for the farm, it's just, you know, a hired gun if you want.  
**1:03:53-1:03:55:**  Then that will not work.  
**1:03:55-1:04:05:**  So I think we're very happy and lucky with the partners that we have in the farms.  
**1:04:05-1:04:12:**  We also had failures in that regard that we had local teams that, I don't know, didn't  
**1:04:12-1:04:18:**  somehow quite connect to our vision and they didn't implement what we thought they were  
**1:04:18-1:04:19:**  implementing.  
**1:04:19-1:04:25:**  They were taking decisions that actually had some bad consequences.  
**1:04:25-1:04:30:**  And so we learned from that and more and more, we are actually involved ourselves in the  
**1:04:30-1:04:31:**  farming.  
**1:04:31-1:04:37:**  So we're not an investor, we're not just a sort of technical support group, but we are  
**1:04:37-1:04:43:**  very actively involved in the farm operational setup.  
**1:04:43-1:04:51:**  And also we set up joint venture structures with local operators, with individuals to  
**1:04:51-1:04:59:**  set up specific farm operator or operating companies that are managing a farm.  
**1:04:59-1:05:06:**  And we're making sure that what we want to see as a theory of change is happening in  
**1:05:06-1:05:09:**  the field and there is a direct feedback.  
**1:05:09-1:05:14:**  At the same time, the people are empowered enough, the local general managers and the  
**1:05:14-1:05:18:**  farm managers and so on, they are empowered enough and knowledgeable enough and educated  
**1:05:18-1:05:22:**  enough that they can make those decisions that are necessary.  
**1:05:22-1:05:25:**  They don't need to, oh, there's a problem.  
**1:05:25-1:05:30:**  And then they need to go all the way through back to Berlin to ask for approval to do something.  
**1:05:30-1:05:32:**  That's not happening.  
**1:05:32-1:05:37:**  But I wanted to ask on the social side of it, because you mentioned earlier that you  
**1:05:37-1:05:41:**  went for a structure where you own big farms.  
**1:05:41-1:05:49:**  And so the structure is we're talking on 5,000 hectares and I can see how that makes sense  
**1:05:49-1:05:52:**  linked to the investments necessities.  
**1:05:52-1:05:57:**  You were mentioning that the type of investors you're talking to aren't going to invest in  
**1:05:57-1:05:59:**  a kind of 10 hectare farm.  
**1:05:59-1:06:04:**  But going forward, what kind of place do you see for small farmers?  
**1:06:04-1:06:09:**  Do you think that necessarily agroforestry and changing agriculture has to go through  
**1:06:09-1:06:18:**  these mega farms owned sometimes by an organization that's from somewhere else or whatever that  
**1:06:18-1:06:20:**  centralizes so much land?  
**1:06:20-1:06:26:**  Or do you think that it will be able, that it's a possibility also for small autonomous  
**1:06:26-1:06:29:**  farmers to play a part in the picture?  
**1:06:29-1:06:34:**  That's a super difficult question.  
**1:06:34-1:06:37:**  That is a question that we discussed quite a bit.  
**1:06:37-1:06:39:**  So yes and no.  
**1:06:39-1:06:48:**  I think there is more and more need for big professional farms that hopefully embrace  
**1:06:48-1:06:55:**  an agenda for good change.  
**1:06:55-1:07:08:**  But to act as in a hub and spoke kind of way in a region, in an area to empower those small  
**1:07:08-1:07:10:**  holders, to empower the small farmers.  
**1:07:10-1:07:17:**  I mean, what I guess you and I don't want to see is the kind of change that happened  
**1:07:17-1:07:25:**  in most of European agriculture where you literally have no one working and farming  
**1:07:25-1:07:26:**  anymore.  
**1:07:26-1:07:34:**  Everything's largely mechanized and at huge scale and at the sacrifice of biodiversity  
**1:07:34-1:07:39:**  and the whole social measure.  
**1:07:39-1:07:45:**  And there are some reversing trends there, of course, but generally I think that is still  
**1:07:45-1:07:50:**  true for North America and Europe and so on and so on.  
**1:07:50-1:07:52:**  So that's not what we want to see.  
**1:07:52-1:08:00:**  At the same time, I think you cannot rely on, I don't know, donor programs and providing  
**1:08:00-1:08:05:**  technical assistance to millions and millions of small farmers.  
**1:08:05-1:08:12:**  And in particular in the tropics, almost all of the farming, the production is still coming  
**1:08:12-1:08:15:**  out of smaller order production.  
**1:08:15-1:08:19:**  So that needs to get better.  
**1:08:19-1:08:23:**  It needs to become, first of all, it needs to become profitable and worthwhile for the  
**1:08:23-1:08:26:**  small farmer.  
**1:08:26-1:08:32:**  And there are only some ways how to achieve that, you know, that actually enough that  
**1:08:32-1:08:36:**  is worthwhile doing that farming.  
**1:08:36-1:08:43:**  And my personal belief is that it will have to be a combination that on the one hand,  
**1:08:43-1:08:52:**  not everyone should be doing subsistence farming, you know, on a tiny plot, but rather you need  
**1:08:52-1:08:59:**  some sort of concentration, at least a couple of hectares, you know, to make it worthwhile  
**1:08:59-1:09:03:**  implementing those better farming practices and so on and so on.  
**1:09:03-1:09:10:**  And then making sure that these farmers are, you know, benefiting from the hard work they  
**1:09:10-1:09:16:**  put in and the knowledge that was transferred to them and that they applied in practice.  
**1:09:16-1:09:21:**  And if that is not translated into higher prices, they can achieve, then they will not  
**1:09:21-1:09:22:**  do it.  
**1:09:22-1:09:23:**  So that needs to happen.  
**1:09:23-1:09:27:**  And at the same time, I think there need to be more aggregators out there, such as our  
**1:09:27-1:09:35:**  farms, but obviously also many others who are acting as local hubs, basically where  
**1:09:35-1:09:39:**  the farmer can sell at a good price, where he can get technical assistance from, where  
**1:09:39-1:09:44:**  he can get knowledge from and inputs and so on.  
**1:09:44-1:09:50:**  So I think it's a combination of having more aggregators or big farms that act as aggregators  
**1:09:50-1:10:02:**  and not just in isolation and alleviating the small farmer out of poverty in the sense  
**1:10:02-1:10:07:**  that not everyone can become a profitable farmer on one or two hectares of land.  
**1:10:07-1:10:10:**  I think that is not a possibility.  
**1:10:10-1:10:17:**  But if you can bring up a big number to a level where it can actually generate a good  
**1:10:17-1:10:22:**  source of income, then I think much has been achieved.  
**1:10:22-1:10:28:**  I wanted to understand, you know, as a business, the decision to invest in perennial crops,  
**1:10:28-1:10:33:**  which have much longer cycles, seems risky in a time of climate change where it's so  
**1:10:33-1:10:37:**  hard to predict future weather patterns.  
**1:10:37-1:10:45:**  And how are you managing these to integrate these longer cycles, both in terms of knowledge,  
**1:10:45-1:10:49:**  because the feedback loops are longer with trees and perennial crops and also in terms  
**1:10:49-1:10:51:**  of harvests and returns?  
**1:10:51-1:10:57:**  That's a good question.  
**1:10:57-1:11:00:**  So yes, we are all about perennial crops.  
**1:11:00-1:11:02:**  That's right.  
**1:11:02-1:11:08:**  At least sort of at the core of our production systems.  
**1:11:08-1:11:11:**  And the lead times to production are much longer.  
**1:11:11-1:11:17:**  So let's say like with coffee, it's two to three years.  
**1:11:17-1:11:22:**  But in cocoa, which we are a lot about, you're more looking at five to seven years.  
**1:11:22-1:11:29:**  And the date palms we've been talking about, they take eight or nine years, you know, until  
**1:11:29-1:11:31:**  they produce something meaningful.  
**1:11:31-1:11:35:**  So that's an awful lot of time in which things can go wrong.  
**1:11:35-1:11:38:**  And then thereafter as well.  
**1:11:38-1:11:49:**  At the same time, those are incredibly important components in a strategy that embraces climate  
**1:11:49-1:11:58:**  change, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity.  
**1:11:58-1:12:09:**  So having those objectives at the same level as profitable farming, for us, that leads  
**1:12:09-1:12:10:**  to perennial crops.  
**1:12:10-1:12:17:**  And it may be more challenging, but at the same time, I think it's more profitable.  
**1:12:17-1:12:22:**  Long term, it's more profitable than annual crops.  
**1:12:22-1:12:24:**  You have higher investments upfront.  
**1:12:24-1:12:25:**  That is true.  
**1:12:25-1:12:28:**  You have higher, longer lead times.  
**1:12:28-1:12:35:**  So this is something that can only be overcome with more patient investors who understand  
**1:12:35-1:12:42:**  that they will not have annual distributions from that investment in the first couple of  
**1:12:42-1:12:43:**  years.  
**1:12:43-1:12:48:**  But once you've overcome that, then you have a very stable system.  
**1:12:48-1:12:53:**  You know, if it is irrigated, for example, if it has a good management crew that knows  
**1:12:53-1:12:59:**  how to manage fit or sanitary risks and so on, then you have a very stable system that  
**1:12:59-1:13:04:**  you can run for 10, 20, 30 years, depending what you have there.  
**1:13:04-1:13:10:**  And it delivers very highly on all these dimensions.  
**1:13:10-1:13:13:**  And that's what you need to keep in mind.  
**1:13:13-1:13:16:**  So our change agenda is ambitious.  
**1:13:16-1:13:20:**  And so we thought that the perennial crops are the best way to achieve that, the best  
**1:13:20-1:13:21:**  way to get there.  
**1:13:21-1:13:25:**  We'll be moving towards the end of the interview because we've been chatting for a while and  
**1:13:25-1:13:29:**  I want to be conscious of your time.  
**1:13:29-1:13:33:**  And I was just wondering, you know, we're on the podcast mainly focused on temperate  
**1:13:33-1:13:41:**  climates and with agricultural as it's practiced in the US and in Europe and in industrialized  
**1:13:41-1:13:43:**  context.  
**1:13:43-1:13:49:**  And do you see the potential for, you know, projects in Europe?  
**1:13:49-1:13:53:**  I mean, not maybe specifically for your organization, if that's not the scope you've given yourself,  
**1:13:53-1:13:59:**  but do you think the type of projects you're running now, the methodologies could be transposable  
**1:13:59-1:14:04:**  to large scale farming in Europe or America?  
**1:14:04-1:14:05:**  I think so.  
**1:14:05-1:14:06:**  And I hope so.  
**1:14:06-1:14:09:**  But I mean, you're right.  
**1:14:09-1:14:17:**  Our focus has been, as I said at the beginning, on those vulnerable habitats and climate zones.  
**1:14:17-1:14:23:**  So we're active in the tropics, we're active in very dry environments.  
**1:14:23-1:14:29:**  And well, unfortunately, those dry environments are coming to Europe and to North America.  
**1:14:29-1:14:33:**  So we may come with that, if you see what I mean.  
**1:14:33-1:14:35:**  And unfortunately, I'm not joking.  
**1:14:35-1:14:45:**  So in a sense, what we're doing in Morocco, for example, in terms of organic dates production,  
**1:14:45-1:14:51:**  and we're looking at many other models that can be done there at the moment for further  
**1:14:51-1:14:53:**  investments.  
**1:14:53-1:15:01:**  You know, the same vulnerability applies to the south of Spain, south of France.  
**1:15:01-1:15:09:**  I mean, we've been on field trips in Brandenburg, surroundings of Berlin, well, headquarters,  
**1:15:09-1:15:17:**  and these are some of the lowest rainfall areas in the whole of Germany, very dry areas.  
**1:15:17-1:15:26:**  And the Centropic farm that we visited there had to do with, I think it was 300 mils of  
**1:15:26-1:15:29:**  rainfall a year, you know, that's not much.  
**1:15:29-1:15:30:**  That's very low.  
**1:15:30-1:15:34:**  So, and that's sort of 50 kilometers outside of Berlin.  
**1:15:34-1:15:46:**  So unfortunately, I think what we're doing is very, very relevant to farming in temperate  
**1:15:46-1:15:50:**  climate zones for the future, because there will be less and less temperate climate zones,  
**1:15:50-1:15:51:**  you know.  
**1:15:51-1:15:57:**  So I think what we're learning there, you know, how to be successful in semi-arid areas,  
**1:15:57-1:16:04:**  how to be, you know, how to be organic producers or near organic producers in very wet tropical  
**1:16:04-1:16:10:**  environments, and to keep those fungi at bay and so on.  
**1:16:10-1:16:18:**  Those things, I think, are hopefully very valuable pieces of information, data points  
**1:16:18-1:16:24:**  that can be used in temperate climates in the future.  
**1:16:24-1:16:30:**  And you know, we're not exclusive to that, that we stay in the tropics and so on.  
**1:16:30-1:16:35:**  We're looking at potentially making investments also in the south of France and Spain, you  
**1:16:35-1:16:36:**  know.  
**1:16:36-1:16:39:**  But there must be an agenda or a theory of change attached to it.  
**1:16:39-1:16:42:**  Ultimately, we're a mission-driven company.  
**1:16:42-1:16:47:**  We're not just looking for the easiest way to farm.  
**1:16:47-1:16:51:**  Sometimes I feel that we're looking for the most complicated way to farm.  
**1:16:51-1:16:53:**  But you know what I mean.  
**1:16:53-1:16:59:**  Those challenges exist in France, they exist in Germany, they exist in the US or in northern  
**1:16:59-1:17:02:**  Mexico.  
**1:17:02-1:17:06:**  And we will eventually, you know, if we can tap into more capital, then we will eventually  
**1:17:06-1:17:07:**  go there.  
**1:17:07-1:17:16:**  At this point in time, we obviously also want to stay to the proven areas, you know, where  
**1:17:16-1:17:22:**  people know that we can do this kind of agriculture in Mesoamerica.  
**1:17:22-1:17:24:**  They know we can do it in Morocco.  
**1:17:24-1:17:31:**  So obviously, it's easier to convince them to do more there or to invest for more investment  
**1:17:31-1:17:35:**  in those areas than to say, hey, let's go to other places.  
**1:17:35-1:17:41:**  But we're pushing further into Africa, we're pushing further into Southeast Asia.  
**1:17:41-1:17:47:**  That would have been our agenda already for this year if that little pandemic wouldn't  
**1:17:47-1:17:51:**  have come into our way.  
**1:17:51-1:17:56:**  And there's nothing that stops us from going into more temperate climate zones.  
**1:17:56-1:18:02:**  And in any case, just to make that point again, those are getting unfortunately more extreme  
**1:18:02-1:18:03:**  as well.  
**1:18:03-1:18:04:**  Sure.  
**1:18:04-1:18:09:**  The question of the need, I think is it's clear that we already need innovative techniques.  
**1:18:09-1:18:17:**  The region where I am has, you know, droughts basically every year now.  
**1:18:17-1:18:21:**  And it's clear that talking with farmers, even those that are not interested in agroforestry  
**1:18:21-1:18:26:**  or haven't determined itself, they're very clear that the first place to have green grass  
**1:18:26-1:18:31:**  is under trees and the last place where the animals can still eat is still under trees.  
**1:18:31-1:18:33:**  So there's definitely the need for it.  
**1:18:33-1:18:34:**  But I do agree with you.  
**1:18:34-1:18:42:**  I think, you know, agroforestry in tropical climates is probably a safer bet.  
**1:18:42-1:18:49:**  It's been used for far longer and the heat and the access to plenty of light definitely,  
**1:18:49-1:18:52:**  you know, lends itself well to this kind of stratified systems.  
**1:18:52-1:18:57:**  And yeah, it's still something, you know, it's still a question I'm trying to understand  
**1:18:57-1:19:05:**  is to what extent, what types of techniques are adapted to Western or let's say temperate  
**1:19:05-1:19:06:**  climates.  
**1:19:06-1:19:07:**  Clearly hedges have been used for a long time.  
**1:19:07-1:19:11:**  But you know, I have quite a skeptical mind in general.  
**1:19:11-1:19:15:**  So I'm still trying to understand if putting trees in the middle of a parcel is a good  
**1:19:15-1:19:19:**  idea or not, and we haven't answered that in this context.  
**1:19:19-1:19:24:**  Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my numerous questions.  
**1:19:24-1:19:27:**  And thanks for doing so in such an interesting manner.  
**1:19:27-1:19:30:**  I really enjoyed hearing about all of this.  
**1:19:30-1:19:36:**  And maybe we can have you back in the podcast in a few years and follow your progress on  
**1:19:36-1:19:38:**  these many exciting projects.  
**1:19:38-1:19:42:**  Thank you Etienne for giving me and us as one to trade the opportunity.  
**1:19:42-1:19:44:**  It's no, very good questions.  
**1:19:44-1:19:51:**  I'm happy that we had the opportunity to also to have the time to go in a bit deeper and  
**1:19:51-1:19:55:**  now would be great to come back at some point.  
**1:19:55-1:19:57:**  So thanks.  
**1:19:57-1:20:01:**  Thanks for making it this far and I hope you enjoyed this episode as much as I did.

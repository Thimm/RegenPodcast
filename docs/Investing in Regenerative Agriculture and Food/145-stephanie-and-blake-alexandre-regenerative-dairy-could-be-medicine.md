**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:00:26):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:00:31):**  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:00:35):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:00:40):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:00:46):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:00:49):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:00:52):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:00:58):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:29):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:31):**  Welcome to another episode today with Stephanie and Blake Alexander, the owners of the Alexandra  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:35):**  family farm, the first regenerative dairy in the world and we're definitely going to  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:38):**  unpack that.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:39):**  The fourth generation dairy farmers with over 40 years of experience.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:43):**  Blake and Stephanie founded the Alexandra family farm in Crescent City, California in  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:47):**  1988.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:48):**  Welcome Blake and Stephanie.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:51):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:52):**  It's great to be here.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:53):**  Yes, thank you.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:54):**  And so to start with an obvious question, but are you born on a farm, on a dairy farm?  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:01:59):**  What is your connection to soil?  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:00):**  Did you move out to that?  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:01):**  Was it a very conscious choice?  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:03):**  Was it, I wouldn't say forced, but what is your story leading to one of the leading regenerative  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:08):**  dairy farms in the world?  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:09):**  Yeah, we're both products of growing up here in California, just on opposite ends of the  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:14):**  state.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:15):**  I'm from the extreme Northern California where I'm fourth generation on my mom's side of  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:21):**  the family.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:22):**  And my dad was actually an immigrant from the Portuguese islands, the Azores.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:26):**  And so I grew up as the only son in our family with two sisters, knowing that I was always  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:31):**  going to be outside working with dad and ultimately growing up to be a dairyman, right?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:37):**  We lived on a rented and leased facility for my entire life.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:41):**  And so I didn't know where I was going to be a dairyman and that later evolved, but  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:47):**  absolutely inherited this career.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:50):**  Just didn't inherit any land with it.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:53):**  And then I grew up in Southern California, as Blake said, my great grandfather immigrated  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:02:57):**  from the Netherlands in the LA area and started dairying there.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:01):**  And then eventually we, I grew up 45 minutes from LA where we contributed to the LA milk  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:06):**  pool and always prayed I'd marry a dairy farmer.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:09):**  I've been on the dairy, love working the dairy.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:12):**  So met Blake at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in college about 38 years ago.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:17):**  And was there any, for both of you actually, any doubt ever to not be a dairy farmer or  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:21):**  not be a farmer at all?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:23):**  Never, absolutely never.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:24):**  I was raised thinking that I could, I as a woman could be a dairy farmer.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:28):**  I was that involved in our family dairy.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:31):**  And then you both mentioned, I mean, connections to the land, but not necessarily the land  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:36):**  where you're now.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:37):**  How did you find this land?  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:39):**  How did your life journey lead to this specific pieces of land, which is quite large and how  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:44):**  deep are the roots now basically?  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:46):**  So we got married and first worked for my father for only about six months, just really  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:52):**  kind of getting our feet on the ground, knowing that we were going to move out onto our own  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:56):**  somewhere.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:03:58):**  And a facility down in Southern California, Los Angeles area where Stephanie's from came  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:03):**  available.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:04):**  And so we went down there and started a partnership with her parents.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:08):**  And we were in that region for almost four years.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:12):**  At that time, this land came for sale up here where we currently call home in Crescent City,  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:18):**  which is about a hundred miles north of where I grew up, but it's very similar region.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:24):**  It was a grass based dairy area.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:27):**  And so for me, it was like coming home.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:29):**  And so we made that big move about 30 years ago to come here to this farm.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:34):**  And it's a very different place.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:35):**  I mean, very different climate than where you grew up Stephanie.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:38):**  And because you've mentioned already the far north of California, and this is even a hundred  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:42):**  kilometers further, around the bus north.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:44):**  So this is just described visually because we're on an audio tour, obviously what the  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:50):**  land looks like when we close our eyes and we're imagining visiting.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:53):**  Wow.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:54):**  When we bought this ranch, it was one of those feelings, how beautiful it is here.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:04:59):**  And we as farmers realized, oh my goodness, we are the true environmentalist.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:03):**  We've got to make a difference with this land.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:06):**  We now have children when we were moving here and need to be mindful of all the things we  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:11):**  need to do right for the land.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:14):**  And growing up in Southern California, yes, I miss the heat, but it didn't take long.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:18):**  I think more importantly, I missed family.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:21):**  And as we grew our own family and the kids started school, then you become friends with  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:25):**  many people who also become family.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:27):**  Yeah, so for your listeners, I would first describe Southern California and much of the  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:33):**  environment where the majority of the milk in our state is coming from is where you've  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:39):**  got large confinement farms or the cattle are living in a corral and being fed on a  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:42):**  feed manger.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:43):**  And in Southern California, sometimes the air quality was not so good because we were  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:48):**  so close to the metropolitan area of Los Angeles.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:51):**  And so I used to say, wow, this is a bad environment for cows and people.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:55):**  It really was.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:05:56):**  And so when we come here, you know, to close our eyes and describe where we are now, it's  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:01):**  just an absolute beautiful setting.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:04):**  We've got the ocean about two kilometers to the west and we can't see it, but we can hear  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:09):**  it.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:10):**  And the reason we can't see it is because there's beautiful trees in between and our  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:13):**  land goes right up to the trees.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:15):**  And some of those trees are our ranch.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:17):**  And then looking in other all three other directions, you kind of see the same thing  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:21):**  because we're in a bit of a valley, a small valley, but there's hills that are just green  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:26):**  all year long with evergreen trees.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:28):**  A lot of we're on the northern end of the redwood forest.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:32):**  And so we've got redwood trees that are really close and even on our ranch.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:36):**  And then it's a green valley with little creeks and drainage is draining through it.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:41):**  And so nothing's square and straight.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:43):**  It's just very natural and beautiful.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:45):**  And we've done a lot of riparian restoration work to replant trees, to make those waterways  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:50):**  even more scenic and more environmentally friendly and actually just more enjoyable  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:55):**  for even us.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:56):**  Right.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:06:57):**  That's, you know, we're the ones that live here and see it every day.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:00):**  And the average daily temperature through the year is 11 degrees from winter to summer.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:05):**  So in the winter it stays pretty mild.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:07):**  We do get a lot of rain, 80 to 100 inches.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:10):**  So that allows us to be green.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:11):**  And when you talk about the whole western United States being in a drought, we're kind  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:15):**  of immune to that so far.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:17):**  And our summers we get the fog because it gets hot inland.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:21):**  And we really appreciate that.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:23):**  So the cows don't need shade when they're out grazing.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:26):**  And I'm imagining you didn't put, because you mentioned nothing is square and straight.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:31):**  You didn't put a huge confinement factory there as you've seen in the south.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:35):**  When you arrived, what was the farm like and what did you change?  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:40):**  Excellent question.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:41):**  Because there's a, the farm had been built for about a 1000 cow dairy.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:46):**  And so there are facilities because of that rainfall that Stephanie mentioned, we need  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:50):**  to have shelter for our cows in the winter months.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:54):**  And that's a period of maybe two to four months depending on the weather and the individual  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:07:59):**  year.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:00):**  And so we have what we call free stall barns where the cows have cubicles where they can  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:05):**  lay down and then eat on the manger.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:07):**  We can bring feed to them.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:09):**  And typically the feed that we use is grass silage or haylage that we've made on our farm  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:14):**  in the spring and summertime and some alfalfa hay that's grown inland at other ranches where  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:21):**  we have one ranch and we kind of buy about 50% of our hay as well.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:26):**  So how did it, I mean, there's, there's many parts of to that question.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:29):**  How did it change in the last 30 years?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:31):**  Let's say first the farm, apart from all the riparian zones you planted, but like the farming  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:35):**  of the cows changed a lot over the last years.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:38):**  You know, it's interesting.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:39):**  So things have changed.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:40):**  When we purchased this facility, we were basically milking 1000 cows three times a day, kind  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:45):**  of a high yield production agriculture model that we had been trained to do from our college  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:51):**  upbringing and certainly all of our peer group and folks in our generation were reaching  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:56):**  out and doing that larger scale dairy.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:08:58):**  It just wasn't comfortable for me because then we've got grass across the road or grass  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:03):**  in the back of the fields that we're going out and harvesting at three or four or five  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:07):**  cuttings grass, haylage, and all we had to do was open the gate and let the cows out.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:12):**  And so it took us a few years, but in 2001 we had a big fire here on the farm and it  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:20):**  burned down some of our facilities, our shop and our feed barn and our electricity.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:24):**  And so we had to regroup immediately and it was a very challenging time.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:29):**  And so from that day forward, we started milking the cows just two times a day.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:34):**  And then real soon, just a number of weeks after we started grazing again and just really  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:39):**  shifted from that high yield production ag into a, I'd say a more sustainable model,  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:45):**  which is what the way cows have been milked around the world forever.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:49):**  And so we're just stepped back to doing what our grandparents were doing and really my  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:53):**  dad at some point, and then we've had this evolution of the dairy industry to get bigger  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:09:59):**  and faster.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:00):**  And so we just slowed it down a tick and it's been a wonderful move and then that led to  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:04):**  organic, which leads to all kinds of other wonderful advantages.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:09):**  I would also add to that early on, we befriended an agronomist who was just in town the other  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:14):**  day and he taught us about organic matter in the soil.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:17):**  So we started testing our organic matters early on and mindful of those concepts in  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:23):**  the soil.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:24):**  Not a lot yet.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:25):**  But when in 2001 or 2003, we went to Acres USA and just started learning.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:31):**  I always say Blake became a soil grass enthusiast after he heard Gary Zimmer, who wrote the  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:37):**  book, The Biological Farmer.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:39):**  And I became a nutrient dense foodie mom in the kitchen and got involved in Weston A.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:43):**  Price and things like that, where it's all about nutrition and that's what's going to  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:47):**  heal people.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:49):**  And what did your peer group think of that?  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:51):**  Or maybe even your parents, like the people that sent you to these colleges where let's  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:56):**  say they taught a different system.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:57):**  Sure.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:10:58):**  Yeah, that's an excellent question because I guess the first answer I want to say is,  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:04):**  well, we didn't ask their opinion, right?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:06):**  We kind of kept it somewhat quiet.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:11):**  But I remember years ago when a friend of mine was into selling organic produce and  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:18):**  I know what I thought of him and that route that he took and so here I was five years  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:23):**  later kind of stepping down the same trail.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:26):**  And so I knew enough not to really ask everyone's opinion.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:30):**  And so I think one of our mottos is to stay home, work hard and try to prove everybody  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:35):**  wrong if they have a negative opinion and certainly focus on what we can do and make  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:40):**  a change right here in our little world that eventually just grows and snowballs.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:45):**  And as our products leave, then we're hopefully making a difference in the ultimate world.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:50):**  And has that changed the opinion of, let's say, the outside world in the last years,  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:55):**  over the last few decades?  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:11:57):**  Have you seen a shift there or have you maybe also changed your bubble around you obviously  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:01):**  in a sense of more people like you mentioned before?  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:05):**  I would say yes, there definitely has been a shift.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:08):**  I think the mindfulness of better foods out there and also people are realizing that one,  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:14):**  they don't want processed foods.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:15):**  That's the first thing.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:16):**  But also organics, we're starting to see more in the media about the dangers of chemicals  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:22):**  in the health system and what they're doing in the correlation to cancers in different  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:27):**  regions of the country.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:29):**  And that's important.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:30):**  And so you can see with the growth in sales of organic products and milk is usually the  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:35):**  first thing, dairy, that people turn to.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:37):**  Yeah, I would also answer the question.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:40):**  So certainly what Stephanie says is consumers have changed.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:42):**  Their awareness is much higher.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:44):**  And so then that trickles all the way back to the farm through the retailers and the  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:48):**  distributors and the marketers.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:51):**  But I think your question was really, what is our peer group's opinion changed?  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:55):**  And yeah, I think some have changed.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:12:58):**  Our peer group has probably changed the most.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:00):**  Not their mindset, just different faces.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:03):**  And we're still friends with the other folks that we knew from 40 years ago and they're  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:08):**  continuing to do what they do in terms of their path of conventional agriculture.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:14):**  And what we're trying to do is become a model for them as well as the folks that already  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:19):**  embrace what we do.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:20):**  And the way we become a model is by trying to do this at large scale and showing folks  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:25):**  that it's not just kind of hippy dippy trippy stuff and it's not just glorified gardening.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:31):**  This is real high yield production agriculture with an old fashioned twist to it is somewhat  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:37):**  making way better nutrient dense food and getting a premium for it.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:43):**  And so it makes a difference.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:44):**  You know, it's sustainable and it makes a difference.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:47):**  I think there's a good moment to describe the farm just for anybody listening and hasn't  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:52):**  seen the website.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:53):**  Obviously, I will link it below.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:54):**  But what would you in a few sentences, how would you describe currently the farm size?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:13:59):**  What are you actually next to dairy?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:01):**  What are you doing to the dairy, to the land?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:03):**  How would you describe your farm in a few in a few sentences?  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:06):**  So it's a family farm made up of Stephanie and I and our five children have grown up  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:11):**  here.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:12):**  They're all now in their 20s.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:14):**  Oldest one just turned 31.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:16):**  The three oldest are married and working for us and with us and part of the farm.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:20):**  The farm has grown and the rest of that family is now 80, 90 employees that work on the farm.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:28):**  The farm is located in three counties now and five milk barns.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:33):**  And so we've just grown a lot.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:36):**  And so there's a lot of activity every week, every day, and it takes a lot of people and  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:40):**  a lot of coordination.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:42):**  In general, it's a green grass setting, 365 days a year.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:47):**  We just have beautiful weather, much like an Ireland or a New Zealand type of setting.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:53):**  And cows are out on grass probably 320 to 340 days a year.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:14:59):**  But we do have to put them in somewhat during the winter.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:04):**  Depending on the rainfall today, it's like as we get a break, they can go out.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:10):**  We've got heifers, young stock out grazing today all winter long and even some of our  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:15):**  dry cows.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:17):**  And so we lean on grass a lot and grow really high quality grass.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:21):**  And then also in the setting, the pastures are broken into paddocks so that it allows  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:27):**  us to rotational graze the cows when they are grazing.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:30):**  They always get a new portion of grass so that they're always just grazing the freshest  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:35):**  stuff that's allocated to them daily.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:37):**  And there's creeks and sloughs that go through our ranch that are all fenced off.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:42):**  And we plant trees every year still.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:44):**  We started those tree plantings when the kids were little and they don't even remember it,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:47):**  but they see big trees now in the creeks.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:50):**  And so that's a beautiful scenic look.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:53):**  And as Blake said, you can hear the ocean most of the time.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:56):**  We get that cool breeze in the summer.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:15:58):**  Yeah, and lots of wildlife, 250 species of birds live on our farm.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:03):**  A large herd of Roosevelt elk, 200 to 300 head.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:07):**  They're here every day.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:08):**  Bald eagle nest.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:10):**  We've had an Aleutian Canada goose that was an endangered species and now it's really  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:18):**  recovered wonderfully to where it's actually hunted now.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:21):**  And so our farm has been a big part of that recovery over the last 20 years.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:26):**  And it's brought us a lot of really wonderful attention and we're quite proud of that.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:30):**  And so we've just tried to create a wonderful place for us to live because we're here every  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:34):**  day and our employees and their families and our, of course, our families and the next  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:39):**  generation.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:40):**  And we actually have a couple of grandkids now that also live here on the farm and we  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:45):**  just keep trying to do the right thing at every turn.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:48):**  And do you remember when you started, let's say, the rotational grazing or started to  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:52):**  go beyond organic?  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:54):**  Was it relatively recent?  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:16:56):**  How did you discover, let's say, this world beyond, let's say, industrial organic that  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:01):**  came in obviously not so long ago?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:05):**  Yeah, I grew up with my grandfather and my dad rotational grazing somewhat.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:10):**  And then I would say 50 years ago, we started not rotational grazing, kind of opened up  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:15):**  all the gates and let the cows wander through the pastures.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:19):**  And there was a movement away from the intenseness of the old fashioned style, if you will.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:25):**  And then there was a really great awakening, I'd say, in the late 1970s with Alan Savery  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:30):**  and Stan Parsons came to the US and started talking about rotational grazing and electric  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:37):**  fencing was starting to become a practical reality.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:41):**  And so we started doing some of that.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:43):**  Anyhow, it's really just evolved from there.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:46):**  And so that's kind of my general understanding.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:49):**  And a company Clover's Tornado was recruiting organic milk in the late 90s.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:55):**  And we learned about it.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:17:56):**  And at the same time, friends of ours were starting a big dairy in Kansas, milking 10,000  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:01):**  cows.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:02):**  And we were getting the same price of milk.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:03):**  So we decided to go down the organic route.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:06):**  It was a business decision.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:08):**  So we were trying to compete in that industrial model realm and realizing that that was silly,  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:15):**  almost stupid, in fact.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:16):**  And so let's milk these cows twice a day.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:18):**  Let's put them out on grass twice a day.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:21):**  Let's let the cow work for a living and go back to nature and growing grass in a simple  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:26):**  model and burning less fuel and less mechanical harvesting of forage.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:33):**  So the organic market came along and allowed us to do that, giving us a premium.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:38):**  And so we could take the production hit and financially survive.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:42):**  And it worked really well for us.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:45):**  And just slightly before that, and I didn't think about it till we're talking to you now,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:48):**  is that we had hired a consultant, two people to come into our farm and go through our books  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:54):**  and what we're doing and this and that.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:56):**  And then we paid him money.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:18:58):**  And then his letter to us back was the only thing he could recommend to us was bankruptcy.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:04):**  That was not an option.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:05):**  We're fighters.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:06):**  And we did this big bullet to have this farm.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:11):**  And it was just Blake and I and the equity on our back.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:15):**  And we persevered through that.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:17):**  And we learned stuff from them.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:18):**  But we moved forward.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:21):**  So I guess we didn't tell you how big the farm is in terms of acres.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:25):**  When we first moved here 29, almost 30 years ago, we bought 556 acres.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:31):**  And then within a few years, we leased another 300 and then another ranch.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:36):**  And so it seemed like we were the only aggressive game in town.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:39):**  And so we now have, golly, close to 4000 acres here in this valley.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:46):**  And we've just become a very significant part of this community and growing.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:51):**  And so in total, we manage about 9000 acres in the three counties that we're farming in.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:19:56):**  So basically, you started to make the switch for economic reasons to cut costs and cut  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:00):**  input costs and don't cut the hayage so much and let the cow actually use her four feet  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:06):**  to actually do it themselves and walk there.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:08):**  And then how has because you mentioned a shop at the beginning and that burned down, how  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:13):**  has it changed where the milk goes and where what you produce goes?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:17):**  How is that?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:18):**  Has that shifted a lot or maybe didn't?  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:20):**  But where does it go now and where did it go before?  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:23):**  Sure.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:24):**  Like Stephanie mentioned, Clover's Donnetta was our very first organic market.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:29):**  And we had organic milk waiting and waiting and waiting for someone to buy it.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:33):**  So it was five months of making organic milk before we sold a load of organic milk.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:38):**  And so we helped them start with their brand new bottling and label.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:42):**  And then there was another creamery at the same time, Humboldt Creamery that started  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:46):**  as well, eventually a little later behind that.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:50):**  And so there was a third one up in Tillamook that abandoned cheese.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:20:55):**  And so we were one load of milk would go north and one would go south every other load.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:00):**  And that whole thing has just evolved.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:02):**  And those markets have grown.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:04):**  They've had wonderful times.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:06):**  Some of them went away, some of them failed, and some of them absolutely succeeded.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:11):**  We now sell milk to nine different creameries and three and sometimes four of them are processing  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:18):**  milk that is unique to us with our label.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:21):**  And so we're getting premium prices for that.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:24):**  And then we're still working with three local creameries that are making cheese and making  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:30):**  some powdered milks and a little bit of fluid and even ice cream.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:36):**  You mentioned nutrient density, Stephanie, before.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:38):**  How has the flavor changed of the milk over the last years as you got more enthusiastic  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:43):**  or more focused on grass and maybe on the cows welfare, etc.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:47):**  Has it changed?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:48):**  And if so, how?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:49):**  And what does it say about nutrients?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:51):**  Absolutely, it's changed.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:53):**  And I think I'm able to compare because I have siblings in the conventional dairy business  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:21:57):**  in central California.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:00):**  And I taste their milk and always would taste our milk after and just know that it just  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:05):**  had a more flavorful taste to it.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:09):**  And part of it is the genetics we're using.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:11):**  When we went back to grazing full time, we searched for those grass based genetics.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:17):**  So we originally went to New Zealand for the Kiwi Cross and brought those genetics into  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:23):**  our herd.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:24):**  And then more recently, we've been more Fleck-V and we've been crossing that into our herd  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:30):**  and that has increased the protein in our herd in the milk.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:33):**  And that's the flavor is so flavorful.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:36):**  Yeah, I would say that the cows have changed, right?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:40):**  The look of our cows.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:41):**  So let's go back to the virtual tour for your folks listening.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:45):**  Our cows are all multiple colors now and most of them have a white face, which is the German  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:50):**  breed that Stephanie just mentioned, Fleck-V. And we really love those cattle because those  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:22:55):**  are bred for dual purpose, both meat and milk production at the same time.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:00):**  So our cows are a little shorter and thicker and we have selected for short cows, low small  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:06):**  framed animals that are more immediate and moderate size.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:10):**  And so literally they're a bit more athletic.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:13):**  They can walk farther to go get their pasture.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:16):**  And we do ask them to do that quite often.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:18):**  And you became the first officially certified regenerative organic dairy in the world through  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:23):**  ROC, which we interviewed Elizabeth on the podcast.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:26):**  I will definitely link it below.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:28):**  What was that process like?  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:29):**  Was it like a lot of, I wouldn't say a lot of work, but for everything you were already  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:33):**  doing, was there still a big gap or was it mostly paperwork or how did you get involved  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:38):**  in and why did you want to be certified as it seems like you're selling already everything  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:43):**  relatively local, organic premiums, et cetera?  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:46):**  Why the jump or why the step?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:48):**  And a lot of work that comes with it with ROC.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:52):**  So we've been open minded and I guess willing to jump into everything and anything and really  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:23:59):**  trying to find value for what we do and primarily motivated by the fact that we had five children  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:06):**  and we wanted our farm to evolve into something that was a real viable option for them as  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:11):**  they grew up and met their spouse and made an adult decision on where to work.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:15):**  We didn't want them coming home to a farm that was painful and less of an opportunity  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:21):**  than they had out there in the big world.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:24):**  And so that's always motivated us to look and be open minded to anything out there.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:30):**  So as this regenerative stuff came along, it was in our minds just a new word for explaining  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:36):**  what we had already been doing and understanding through building soil and grazing cows and  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:42):**  managing grass correctly.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:45):**  So we had our daughter, Vanessa, who's about four years ago, just start getting involved  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:52):**  with both of these groups that wanted to do a regenerative certification.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:24:56):**  And that was through the Savory Institute and also the Regenerative Organic Alliance.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:02):**  And I would also add that we've known Elizabeth since we went organic and she, through the  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:08):**  years I had given her a Weston A. Price cookbook, Sally Fountain's Nourishing Traditions.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:12):**  So she knew our passion on the kitchen table as well, not just on the farmland.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:17):**  So when the pilot program started, she asked us to be a part of it because she wanted real  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:23):**  people that cared all the way to the end product.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:27):**  And we've always had the attitude that we want to be part of the development, part of  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:31):**  the solution, part of the future, and not just sit back and throw darts at the program  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:38):**  and the pieces that we don't like.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:41):**  And often these programs come and they say, well, you're too big, you're too this, you're  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:46):**  too that, and too many cows.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:48):**  And so we've been really trying to prove to a lot of folks that we can do organic and  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:54):**  we can do it right, we can do regenerative and we can do it right, and we can do it at  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:58):**  scale.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:25:59):**  And I think that's really the biggest contribution that we're going to eventually make to, I'd  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:04):**  say the US agriculture first and hopefully the world next, but we've got to help large  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:10):**  scale farmers understand that there's a path out of this extraction agriculture that they're  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:15):**  currently in and there's consumers that will reward them and retailers that will reward  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:21):**  them for that.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:23):**  And the end game is better food for more people.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:25):**  That's important.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:26):**  And then also saving rural America, our rural towns, you know, giving examples of regenerative  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:32):**  approaches that maybe they're not going to go organic, but maybe they can have longer  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:37):**  grazing seasons or warmer soils or just all those good things that would benefit their  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:43):**  farm.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:44):**  So beyond the dairy, what else do you grow?  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:46):**  Like how complex is your system?  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:48):**  I mean, you already mentioned the double function cows, obviously on the meat side.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:52):**  Are there other things you grow, other things you rotate?  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:54):**  What does your system look like beyond the dairy or the double function cows?  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:26:59):**  So in 2005, we toured Pennsylvania with our children and came home and took an old hay  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:05):**  wagon and built a chicken coop, a portable chicken coop on grass.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:10):**  And that has evolved now to 40,000 hens for egg production and grazing coops that get  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:17):**  rotated twice a week.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:18):**  So they always get new green grass.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:20):**  And so we have a egg business as well.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:22):**  We named it Alexander Kids because it was really the kids business.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:25):**  It was about raising kids.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:27):**  And we are excited with how that kind of took off.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:31):**  And that also showed us how to be in the marketplace, develop a brand distribution.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:37):**  We did a lot of self-distribution in that business and those chickens are rotating through  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:42):**  the pastures.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:44):**  So as far as diversity and what else we do, in cropping, we do very little.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:49):**  The diversity is all on permanent pastures and we keep adding new seeds and new plant  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:54):**  varieties within the old pasture.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:56):**  And so we are really not farming.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:27:58):**  We're not disking, tilling and doing things like that.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:01):**  And so, yeah, it's pretty basic.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:03):**  We've got meat, milk and eggs.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:05):**  That's what we're producing.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:07):**  And everything we're doing is growing feed for our cows and our chickens are grazing  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:13):**  on their section of ground.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:15):**  And we bring in cattle to kind of clean up the grass.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:19):**  When the grass gets too tall for the chickens, they get uncomfortable when it's a little  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:22):**  too tall.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:23):**  So that's it.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:25):**  It's kind of in harmony.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:26):**  And do you have any plans for the tree side of things, the agroforestry?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:30):**  I mean, you've been planting a lot of trees, but also on the production side, or that's  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:33):**  really a completely different game.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:36):**  We have such a wet climate that having trees in the middle of a pasture is...  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:42):**  The cows are going to shelter up under it in the wet, cool situation.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:47):**  They don't need shelter from sun here.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:49):**  We are really cool.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:50):**  And so it's probably not a good fit necessarily.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:55):**  So our trees are all on the edges and around the riparian areas and the drainages.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:28:59):**  And I don't see us harvesting those much, a little bit, but not really.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:04):**  It's more just providing beauty and habitat.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:06):**  And of course, there's an ecological effect, I think, even in the fields and windbreak  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:12):**  and things like that.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:13):**  But as far as silviculture and things that can be done in a dry climate or drier land,  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:20):**  I just don't see that working in our setting.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:24):**  What are you excited about what's next in terms of the farming or maybe the selling  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:29):**  side as well?  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:30):**  Like what is exciting?  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:31):**  We're now talking the end of 2021.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:33):**  What are big, big projects coming up or big things coming up that are exciting in your  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:38):**  farming life?  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:39):**  I would say right now we are excited with what we're doing because we launched a dairy  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:44):**  brand and we went national earlier this year and watching those sales grow as we get people  
**[0:29:50-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:50):**  talking about regenerative and our A2 organic milk where it's the digestible protein.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:29:57):**  That we're just excited about right now and investing.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:01):**  We don't want to start anything else because we are trying to make it.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:06):**  And that's an expensive launch.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:09):**  I think what she's saying is we need to get refinanced all the time and refinance our  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:13):**  real estate because we keep growing and outgrowing our business model.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:19):**  I also would add to that exciting part that I think we're getting more involved with regenerative  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:24):**  A2 powdered milks.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:27):**  We've been able now to segregate our milk through systems and make some really great  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:31):**  powders.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:32):**  Now, those powders can move around into new products and some of those new products are  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:37):**  in the center of the store for a change that aren't in the refrigerated section.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:43):**  Infant formulas, toddler formulas, cheese crackers and different things.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:49):**  Also I think we're going to have powders that can make their way into the world market.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:54):**  Working with a fellow in Australia and another broker here in the United States and partnering  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:30:58):**  with them to discover and develop more opportunity.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:03):**  Right now food companies don't have an ingredient that says we need A2 organic regenerative  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:10):**  milk.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:11):**  Just for background, what is A2?  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:13):**  It's a specific type of protein.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:17):**  It's a reference to the protein.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:18):**  In the cattle industry all over the world, somewhere a thousand years ago there was a  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:23):**  mutation of a gene where a histidine jumped in where a protein was on this amino acid  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:29):**  chain.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:30):**  For a lot of people they can't digest that milk and so they believe that they're lactose  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:34):**  intolerant.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:36):**  That's the common term around the world and yet it's probably not the lactose or the milk  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:41):**  sugar that's causing the problem, it's the protein.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:45):**  With a simple hair follicle DNA test on cattle, we can discover what genes they inherited  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:51):**  from both of their parents.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:53):**  We're looking for the females that got an A2 gene from both parents and we refer to  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:31:58):**  those as A2-A2 cows.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:01):**  Then we know that that milk is more digestible for most folks.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:04):**  Obviously, it's relatively new.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:07):**  I think that the DNA testing there was always expensive.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:10):**  The last 15 years.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:13):**  All mammal milk is A2.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:15):**  Breast milk, goat milk, sheep milk is A2.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:18):**  It was just the modern dairy breeds that had this mutation.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:23):**  This almost starts touching upon food as medicine.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:26):**  Definitely the density side of things because you cannot digest it and it causes a lot of  
**[0:32:31-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:31):**  issues.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:32):**  You're not going to consume it.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:35):**  I see a lot of talk around it and you, Stephanie, are definitely more in that world.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:39):**  Do you see it bubbling a lot more the last 18 months or two years?  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:44):**  This whole discussion of food as medicine, is that something you're part of as well?  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:49):**  What do you see happening there?  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:50):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:51):**  We get a lot of anecdotal information from parents of children that are autistic that  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:32:57):**  when they drink regular milk, their autism is more aspirated.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:01):**  When they drink our milk, they're very calm.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:03):**  Also, parents tell us their child with seizures.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:07):**  We get calls all the time about people who can't drink dairy and they can digest our  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:10):**  dairy.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:11):**  We've gotten people that have told us that they thought it was raw milk and they could  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:15):**  drink the raw milk because it still had the lactase enzyme for digestion of the lactose,  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:20):**  but they still had autoimmune diseases.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:22):**  Then they switched to our milk, which is that pasteurized, a mild slow pasteurization or  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:27):**  also ultra-pasteurized for national distribution.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:31):**  They're able to not only digest our milk, unlike other milk on the shelf, they tell  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:35):**  us, but their autoimmune diseases disappeared.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:39):**  There's a link to a lot of health issues across America or across the world that have to do  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:44):**  with milk that had the mutation, the A1 milk, and we're bringing people back to dairy.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:50):**  We're talking about the protein in milk.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:52):**  In America, there's a lot of sensitivity to gluten, the wheat proteins.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:56):**  It's the same thing.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:57):**  It's the sensitivity to a protein.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:33:59):**  That protein is not digesting.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:02):**  It's going through your gut defenses.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:04):**  Now you have this foreign protein called beta-casein morphine 7 floating around through the body.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:09):**  There's a lot of autoimmune diseases in America and it's part of the food system.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:14):**  It shouldn't be.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:15):**  Food is medicine.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:16):**  One of the exciting things that we learned and this knowledge came out of New Zealand  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:20):**  in a book called The Devil in the Milk.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:23):**  In 2007, we read that.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:25):**  By 2008, we were starting to test our cattle.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:29):**  We had to send those samples all the way to New Zealand because there weren't any labs  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:32):**  in America that could do that at the time.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:35):**  It absolutely was cutting edge technology.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:39):**  There's a conventional version of this milk called the A2 milk company that has been marketing  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:45):**  milk in Australia, New Zealand, and even into Asia, China, and around the world now in different  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:50):**  parts quite successfully.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:54):**  We simply wanted to be an organic version of that and we couldn't get anybody to do  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:58):**  it.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:34:59):**  We had to start our own brand and our own creamery and processing to accomplish that.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:04):**  One of the really exciting things, the guy that wrote that book got back to us, was our  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:08):**  daughters have studied in New Zealand and at the university that he did his work at.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:14):**  He sent us the update to the book where they had connected this to SIDS or sudden infant  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:21):**  death syndrome.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:23):**  These are raised on mama's breast milk for as long as they can and then they switch over  
**[0:35:27-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:27):**  to a baby formula that now might have a one in there, the devil in the milk.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:34):**  It just causes respiratory system to slow down and it's a sad deal.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:40):**  Those type of things are yet to be common knowledge and we hope that what we're saying  
**[0:35:46-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:46):**  is the truth and that we can be part of the solution.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:49):**  Yeah, there's more studies that are needed.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:52):**  There's definitely a lot.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:54):**  I think the milk space is interesting because it's often the first organic things people  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:35:59):**  buy as they're getting children.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:01):**  Then it's a nice gateway into a lot of other things.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:05):**  A Greg of Farmland LP called it the great gateway drug into organic is often milk, organic  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:10):**  milk.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:11):**  What would you tell?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:12):**  Let's imagine we're in a theater, we're doing this in person, which we hope to do at some  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:16):**  point and the room is full of investors that are interested in the food system that might  
**[0:36:21-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:21):**  have even invested in, let's say milk alternatives as well.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:24):**  They're very interested in protein.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:25):**  They're interested in this space and we're having this discussion on stage.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:29):**  What would you tell them, obviously without giving investment advice, but what would you  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:33):**  tell them to look for, to dive deeper into, to start digging?  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:37):**  Where should investors spend their attention and maybe at some point also make investments  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:41):**  after they've done their DD, obviously, their due diligence.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:44):**  Where would you point them to learn more about this fascinating space of regenerative therapy?  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:50):**  I think the big picture needs to start with this industrial revolution that we have and  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:55):**  that we've had certainly in the United States and I believe around the world where food  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:36:59):**  just got cheaper, faster and less nutrient dense.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:05):**  What did we learn from that experience?  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:07):**  That extraction agriculture where we were using a lot of chemical fertilizers and chemicals,  
**[0:37:13-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:13):**  period.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:15):**  What investors or what new money should be looking for is an opportunity to change the  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:19):**  food system and an opportunity to help farmers understand first why they should be growing  
**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:26):**  things regeneratively or organically.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:30):**  I personally say regenerative first.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:33):**  I don't care so much about organic as a certification.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:36):**  I think that treating the ground appropriately and honoring the system that we've been given  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:43):**  and the biology that lives in the soil and then understanding that and not doing things  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:48):**  that harm all that ultimately brings yield efficiency and more sustainable profits to  
**[0:37:54-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:54):**  the farmer and the rancher.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:37:56):**  But they have to somehow get weaned off of all the current system that they're addicted  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:01):**  to.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:03):**  There's a lot of stories and a lot of education that needs to take place first on the ground  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:08):**  at the farmer level.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:09):**  I think the consumers and the retailers are already getting it like Stephanie was mentioning.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:15):**  There is a demand for it.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:17):**  We just now need to somehow show the farmer how to get from here point A to point B.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:23):**  I think an investor needs to know the farmers and needs to see what's happening at the ground  
**[0:38:29-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:29):**  level to have confidence in the system they're investing in if they truly want better foods  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:36):**  out there for more people.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:38):**  That's our end game.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:39):**  I am a core organic person and want that clarity and surety that it's clean food and especially  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:48):**  when it's coming, it's right here.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:50):**  I like to know my farmers where we're getting our fruits and vegetables, but I know not  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:54):**  everybody can.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:38:56):**  An investor who's investing in some consumer product or a farm needs to have an understanding  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:02):**  of the soils and what they're looking for or hire the right people that can give them  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:07):**  the right advice to put their money in the right funnels.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:12):**  I would also add to that.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:15):**  I focus on regenerative first because when you focus on the soil and you start to understand  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:21):**  that and farmers become aware, they're going to automatically lean towards organic principles  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:28):**  and they're going to stop doing some of the harmful things.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:31):**  Ultimately, then organic becomes really simple for them.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:35):**  Right now, often when we talk to our peer group, we switch churches and we switch religions  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:41):**  from where they're at in a sense.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:45):**  I think if we could tiptoe into this and start at the soil and not ask them to switch churches,  
**[0:39:51-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:51):**  just a few religious principles in regards to soil, they will evolve at a faster rate  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:39:58):**  and we can truly affect more people.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:01):**  That's where I'm coming from with that.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:03):**  Do you see that in your groups around your neighbors or people that visit the farm?  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:08):**  For sure, you've had many, many people stepping onto the farm and seeing the differences to  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:13):**  their farm that might even be relatively nearby.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:17):**  Have many made changes as well?  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:19):**  If not, what is keeping them from doing like you do or copying?  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:23):**  We often see that the neighbors are not changing as well and especially the neighbors around  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:28):**  these pioneering farmers.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:29):**  For some reason, they keep saying this is a different climate or different soils or  
**[0:40:34-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:34):**  all kinds of excuses to come up why it shouldn't work or couldn't work in their farm.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:37):**  What has been your response when you see or you get those answers from your neighbors  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:41):**  or further away neighbors that somehow see with their own eyes how it could be done but  
**[0:40:46-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:46):**  still not take the plunge?  
**[0:40:47-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:47):**  We could talk all day on this subject.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:49):**  You're never a prophet in your own land.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:52):**  Let me just start right here locally.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:54):**  We've got a handful of other neighbors and one of them often would say, I don't want  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:40:58):**  any of those weeds growing in my field that you've got, Blake.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:02):**  He's referring to the chicory and the plantain and then some herbs that we have, brassicas,  
**[0:41:08-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:08):**  all these things that have helped our soils and he doesn't want any.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:12):**  Bottom line is he's selling his cows.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:14):**  He's getting out of the dairy business this month and it's sad.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:18):**  He didn't have interest in a next generation that had interest in the soil or interested  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:22):**  in the long-term sustainability of their farm.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:26):**  That's what I'm talking about is we have to somehow educate farmers to understand that  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:33):**  there's a better path forward that is truly sustainable and sustainable from a farmer's  
**[0:41:38-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:38):**  point of view means that it needs to be profitable.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:41):**  We do have a lot of people that come here and admire what we do and some that come and  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:46):**  don't notice.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:48):**  We had friends over for dinner just this weekend and they're like, man, your ranch is just  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:52):**  beautiful compared to the neighbors.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:54):**  It's incredible.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:41:55):**  This is a fellow that owns a roofing company in town and he can tell.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:00):**  We also dairy in Blake's hometown, Ferndale, and our son is on that dairy.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:06):**  It's a dairy community where there are a lot of other dairies and they ship to the local  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:10):**  cheese plant like we do, Romiano cheese.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:14):**  There's been a little bit more progression on definitely going organic there and we're  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:18):**  seeing them rotational grazing.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:21):**  We're seeing better seeds come in and the agronomist stopping in that town.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:25):**  That's great to see, but I think because there was more other dairies that went organic and  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:29):**  started listening as opposed to where we originally start and where we live, it was more of a,  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:34):**  remember we moved into this town and there was nobody who wanted the ranches so we were  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:38):**  able to grow.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:39):**  Thus, the ones that are in the dairy business still here were just in that same paradigm  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:45):**  where they just always did what they did and the next generation didn't come back.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:50):**  The other community that Stephanie is referring to, which is my hometown where our son is  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:42:55):**  fifth generation on the farm that my great grandfather started 100 years ago.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:01):**  There's a tighter connection to that community in a sense that there's neighbors that have  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:05):**  also been there for a long time.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:08):**  We've all evolved together at a slower pace there.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:12):**  It's neat to have that as a contrast to what we were first describing up here, right here  
**[0:43:17-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:17):**  in our backyard.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:18):**  Yeah, I can imagine and a shout out to Joe Baird of Arruma & Arno Cheese who introduced  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:23):**  us and the reason why we're talking here.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:26):**  Another thing, I'll put it in the show notes, they just published a piece of research in  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:29):**  the Netherlands on regenerative dairies where they showed actually the economical side of  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:33):**  things.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:34):**  They're outperforming their conventional extractive neighbors or non-neighbors or let's say somewhere  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:39):**  else in the country.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:40):**  The economic side of things, I only found the article in Dutch so you have to Google  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:44):**  translate it or deeply, but it's definitely understandable if you find a translator.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:48):**  It's quite interesting.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:50):**  I'm very interested always in the profitability side of things as well because it's much easier  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:54):**  to convince people that at least the same level.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:43:57):**  People say, yeah, but this is the hippie stuff that you mentioned before and this can never  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:00):**  be profitable and et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:03):**  The research that Jonathan and the team is doing, we had him on the call on the podcast  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:08):**  once and he's doing some other research in almonds and on the meat side as well.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:12):**  Very, very interesting.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:13):**  Unfortunately, very few people do that kind of comparison and taking a nice sample size  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:18):**  of forward thinking farmers compared to the rest and just showing the level of input costs,  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:23):**  showing the level of birds connected to that, showing the level of profitability, et cetera.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:28):**  I will link those below for whoever's interested in that.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:31):**  Then a contrarian question, definitely borrowed from John Kemp who we both know, where are  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:36):**  you when you go to, let's say, even to actually to an organic conference like acres, et cetera,  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:42):**  where are you thinking very different from your peers?  
**[0:44:46-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:46):**  What do you believe to be true about this space compared to others?  
**[0:44:48-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:48):**  Sure.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:49):**  Here in the United States, we have the Farm Bureau, we have state Farm Bureaus and I've  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:54):**  been very active there and even had a chance to speak at our National Farm Bureau Convention,  
**[0:44:59-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:44:59):**  which is the American Farm Bureau, three different times.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:02):**  There's like six, 7,000 people there.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:04):**  The last talk I gave was titled Honor Soil as You Would Your Grandchildren.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:08):**  Again, we're just trying to plant seeds in their mind that opens them up to a different  
**[0:45:14-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:14):**  possibility.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:17):**  Buying less fertilizer next year will be a good thing.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:21):**  Especially this year that we've got this crazy economy blowing up and inflation absolutely  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:27):**  out of control and literally fertilizers in the supply chain, fertilizers might double,  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:32):**  triple or quadruple in cost.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:35):**  My eyes, I'm saying, there's a great opportunity for these folks to start scaling back because  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:41):**  they've been in a cycle where they have to keep adding nutrients to get a marginally  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:46):**  smaller return of yield.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:50):**  Maybe we'll get their attention this year.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:52):**  Do you see that already?  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:54):**  Do you see like this year, do you get more people calling back saying, but you said that  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:45:58):**  a few years ago on stage somewhere, I read something about your inputs.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:01):**  Do you see any signs of that?  
**[0:46:04-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:04):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:05):**  I do.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:06):**  In fact, I'm thinking of a young fellow that, well, we were at college together.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:10):**  He's not that young.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:11):**  He's two years younger.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:12):**  18, let's say.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:15):**  What you said was phenomenal.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:16):**  I thought about it later and I went and listened to Alan Savery's TED talk and I learned.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:22):**  I get what you're talking about.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:24):**  Then that led to him talking to somebody else.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:27):**  That led to me being invited to talk to the California State Board of Agriculture.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:31):**  Apparently, I just got written up in a magazine about that talk.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:37):**  We're now asked to speak in podcast and different events all the time.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:42):**  The world's opening up and listening a little bit to what we have to say.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:47):**  Again, I love your question or John Kemp's approach.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:51):**  What would we do and what would we say?  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:46:55):**  It's not an easy answer, but I do know it starts in the soil and it starts with honoring  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:00):**  that system of the ecology and the biology that's happening in the soil and understanding  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:05):**  it.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:06):**  Most farmers, as we got educated, didn't learn.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:10):**  That's not what they're teaching at universities.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:12):**  Right.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:13):**  I think, as we know, a lot of your listeners probably understand their gut health and that  
**[0:47:18-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:18):**  gut health is so important to your whole being.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:21):**  It's feeding that healthy gut and making that healthy gut.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:24):**  The same with the soil is the gut of the plant.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:27):**  We just always got to be concentrating on that soil and make it healthier and healthier  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:30):**  because that's going to grow healthier plants.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:33):**  If you could change one thing overnight, so you have a magic wand and you could change  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:37):**  one thing in the food system or even in the general ecosystem where we live in, what would  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:41):**  that be?  
**[0:47:42-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:42):**  Obviously, you can both answer that question very differently if you want to.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:46):**  I'll start.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:47):**  I would change the soil management of the farmer and get them off the chemical path  
**[0:47:54-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:47:54):**  because down this regenerative organic approach, they would ultimately see more sustainable  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:00):**  long-term benefits, yields, and profits.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:05):**  Mine's probably a far off dream, but when you get investors investing in agriculture  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:12):**  or investing in brands and they multiply it and sell it and multiply it and sell it, at  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:17):**  the end of the day, it's always cheaper priced to the farmer at the farm gate.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:22):**  It would be nice if there was a system where a brand was maybe sold or maybe not sold,  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:27):**  just invested in so that farmers can sustain and have enough runway to get that regenerative  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:34):**  system implemented and therefore turn their system into profitability.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:39):**  Then it's held somehow, not resold and resold because eventually that farmer loses again.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:46):**  We've certainly seen that with large brands and international brands and just absolutely  
**[0:48:52-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:52):**  have seen that.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:53):**  I think to be more specifically clear here for everybody is in both of what we're talking  
**[0:48:59-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:48:59):**  about, when I say that we need to detox the normal chemical agriculture, there's a downside  
**[0:49:06-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:06):**  there and somebody has to fund and finance the farm through that down cycle until they  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:13):**  pick up momentum on the other side and it starts snowballing in a positive direction.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:19):**  Often we need to get paid more for our regenerative products and that's actually not part of the  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:25):**  current system because consumers want faster and cheaper generally.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:30):**  Then there's this segment that's probably listening to us right now, it is willing to  
**[0:49:34-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:34):**  pay extra.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:35):**  We just need to get all the institutions involved and get them willing to pay extra as well  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:41):**  and understand that they've got to pass more of that onto the farmer.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:46):**  For us personally, our starting a brand, buying the additional agriculture has all been on  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:52):**  our own equity, our own backs.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:54):**  We are searching for refinancing.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:49:56):**  We are maybe searching for that right kind of investor that would come in and help us,  
**[0:50:01-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:01):**  but not to sell it.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:02):**  We didn't build a brand to sell it.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:04):**  We built a brand to bring health to our farm, health to our community.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:07):**  We want to better our community, which is where all the families live here around us  
**[0:50:13-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:13):**  and our team.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:15):**  It's not about building a brand to sell.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:17):**  What would you, let's say you're not the farmer, tomorrow morning you wake up and you are on  
**[0:50:22-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:22):**  the investor side.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:23):**  You have a large fund, let's say a billion dollars or 10 billion because a billion lost  
**[0:50:27-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:27):**  a bit of its largeness over the last years.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:29):**  When I started asking this question, a billion was a lot, but not so much anymore.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:33):**  Let's say you have almost unlimited resources.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:36):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:37):**  I hear transition finance in both of your answers of the question before.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:41):**  How would you partner with farmers or would you maybe set up something completely different,  
**[0:50:45-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:45):**  investing technology or investing in monitoring?  
**[0:50:48-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:48):**  What would you focus on as an investor if you had those resources to invest or put to  
**[0:50:54-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:54):**  work?  
**[0:50:55-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:55):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:50:56):**  It's a big number and a wonderful opportunity.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:00):**  I would start from a local perspective here and work from, we need processing.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:07):**  We need products that can then reach out across the country and across the world.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:13):**  Like I mentioned, powdered milks and powders and high quality infant formulas.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:18):**  The world desperately needs that stuff and they need it all over Asia and just everywhere.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:25):**  That's one step.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:27):**  We need to add value to the farmer's products.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:30):**  We sell meat, milk and eggs.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:32):**  We need value added processing that complements what we do that then makes those foods more  
**[0:51:38-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:38):**  available to more folks.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:41):**  We need that here, but we need that collectively everywhere.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:44):**  Yeah, especially meat processing facilities across America.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:50):**  They shouldn't be centralized.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:52):**  We need more rural ones and yeah, who's going to all project manage that?  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:51:56):**  But getting the right investors and the right people in the place, they have the tools.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:02):**  Last week at Acres USA, we had an opportunity to sit with our good friends, Will and Jenny  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:06):**  and Jody Harris from White Oak Pastures in South Georgia.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:11):**  Will and I have connected many times and he's about eight years older than I am.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:16):**  So I look up to him and try to follow his lead.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:20):**  They invested a lot in processing.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:23):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:25):**  What he has done in this quiet little community of Lupton, Georgia is just phenomenal.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:31):**  It was his walk away from conventional agriculture into a different model, which is regenerative  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:38):**  and organic.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:40):**  It's led him down a really cool path and where he's built processing for poultry as well  
**[0:52:47-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:47):**  as red meats.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:49):**  Then that led to some visiting stuff and more employees.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:53):**  So then he had to open a little on-farm restaurant to feed folks and then the community starts  
**[0:52:58-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:58):**  coming and pretty soon.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:52:59):**  The little town is waking up and he and they are a big part of that.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:04):**  So now they have a general store and they do leather processing and so on and so on.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:10):**  It just keeps snowballing and it's just absolutely wonderful.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:13):**  Will made the comment in his presentation that every county in the United States needs  
**[0:53:18-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:18):**  a White Oak Pastures or small community development program, if you will.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:24):**  We came home and we're thinking about that and we need to be that shining star in our  
**[0:53:30-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:30):**  community and then we need to help others do that in every community.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:35):**  So we've industrialized agriculture in our food system and we need to step back and try  
**[0:53:43-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:43):**  to build smaller processing centers for cattle and slaughterhouses and different things and  
**[0:53:48-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:48):**  localize that again.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:50):**  I think there's absolutely room for that.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:53):**  Here in the United States, we've watched beer, drinking beer from three or four brands 50  
**[0:53:59-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:53:59):**  years ago to now there's hundreds and thousands of them and all these little microbreweries  
**[0:54:06-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:06):**  and the model has worked to reinvent that system in a looking back method.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:15):**  So I believe there's room in agriculture for that and there's consumers absolutely willing  
**[0:54:19-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:19):**  to support it.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:20):**  Now we need the big money to support it and help us not build theoretical farms but come  
**[0:54:25-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:25):**  out and finance as real folks and make it happen one acre, one hectare at a time.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:33):**  Yeah, I think it's fascinating the beer example because it didn't only lead to much better  
**[0:54:38-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:38):**  beers but also to I think a lot of space for farmers to grow barley and other rotational  
**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:43):**  crops that they normally would feed somewhere and a lot of specialty grains that suddenly  
**[0:54:46-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:46):**  they had a market and they have a market because they were looking for very specific flavor  
**[0:54:51-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:51):**  profiles, very specific origins, etc.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:54):**  Something we've always seen in wine and now suddenly so in beer.  
**[0:54:57-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:57):**  We see it in coffee as well.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:54:58):**  We see it in chocolate.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:00):**  We see it in these high end places and we slowly start to see it in the rest of the  
**[0:55:04-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:04):**  space.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:05):**  I will link some links for anybody that doesn't know Will Harris and the work they have been  
**[0:55:08-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:08):**  doing.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:09):**  It was a great podcast I think with the Sustainable Food Trust and some other.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:14):**  They were one of the first ones actually that did an LCA on showing the carbon positive  
**[0:55:19-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:19):**  side of meat which of course led to a huge shock.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:22):**  I will link that one below from Qantas as well which is very interesting.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:26):**  Some nice infographics there to show what's possible even taking into consideration methane  
**[0:55:31-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:31):**  which was a whole different topic we're not going to get into now.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:35):**  But it's definitely a leading example and I think they ended up buying and refurbishing  
**[0:55:39-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:39):**  and restoring houses there because his staff couldn't find places to live in the town because  
**[0:55:44-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:44):**  they were all run down.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:46):**  It's an impact on many levels.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:49):**  He's truly regenerated or rejuvenated an old community and made it prosper and now it's  
**[0:55:55-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:55):**  got a long term future and it's attracting young people from all over the country, all  
**[0:55:59-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:55:59):**  over the world and certainly from his own family.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:03):**  That's really good.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:04):**  But let's not forget the risk he took and the money they put on the line stepping away  
**[0:56:09-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:09):**  from, I've heard a few podcasts with him where he described how much easier it would have  
**[0:56:13-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:13):**  been to stay in the conventional system and only now I think with COVID and with direct  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:18):**  sales that they started a few years ago that it started to really take off and pay off  
**[0:56:22-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:22):**  this huge processing investments that they've made and finally, it's a miracle they're still  
**[0:56:27-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:27):**  there.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:29):**  Any consultant would have probably wrote them off on bankruptcy just like you over the last  
**[0:56:32-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:32):**  years and they're still there luckily, but it's a miracle.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:36):**  They made it work against all odds.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:38):**  We absolutely all share those same stories and Will and I were talking that we both grew  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:41):**  up absolutely knowing that we were going to run the farm, we're going to be farmers and  
**[0:56:46-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:46):**  yet our kids really did or didn't and we were talking to his daughters about that and they  
**[0:56:51-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:51):**  weighed in and how they wanted to get off the farm but ultimately they came back because  
**[0:56:56-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:56:56):**  it was a wonderful option and so we're living through that as well with our kids.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:00):**  I also just wanted to add to this kind of theoretical where would funding go and what  
**[0:57:04-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:04):**  should it do?  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:05):**  So it should develop these farms that are more attached and more intricately connected  
**[0:57:10-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:10):**  to the community and then I think of our cities and so what I'm really saying is we need to  
**[0:57:14-0:57:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:14):**  depopulate some of the cities in a sense and COVID has helped us do that.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:19):**  So everybody's learned that they can now work from home and well, wouldn't it just be cool  
**[0:57:23-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:23):**  if their home was closer to a farm and closer to their food?  
**[0:57:26-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:26):**  Or on a farm.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:28):**  Or on the farm, exactly.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:29):**  So it just opens up, I think, all kinds of opportunity for this stepping back in time  
**[0:57:35-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:35):**  and rethinking our entire lifestyle.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:39):**  I think that's a great rabbit hole to dive into another time but also a great way to  
**[0:57:43-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:43):**  end this conversation.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:44):**  I want to thank you both so much for opening up, for taking the time in your very busy  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:49):**  schedule and running a small but massive farm at the same time and a lot of different spinning  
**[0:57:54-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:54):**  plates I think to keep up.  
**[0:57:56-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:57:56):**  So thank you so much for this sharing and of course good luck and I hope to check in  
**[0:58:00-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:58:00):**  in person at some point when that's possible again.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:58:03):**  Yeah, thank you, Kai.

**[0:59:10-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:59:10):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:59:14):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:59:16-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:59:16):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:59:20-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:59:20):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:59:25-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=0:59:25):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[1:00:53-1:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:00:53):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:00:55-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:00:55):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:01:00-1:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:00):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:01:05-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:05):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:01:10-1:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:10):**  if you're a soil builder.

**[1:01:16-1:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:16):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:20):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:25):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:01:26-1:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:26):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:28):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:30):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:34):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/stephanie-blake-alexandre#t=1:01:36):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

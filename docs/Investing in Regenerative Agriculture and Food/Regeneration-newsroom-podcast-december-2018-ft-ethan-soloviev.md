**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:36):**  How about you, Cohen?  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:37):**  Yeah, I'm a senior manager at Tonic, which is the global active impact investor community  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:42):**  where we work with over 450 active impact investors around the world, family offices,  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:48):**  corporations, et cetera, that are mostly actively moving their whole portfolio to impact investing.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:53):**  Apart from that, I interviewed over 44 investors, fund managers, writers, farmers on how to  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:59):**  put money to work in regenerating soil, people, local communities and ecosystems.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:04):**  And so I've been diving into the regenerative ag space for, I think the last seven or eight  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:08):**  years and very excited where we are today.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:11):**  So let's get started with this month.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:12):**  What is the main, what are the main articles that really caught your attention?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:17):**  I think one of them is agroforestry in a region we don't hear too much about when we talk  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:21):**  about region ag, Central Asia.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:23):**  Definitely.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:24):**  So in this month's regeneration newsroom, I am very excited about these stories coming  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:28):**  out of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:31):**  I myself have spent a good bit of time in Kazakhstan working with the origin of all  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:36):**  apple trees in the world, the wild apple forest of Kazakhstan.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:40):**  In Kyrgyzstan, those same kind of ecosystems go from being just wild apple forest and transition  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:46):**  into wild apple and walnut forests.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:49):**  And there's some incredible stories about farmer led on the ground innovation in managing  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:56):**  these complex centuries, maybe even thousand year old agroforestry systems for economic  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:02):**  and community gain.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:04):**  And I just love seeing these stories because I think so much innovation comes from farmers  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:09):**  on the ground and seeing how they're figuring out how to do it even in the face of rapidly  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:14):**  changing weather patterns and not great amounts of attention or economic support in their  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:21):**  rural communities.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:22):**  But figuring out how to make things work with agroforestry is very exciting.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:27):**  And I guess the bigger picture here is that agroforestry systems, tree based cropping  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:32):**  systems are, in my mind, the cream of the crop for regenerative agriculture because  
**[0:03:38-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:38):**  no systems that are out there can sequester as much carbon as quickly as trees.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:46):**  So would you say without trees it's not really regenerative?  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:50):**  No, I wouldn't say that because I don't believe there's, I don't think you can make regenerative  
**[0:03:55-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:55):**  be about a single practice or a single element or a single species.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:02):**  Regenerative is about systems, effects and outcomes.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:05):**  So you can do agroforestry in a way that would be very extractive.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:09):**  But when you head into tree crops, there's a greater chance that you'll be capturing  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:13):**  more carbon, building more soil, you know, enhancing the overall value of ecosystems,  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:18):**  water cycles, geochemical cycles.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:21):**  And the science shows this.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:23):**  I quote another report, sort of a meta report that came out about carbon sequestration from  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:27):**  the Rocky Mountain Institute.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:29):**  And it's very clear the opening diagram shows how much potential in terms of actual gigatons  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:35):**  of carbon that could be stored in the world, trees lead.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:39):**  Soil is great.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:40):**  We can do some good stuff on crop lands, which is where most people, you know, currently  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:44):**  talking about regenerative agriculture are focused on soil, soil, soil, which is good.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:48):**  I'm not saying we should ignore it, but the synergisms and the potential when you integrate  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:53):**  tree crops into agricultural systems is huge.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:57):**  So that's, that's my main point.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:59):**  I think you should definitely read and check out those stories.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:01):**  They're just cool people on the ground doing, doing great stuff.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:04):**  And I think it also helps us to look at and see a bigger global scale.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:10):**  You were interested in looking at the map.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:12):**  There's a new map there.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:13):**  Maybe talk about that and the thousand landscapes.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:16):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:17):**  I mean, you opened the regeneration newsroom with a very pretty map of degradation, which  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:24):**  is obviously not a pretty subject.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:26):**  But I would urge everybody, also the technology behind it.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:29):**  So somebody created actually a map of very small squares.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:33):**  It's satellite data and figured out what, how the land use has changed over time, which

**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:39):**  Obviously, if you look at the great land, so there's a very cool map and you can actually  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:42):**  see in your local landscapes as well, what happened there.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:46):**  And I connected that to another article you shared on Fiji, which was a bigger event in  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:50):**  Vienna, where people discuss how to regenerate full landscapes and Paul, somebody who works  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:56):**  at WWF, which I'll hopefully be interviewing soon, mentioned there something very, very  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:01):**  interesting.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:02):**  There's about 1000 landscapes in the world.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:04):**  So just 1000.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:06):**  And about 100 of those are critical from climate perspective.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:11):**  And if we focus on those, much of the heavy lifting can be done with just those 100.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:16):**  Obviously one of my questions would be, which are those and what do we need to do there?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:20):**  But for instance, if you just look at deforestation, it's mostly concentrated in about 11 landscapes  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:24):**  in the world.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:25):**  That's just one one that seems, although they're huge, it seems manageable, which is quite  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:29):**  interesting.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:30):**  And another thing that I got from the event that was held in Vienna is that systematically  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:35):**  restoring these, and I'm going back to these 100 crucial global landscapes, would might  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:40):**  cost only as much as a single aircraft carrier, which I don't know by now how much costs,  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:45):**  but I would say 300, 400 million, maybe 500, but that's a lot of money.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:49):**  But if you look at 100 landscapes, which are apparently the most critical ones, that seems  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:53):**  nothing to get to.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:56):**  Of course, there are some maybes in this dialogue, but it seems almost doable.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:03):**  So that's really what I got from both that event and from the map.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:06):**  Like, okay, we start to see concrete, at least, issues and maybe this gets to a financeable,  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:14):**  a donatable, probably put together blended finance, et cetera, to actually do these 100  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:20):**  landscapes.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:21):**  And then let's see what we do with the other 900, obviously.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:23):**  Makes it seem very doable.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:26):**  Makes it very, very doable.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:27):**  And actually connecting to that, something super practical that came out.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:30):**  We've discussed savory a few times actually in the last podcast, but what happened this  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:34):**  month because they seem extremely busy.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:36):**  Yeah, savory is on the move, getting regeneration into the soil.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:41):**  They've been doing that for a while, but now with the new land to market program that they've  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:45):**  been launching, they've got their first food product out.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:49):**  We discussed that last month in the podcast.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:51):**  Have you tried it yet?  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:53):**  Still haven't tried it.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:54):**  This month they are focusing on the fiber and fashion side of things.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:00):**  So they did a joint press release with caring, which is the parent company of luxury brands  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:07):**  like Gucci and Balenciaga.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:10):**  And they are doing some very interesting work towards regenerative leather and regenerative  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:15):**  wool.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:16):**  There was another press release savory put out about the first land to market ecological  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:20):**  outcomes verified wool hitting the hitting the markets in South Africa from farms that  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:26):**  are verified to be doing ecologically positive work.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:30):**  And with these luxury brands like Gucci stepping up and saying, you know, we want our purses,  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:37):**  which you know, our average of two thousand five hundred US dollars to get one of their  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:41):**  purses.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:42):**  Imagine if that could be coming from regeneratively produced leather.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:45):**  They're not saying we're done.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:47):**  We have it.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:48):**  And it comes from that, but they are collaborating towards figuring out how do you improve the  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:52):**  supply system so that these super luxury items can be coming from things that are actually  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:58):**  ecologically regenerative.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:00):**  This I think is a good step.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:01):**  And more than more than the impact that alone will have, the bigger impact is in the signal  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:08):**  that that sends into the marketplace and the marketing.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:11):**  I mean, if anybody is good at marketing, they are the luxury brands.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:15):**  If they start using, imagine if they start this gigantic billboards that I see in Milan  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:20):**  or Amsterdam, et cetera, they start using that for regeneration.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:23):**  It could be quite, quite interesting.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:25):**  I'm I mean, you ask a very good question in newsroom.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:28):**  What is the market going to say?  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:30):**  Because I if you spend two and a half thousand dollars for a bag, would you care about regeneration  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:35):**  or not?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:36):**  I mean, it's going to be very just the same what we had with Epic.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:38):**  Like is our people going to buy snacks or not?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:40):**  Are people going to buy these bags more or and maybe it's a Tesla effect, like you start  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:45):**  at the top.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:46):**  We have to follow up.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:47):**  Yeah, we'll have to follow up.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:48):**  I don't think ultimately that's the right approach nor the most equitable approach,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:53):**  nor is the most no honestly realistic approach.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:57):**  Most of the most regenerative food in the world never sees a billboard, never sees a  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:02):**  marketing anything.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:03):**  It goes direct from smallholder farmer to family and is produced and grown and eaten  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:10):**  and composted on the ground on, you know, billions of acres around the world.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:17):**  And so that's actually where a lot of real innovation and regeneration is happening.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:22):**  It's just interesting to see it coming in sort of from that angle and from this luxury  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:27):**  perspective.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:28):**  I hope that they can meet up and bring us all along the way.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:33):**  And then you wrote something about, I mean, the podcast that to follow, which was one  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:38):**  of them actually I did this month or last month, I don't remember.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:41):**  No, it was this month actually with Chuck of Soil Capital.

**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:46):**  I disagree with how Chuck in this case of Soil Capital and definitely all listen to  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:50):**  the podcast, obviously, how he, how he defines Regen Egg.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:54):**  Why is that?  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:55):**  Well, I mean, there's a bunch of good podcasts this month.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:58):**  I think this one's really interesting because I really appreciate the work that Soil Capital  
**[0:11:02-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:02):**  is doing, reaching out to larger landowners and transitioning some extractive agriculture  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:11):**  systems towards regeneration.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:13):**  But I think there's a mistake to jump forward and say, well, this is regenerative ag because  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:18):**  we're doing compost and cover cropping and, you know, we're minimizing tillage and we're  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:23):**  minimizing our chemical inputs.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:26):**  That's all really good stuff, but that's not regenerative.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:30):**  A single practice or even a set of practices doesn't make agriculture regenerative.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:35):**  You have to be looking at outcomes on the farm and then more systemic effects to really  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:41):**  understand if regeneration is occurring.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:43):**  But you know, this, not to say that Chuck is alone in sort of defining regenerative  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:47):**  agriculture as a set of really 30 year old conservation farming practices.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:52):**  A lot of what's out there in, you know, especially the, the Rodale organic lineage of regenerative  
**[0:11:58-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:58):**  agriculture and the sort of what I call the soil profits lineage are doing the same thing.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:06):**  Where we discussed, Gabriel, yeah, I don't know.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:10):**  I mean, from what I understood with Chuck in the conversation, they go a lot further  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:16):**  than that, but they are very aware of their clients, which are large landowners and trying  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:23):**  to make it almost like a step approach.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:25):**  So maybe it's Regen Ag Light or, and, but how to engage with very traditional landowners  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:32):**  that and farm managers and get them stepped by almost like unknowingly get them towards  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:38):**  regenerative.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:39):**  But I think you're right in terms of outcomes, like how fast do you want to go?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:43):**  But at the same time, I had the same discussion with Eric Jackson of Pipeline Foods, which  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:47):**  was mostly working on organic and not necessarily regenerative.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:50):**  Like if the market, what's the market doing?  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:52):**  Is it pooling or not?  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:54):**  And if the market asks for regenerative, then we will be ready to do that.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:59):**  But for now we can have more impact to do thousands and thousands of acres and really  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:05):**  reduce the inputs and switch most of that to organic and hopefully be ready when the  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:11):**  market is ready to switch the whole thing to regenerate 1000 acres or 10,000 or 100,000  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:17):**  acres and cut so much inputs.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:19):**  It may be better than a few acres regenerative.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:22):**  I don't know, but the outcome measurement should be, should be saying that.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:26):**  I agree.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:27):**  I think putting 100,000, a million, 10 million, a hundred million acres into a conservative  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:32):**  agricultural practices that reduce inputs start to maybe, you know, either reduce the  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:38):**  loss of carbon or maybe begin to build carbon.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:41):**  That's awesome.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:42):**  We should definitely do that.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:43):**  Just don't call it regenerative yet until we're actually there because it's such a,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:48):**  it is.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:49):**  We have a long way to go.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:51):**  I don't think we could just, I don't think pipeline could just switch over and be quote  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:54):**  unquote doing regenerative.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:56):**  There's still a lot of work to scale up the systems and learn to make them unique in each  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:01):**  place till we're, till we're really there.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:03):**  Agroforestry isn't at the scale it needs to be in practice or really to hit that.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:10):**  So let's just call it the path to regeneration.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:14):**  And you might pass through organic, you might not on that path.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:16):**  It doesn't really matter, but you're heading towards these regenerative outcomes in the  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:21):**  systems.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:22):**  You can use any practices you want to try to get there, but let's keep our eye on what's  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:25):**  actually happening.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:26):**  What are the outcomes on the farm?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:27):**  What are the systemic effects in the bio region and how can we be improving those over time  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:32):**  on the path to regeneration?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:34):**  Don't go make a hype about, Oh, we're regenerative because that's a hot new word.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:38):**  I have the feeling we're going to have this discussion a few more times in this podcast.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:42):**  Anyway, let's keep moving.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:44):**  Otherwise we will never hit our time.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:46):**  You went to the regenerative earth summit.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:48):**  Tell us about it.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:49):**  What are a few of the main takeaways for the people that didn't go or didn't follow it  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:53):**  online?  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:54):**  This is a great event.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:55):**  I spoke on a panel with a number of fashion brands, Eileen Fisher, also actually somebody  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:00):**  from Pipeline Foods, indigenous Gaia herbs, particularly focusing on transparency and  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:07):**  traceability.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:09):**  But the overall event was really excellent in its celebration of the good work that's  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:17):**  being done almost maybe to a fault in my perception.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:22):**  There was a lot of, yes, here's this amazing great work we've done.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:25):**  We're all going regenerative.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:26):**  And I love seeing that.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:28):**  But to me, maybe there wasn't enough discernment about, well, wait a minute, what is regeneration  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:34):**  really?  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:35):**  Or even the conversation you and I were just happening, it was happening around the edges  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:38):**  of the room, but it wasn't a part of the main stage conversation.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:43):**  And I think that level of discernment, right?  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:47):**  How do we balance our excitement to move towards regeneration with the discernment to say,  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:53):**  well, we actually still have a really, really long way to go.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:56):**  Yes, the North Face made a single beanie out of wool that came from a regenerative sheep

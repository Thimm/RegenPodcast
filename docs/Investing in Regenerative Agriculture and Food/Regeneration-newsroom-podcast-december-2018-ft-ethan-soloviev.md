**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome to the Regeneration Newsroom podcast of December 2018.  This is a joint venture between the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture podcast and Ethan  Soloveyev's monthly Regeneration Newsroom, where we, Ethan Soloveyev and myself, come  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:00:27):**  over to the highlights from this month's newsroom.  So welcome, Ethan, back on the show.  I mean, it's more, it's a month ago, we recorded the first one.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:00:34):**  Shall we start with a short introductions of ourselves?  Sure.  Glad to be on again.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:00:40):**  I am a farmer in upstate New York in the United States.  I grow apples, mushrooms and rotationally graze sheep in a silvopasture system here  on the farm.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:00:51):**  I'm also the executive vice president of research at Howgood, which has the world's largest  product sustainability database.  We've assessed over a million products across 127 different sustainability attributes to  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:04):**  figure out what essentially are the most regenerative products out there in the marketplace.  We've got an app you can use.  We work with retailers, we work direct with manufacturers and CPGs that produce the food  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:16):**  to help grow the whole food system towards regeneration.  Finally, I'm a speaker and an author, I write on regenerative agriculture and business in  a number of different publications, have a short book called Regenerative Enterprise  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:31):**  and continually writing to grow regenerative agriculture in the world.  How about you, Cohen?  Yeah, I'm a senior manager at Tonic, which is the global active impact investor community  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:42):**  where we work with over 450 active impact investors around the world, family offices,  corporations, et cetera, that are mostly actively moving their whole portfolio to impact investing.  Apart from that, I interviewed over 44 investors, fund managers, writers, farmers on how to  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:01:59):**  put money to work in regenerating soil, people, local communities and ecosystems.  And so I've been diving into the regenerative ag space for, I think the last seven or eight  years and very excited where we are today.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:11):**  So let's get started with this month.  What is the main, what are the main articles that really caught your attention?  I think one of them is agroforestry in a region we don't hear too much about when we talk  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:21):**  about region ag, Central Asia.  Definitely.  So in this month's regeneration newsroom, I am very excited about these stories coming  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:28):**  out of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.  I myself have spent a good bit of time in Kazakhstan working with the origin of all  apple trees in the world, the wild apple forest of Kazakhstan.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:40):**  In Kyrgyzstan, those same kind of ecosystems go from being just wild apple forest and transition  into wild apple and walnut forests.  And there's some incredible stories about farmer led on the ground innovation in managing  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:02:56):**  these complex centuries, maybe even thousand year old agroforestry systems for economic  and community gain.  And I just love seeing these stories because I think so much innovation comes from farmers  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:09):**  on the ground and seeing how they're figuring out how to do it even in the face of rapidly  changing weather patterns and not great amounts of attention or economic support in their  rural communities.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:22):**  But figuring out how to make things work with agroforestry is very exciting.  And I guess the bigger picture here is that agroforestry systems, tree based cropping  systems are, in my mind, the cream of the crop for regenerative agriculture because  
**[0:03:38-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:38):**  no systems that are out there can sequester as much carbon as quickly as trees.  So would you say without trees it's not really regenerative?  No, I wouldn't say that because I don't believe there's, I don't think you can make regenerative  
**[0:03:55-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:03:55):**  be about a single practice or a single element or a single species.  Regenerative is about systems, effects and outcomes.  So you can do agroforestry in a way that would be very extractive.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:09):**  But when you head into tree crops, there's a greater chance that you'll be capturing  more carbon, building more soil, you know, enhancing the overall value of ecosystems,  water cycles, geochemical cycles.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:21):**  And the science shows this.  I quote another report, sort of a meta report that came out about carbon sequestration from  the Rocky Mountain Institute.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:29):**  And it's very clear the opening diagram shows how much potential in terms of actual gigatons  of carbon that could be stored in the world, trees lead.  Soil is great.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:40):**  We can do some good stuff on crop lands, which is where most people, you know, currently  talking about regenerative agriculture are focused on soil, soil, soil, which is good.  I'm not saying we should ignore it, but the synergisms and the potential when you integrate  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:04:53):**  tree crops into agricultural systems is huge.  So that's, that's my main point.  I think you should definitely read and check out those stories.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:01):**  They're just cool people on the ground doing, doing great stuff.  And I think it also helps us to look at and see a bigger global scale.  You were interested in looking at the map.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:12):**  There's a new map there.  Maybe talk about that and the thousand landscapes.  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:17):**  I mean, you opened the regeneration newsroom with a very pretty map of degradation, which  is obviously not a pretty subject.  But I would urge everybody, also the technology behind it.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:29):**  So somebody created actually a map of very small squares.  It's satellite data and figured out what, how the land use has changed over time, which  is absolutely crucial.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:39):**  Obviously, if you look at the great land, so there's a very cool map and you can actually  see in your local landscapes as well, what happened there.  And I connected that to another article you shared on Fiji, which was a bigger event in  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:05:50):**  Vienna, where people discuss how to regenerate full landscapes and Paul, somebody who works  at WWF, which I'll hopefully be interviewing soon, mentioned there something very, very  interesting.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:02):**  There's about 1000 landscapes in the world.  So just 1000.  And about 100 of those are critical from climate perspective.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:11):**  And if we focus on those, much of the heavy lifting can be done with just those 100.  Obviously one of my questions would be, which are those and what do we need to do there?  But for instance, if you just look at deforestation, it's mostly concentrated in about 11 landscapes  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:24):**  in the world.  That's just one one that seems, although they're huge, it seems manageable, which is quite  interesting.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:30):**  And another thing that I got from the event that was held in Vienna is that systematically  restoring these, and I'm going back to these 100 crucial global landscapes, would might  cost only as much as a single aircraft carrier, which I don't know by now how much costs,  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:45):**  but I would say 300, 400 million, maybe 500, but that's a lot of money.  But if you look at 100 landscapes, which are apparently the most critical ones, that seems  nothing to get to.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:06:56):**  Of course, there are some maybes in this dialogue, but it seems almost doable.  So that's really what I got from both that event and from the map.  Like, okay, we start to see concrete, at least, issues and maybe this gets to a financeable,  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:14):**  a donatable, probably put together blended finance, et cetera, to actually do these 100  landscapes.  And then let's see what we do with the other 900, obviously.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:23):**  Makes it seem very doable.  Makes it very, very doable.  And actually connecting to that, something super practical that came out.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:30):**  We've discussed savory a few times actually in the last podcast, but what happened this  month because they seem extremely busy.  Yeah, savory is on the move, getting regeneration into the soil.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:41):**  They've been doing that for a while, but now with the new land to market program that they've  been launching, they've got their first food product out.  We discussed that last month in the podcast.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:07:51):**  Have you tried it yet?  Still haven't tried it.  This month they are focusing on the fiber and fashion side of things.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:00):**  So they did a joint press release with caring, which is the parent company of luxury brands  like Gucci and Balenciaga.  And they are doing some very interesting work towards regenerative leather and regenerative  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:15):**  wool.  There was another press release savory put out about the first land to market ecological  outcomes verified wool hitting the hitting the markets in South Africa from farms that  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:26):**  are verified to be doing ecologically positive work.  And with these luxury brands like Gucci stepping up and saying, you know, we want our purses,  which you know, our average of two thousand five hundred US dollars to get one of their  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:41):**  purses.  Imagine if that could be coming from regeneratively produced leather.  They're not saying we're done.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:47):**  We have it.  And it comes from that, but they are collaborating towards figuring out how do you improve the  supply system so that these super luxury items can be coming from things that are actually  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:08:58):**  ecologically regenerative.  This I think is a good step.  And more than more than the impact that alone will have, the bigger impact is in the signal  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:08):**  that that sends into the marketplace and the marketing.  I mean, if anybody is good at marketing, they are the luxury brands.  If they start using, imagine if they start this gigantic billboards that I see in Milan  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:20):**  or Amsterdam, et cetera, they start using that for regeneration.  It could be quite, quite interesting.  I'm I mean, you ask a very good question in newsroom.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:28):**  What is the market going to say?  Because I if you spend two and a half thousand dollars for a bag, would you care about regeneration  or not?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:36):**  I mean, it's going to be very just the same what we had with Epic.  Like is our people going to buy snacks or not?  Are people going to buy these bags more or and maybe it's a Tesla effect, like you start  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:45):**  at the top.  We have to follow up.  Yeah, we'll have to follow up.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:09:48):**  I don't think ultimately that's the right approach nor the most equitable approach,  nor is the most no honestly realistic approach.  Most of the most regenerative food in the world never sees a billboard, never sees a  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:02):**  marketing anything.  It goes direct from smallholder farmer to family and is produced and grown and eaten  and composted on the ground on, you know, billions of acres around the world.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:17):**  And so that's actually where a lot of real innovation and regeneration is happening.  It's just interesting to see it coming in sort of from that angle and from this luxury  perspective.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:28):**  I hope that they can meet up and bring us all along the way.  And then you wrote something about, I mean, the podcast that to follow, which was one  of them actually I did this month or last month, I don't remember.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:41):**  No, it was this month actually with Chuck of Soil Capital.  And he wrote a very interesting sentence and I wanted to ask you about that.  I disagree with how Chuck in this case of Soil Capital and definitely all listen to  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:50):**  the podcast, obviously, how he, how he defines Regen Egg.  Why is that?  Well, I mean, there's a bunch of good podcasts this month.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:10:58):**  I think this one's really interesting because I really appreciate the work that Soil Capital  is doing, reaching out to larger landowners and transitioning some extractive agriculture  systems towards regeneration.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:13):**  But I think there's a mistake to jump forward and say, well, this is regenerative ag because  we're doing compost and cover cropping and, you know, we're minimizing tillage and we're  minimizing our chemical inputs.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:26):**  That's all really good stuff, but that's not regenerative.  A single practice or even a set of practices doesn't make agriculture regenerative.  You have to be looking at outcomes on the farm and then more systemic effects to really  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:41):**  understand if regeneration is occurring.  But you know, this, not to say that Chuck is alone in sort of defining regenerative  agriculture as a set of really 30 year old conservation farming practices.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:11:52):**  A lot of what's out there in, you know, especially the, the Rodale organic lineage of regenerative  agriculture and the sort of what I call the soil profits lineage are doing the same thing.  Where we discussed, Gabriel, yeah, I don't know.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:10):**  I mean, from what I understood with Chuck in the conversation, they go a lot further  than that, but they are very aware of their clients, which are large landowners and trying  to make it almost like a step approach.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:25):**  So maybe it's Regen Ag Light or, and, but how to engage with very traditional landowners  that and farm managers and get them stepped by almost like unknowingly get them towards  regenerative.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:39):**  But I think you're right in terms of outcomes, like how fast do you want to go?  But at the same time, I had the same discussion with Eric Jackson of Pipeline Foods, which  was mostly working on organic and not necessarily regenerative.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:50):**  Like if the market, what's the market doing?  Is it pooling or not?  And if the market asks for regenerative, then we will be ready to do that.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:12:59):**  But for now we can have more impact to do thousands and thousands of acres and really  reduce the inputs and switch most of that to organic and hopefully be ready when the  market is ready to switch the whole thing to regenerate 1000 acres or 10,000 or 100,000  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:17):**  acres and cut so much inputs.  It may be better than a few acres regenerative.  I don't know, but the outcome measurement should be, should be saying that.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:26):**  I agree.  I think putting 100,000, a million, 10 million, a hundred million acres into a conservative  agricultural practices that reduce inputs start to maybe, you know, either reduce the  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:38):**  loss of carbon or maybe begin to build carbon.  That's awesome.  We should definitely do that.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:43):**  Just don't call it regenerative yet until we're actually there because it's such a,  it is.  We have a long way to go.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:13:51):**  I don't think we could just, I don't think pipeline could just switch over and be quote  unquote doing regenerative.  There's still a lot of work to scale up the systems and learn to make them unique in each  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:01):**  place till we're, till we're really there.  Agroforestry isn't at the scale it needs to be in practice or really to hit that.  So let's just call it the path to regeneration.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:14):**  And you might pass through organic, you might not on that path.  It doesn't really matter, but you're heading towards these regenerative outcomes in the  systems.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:22):**  You can use any practices you want to try to get there, but let's keep our eye on what's  actually happening.  What are the outcomes on the farm?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:27):**  What are the systemic effects in the bio region and how can we be improving those over time  on the path to regeneration?  Don't go make a hype about, Oh, we're regenerative because that's a hot new word.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:38):**  I have the feeling we're going to have this discussion a few more times in this podcast.  Anyway, let's keep moving.  Otherwise we will never hit our time.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:46):**  You went to the regenerative earth summit.  Tell us about it.  What are a few of the main takeaways for the people that didn't go or didn't follow it  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:14:53):**  online?  This is a great event.  I spoke on a panel with a number of fashion brands, Eileen Fisher, also actually somebody  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:00):**  from Pipeline Foods, indigenous Gaia herbs, particularly focusing on transparency and  traceability.  But the overall event was really excellent in its celebration of the good work that's  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:17):**  being done almost maybe to a fault in my perception.  There was a lot of, yes, here's this amazing great work we've done.  We're all going regenerative.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:26):**  And I love seeing that.  But to me, maybe there wasn't enough discernment about, well, wait a minute, what is regeneration  really?  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:35):**  Or even the conversation you and I were just happening, it was happening around the edges  of the room, but it wasn't a part of the main stage conversation.  And I think that level of discernment, right?  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:15:47):**  How do we balance our excitement to move towards regeneration with the discernment to say,  well, we actually still have a really, really long way to go.  Yes, the North Face made a single beanie out of wool that came from a regenerative sheep  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:16:01):**  farm in California.  That's great.  But that's a point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero one percent of all the beanies  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:16:09):**  in the world.  Yeah, of what we need to do to get to regeneration.  So from my perspective, I'd love to see more of that discussion of like, here's the long  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:16:16):**  road, here's the path we're taking, and here's where we are.  Exactly.  And here's the plan.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:16:23):**  And can you help us?  Let's work on it.  Let's move towards that.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:16:26):**  And I think one outfit I do see doing that is Danone.  They have put a recent focus on regenerative agriculture.  There's actually an investor deck that I'll include in Regeneration Newsroom that shows  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:16:38):**  some of their thinking on regenerative agriculture.  And I think that's really great.  That sounded like a great event.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:16:45):**  And looking forward, because we're at the end of the year, what are events we should  be coming to following online if we cannot be there in 2019?  What excites you for the coming months?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:16:59):**  There's some great events coming up.  The Living Soil Symposium in Montreal in March will bring together some great farmers really  to focus on soil and growing towards regeneration of whole systems from soil.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:17:13):**  Joel Salatin will be there.  A number of great speakers.  I'm also really excited about a couple of different events happening in May, including  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:17:23):**  the Virtual Regenerative Business Summit.  This will be the third year to have a Regenerative Business Summit.  And we're doing this hybrid online in-person with local events where businesses can come  
**[0:17:35-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:17:35):**  together to help each other work towards regeneration while tuning in to some leading companies  and looking at regeneration in their businesses and how we can move it forward.  And it's all going to be focused around essence.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:17:49):**  What is the essence of the business?  What is the uniqueness of the business?  And how can you use that as a tool for innovation and non-displacability in the market?  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:17:57):**  So I'm excited about that.  And then also just the following week in May, the Transform Series is kicking off in California  focusing on climate, communities, and capital.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:18:09):**  Very interesting work that is going on there looking at regenerative agriculture and investment  around the world, regenerative forestry.  Yeah, more details to come for that event.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:18:21):**  Sounds great.  I think it's a wrap or you have anything else to add?  I think that's it.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:18:28):**  Read this month's Regeneration Newsroom.  As always, let us know if you have stories we've missed or questions or things you want  us to talk about or argue about on the show.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:18:39):**  Thanks so much.  Thank you so much for listening.  And this was this month, December 2018, Regeneration Newsroom podcast.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:18:46):**  See you next month.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:18:59):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:19:09):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:19:21):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:19:28):**  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:19:32):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:19:37):**  For whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:19:48):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management consultants, etc, etc.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:20:00):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  etc.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:20:11):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:20:15):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:20:25):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you.  And if you have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth, thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:20:35-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:20:35):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:20:48):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:21:00):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:21:14):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/22/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-december-2018/#t=0:21:19):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

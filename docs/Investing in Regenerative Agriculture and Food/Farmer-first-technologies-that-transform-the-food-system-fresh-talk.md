**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome to a very special episode where we hosted a conversation together with the team  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:18):**  of Fresh Ventures, where we looked this time at the role of technology in regenerative  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:24):**  agriculture and food.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:26):**  Often overlooked, often very much underfunded compared to the rest of the, let's say, ag  
**[0:00:31-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:31):**  tech space.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:32):**  And we had a very interesting discussion with Regrow, which had been on the podcast before,  
**[0:00:37-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:37):**  Seaweed Company and much more.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:39):**  So we're doing this more often.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:41):**  Please check in if you want to join live and enjoy.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:45):**  Welcome everyone to the second Fresh Talks.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:48):**  This time focused on farmer first technologies and how it can help accelerate our transition  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:54):**  to regenerative food system.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:58):**  This is an event organized by Fresh Venture Studio in collaboration with investing in  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:03):**  regenerative agriculture and food podcast.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:06):**  Also the co-host of today, Koonfels Eijen is the host of this podcast.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:11):**  My name is Bart van de Sonderen.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:13):**  I'm the co-founder of Fresh Venture Studio and with Fresh, for those who don't know us  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:18):**  yet, we are on a mission to accelerate the transition to regenerative food system by  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:22):**  building multiple new steward-owned ventures from scratch.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:27):**  And we organize a yearly four month program, inviting talented entrepreneurial people and  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:32):**  expert to find a co-founder, get a systemic understanding of a problem and do the early  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:37):**  stages of venture building.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:39):**  And we connect them to potential financiers and experts in the field.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:44):**  We're currently actively looking also for applicants, but also always diving into what  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:50):**  are the actual questions we need to focus on.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:54):**  What are the problems that we should focus on?  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:56):**  What are the technologies that might be interesting?  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:58):**  And as part of that, we organize events like this.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:02):**  Before we get into it, I would actually want you also to share a little bit with us.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:10):**  And also as part of the practicalities, you have the chat downstairs in the Zoom, and  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:15):**  I would like you to open it up right now and share with us who you are briefly.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:22):**  And also if you would start a venture tomorrow and you would have the capital and the free  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:28):**  time, what would it be?  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:30):**  Do you have an idea that you think this is what we actually need right now if you want  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:34):**  to transition to regenerative food system?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:36):**  Please share it in the chat.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:39):**  I'll stop my sharing as well.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:40):**  Then you actually see my face.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:42):**  Welcome everyone.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:43):**  So please use the chat to introduce yourself.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:49):**  Also during this event, if you have a question for our speakers or just a general remark  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:55):**  or you want to chip into the conversation, please use the chat as well to share your  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:00):**  question and then we will give you the stage to ask the question or say what you want to  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:07):**  say.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:09):**  Also to get a sense of the people around you and not just listen to me and the other speakers,  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:14):**  we are going to start with a short breakout, which means that you will leave this room  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:20):**  and you will be put together with one other person.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:25):**  And we want you to share well, two things, who you are and what the mission is you are  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:31):**  personally working on.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:32):**  Quickly get introduced to each other, see some different faces and get that activity  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:37):**  going.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:38):**  We are all ready to go.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:42):**  Then I would like to ask Hup to start the going into breakout room.  
**[0:03:47-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:47):**  So see you in two minutes.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:17):**  Thank you.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:17):**  Hi, Koon and Anna.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:23):**  Welcome.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:24):**  It's a bit of an empty space right now because everyone is in a very brief breakout room  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:28):**  to get quickly introduced.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:31):**  But they will be back in one or two minutes and then we will continue the event.  
**[0:05:41-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:41):**  Maybe some people are already coming back.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:06):**  We're going to repopulate this room in 30 seconds, I think.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:13):**  And then we will continue with the event.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:16):**  But for those who just joined, welcome.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:20):**  Most of the participants are now in a short breakout room to get introduced to the digital  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:25):**  neighbor next to you, I would say.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:32):**  And we'll, I think we are closing down the breakout rooms right now.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:48):**  Welcome back for those that are rejoining.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:52):**  Koon is back as well.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:03):**  All right.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:17):**  Just waiting for everyone to come back from the breakout rooms.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:23):**  I hope you managed to get a short introduction and managed to meet someone in this room.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:33):**  Now you met one person.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:34):**  We also want to give you a sense of what kind of people are in this meeting.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:38):**  So we'll now do a very short poll.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:42):**  And then if you can answer that, we get a bit of an understanding of what type of people  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:47):**  we have here.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:49):**  So please answer the poll.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:55):**  There's no NGOs there Bart.  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:58):**  NGOs?  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:59):**  You're right.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:01):**  You're right.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:03):**  Well, I'm entrepreneurial, so I say an entrepreneur.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:07):**  That's great.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:08):**  That's great.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:09):**  Thank you, Yomart.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:10):**  Thank you as well.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:12):**  I have a burning question to ask you, but we'll get to that during the Q and A. This  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:19):**  is also our way to skew the data, Yomart, not having NGOs and pushing everyone towards  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:25):**  entrepreneurial.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:27):**  There's still a bunch of people that need to vote, but some people are a little bit  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:36):**  in doubt it seems.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:39):**  We will share the insights with you as well.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:45):**  Maybe Hup we can share it.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:46):**  We have, I think, six people that still need to answer, but then I think the idea is clear.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:57):**  So the entrepreneurial background is dominant right now, but also quite a few have not found  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:04):**  it before and are looking to found.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:08):**  On the technical, we're a little bit in the middle, so we don't have a modern day Nikola  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:12):**  Tesla.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:13):**  I was expecting at least one modern day Nikola Tesla today, but we don't have any.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:18):**  But thank you everyone.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:19):**  This gives a clear idea of who we are.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:28):**  I would like to move forward and introduce my cohost of the day, Koen van Steije.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:35):**  Hi Koen.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:36):**  Good afternoon.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:37):**  Good morning.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:38):**  I'm very happy to be standing where you are.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:39):**  Good morning.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:40):**  Great to be back.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:41):**  Koen is the, I will briefly introduce you Koen and then you can go ahead.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:46):**  But Koen is the host of the podcast, Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:53):**  He has done a lot of interviews with the pioneers in the field and has probably one of the most  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:00):**  extensive networks and I think a good idea of what is happening in the space.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:05):**  And recently he started up a series in specifically focusing on the role of technology.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:12):**  Koen, how are you feeling?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:15):**  I'm good.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:16):**  I'm good.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:17):**  I'm always, I had a lot of technology focused discussions in the last days.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:22):**  I'm excited, but yeah, also it's a very interesting topic ranging from clean meat or lab meat  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:28):**  to vertical farms to satellite remote sensing.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:32):**  It's definitely heating up, which is great.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:37):**  Maybe you can kick it off a little bit Koen also with sharing your insights as you've  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:42):**  been obviously having all those conversations.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:45):**  What do you see happening and also what do you see that's missing and maybe also what  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:53):**  is being too much of a hype or overestimated a little bit?  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:57):**  I think that's an interesting insight as well.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:59):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:00):**  So we, I mean, we've definitely with the podcast, I think we're at episode one 20 something  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:07):**  at the moment.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:08):**  So we've had our share of people that are using technologies and we definitely always  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:14):**  discuss it, but obviously we always have a soil focus as well.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:18):**  So it's often about farming, it's often about nutrient density, et cetera, but we decided  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:23):**  to do a specific series on what technologies are needed to get regenerative agriculture  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:29):**  to a landscape scale because we really felt that's missing.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:31):**  We often talk about this farm and that farm and very rarely, unless you are working at  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:38):**  violent or at common land or some of the very few organizations that are doing groundwork  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:43):**  on a landscape or ecosystem scale.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:45):**  You very not very often talk about what is needed to get there, what is needed to do  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:50):**  a hundred thousand hectares or a million hectares, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:54):**  And so we decided to do a series on that.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:56):**  We got some support from the Grantham Foundation or the Grantham Foundation for Eclectic Climate  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:01):**  Opportunities.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:03):**  And they introduced us to Regrow.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:05):**  So we have a beautiful bridge to Manao in a second, but what do we really want to explore  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:11):**  in that series?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:12):**  And we're definitely still looking for insights.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:16):**  It's an ongoing series that will be 10 episodes, potentially more like what technologies are  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:21):**  already being used or what is already ready.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:24):**  I don't have a technology background.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:25):**  I would probably not say I can change the light bulb, but probably do a bit more, but  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:28):**  I'm definitely not a PhD in computer science.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:32):**  So I'm very interested in remote sensing and we discussed it with Regrow, with Anastasia,  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:36):**  one of the co-founders in that interview, like what's possible from space?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:40):**  What can you follow from afar and why suddenly I see a lot of remote sensing companies coming  
**[0:12:44-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:44):**  up?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:45):**  How can we follow whole landscapes as they potentially transition to a more regenerative  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:49):**  practices and what's completely missing?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:51):**  So we do interviews also on the ground with, for instance, Commonland, who we just interviewed  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:56):**  on how do you calculate returns at a landscape scale?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:59):**  And which to me, a return framework is also a technology.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:03):**  We use a very wide definition of technology.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:06):**  And I think what's very interesting is that we're in a moment where ECTC is raising more  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:10):**  money that we could have ever dreamed of.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:12):**  Like the amount of money flowing into the space is honestly quite crazy.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:17):**  But if you dig a bit deeper and ask that question, I think that's what's missing.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:21):**  Like what of those technologies is actually helping farmers, lands towards landowners,  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:25):**  whoever is managing the land to make different decisions, very few of that is.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:30):**  So it's very much focused on not necessarily transitioning large acres or large pieces  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:36):**  of land into regenerative and more regenerative practices.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:40):**  So I would always urge investors, I would always urge anybody wanting to work in a space  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:45):**  ask that question, is it helping to rebuild soil at scale or not?  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:49):**  And I think what's definitely, I wouldn't say overhyped, but a lot of things are focused  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:53):**  on technologies that in the grand scheme of things might not have the largest impact.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:59):**  I had a lot of discussions on vertical farming the last few days.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:01):**  I don't know why it came up.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:03):**  But if you look at the calories we get out of the produce that can be grown in there  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:08):**  at the moment, I'm not saying it cannot scale.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:10):**  I'm not saying we cannot do other things in it, but it's mostly herbs, mostly salads,  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:15):**  mostly some tomatoes, et cetera.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:17):**  It's a very small acreage, I think in the US it's a couple of percent of the agriculture  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:22):**  land we can ask Manon because for sure they did research on that.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:25):**  So if we want to have a large impact on chemicals, on water use, we need to look at large broad  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:31):**  acre crops and we need to figure out what to do with rice, what to do with grain, what  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:35):**  to do with soy, et cetera.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:37):**  So I'm very interested what's already possible.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:39):**  I got some very interesting new, no teaser, but we've got some interesting new episodes  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:43):**  coming up of things of, okay, how do we bring this to a landscape scale?  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:47):**  Because I think we're ready, we're there, we have amazing examples of individual farms.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:53):**  And now the question is, okay, what are we going to plant, where and why, and how can  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:56):**  technology help with that?  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:58):**  And how can we predict things?  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:59):**  How can we figure out where to plant the trees?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:02):**  And I think there's so much we can learn from that space, but most of it is directed at  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:07):**  things that at the end of the day don't help farmers to make transitions.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:11):**  So I think that's an underlying, I would always push on, okay, is there, I mean, Robin O'Brien  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:16):**  of Replant Capital, quite a large investor in the space in the US, always asks the question,  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:20):**  is there a farmer on your board or in your team?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:23):**  And if not, then I would be worried.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:26):**  So I think that's for all of us who didn't grow up on a farm and don't have that life  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:31):**  experience, definitely get close to it because otherwise you end up building things that  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:35):**  are just not so relevant in the space.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:37):**  So I think that's a short overview.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:39):**  The series is only two episodes in, so we have a whole thing to discover.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:43):**  We'll be doing webinars around it.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:44):**  We'll do quite a bit.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:46):**  So we're already at the beginning there, but of course we had discussions on technologies.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:49):**  So I see Stefanie raised in the audience and we had discussions in the past on technology  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:54):**  and I'm always fascinated by it.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:56):**  We're using it now to do this conference or this webinar, which would have been possible  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:00):**  a couple of years ago.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:02):**  All right.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:05):**  Thank you.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:06):**  I would like you to introduce Manal as well, but maybe a question and we can dive into  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:12):**  that into the Q&A because you're referencing, I think, to what extent the AgTech is actually  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:18):**  helping farmers.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:19):**  I also would like to dive into sort of coming from the other side, the maybe technological  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:25):**  phobia from a very nature-based perspective and how can we integrate that a little bit  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:33):**  and what your vision is on that.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:36):**  So maybe we can get into that during the Q&A because I think it's good also to get more  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:41):**  people involved.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:43):**  Maybe you can give an introduction to Manal as well.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:47):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:48):**  I'm very happy Manal is here.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:49):**  I had the great pleasure to interact with Rie Groh in the past after a warm introduction  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:55):**  from Eric Smith of the Grantham Foundation.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:57):**  He said, you absolutely have to talk to him.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:59):**  And then I did that.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:02):**  So I was amazed of what's possible from space, from a distance, remote sensing and what is  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:07):**  not possible yet, but it was what we're very close in and she, Manal, has an amazing experience  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:12):**  more than 12 years into space, knows everything about remote sensing.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:15):**  And so I think we're very lucky to have her here.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:17):**  It's very early.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:18):**  So I'm also very happy she got up in California to be with us today.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:23):**  So very warm welcome Manal and please introduce to whoever doesn't know Rie Groh, of course,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:28):**  introduce yourself, but also Rie Groh and your fascination for tech in the regeneration  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:33):**  space.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:34):**  Good morning, everyone.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:36):**  I don't know everything about remote sensing.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:38):**  Let's start there at all.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:39):**  I did spend a PhD trying to figure it out, but I can't claim that I know everything about  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:44):**  it.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:45):**  Thank you for having me.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:48):**  Thank you, Akun and Bart for all of your efforts and for building a community and for always  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:53):**  asking the right questions and trying to start the conversation and make everyone think.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:58):**  I really enjoyed the first fresh talk and super excited to be joining you on the second  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:02):**  one.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:04):**  So as you mentioned, I'm based in California.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:07):**  It's almost eight o'clock.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:09):**  It's not too early.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:11):**  My name is Manal.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:12):**  I am an agronomist with a PhD in remote sensing and precision ag.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:18):**  I am the boots on the ground.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:20):**  It's so cool what you said, Koen.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:22):**  And I totally relate to when you're trying to build a company and build a product that  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:26):**  speaks to farmers and in theory wants to make things easy.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:30):**  It's just so important to make sure that, you know, you have real farmers on your team.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:34):**  And I'm privileged and really honored to have our agronomy having real farmers, people that,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:40):**  you know, have to skip work for two days because they have to plan their cover crop, which  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:45):**  is pretty cool because that's the kind of feedback.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:48):**  And that's how you test that.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:50):**  What you're doing actually makes an impact.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:53):**  So I'm the head of, global head of BD at Regrow.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:57):**  Regrow is a platform.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:00):**  Our platform is on a mission to quantify and scale regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:06):**  We work with the global agri-food companies and we're really keen and work towards enabling  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:14):**  farmers and companies and food processors and CPGs to become climate healers.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:20):**  So adopting and promoting regenerative ag is something that is feasible and doable for  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:25):**  them.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:26):**  Perhaps I'll start where you left, Koon, about the technology piece, about how it's important.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:35):**  You know, regen ag, regenerative agriculture is this squishy status of people.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:41):**  Am I an agerative agriculture?  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:43):**  Am I qualified to be considered that?  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:46):**  It's just, it's a little bit tricky, especially when it's hard to define success for you to  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:52):**  be like, okay, I check mark this, I did this for that purpose.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:56):**  So that's always where the discussion with farmers start.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:00):**  And I work on daily basis with growers and with co-ops, which are the closest people  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:07):**  to the farm that are thinking about how we can get that grower to see what can regenerative  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:14):**  agriculture do for them.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:15):**  And the conversation always starts like, why do you want to adopt that practice?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:18):**  What is your goal?  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:20):**  Are you trying to solve an erosion issue in your soil?  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:23):**  Are you trying to enhance your soil health?  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:25):**  Are you trying to counter for water lodging that happens on your field?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:30):**  So it's so important to start with, I'm doing this practice for this purpose, because that's  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:35):**  how success can be defined.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:37):**  And that's how you want to increase the adoption by showing that effect, by solving a real  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:42):**  problem and not, oh yeah, it's a hype and someone is paying me to do it.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:47):**  If we do it for the right reasons, it's going to be, it's going to exist longer and the  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:53):**  trend is going to increase.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:55):**  So with that being said, around the region ag, the technology part is quite fascinating.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:00):**  And I split the technology into two sectors, like what's happening on your farm.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:05):**  There's all the technology of the planters, of the seeders, of the machinery that's on  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:10):**  your farm that are able to perform strip till, that are able to do seed placements between  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:17):**  your corn rows for cover crop.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:19):**  That's a fascinating piece of the technology.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:22):**  And growers and farmers, they have invested for not themselves maybe, but their co-op  
**[0:21:28-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:28):**  have that machine that is available for them to use or to rent.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:35):**  So that's kind of the technology that's on the ground.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:38):**  There's the machinery, there's the technology around the seeding, around the different generics  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:45):**  of seeds that works really well for certain climates.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:49):**  And as I said, growers are connected.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:51):**  They have farm management systems, they store that data, they have it saved.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:57):**  And on the other side, there's that technology that really plays a big role in region agriculture,  
**[0:22:01-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:01):**  which is imagery, which is the capability to record an action that did not happen.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:09):**  For example, if you did not till, if you went through your soybean rotation and corn and  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:16):**  beans and you did not do tillage, then that is a practice that could be detected by the  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:22):**  remote sensing, by the imagery.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:24):**  And we're talking about publicly available satellite imagery, the sentinels, the Landsat,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:31):**  MODIS, different resolutions.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:33):**  So having the technology that can detect those fields and monitor them over the time period  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:41):**  of your growing cycle, we're able to see through the imaging and say, okay, harvest has happened  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:47):**  and then calculate how much residue was left.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:50):**  And by that, we're able to say, okay, this farmer did actually the no-till practice.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:56):**  So it's a technological capability, what a model called Optus, Operational Tillage Information  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:04):**  System.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:05):**  It's a model that actually analyzed this time series of satellite imagery to produce this  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:11):**  kind of information.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:13):**  Was there a cover crop?  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:15):**  Was there the absence of a tillage practice?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:19):**  So that's where the technology could also assist in making it easier for a grower to  
**[0:23:25-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:25):**  document what they did, to verify their practices and to understand their management as well.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:34):**  Another key component that I think is so important when I think about technology is the fact  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:38):**  that it's all connected.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:40):**  And what does that mean?  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:41):**  And that's something at regrow that we're really, really passionate about.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:44):**  And it's something that we've highlighted when we're talking region or even when we're  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:50):**  just talking about agronomy throughout the year, when we're trying to monitor your fields  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:55):**  or provide a nitrogen recommendation.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:59):**  Is that information that is in your equipment?  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:01):**  Are we able, and this is a piece that we were able to solve with our platform, is you're  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:07):**  able to connect to that farm management system.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:10):**  So let's say, on your John Deere equipment, you did the practice, you did the planting,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:17):**  you did document those activities as events.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:22):**  Having the technology where you can log in, bring in that data and start at a point where  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:29):**  you're like, okay, I can start at a point where I'm showing all my practices for the  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:35):**  past five years.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:37):**  So I can understand.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:39):**  That's where regrow comes and helps.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:41):**  Now we can tell you what's your baseline, where you are today.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:45):**  And that's what our technology by leveraging models like the DMDC, for example, denitrification  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:52):**  decarbonization model, it's a model that is able to quantify.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:57):**  So quantify what is your carbon stock and what can happen in the future.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:04):**  So it runs scenario planning tool.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:06):**  It shows this grower.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:07):**  If you decide to adopt this practice, which could be like a cover crop practice or no-till  
**[0:25:13-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:13):**  practice, this is the potential that you can sequester carbon in your field.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:20):**  It's all connected.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:21):**  You do the practice and it's even historical practices.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:24):**  They're all on your farm management system.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:26):**  You connect that, you fill in the information automatically.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:32):**  You don't have to do that.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:33):**  Just connect via API, your farm, and you populate that information.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:37):**  And then you're able to understand, okay, where am I today?  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:41):**  Because the model does take into consideration your field, your climate, your soil, everything  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:46):**  about your own field to be able to assist you by giving you scenarios of what can happen  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:51):**  when you adopt this regenerative practice on your soil health, on your sequestration,  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:58):**  and how you can capture on that potential new revenue.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:05):**  What do you see missing the most?  
**[0:26:06-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:06):**  Like what would you absolutely love if tomorrow morning suddenly with some kind of magic existed?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:17):**  What I would love to see the most is not on the technology side.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:20):**  I'd love the market to mature faster.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:25):**  I'd like more support for growers.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:27):**  I deal with growers on a daily basis.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:30):**  I work with them and they have a lot of questions.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:32):**  Like there is no one solution fit all.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:37):**  What I would like to see is more localized enablement.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:41):**  When a grower wants to adopt a practice, he has a goal.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:45):**  He knows that this works for his soil type.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:48):**  And he understands that this is better for him because they all want to build resilience.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:52):**  They all want to be able to give their kids a chance for inheriting that farm and making  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:57):**  a business from it.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:58):**  So our incentives are all aligned.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:00):**  It's just a matter of being resourceful of what would work for him.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:06):**  How can the local infrastructure enable him to make that decision and answer all his questions  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:14):**  and be confident in like this makes sense and this does solve my problem.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:18):**  So it's the conversation at the farmer level.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:22):**  I'd like to see that more maturing and him being more enabled and knowledgeable.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:29):**  And on the technology side and the market side, I'd like to see more maturity of initiatives  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:37):**  that not just announcements of, yeah, we want to do this, we want to do that, but more plans  
**[0:27:44-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:44):**  of how we're going to walk with our growers to get to that position where it makes sense  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:53):**  what they're doing.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:54):**  They're being rewarded and all of that.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:57):**  So that's what I would like to see soon.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:01):**  Great.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:03):**  And anything very briefly, I know we're to transition, but what's overhyped the most  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:08):**  with you having been in this space for a bit and working with growers constantly?  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:13):**  Do you get annoyed by some tech crunch messages?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:16):**  Do you get annoyed by some announcements?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:18):**  What is hyped too much with you in the tech space?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:23):**  Many that's a conversation by itself.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:25):**  You have to pick one?  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:26):**  If I have to pick one, the commitments, they get announced without an action plan.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:33):**  Like, great, we want to get a hundred thousand acre adopting a practice that makes sense.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:38):**  Great.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:39):**  I love these conversations.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:40):**  How?  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:41):**  And that has been the driver of, for us at Regrow to build what we can build, which is  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:48):**  the scale.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:50):**  So yeah, we try to solve the most annoying questions, which is how do I get that?  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:56):**  And that's what our purpose is to bring scale to regenerative ag and for that adoption.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:01):**  Great.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:02):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:04):**  I think Brett is going to step in now.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:07):**  Well, we'll dive, it's indeed it's time, which is too bad because I think we can dive into  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:13):**  this for the whole session actually, but we'll do that also.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:16):**  And thank you everyone for sharing the questions already and keep them coming.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:20):**  We'll get back to that right after we've introduced Wouter as well.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:26):**  Hello Wouter.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:27):**  Wouter Swachamaker, he's, I think originally an engineer.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:34):**  Wouter became more of a venture builder actually and a business developer throughout his career  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:40):**  and he's now active for the seaweed company and they're focusing on well, valorizing all  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:46):**  the possibilities with seaweed, regenerating both the oceans, but also using that to help  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:53):**  regenerate the soil, which is an interesting connection, I think between the ocean and  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:58):**  land.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:00):**  I won't share any more on the seaweed company, I'm quite enthusiastic also about what you  
**[0:30:05-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:05):**  do, but I would like to give you the stage Wouter and share a little bit more about yourself  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:12):**  and what you guys do as well.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:14):**  Yeah, thanks a lot Bart and everyone.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:17):**  Great initiatives to be here and happy to share something on the seaweed company and  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:23):**  the work we're doing and actually where many other people can help us with.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:27):**  And as you introduced already, I have some experience, some perfect experience in the  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:33):**  past and, but actually feel we're in the moment that we have to valorize more of our natural  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:40):**  resources to actually create more wins, actually seek solutions where you can create exponential  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:47):**  wins.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:48):**  So not per se exponential growth, but wins.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:51):**  And I found that personally into seaweeds and actually before me, some other people  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:57):**  already found that and they found it the seaweed company.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:00):**  And that's why I want to talk to you about.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:04):**  So I have a couple of slides.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:06):**  I want to walk you through, give some background where we're at and happy to answer any questions  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:13):**  that are later on.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:14):**  So I will share my screen.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:19):**  And actually it starts with capturing the value of seaweed because that's the mission.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:26):**  We believe there's more value into seaweeds than we've seen so far.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:32):**  And actually if you like seaweeds like us, you understand that there's a huge end-depth  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:40):**  potential actually in something like seaweeds, not very much known in this part of the world,  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:47):**  this part being Europe or maybe US, but actually it can have a lot of impact.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:53):**  Ocean restoration, it can help coastal communities.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:56):**  It can help health and wellbeing, but also sustainable farming.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:00):**  And especially the sustainable farming part is something I'd like to share more about  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:05):**  today.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:08):**  Because what's the seaweed company?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:10):**  The seaweed company actually was founded three years ago from the belief that some new industries  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:18):**  need to be arise.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:21):**  And actually we started with a unique approach, looking at a vertical integrated company.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:26):**  So if you look at the moment at the seaweed company, after three years, we own and operate  
**[0:32:31-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:31):**  four farms globally, Morocco, India, Ireland, where we create a sustainable traceable biomass  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:41):**  flow.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:43):**  And on the other hand, we turn them into products and make sure we actually generate awareness  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:48):**  for the demand of seaweeds.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:50):**  Again, there's a huge potential for products, but we decided we have to choose right.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:57):**  And we have to choose the right ones in order to get the traction and get the market running  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:03):**  also.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:08):**  What our belief is, and this is a small background into seaweeds, there are about more than 10,  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:15):**  20,000 species of seaweeds, but you can classify them in three big categories, green, red,  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:21):**  and brown.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:23):**  And actually it can be seen as a commodity and you can extract stuff from it and it's  
**[0:33:27-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:27):**  a commodity, but the combination of it is where huge value and potential is in.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:34):**  And this is what we believe.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:38):**  A concept that we recently joined and where we believe we can create the awareness for  
**[0:33:44-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:44):**  seaweeds is something unique that we as a vertical integrated company can actually bring  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:52):**  to market.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:53):**  And we call that our blue farming approach.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:58):**  The interesting thing about using seaweeds and utilizing them and utilizing the bioactive  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:05):**  ingredients into the seaweeds is that you can create great products that do great things  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:12):**  that generate exponential winds.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:15):**  And in this sense, we can combine the creation of products like a bio stimulant, our top  
**[0:34:24-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:24):**  health plants products that the farmer can use for their lands, help them reduce fertilizer,  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:34):**  make sure the water holding capacity of the fields increase and increases the biotic and  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:39):**  abiotic stresses of the plants with the natural product that actually in a previous life has  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:45):**  also regenerated the oceans and created jobs.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:49):**  So it's actually almost our blue farming approach, we try to position it also as a, as a, as  
**[0:34:55-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:55):**  a exponential wind, help a farmer make a step on the sustainable farming ladder and on the  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:03):**  other hand, restore oceans.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:07):**  And we have a range of products, I just explained about the bio stimulant, but we also have  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:12):**  some animal feed products, for example, for chicken, chicken can be co-fed with some natural  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:19):**  seaweed supplements.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:21):**  And actually those seaweed supplements prove to yield better health for the chicken, have  
**[0:35:31-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:31):**  less meat rejection for the, for the farmer and the farmer needs to use less antibiotics.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:39):**  So the same thing you actually see on happening to the soil for the bio stimulant, we can  
**[0:35:44-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:44):**  make sure we can see happening with animals and increasing the life, the wellness of animals.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:51):**  And as such, we believe we're seeing this potential and the first direction we see with  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:56):**  the farmers we work with is that we have to set emissions also in this area.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:01):**  So we believe, for example, in Europe, in the next years, we can make sure half a million  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:09):**  to a million farmers actually understand the power of seaweeds and how they can use them  
**[0:36:15-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:15):**  to make a step on the regenerative ladder and become more sustainable.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:22):**  We can improve animal health and life, we can regenerate lands and in the same time,  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:29):**  we mitigate climate impacts, recreate jobs and actually strengthen coastal ecosystems.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:36):**  So this is an interesting story about seaweeds that which is, I think I couldn't mention  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:41):**  it, landscapes and seascapes.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:43):**  So it's a real rich story and we're really proud that we work with a couple of farmers.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:49):**  We work with a couple of big companies that actually want to embrace the benefits of this.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:58):**  Interesting and this is maybe another view on our company is where does the technology  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:04):**  come into play into the seaweed phase at the moment?  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:08):**  And to make it to make it easy, I would like to mention three areas.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:15):**  And the three areas, I have a couple of examples to give you a sense where is the technology  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:20):**  level at the seaweed company, for example, or the seaweed industry as a whole.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:26):**  And that comes into play and this is pretty logical, mainly marine biology.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:33):**  Understanding how seaweeds grow.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:36):**  For example, here Dr. Stephen Cran, one of the founders of the company in the R&D lab  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:41):**  in Ireland, understanding how the life cycle of astral gases grows and how we can make  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:46):**  sure that we can do next year harvest even better than this year.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:52):**  This is marine biology.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:55):**  Another word, tech and engineering.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:59):**  I mean growing seaweeds, harvesting seaweeds requires quite a bit of tech.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:05):**  It might seem like relatively low tech, but it hasn't been done before.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:11):**  So for example, on the left hand side, we went to United Project where we actually grow  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:16):**  seaweeds 14 kilometers out of the coast in Scheveningen in the Netherlands.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:22):**  Something which is a pioneering project, never has been done before.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:27):**  Growing seaweeds in an ocean with 15, 20 meter waves high.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:32):**  This is stuff we're pioneering.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:34):**  We're also pioneering in solutions like how do you kind of automate, improve the efficiency  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:41):**  of the seeding and harvesting.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:45):**  And the last word of tech, and maybe in this sense, tech is not really high tech, but it's  
**[0:38:50-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:50):**  I think like Coon described, it's a, yeah, you can look at it broadly, is a biotech.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:58):**  And this understanding of the bioactive components of the true value that are in products.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:04):**  So over here you see, for example, the bio stimulants.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:08):**  How do we make sure that we use, for example, the right seaweed extract with some additions  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:14):**  and some other seaweeds that can actually bring those exponential benefits you would  
**[0:39:18-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:18):**  like to see.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:20):**  Also the natural feed supplements, for example, for our poultry.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:25):**  We have the experience and the expertise with our science team to make sure that we kind  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:30):**  of make the blends that actually do not only bring the health and wellbeing benefits, but  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:36):**  also make sure we can increase food conversion ratios by which the business case can also  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:41):**  work for the farmers.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:42):**  And this is also a very important part of the tech.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:45):**  It might not be really hardcore tech, but it's really science tech.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:50):**  And as such, I hope you have a bit of a glance of what we're doing at the seaweed company.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:56):**  And I'd like to close off with something what we all can do.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:04):**  Let's be an ambassador for something like seaweeds.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:08):**  Let's be a consumer to make sure demand is picking up or let's be a farmer that actually  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:15):**  embraces the fact that bio stimulants based on natural products can help you make a step  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:20):**  into sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:23):**  So I hope you get a sense of seaweeds, the seaweed company and the work we're doing.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:30):**  So thank you very much for your attention.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:35):**  Thank you, Mauter.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:36):**  If you can.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:38):**  Like, thank you very much.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:40):**  I think very interesting and we got some questions in the chat as well.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:47):**  And I want to, we're going to open up the stage for multiple questions and also getting  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:52):**  back to some of the questions that were asked to Manal and some of the questions that people  
**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:56):**  had for you, Mauter, and I have a few as well.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:59):**  So for everyone, if you want to jump in, please feel free.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:03):**  But someone that I want to introduce first and also give the stage for a question is  
**[0:41:10-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:10):**  Jan Marte Droz.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:13):**  He's working for Leiland, but maybe Jan Marte, you can introduce yourself.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:18):**  You had a question for Manal and yeah, I also have some questions with you, but maybe you  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:24):**  can, you can introduce yourself a little bit and then ask your question you had for Manal  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:29):**  and then we'll get back to the questions for you about it as well.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:35):**  You're muted Jan Marte.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:39):**  I did turn on my video, though.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:42):**  Thanks Bart.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:43):**  Thanks Koon.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:44):**  Thanks Manal for your explanation on regrow.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:50):**  You mentioned the DNDC as one of the tech options out there that can help farmers in  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:56):**  their journey towards regeneration.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:02):**  I'm involved in a pilot project together with the Dutch agri-lander Rabobank looking at  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:12):**  carbon farming or actually stimulate regenerative agriculture through carbon payments, as we  
**[0:42:18-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:18):**  now agreed to frame it.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:22):**  The partnership is not yet public, but we are working behind the scenes to do baselines  
**[0:42:28-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:28):**  and to find models that are appropriate, that are sensitive to regenerative technologies,  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:37):**  which is not easy to find.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:40):**  And DNDC was on our shortlist, but we actually decided to pull the plug because it requires  
**[0:42:49-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:49):**  very detailed spatial and temporal data in order to come up with modeling results.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:58):**  So my question is, do you have examples of working with DNDC in a farmer friendly way?  
**[0:43:04-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:04):**  And if not, or if so, are there any other options out there that provide reliable estimation  
**[0:43:13-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:13):**  of emission reductions that can be done based on existing data or simple queries?  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:27):**  Sorry for the background noises.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:30):**  My kids all woke up, so a disclaimer.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:34):**  Thank you for your question, John, and for exploring, working with models similar to  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:40):**  the DNDC.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:42):**  When it comes to modeling, it's this catch-22.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:44):**  You want a model that requires all these inputs, so you understand the right environmental,  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:50):**  the social, the weather, the soil, the environment, what kind of microbes you have.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:56):**  So you do need all these inputs so you can understand what is the environment and how  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:01):**  favorable it is to sequester, under what condition, under what practices.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:06):**  So it's good that the model require input.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:11):**  At the same time, it's painful that the model requires input.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:14):**  And I think that's the problem that we're solving, is where is that information?  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:20):**  How can we make it from a user perspective super friendly?  
**[0:44:23-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:23):**  And I will share with you what our current project with a project developer here in the  
**[0:44:31-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:31):**  US, we're working with them and they're using our regrow platform.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:35):**  So their growers, for example, have a lot of their information about what kind of fertilizer  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:42):**  they used, what was the cropping cycle for the past five years, when they planted, what  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:47):**  did they harvest, what was the amount of yield that they got.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:51):**  All of that information is in their farm management system.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:54):**  So connecting to that farm management system helps us answer automatically all of the questions  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:01):**  related to the agronomical practices.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:04):**  Then by connecting to data sources similar to the prism, the weather data sources or  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:11):**  the soil type, publicly available data sources that can answer a good chunk of the inputs  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:18):**  around the environment, the soil, the weather, and all of that.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:24):**  So the two pieces of information need to exist.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:28):**  It is a model that requires knowing about what has happened, what have been your practices,  
**[0:45:33-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:33):**  to be able to understand where you are today and how much you can sequester.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:39):**  The best thing or the best approach of it is where does this data exist?  
**[0:45:43-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:43):**  Great.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:44):**  It is on your farm management system.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:45):**  Let's connect to it.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:46):**  Let's get it.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:47):**  So we're able to run these simulations with minimum interaction.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:53):**  In addition to the DNDC, we run, for example, Optus, the operational tillage information  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:58):**  system, which is using the satellite and the remote sensing to fill out gaps, previous  
**[0:46:03-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:03):**  gaps in the data around if a cover crop was available, if a tillage practice has been  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:10):**  performed.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:11):**  So along with the combination of those three sources of data, you're able to cover what  
**[0:46:17-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:17):**  does the DNDC need to run.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:20):**  And I'm happy to share more examples with, I'll probably drop in a link for resources  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:27):**  for all of you guys to go check out a couple of videos and some workflows that are very  
**[0:46:32-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:32):**  farmer friendly.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:34):**  And it's what our farmers are using to enroll on some programs here in the US.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:41):**  Thank you.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:42):**  Thank you Manal.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:43):**  Maybe to follow up with that, and that's partly what I want to ask you as well, Jaumeit.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:51):**  You're talking about combining a lot of data as well and integrating with what is already  
**[0:46:56-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:56):**  there, but also introducing new data.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:58):**  And I think, Jaumeit, I heard you say in a different podcast also, raising the question,  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:04):**  maybe you can elaborate on it if I'm not saying it correctly, but who is owning the data and  
**[0:47:09-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:09):**  to what extent are farmers owning the data they produce or where does it land in this  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:17):**  well developing space also in getting this knowledge.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:21):**  So Jaumeit, if you don't want to extend on that, maybe Manal, you can answer already.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:26):**  No, I can't.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:29):**  Yeah, I'm here.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:33):**  No, there's, so there's, after I did the podcast, I got a lot of feedback from farmers, from  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:40):**  tech people and from everybody in between.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:45):**  For me, tech and agriculture is new-ish.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:50):**  I used to work with Solidarity.org working on sustainable value chains, and it had set  
**[0:47:56-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:56):**  up a digital unit.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:58):**  But especially in development space, you work with farming communities that have very little  
**[0:48:04-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:04):**  access to data and even issues like literacy or basic stuff like power and IT devices is  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:15):**  already a challenge there.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:17):**  Coming to the Netherlands and working with Vailand, I was surprised about the enormous  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:23):**  amounts of data that are collected by the machines that Manal referred to that are collected  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:29):**  using remote sensing through social media, etc.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:34):**  But for all or the majority of these tech companies, and then I mean both IT tech companies  
**[0:48:41-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:41):**  and engineering tech companies, it seems that the farmer becomes more and more a business  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:47):**  model rather than a client or a partner.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:52):**  It's I find it staggering to see how little access farmers have to data regardless of  
**[0:48:58-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:58):**  whether it's their own data or it's somebody else's data.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:02):**  There's an NGO, it translates into a bull nature, it translates into farmer and data  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:09):**  that has recently been set up in Netherlands to address this issue because also regulators,  
**[0:49:14-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:14):**  the Ministry of Agriculture, for example, are not even aware that the way agricultural  
**[0:49:22-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:22):**  companies control and use these data and limit the access of the data to the farmers themselves  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:29):**  is a problem at all.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:33):**  On the other hand, the farmers can do relatively little with a huge heap of terabytes of data.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:41):**  So it requires interfaces, it requires analysis, it requires support, and it's just I think  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:47):**  another service industry that is developing around the farming community in order to make  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:52):**  sense out of this data.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:54):**  But my analysis is that the farmers' interest is not put first in designing the systems  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:02):**  that govern these data.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:04):**  The public stakeholders, I think, are failing to provide such a thing, leave it to the private  
**[0:50:09-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:09):**  sector and the private sector by definition is more driven by profit or by their own benefits.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:20):**  And I think this is a serious impediment for regenerative agriculture because the stuff  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:24):**  we do is highly data intensive.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:27):**  We need to monitor things, we have very tailor-made specific interventions in specific locations  
**[0:50:34-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:34):**  so not all farmers are the same and in order to get to restore values and at the same time  
**[0:50:41-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:41):**  reap profit from a farm, you need really top-notch knowledge and intelligence and technology.  
**[0:50:53-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:53):**  So I think open space, farmer-owned and controlled and privacy-proof systems are required and  
**[0:51:05-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:05):**  there needs to be, well, attention in the public space and with government and civil  
**[0:51:13-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:13):**  society stakeholders that this is not something we should leave to the big agri-tech companies.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:19):**  Otherwise the same thing will happen that happened to GMOs 20 years ago, it was shunned  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:23):**  by the public, it was shunned by the NGOs, it was shunned by the governments, it was  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:28):**  left to the private sector and you could argue whether they created the Frankenstein but  
**[0:51:33-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:33):**  they definitely did not create a farm-refers technology with GM.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:41):**  Maybe Manal, you would like to, I'm very curious what your views are as well in this.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:49):**  Very good points, Jarmatine.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:52):**  What I would like to add is or emphasize and echo what you were saying around these kinds  
**[0:51:59-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:59):**  of practices to see the effect on the soil, it takes time.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:02):**  You do the practice, you start seeing its effect on your soil and being able to quantify  
**[0:52:08-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:08):**  it and feel it 10 years, 15 years from now and you need to take measurements to see how  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:13):**  much you are sequestering, how much your soil activity is or how your baseline is at  
**[0:52:18-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:18):**  the moment.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:19):**  So it is data intensive and understanding that the purpose of capturing that data is  
**[0:52:25-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:25):**  one to document and report on your advancement, your success so you could be rewarded accordingly  
**[0:52:34-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:34):**  and it's also needed for you to understand and find the practices that actually did make  
**[0:52:43-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:43):**  an impact on you.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:45):**  So it's answering your question and it's also answering the questions for the market for  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:48):**  you to be able to sell something which is for example your carbon sequestration potential.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:54):**  So the purpose behind the data is to enable you, the grower, it should be owned by the  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:01):**  grower.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:02):**  The models are at a point where they could be farm specific so we're asking you about  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:07):**  what you did just the past five years, how's your own soil, your own amendments, what you've  
**[0:53:12-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:12):**  been doing on your farm and this is all meant for you to make a better choice.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:18):**  That is the perspective of that data is for you to know what is the best thing for you  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:22):**  to what kind of practices would work best for your soil, what kind of practice will  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:27):**  give you the best financial potential and then the data come in to show that you have  
**[0:53:33-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:33):**  done that practice.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:35):**  So the purpose of the data is to assist the grower and I think there's a huge role as  
**[0:53:42-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:42):**  you mentioned Jean-Martin around what does the public sector, rules and regulations around  
**[0:53:48-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:48):**  that but it's definitely something that we are very keen and passionate about.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:55):**  Our grower first perspective of this technology, his privacy, his data and bringing value to  
**[0:54:03-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:03):**  him.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:04):**  Thank you Manal, I'm speeding up a little bit.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:08):**  I really feel that this is in a broader sense maybe a subject we can dive in separately  
**[0:54:15-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:15):**  as well and we can continue to do so after the summer.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:18):**  Maybe there's probably a lot to build there as well.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:21):**  I wanted to ask Vauter one more question before I ended up as well.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:29):**  We had a question for you actually from Andrew S. Kaller.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:32):**  Did you already answer it in the chat Vauter or not?  
**[0:54:37-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:37):**  I answered one I believe but I'm not sure.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:43):**  I'll follow up with a question maybe a little bit more relevant in this context and maybe  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:47):**  we cannot fully answer it but it's a question also to dive into.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:52):**  As you said we're pioneering a lot of new things and we're trying to get technology  
**[0:54:59-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:59):**  to help us there.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:01):**  Because it can be a chicken and an egg right?  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:03):**  You need the technology to make it the business case work.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:06):**  On the other hand the business case isn't working so the technology might not have a  
**[0:55:09-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:09):**  business case.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:13):**  How do you look at driving technological advancements in such a pioneering space as the one you're  
**[0:55:18-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:18):**  active in?  
**[0:55:20-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:20):**  It's a good question and I think maybe two answers which pop into my mind now.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:28):**  One is just go and do stuff step by step on the one hand.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:34):**  Just make small steps yourself with the company you can do to get your incremental results  
**[0:55:42-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:42):**  learn from it and see what happens and the other is team up.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:46):**  Actually the majority of the work actually going into the sewage field as I described  
**[0:55:51-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:51):**  for example that United project in the North Sea it can only work because you cover it  
**[0:55:56-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:56):**  together with other parties in the space.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:00):**  It's only then that usually these products get funded by public money or sometimes even  
**[0:56:06-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:06):**  private investors.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:07):**  So you have to team up there and in that sense if I look at our company we try to be a vertically  
**[0:56:15-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:15):**  integrated company but still we do not do everything ourselves.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:18):**  We also need to partner there and that's the vision we do have.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:23):**  Understand the total chain but work together on all these areas where you need to work  
**[0:56:30-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:30):**  together and also orchestrate that together.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:33):**  Well that the developments can advance where they need to.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:36):**  So on one hand just go do it make incremental steps and learn and team up together.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:43):**  Really important.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:47):**  All right thank you.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:48):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:49):**  I think this is also an interesting topic to dive into someone referred to.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:54):**  I'm not sure if it's relevant here but like the big challenges for example as has been  
**[0:56:59-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:59):**  done with the solar race where student teams are sort of used to drive a technology that  
**[0:57:04-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:04):**  is not yet feasible that cannot be used yet but find different ways to sort of moonshot  
**[0:57:12-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:12):**  technologies and drive and for it was an interesting as well.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:15):**  But thank you for your additions.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:18):**  I think we are it's always just one hour that we that we're having here which is feels a  
**[0:57:23-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:23):**  little bit too short but do you have any final remarks or things you wanted to add?  
**[0:57:29-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:29):**  To share before I go to thank our speakers.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:32):**  Yeah I mean I think we just literally pun definitely intended scratch the surface.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:36):**  I mean there are some great questions of of harness for smallholder farmers.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:40):**  I think there's a lot happening there.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:42):**  Anything from processing do it yourself or open source systems all the way up to you  
**[0:57:47-0:57:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:47):**  how to design systems at scale but also Glenn was asking something on soil health and also  
**[0:57:52-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:52):**  their technology is playing a big role but also a big role but obviously and things are  
**[0:57:57-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:57):**  coming in terms of carbon measurement I'll put it in the link but also simply observing  
**[0:58:01-0:58:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:01):**  and helping to observe your land and and do simple soil health tests which give a lot  
**[0:58:06-0:58:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:06):**  of power back to the farmer and we've done an interview with Abby Rose with on that quite  
**[0:58:12-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:12):**  a few years ago that have used technology to help farmers to start observing their souls  
**[0:58:17-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:17):**  much more with very simple things like things that everyone can do even if you have issues  
**[0:58:22-0:58:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:22):**  with a light bulb but most farmers don't because they keep their equipment running all the  
**[0:58:27-0:58:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:27):**  time so I think that the term of technology in agriculture is just incredibly wide so  
**[0:58:32-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:32):**  yeah an hour if we go from seaweed to to satellites there's there's everything is there in between  
**[0:58:38-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:38):**  so naturally we only scratch the surface so this begs the question of a lot more of these  
**[0:58:44-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:44):**  conversations.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:45):**  Yeah all right well thank you and maybe to continue with that and we are at the end but  
**[0:58:53-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:53):**  we're trying to host more of these conversations obviously Coon is doing a lot of interviews  
**[0:58:58-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:58):**  zooming in to specific questions here so I always recommend following the podcast but  
**[0:59:04-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:04):**  we're going to host multiple conversations where we have only have conversations and  
**[0:59:12-0:59:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:12):**  Q&A I would say and zoom in on multiple questions we'll try to do it on a monthly basis so if  
**[0:59:16-0:59:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:16):**  you like to continue the conversation with us please follow us on LinkedIn or find other  
**[0:59:21-0:59:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:21):**  ways I will make sure to follow up this meeting as well and share the the stream so you can  
**[0:59:28-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:28):**  you can watch it back or share it with other people when you want to.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:33):**  For now I really want to thank Wouter and Manal for sharing their stories and also Jan  
**[0:59:38-0:59:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:38):**  and Härte for dropping in from from Nylon so thank you very much I hope we we see you  
**[0:59:44-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:44):**  again and wish you good luck also I hope you succeed because then I think we all succeed  
**[0:59:51-0:59:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:51):**  so thank you thank you very much for your presence and Manal enjoy your day which is  
**[0:59:58-1:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:58):**  starting so thank you for those that want to stick around for a few minutes to to ask  
**[1:00:05-1:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:05):**  some questions maybe to us feel free but the the speakers will leave us in a bit and yeah  
**[1:00:12-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:12):**  thanks everyone for being here as well so always a weird ending digitally but you're  
**[1:00:19-1:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:19):**  welcome have a great day bye bye you too bye bye all right  
**[1:00:34-1:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:34):**  If there are people that want to ask us something maybe maybe I'm not sure about if you want  
**[1:00:41-1:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:41):**  to stick around maybe maybe you want to join the conversation but we usually keep the room  
**[1:00:47-1:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:47):**  open a little bit for those that want to yeah I'm looking to download the chat the meeting  
**[1:00:52-1:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:52):**  chat yeah okay I think it's yeah it's part of the stream it's part of the stream but  
**[1:00:59-1:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:59):**  oh perfect okay well thanks guys enjoy your afternoon and evening  
**[1:01:06-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:06):**  yeah thank you bye bye  
**[1:01:10-1:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:10):**  Gunnar are we going to dive into all these questions I can now understand why you have  
**[1:01:19-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:19):**  always multiple podcast questions that you can dive into make a podcast when we did it  
**[1:01:25-1:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:25):**  when we did the ask me anything where it's like an hour and I just try to plow through  
**[1:01:30-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:30):**  as many fun content as possible and usually yeah we get somewhere there and never never  
**[1:01:36-1:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:36):**  there because it's just an endless one so it's it's yeah every question raises more  
**[1:01:43-1:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:43):**  questions which is which is fine because it makes sense  
**[1:01:46-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:46):**  Oh someone has a question I think Glenn raised his hand I can see well hi Glenn oh hi hi  
**[1:01:53-1:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:53):**  hi guys really good to finally meet you I've been listening to all your podcasts for such  
**[1:01:57-1:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:57):**  a long time and thinking oh yeah I've got to go reach out one day here's my opportunity  
**[1:02:03-1:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:03):**  we're tackling the project so the problem the bigger regenerative agricultural problem  
**[1:02:07-1:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:07):**  in a different slide it's slightly different sort of way so we're at the carbon farm based  
**[1:02:12-1:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:12):**  in jersey in the channel islands and we actually farm carbon as a living that's what we do  
**[1:02:18-1:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:18):**  so currently we're working on a farm jersey hemp and we're transitioning them into regenerative  
**[1:02:23-1:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:23):**  agriculture and the way we do that is we produce biologically complete compost understand what  
**[1:02:29-1:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:29):**  the state of their soil health is and the soil succession is and then we improve that  
**[1:02:34-1:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:34):**  soil succession to suit what they their plants need to grow and then we see that their plants  
**[1:02:41-1:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:41):**  increase photosynthesis capability and the transfer of co2 into soil carbon exponentially  
**[1:02:47-1:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:47):**  because hemp is a is a plant of sequestration significance it can it can pull down about  
**[1:02:54-1:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:54):**  30 tons per hectare per year which is probably two to three times more than any tree can  
**[1:02:59-1:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:59):**  do and we can measure this and what we're doing is we're entering that into the blockchain  
**[1:03:05-1:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:05):**  and we're issuing carbon credits on behalf of business on behalf of farmers to business  
**[1:03:11-1:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:11):**  offsets and paying farmers to farm carbon so we're literally walking them through the  
**[1:03:16-1:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:16):**  transition of regenerative farming and measuring it independently for them and entering it  
**[1:03:22-1:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:22):**  into the carbon markets  
**[1:03:23-1:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:23):**  grateful great to finally meet and and i definitely have to dive into it yeah it's quite a bit  
**[1:03:33-1:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:33):**  about hemp etc but obviously i haven't and we have not done anything on fibers i think  
**[1:03:38-1:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:38):**  so far so yeah well we're using we're using hemp predominantly as a viral mediation crop  
**[1:03:45-1:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:45):**  so that has been used like that yeah so it's a great way of regenerating soils for trees  
**[1:03:53-1:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:53):**  and we're you know we the tree loss is obviously a lot less if you proceed it with hemp and  
**[1:04:02-1:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:02):**  yeah it's we're finding then when you can actually move the soil succession to suit  
**[1:04:07-1:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:07):**  the plants and becoming more fungal as you get towards trees and you balance your microbiome  
**[1:04:13-1:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:13):**  around the roots then the plants can actually deposit a lot more stable soil carbon into  
**[1:04:20-1:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:20):**  the you know into the soils which can be measured and then you know offset  
**[1:04:25-1:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:25):**  amazing now i think there's a lot to discover or to to figure out and you know how to speed  
**[1:04:32-1:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:32):**  up these processes how to speed up agroforestry processes how to bring down the failure rate  
**[1:04:37-1:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:37):**  of trees and and all of that because it's a it's definitely holding back and holding  
**[1:04:43-1:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:43):**  back the agroforestry pledges that we've seen around so i put up one of the questions you  
**[1:04:47-1:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:47):**  know maybe we ought to start looking looking more at natural systems rather than technology  
**[1:04:53-1:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:53):**  in one of the chat things i think technology is definitely something that's going to come  
**[1:04:58-1:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:58):**  along and it needs to come along desperately but at the moment it's actually quite easy  
**[1:05:02-1:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:02):**  to do the measurements without technology so for example soil organic matter that can  
**[1:05:10-1:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:10):**  be measured soil carbon you can figure out what the soil carbon levels are and you can  
**[1:05:15-1:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:15):**  see whether they're increasing or falling the other measurements is of course the soil  
**[1:05:20-1:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:20):**  health so we can do the elanigums soil food web analytics and work out where the fungal  
**[1:05:26-1:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:26):**  bacteria ratios are which relate to the plants can you do it here as well is it is it oh  
**[1:05:31-1:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:31):**  yeah costly at a few thousand hectares or um or what's your feeling there so we've got  
**[1:05:39-1:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:39):**  we've got a young lab tech who actually is at university at warrick university and she's  
**[1:05:44-1:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:44):**  at the moment doing comparisons between elanigums counts and a dna count so we're actually seeing  
**[1:05:50-1:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:50):**  for the first time what the you know the differences are a human count comes in at you know a very  
**[1:05:56-1:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:56):**  reasonable price the same cost as you know any chemical analysis um obviously a dna count  
**[1:06:03-1:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:03):**  is going to come at five six seven hundred pounds or whatever ridiculous um so it'll  
**[1:06:08-1:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:08):**  be interesting to see the comparison you don't know yet like i don't know yet okay that's  
**[1:06:14-1:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:14):**  going to be interesting it will be interesting um but just to give you an idea we're we're  
**[1:06:19-1:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:19):**  bringing in we're doing soil sampling um we're doing sort of like a package for about 75  
**[1:06:24-1:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:24):**  pounds which will do a total carbon that's including the microbial carbon um and that's  
**[1:06:31-1:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:31):**  that's sort of affordable but it's still quite expensive for a farmer um but you know that  
**[1:06:36-1:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:36):**  can be that can be accounted through the carbon offsets anyway yeah no definitely i mean i  
**[1:06:41-1:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:41):**  see we just recorded an episode i mean some people are selling obviously to to the front  
**[1:06:47-1:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:47):**  runners like stripe etc who are actively in the market for let's say the experimental  
**[1:06:52-1:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:52):**  stuff the biochar the enhanced weathering potentially hemp i don't know if you're selling  
**[1:06:56-1:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:56):**  to them as well so there's definitely a moment in in time now where you can finance some  
**[1:07:01-1:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:01):**  of this through carbon credits to not not crazy amounts but definitely crazy amounts  
**[1:07:06-1:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:06):**  per ton and to to kick start a lot of this and the others will follow is is the the current  
**[1:07:13-1:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:13):**  thinking but of course we don't know if we're in a bubble of carbon credits at the moment  
**[1:07:16-1:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:16):**  but definitely there's a lot of money out there so i think it's yeah the the uk government  
**[1:07:22-1:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:22):**  is doing quite a major area a deal with this so i know they put out this thing the other  
**[1:07:26-1:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:26):**  day um that uh if businesses don't submit their esgs i think i heard it on your one  
**[1:07:32-1:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:32):**  of your podcasts if they don't businesses don't submit their esgs alongside their tax  
**[1:07:36-1:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:36):**  returns then they're less likely to get a government to a contract um and that was but  
**[1:07:42-1:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:42):**  that would be interesting yeah so um and that follows through to investments that banks  
**[1:07:48-1:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:48):**  make as well so banks have to submit all of the investments they make um and what their  
**[1:07:52-1:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:52):**  environmental strategies are and again if they all line up then the government is going  
**[1:07:57-1:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:57):**  to support them if they don't then they won't get the government support which is now opening  
**[1:08:01-1:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:01):**  up the market so that now we're finding um big emitters um are now seeking ways of offsetting  
**[1:08:08-1:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:08):**  so the obvious the low hanging fruit of the farmers of course we're just going to get  
**[1:08:12-1:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:12):**  the measurements in place to do it absolutely and the standardization and the double counting  
**[1:08:18-1:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:18):**  sometimes and i mean but there's yeah there's a lot moving there i'm i should i'm talking  
**[1:08:25-1:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:25):**  to strive to get them on the podcast here to explore that more their leading role as  
**[1:08:29-1:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:29):**  okay as one of these players so the way we do it just to really i know i'm taking up  
**[1:08:35-1:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:35):**  a lot of time which i apologize for but so the way we do it is through the blockchain  
**[1:08:39-1:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:39):**  um so you know the the carbon coming from top from bottom up you know the carbon goes  
**[1:08:46-1:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:46):**  through a methodology um which is accepted by the uk carbon code um and then that goes  
**[1:08:52-1:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:52):**  off for verification and certification um and then you get a dark green carbon credit  
**[1:08:58-1:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:58):**  um or a light green carbon credit so a light green carbon credit would be a lower value  
**[1:09:02-1:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:02):**  carbon credit which say accounts for trees um or if you want a dark green carbon credit  
**[1:09:07-1:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:07):**  that would actually account that would go to a local regenerative farmer who's um a  
**[1:09:12-1:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:12):**  signed up on the regenerative organic certification so that means he's he's not using any chemicals  
**[1:09:18-1:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:18):**  um you know soil health animal health and people health are top of the level um and  
**[1:09:22-1:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:22):**  then it's just very simple um doing the the total carbon audits and the soil food web  
**[1:09:29-1:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:29):**  super interesting things that don't worry about taking time super interesting stuff  
**[1:09:33-1:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:33):**  sorry about it i think it's great this is so there are no rules here so uh anyone can  
**[1:09:39-1:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:39):**  step in and agree that you did i also wonder um with i mean you're you say you do the you  
**[1:09:48-1:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:48):**  use the blockchain right but it's also about it's mainly about the input in the blockchain  
**[1:09:52-1:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:52):**  so the blockchain make sure that uh it's controlled and certified but you can still um input or  
**[1:10:03-1:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:03):**  lie i would say with with the input you're doing on on the amount of carbon that you're  
**[1:10:07-1:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:07):**  actually storing how does it work for you you shed a little bit on how you measure it  
**[1:10:11-1:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:11):**  but what is the control mechanism actually in making sure that the carbon that you say  
**[1:10:17-1:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:17):**  you are sequestering is actually happening yeah that's a really good question and this  
**[1:10:23-1:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:23):**  is one of the things that we've been um we've been tackling them quite hard and i heard  
**[1:10:27-1:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:27):**  one of the um one of the statements came up in the earlier discussions about you know  
**[1:10:33-1:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:33):**  the farmer um actually being control in control of the measurements or understanding the measurements  
**[1:10:39-1:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:39):**  or something we find that is where your double accounting will really start to cause problems  
**[1:10:44-1:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:44):**  so the way the carbon farm has positioned itself is to actually work with the farmer  
**[1:10:49-1:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:49):**  as an independent auditor but we also guide them through the regenerative transition if  
**[1:10:55-1:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:55):**  you see what i mean so you know what we do is the with their three tests we four tests  
**[1:11:02-1:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:02):**  we really do we do the the biologicals through an independent soil food web lab tech we do  
**[1:11:09-1:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:09):**  chemistry looking for the total soil carbon we do that through an independent um recognized  
**[1:11:15-1:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:15):**  laboratory in the uk um we do physical which the farmer tends to do themselves so that's  
**[1:11:21-1:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:21):**  water infiltration um and the soil parameters but the the fourth one we do which i think  
**[1:11:27-1:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:27):**  is the key to it is the um the practices of the farmer so and the way that's done is what  
**[1:11:35-1:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:35):**  is their certification so if their certification is um conventional um i know certification  
**[1:11:41-1:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:41):**  then they can't even enter onto the scheme if it's organic they can enter onto the scheme  
**[1:11:46-1:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:46):**  um but then there are certain parameters like tillage if they do that or um use of certain  
**[1:11:52-1:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:52):**  chemicals you know coppers or sulfates or things like that then they would obviously  
**[1:11:56-1:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:56):**  that would knock knock them off uh knock certain points off but if they're regenerative organic  
**[1:12:01-1:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:01):**  certificate um in other words soil health people health and animal health are key to  
**[1:12:07-1:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:07):**  it and they um they obviously have to go through their accreditation to get the regenerative  
**[1:12:12-1:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:12):**  organic that solves that problem um and then we just measure it through as i say those  
**[1:12:17-1:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:17):**  measurements which i gave you know those different parameters of biological chemical and physical  
**[1:12:21-1:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:21):**  data sets i think that's also what we just discussed with the satellites and uh because  
**[1:12:29-1:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:29):**  that's maybe potentially because you said we don't need that much of technology and  
**[1:12:33-1:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:33):**  i think it's it's good to start with with what nature is actually doing and try to have  
**[1:12:40-1:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:40):**  technology in a supporting role but maybe for example in seeing what is we zoom in on  
**[1:12:45-1:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:45):**  the practices for example using satellite data on seeing what has actually been done  
**[1:12:50-1:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:50):**  on a farm is that something you you see as potentially helpful for example yeah we use  
**[1:12:55-1:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:55):**  we use satellites we currently use satellites but we can only allocate a light green carbon  
**[1:13:00-1:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:00):**  credit if through satellite data um so in other words you know if if the offsetter doesn't  
**[1:13:07-1:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:07):**  want to go for the higher value carbon offsets you know where we're talking above uh 25 30  
**[1:13:13-1:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:13):**  pounds a unit um if they only want to spend about five pounds a unit or whatever um then  
**[1:13:19-1:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:19):**  we'll use satellite data because it's it's relatively cheap to do that um the cost is  
**[1:13:24-1:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:24):**  in the measurements as you've just quite rightly alluded to so if if the if the client comes  
**[1:13:29-1:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:29):**  to us and say they want light green carbon credits that's absolutely fine we can do that  
**[1:13:32-1:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:32):**  we can send a satellite over and measure it um but that tends to be for carbon credits  
**[1:13:37-1:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:37):**  that are um not local so that's if someone wants to grow trees in south america or something  
**[1:13:43-1:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:43):**  like that um and obviously there's all the um you know all the problem problems that  
**[1:13:50-1:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:50):**  could be associated with that with climate change obviously the trees can burn down or  
**[1:13:53-1:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:53):**  there could be political problems or all the rest of it so it attracts a much lower value  
**[1:13:58-1:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:58):**  carbon credit but for a local carbon credit you know higher value where you get all the  
**[1:14:03-1:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:03):**  um the added bonuses you know food security biosecurity water security then that attracts  
**[1:14:10-1:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:10):**  a much higher carbon credit our carbon unit yeah all right yeah cool i wanted to i'm not  
**[1:14:19-1:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:19):**  sure if kun if you still have time to stick around normally we we keep it open for about  
**[1:14:23-1:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:23):**  uh 15 to 30 minutes i think it's i would like to continue the conversation a little bit  
**[1:14:28-1:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:28):**  but also invite maybe the people that are sticking around if they want to say something  
**[1:14:33-1:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:33):**  sure i can't i can't stay much longer but i'm very happy to answer as many questions  
**[1:14:37-1:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:37):**  to the camera i've got this great opportunity you guys have set up like and now great to  
**[1:14:43-1:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:43):**  have you i think uh yeah i see that josepe who's in the yes as well i'd like to connect  
**[1:14:49-1:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:49):**  with you glenn hi uh good to meet you and thanks kun and uh and barth for setting this  
**[1:14:55-1:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:55):**  up and glenn very interesting so i'm responsible at the live kindly collective which is a collective  
**[1:15:00-1:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:00):**  of plant-based meat alternative companies um produce plant-based meat alternatives and  
**[1:15:06-1:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:06):**  we're also have an agriculture division where we implement regenerative agriculture and  
**[1:15:14-1:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:14):**  uh putting in place a system to generate carbon credits and we recognize all the complexities  
**[1:15:20-1:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:20):**  but glenn it's interesting you mentioned sort of the measurement is not the issue and i  
**[1:15:26-1:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:26):**  just wondered how do you deal with how do you prove permanence of the carbon credit  
**[1:15:33-1:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:33):**  that seems an issue that we i mean we're also combining these different you know remote  
**[1:15:38-1:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:38):**  sensors local sensors local samples putting that into models and machine learning but  
**[1:15:44-1:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:44):**  that still proves you know it's still a multivariate problem with a lot of variables that interact  
**[1:15:50-1:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:50):**  together so i just wondered how you deal with that issue and yeah and then related to that  
**[1:15:55-1:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:55):**  which which credit agency is actually you're working with that it's actually issuing the  
**[1:16:00-1:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:00):**  carbon credits yeah really good questions there um thanks for asking them so permanence  
**[1:16:05-1:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:05):**  is just a matter of time um if you look at if carbon is a is a farmer's bank account  
**[1:16:10-1:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:10):**  um soil organic matter is their current account in other words it comes in and goes out but  
**[1:16:15-1:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:15):**  soil carbon is their deposit account so the longer they can actually keep their soil organic  
**[1:16:20-1:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:20):**  matter levels up and the biodiversity the soil biodiversity is is is suitable to what  
**[1:16:25-1:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:25):**  the plants requires then the stable soil carbon will start to accumulate and you can you can  
**[1:16:32-1:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:32):**  measure that over a period of time so that's pretty straightforward um the other side of  
**[1:16:37-1:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:37):**  permanence is what you do with the biomass the above ground carbon if that carbon is  
**[1:16:43-1:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:43):**  is sent off for um i don't know uh incineration worst case scenario then that would go as  
**[1:16:49-1:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:49):**  a negative um but if it's um if it's composted or um you know made into hempcrete which is  
**[1:16:56-1:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:56):**  what we do a lot with our biomass then obviously that locks it up and that acts as a positive  
**[1:17:01-1:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:01):**  um so that's the way we deal with permanence um as regards to which um which group we work  
**[1:17:09-1:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:09):**  with we use the uk carbon code um so that one you know what that is is set up the um  
**[1:17:17-1:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:17):**  the template for uh farmers or um consultants like us to actually use um we have actually  
**[1:17:26-1:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:26):**  improved the the basic carbon code so we've we've almost done a fork on the carbon code  
**[1:17:31-1:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:31):**  to create a much more um concise you know for whatever the context of the farm is um  
**[1:17:38-1:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:38):**  to suit that farm so depending on what that farm is growing um we can we can change that  
**[1:17:43-1:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:43):**  carbon code just slightly to to basically support the farmer so at the end of the day  
**[1:17:48-1:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:48):**  the whole point is the farmer farms carbon um and initially if it's difficult for them  
**[1:17:53-1:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:53):**  to cover the cost the business i work for the carbon farm will cover the costs initially  
**[1:17:59-1:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:59):**  until ecosystem services cut in and then the costs reduce dramatically to the farmer um  
**[1:18:04-1:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:04):**  so that they can then start issuing the carbon credits on their own on their own behalf okay  
**[1:18:10-1:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:10):**  thank you i have a bit of a follow-up question if you still have time or at least the thing  
**[1:18:15-1:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:15):**  that i'm struggling with a little bit and i wonder all of you what you think but um  
**[1:18:21-1:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:21):**  it's also when you start measuring right so it's about the the amount of carbon that you  
**[1:18:26-1:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:26):**  actually harvest but correct me if i'm wrong so if you want to you're already doing a great  
**[1:18:32-1:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:32):**  job you almost have like you did a perfect job for like maybe indigenous uh indigenous  
**[1:18:39-1:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:39):**  people having a huge area that is perfectly holding the carbon already that is not incentivized  
**[1:18:45-1:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:45):**  and then by capturing it can we sort of define like this is this is the amount of carbon  
**[1:18:52-1:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:52):**  that that should be this area should be capable of of holding and you are already having like  
**[1:19:00-1:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:00):**  30 so that's that's good good and then you can you can add up to it is it yeah yeah so  
**[1:19:08-1:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:08):**  i'll tell you how we do it um it's it's not actually fixed and we haven't come up with  
**[1:19:12-1:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:12):**  um we haven't we haven't pushed this towards the uk carbon code but we've talked to them  
**[1:19:19-1:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:19):**  a bit about it and offer and ask them whether they'd accept it but it's just a thought it's  
**[1:19:24-1:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:24):**  just something we're throwing out there and it's open for discussion and you know it's  
**[1:19:27-1:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:27):**  open there to be you know cut down basically um but the uk has some really tight figures  
**[1:19:34-1:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:34):**  on this so um back in the 1700s soil organic matter was around 30 atmospheric um co2 was  
**[1:19:41-1:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:41):**  around 240 parts per million um in 2021 soil organic matter was three percent and atmospheric  
**[1:19:47-1:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:47):**  carbon is uh what 420 parts per million so it's obviously soil is a major contributor  
**[1:19:53-1:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:53):**  to the whole climate change initial issue um so we're using three percent as our baseline  
**[1:19:58-1:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:58):**  um and then we're also looking at the biology um so there's no point in having say five  
**[1:20:04-1:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:04):**  percent soil carbon or so you know sort of carbon but actually have no life in the soil  
**[1:20:10-1:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:10):**  um because that indicates that the cat the the the farmer might have been putting down  
**[1:20:14-1:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:14):**  loads of manure but also following it up with glycerate or something like that um so if  
**[1:20:20-1:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:20):**  the soil carbon levels are anything above three percent and there's a really good healthy  
**[1:20:24-1:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:24):**  soil food web um present then we believe that farmers should be entitled to some um you  
**[1:20:30-1:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:30):**  know compensation and that's something that isn't recognized now right so you're lobbying  
**[1:20:38-1:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:38):**  for that yeah yeah so um where we are here in jersey is we're part of the uk but we're  
**[1:20:46-1:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:46):**  not um so we have our own government and our own laws and we have our own money um but  
**[1:20:51-1:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:51):**  we're a protectorate of the uk as well so we can we can use the uk's carbon code and  
**[1:20:57-1:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:57):**  we can develop that code for ourselves and so that's what we're proposing to do is to  
**[1:21:02-1:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:02):**  develop that code um to input to put in this new parameter and we're seeing where the people  
**[1:21:07-1:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:07):**  will it you know if businesses will accept it um and if businesses do accept it and then  
**[1:21:12-1:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:12):**  there's a transaction then there's no reason why it can't be included into the more um  
**[1:21:17-1:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:17):**  universal code code but i think i think Bart is a key point that you're mentioning because  
**[1:21:23-1:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:23):**  paradoxically what this uh what this means is that you you know the worst farming practices  
**[1:21:29-1:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:29):**  have the biggest delta between let's say the baseline and the additionality right so you  
**[1:21:32-1:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:32):**  get like this paradoxical situation where if you're really doing good regenerative agriculture  
**[1:21:37-1:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:37):**  you can actually make less money today so that's why we're really focused on uh you  
**[1:21:42-1:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:42):**  know also showing the annual uh sequestration uh potential because it's rather than to see  
**[1:21:48-1:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:48):**  it as a pool of soc that you uh sequester and then you create one credit that is really  
**[1:21:54-1:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:54):**  a long term and permanent proven uh carbon you also want to look at the short-term carbon  
**[1:22:01-1:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:01):**  cycles and what is it really that you capture every year as a as a net uh sequestration  
**[1:22:07-1:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:07):**  and then you can apply that also to farmers that are already in the regenerative uh you  
**[1:22:11-1:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:11):**  know space yeah and potentially you could even look back i think right with some of  
**[1:22:15-1:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:15):**  the satellite data goes back i think 16 or 17 years so you can actually see i mean that's  
**[1:22:19-1:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:19):**  a long time not very long but still like you could theoretically see okay who has been  
**[1:22:24-1:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:24):**  in it for a while and and who didn't take out his uh carbon removal device aka the plow  
**[1:22:31-1:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:31):**  and because that's the danger obviously if that delta is too big we or the soul in terms  
**[1:22:37-1:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:37):**  of trees etc like we're going to incentivize the wrong behavior yeah yeah yeah except for  
**[1:22:42-1:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:42):**  satellite gives you as glen was also mentioning it gives you a sort of you know approximation  
**[1:22:46-1:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:46):**  yeah of course now the new the new um flex satellite that esta is launching next year  
**[1:22:53-1:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:53):**  and we're actually sorry 2023 that's going to be a big improvement because it's going  
**[1:22:57-1:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:57):**  to be the resolution okay i think i think 15 centimeters something like that it's really  
**[1:23:04-1:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:04):**  really big but this same problem comes back it doesn't matter what technology you use  
**[1:23:10-1:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:10):**  until you can actually get technology into the soil ie a bot in the soil that can measure  
**[1:23:15-1:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:15):**  the um the microbial as well as the carbon you know the the organic carbon and non-organic  
**[1:23:20-1:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:20):**  carbon then you're never going to get an accurate carbon an accurate figure so the way we do  
**[1:23:25-1:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:25):**  it is to actually see how the farmer's um soil succession is mimicked by the microbial  
**[1:23:31-1:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:31):**  succession and that's that that's mirrored so if your fungal bacteria ratio is say one  
**[1:23:37-1:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:37):**  to one and you're trying to grow row crops um then that shows that there's been good  
**[1:23:41-1:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:41):**  practices by that farmer over a period of time and um and what we're finding with the  
**[1:23:47-1:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:47):**  great study in new zealand on regenerative farms is within one growing season you can  
**[1:23:51-1:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:51):**  actually increase the um the soil health or soil carbon levels up to a certain amount  
**[1:23:57-1:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:57):**  or you can sequester so much carbon and then years you know following years after that  
**[1:24:02-1:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:02):**  um the the percentages drop dramatically but there is an increase each year if you see  
**[1:24:07-1:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:07):**  what i mean so it's that initial um it's that initial period where you get the serious sequestration  
**[1:24:13-1:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:13):**  and then it's just like topping up continually and that's how nature plays the game because  
**[1:24:18-1:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:18):**  she doesn't want to show that um she doesn't want to throw the whole succession out of  
**[1:24:22-1:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:22):**  balance to what the crop that you're trying to grow or it's suitable to grow so so glenn  
**[1:24:28-1:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:28):**  glenn and maybe i don't want to take too much time from the others i see just because it's  
**[1:24:32-1:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:32):**  very interesting so but then on the measurement of the uh fungal material ratio do you only  
**[1:24:40-1:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:40):**  work with sampling or so do you work with sample with sensors soil sensors and if so  
**[1:24:46-1:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:46):**  which which are sort of proxies for the soil health in terms of bacterial and fungal activity  
**[1:24:52-1:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:52):**  uh there's no sensors out there currently that can um can can uh are as good as the  
**[1:25:00-1:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:00):**  human count and the human count by no means is up to scratch um there's too many variabilities  
**[1:25:06-1:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:06):**  um so what we tend to do is we just use one person to do all of our soil samples and she's  
**[1:25:12-1:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:12):**  really really busy um but at least we get some sort of like um you know continuation  
**[1:25:18-1:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:18):**  from her um and we're desperate we are there is a lot of work at the moment being done  
**[1:25:23-1:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:23):**  um i think there's three different um groups who are actually trying to develop uh some  
**[1:25:30-1:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:30):**  sort of machine learning um through the microscope so you know you can we're just teaching the  
**[1:25:36-1:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:36):**  machine to actually recognize shapes of microbes so it can be a much more accurate um count  
**[1:25:42-1:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:42):**  than um you know than the human count but we're about two or three years off that um  
**[1:25:47-1:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:47):**  i've heard of there's also bots which are being developed in australia um which are  
**[1:25:53-1:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:53):**  using phosphorescent um spectrometry um which is able to um you know which is quite quite  
**[1:26:00-1:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:00):**  interesting um accuracy again you know so there's lots going on it's a really exciting  
**[1:26:07-1:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:07):**  world but at the moment we're about two years off and we just have to still use the human  
**[1:26:10-1:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:10):**  eye which isn't the best but it's the best we've got at the moment okay thanks all right  
**[1:26:17-1:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:17):**  i uh potentially we can we can dive into this uh in one of the conversations after the summer  
**[1:26:23-1:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:23):**  as well i think there's a there's a it's an interesting conversation but i i also want  
**[1:26:28-1:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:28):**  to be mindful of all of your time i think we are uh nearing uh the end of the sort of  
**[1:26:34-1:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:34):**  the open space as well maybe we we can have one more uh remark from hannes and then uh  
**[1:26:40-1:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:40):**  wrap it up i would say because hannes has been asking quite a few questions uh so hannes  
**[1:26:45-1:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:45):**  i'm not if you're still here uh yeah hi i i might drop out my battery is low but i just  
**[1:26:52-1:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:52):**  had a question about the the value of the carbon credits against the value of the of  
**[1:26:57-1:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:57):**  the crop on the hemp if sold is there can you yeah elaborate on that relation and then  
**[1:27:06-1:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:06):**  maybe also asking if you plan on leaving the island scaling to other geographies or or  
**[1:27:11-1:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:11):**  is that too early um as far as evaluation is concerned that's a really good question  
**[1:27:17-1:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:17):**  um that's what you can actually get for it so um we are currently negotiating for farmers  
**[1:27:23-1:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:23):**  we reckon we've got a hit about 50 pounds a ton to make it worthwhile for a farmer to  
**[1:27:27-1:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:27):**  um to farm a ton of carbon per hectare um we're we're hitting about 35 pounds a ton  
**[1:27:33-1:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:33):**  at the moment which is interesting um but we've got to get it up to 50 pounds and i  
**[1:27:38-1:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:38):**  reckon we'll do that this year um because of all the um the you know the ex the other  
**[1:27:44-1:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:44):**  benefits that come along with it the water security food security and all the other issues  
**[1:27:48-1:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:48):**  we can sell that we think um as far as um with regards to the hemp well actually a healthier  
**[1:27:55-1:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:55):**  soil produces a more healthier crop um and as i've always said mother nature's or the  
**[1:28:00-1:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:00):**  microbes work 24 7 365 days of the year so i'd rather employ them for free than a load  
**[1:28:07-1:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:07):**  of staff so the profitability of the hemp crop increases dramatically alongside the  
**[1:28:13-1:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:13):**  the amount of carbon in soil so actually if you can have your cake and eat it um if you  
**[1:28:18-1:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:18):**  farm regeneratively and measure it um what was your other question sorry i forget  
**[1:28:23-1:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:23):**  geography yeah it's a really really good really good question that i'm glad you've asked it  
**[1:28:33-1:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:33):**  um we're completely um uh changing the whole uh strategy of carbon credits um i can tell  
**[1:28:41-1:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:41):**  you we are now um how can i say it best we're trying to privatize the environment um so  
**[1:28:47-1:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:47):**  we're using crypto coins we're using blockchain and we're going to give everyone an opportunity  
**[1:28:53-1:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:53):**  to potentially um purchase a crypto coin a carbon coin in order to actually offset their  
**[1:28:59-1:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:59):**  emissions directly to the farmer and that's quite exciting because that will really localize  
**[1:29:04-1:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:04):**  the whole carbon trading system so there will be a lot of need for um businesses or um you  
**[1:29:12-1:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:12):**  know to offset their carbon their carbon locally in which case we'll be looking for farms all  
**[1:29:16-1:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:16):**  over the world to actually do that so it's a really exciting um area that that that's  
**[1:29:23-1:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:23):**  developing  
**[1:29:24-1:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:24):**  thanks a lot also for your for your question uh yeah great that you uh jumped in i think  
**[1:29:35-1:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:35):**  uh glenn if i pronounce it right uh so uh good to hear from you as well and uh hope  
**[1:29:41-1:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:41):**  you join more of our conversations because i think it's there's a lot there's a lot to  
**[1:29:44-1:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:44):**  talk about absolutely well it's been a great pleasure meeting you i really has i've been  
**[1:29:49-1:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:49):**  meaning to get in touch with you guys for a long long time but i love the podcast and  
**[1:29:53-1:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:53):**  i love what you're doing and keep up the good work  
**[1:29:55-1:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:55):**  all right thank you everyone thank you kun uh and uh yeah see you next time cheers thank  
**[1:30:05-1:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:30:05):**  you bye-bye cheers thanks bye-bye  
**[1:30:10-1:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:30:10):**  dear friends of the podcast i'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:30:14-1:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:30:14):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:30:19-1:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:30:19):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it why are we doing this

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2021-00-17)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  Welcome to a very special episode where we hosted a conversation together with the team  of Fresh Ventures, where we looked this time at the role of technology in regenerative  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:24):**  agriculture and food.  Often overlooked, often very much underfunded compared to the rest of the, let's say, ag  tech space.  And we had a very interesting discussion with Regrow, which had been on the podcast before,  Seaweed Company and much more.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:39):**  So we're doing this more often.  Please check in if you want to join live and enjoy.  Welcome everyone to the second Fresh Talks.  This time focused on farmer first technologies and how it can help accelerate our transition  to regenerative food system.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:58):**  This is an event organized by Fresh Venture Studio in collaboration with investing in  regenerative agriculture and food podcast.  Also the co-host of today, Koonfels Eijen is the host of this podcast.  My name is Bart van de Sonderen.  I'm the co-founder of Fresh Venture Studio and with Fresh, for those who don't know us  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:18):**  yet, we are on a mission to accelerate the transition to regenerative food system by  building multiple new steward-owned ventures from scratch.  And we organize a yearly four month program, inviting talented entrepreneurial people and  expert to find a co-founder, get a systemic understanding of a problem and do the early  stages of venture building.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:39):**  And we connect them to potential financiers and experts in the field.  We're currently actively looking also for applicants, but also always diving into what  are the actual questions we need to focus on.  What are the problems that we should focus on?  What are the technologies that might be interesting?  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:58):**  And as part of that, we organize events like this.  Before we get into it, I would actually want you also to share a little bit with us.  And also as part of the practicalities, you have the chat downstairs in the Zoom, and  I would like you to open it up right now and share with us who you are briefly.  And also if you would start a venture tomorrow and you would have the capital and the free  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:28):**  time, what would it be?  Do you have an idea that you think this is what we actually need right now if you want  to transition to regenerative food system?  Please share it in the chat.  I'll stop my sharing as well.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:40):**  Then you actually see my face.  Welcome everyone.  So please use the chat to introduce yourself.  Also during this event, if you have a question for our speakers or just a general remark  or you want to chip into the conversation, please use the chat as well to share your  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:00):**  question and then we will give you the stage to ask the question or say what you want to  say.  Also to get a sense of the people around you and not just listen to me and the other speakers,  we are going to start with a short breakout, which means that you will leave this room  and you will be put together with one other person.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:25):**  And we want you to share well, two things, who you are and what the mission is you are  personally working on.  Quickly get introduced to each other, see some different faces and get that activity  going.  We are all ready to go.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:42):**  Then I would like to ask Hup to start the going into breakout room.  So see you in two minutes.  Thank you.  Hi, Koon and Anna.  Welcome.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:24):**  It's a bit of an empty space right now because everyone is in a very brief breakout room  to get quickly introduced.  But they will be back in one or two minutes and then we will continue the event.  Maybe some people are already coming back.  We're going to repopulate this room in 30 seconds, I think.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:13):**  And then we will continue with the event.  But for those who just joined, welcome.  Most of the participants are now in a short breakout room to get introduced to the digital  neighbor next to you, I would say.  And we'll, I think we are closing down the breakout rooms right now.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:48):**  Welcome back for those that are rejoining.  Koon is back as well.  All right.  Just waiting for everyone to come back from the breakout rooms.  I hope you managed to get a short introduction and managed to meet someone in this room.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:33):**  Now you met one person.  We also want to give you a sense of what kind of people are in this meeting.  So we'll now do a very short poll.  And then if you can answer that, we get a bit of an understanding of what type of people  we have here.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:49):**  So please answer the poll.  There's no NGOs there Bart.  NGOs?  You're right.  You're right.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:03):**  Well, I'm entrepreneurial, so I say an entrepreneur.  That's great.  That's great.  Thank you, Yomart.  Thank you as well.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:12):**  I have a burning question to ask you, but we'll get to that during the Q and A. This  is also our way to skew the data, Yomart, not having NGOs and pushing everyone towards  entrepreneurial.  There's still a bunch of people that need to vote, but some people are a little bit  in doubt it seems.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:39):**  We will share the insights with you as well.  Maybe Hup we can share it.  We have, I think, six people that still need to answer, but then I think the idea is clear.  So the entrepreneurial background is dominant right now, but also quite a few have not found  it before and are looking to found.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:08):**  On the technical, we're a little bit in the middle, so we don't have a modern day Nikola  Tesla.  I was expecting at least one modern day Nikola Tesla today, but we don't have any.  But thank you everyone.  This gives a clear idea of who we are.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:28):**  I would like to move forward and introduce my cohost of the day, Koen van Steije.  Hi Koen.  Good afternoon.  Good morning.  I'm very happy to be standing where you are.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:39):**  Good morning.  Great to be back.  Koen is the, I will briefly introduce you Koen and then you can go ahead.  But Koen is the host of the podcast, Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  He has done a lot of interviews with the pioneers in the field and has probably one of the most  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:00):**  extensive networks and I think a good idea of what is happening in the space.  And recently he started up a series in specifically focusing on the role of technology.  Koen, how are you feeling?  I'm good.  I'm good.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:17):**  I'm always, I had a lot of technology focused discussions in the last days.  I'm excited, but yeah, also it's a very interesting topic ranging from clean meat or lab meat  to vertical farms to satellite remote sensing.  It's definitely heating up, which is great.  Maybe you can kick it off a little bit Koen also with sharing your insights as you've  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:42):**  been obviously having all those conversations.  What do you see happening and also what do you see that's missing and maybe also what  is being too much of a hype or overestimated a little bit?  I think that's an interesting insight as well.  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:00):**  So we, I mean, we've definitely with the podcast, I think we're at episode one 20 something  at the moment.  So we've had our share of people that are using technologies and we definitely always  discuss it, but obviously we always have a soil focus as well.  So it's often about farming, it's often about nutrient density, et cetera, but we decided  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:23):**  to do a specific series on what technologies are needed to get regenerative agriculture  to a landscape scale because we really felt that's missing.  We often talk about this farm and that farm and very rarely, unless you are working at  violent or at common land or some of the very few organizations that are doing groundwork  on a landscape or ecosystem scale.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:45):**  You very not very often talk about what is needed to get there, what is needed to do  a hundred thousand hectares or a million hectares, et cetera, et cetera.  And so we decided to do a series on that.  We got some support from the Grantham Foundation or the Grantham Foundation for Eclectic Climate  Opportunities.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:03):**  And they introduced us to Regrow.  So we have a beautiful bridge to Manao in a second, but what do we really want to explore  in that series?  And we're definitely still looking for insights.  It's an ongoing series that will be 10 episodes, potentially more like what technologies are  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:21):**  already being used or what is already ready.  I don't have a technology background.  I would probably not say I can change the light bulb, but probably do a bit more, but  I'm definitely not a PhD in computer science.  So I'm very interested in remote sensing and we discussed it with Regrow, with Anastasia,  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:36):**  one of the co-founders in that interview, like what's possible from space?  What can you follow from afar and why suddenly I see a lot of remote sensing companies coming  up?  How can we follow whole landscapes as they potentially transition to a more regenerative  practices and what's completely missing?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:51):**  So we do interviews also on the ground with, for instance, Commonland, who we just interviewed  on how do you calculate returns at a landscape scale?  And which to me, a return framework is also a technology.  We use a very wide definition of technology.  And I think what's very interesting is that we're in a moment where ECTC is raising more  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:10):**  money that we could have ever dreamed of.  Like the amount of money flowing into the space is honestly quite crazy.  But if you dig a bit deeper and ask that question, I think that's what's missing.  Like what of those technologies is actually helping farmers, lands towards landowners,  whoever is managing the land to make different decisions, very few of that is.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:30):**  So it's very much focused on not necessarily transitioning large acres or large pieces  of land into regenerative and more regenerative practices.  So I would always urge investors, I would always urge anybody wanting to work in a space  ask that question, is it helping to rebuild soil at scale or not?  And I think what's definitely, I wouldn't say overhyped, but a lot of things are focused  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:53):**  on technologies that in the grand scheme of things might not have the largest impact.  I had a lot of discussions on vertical farming the last few days.  I don't know why it came up.  But if you look at the calories we get out of the produce that can be grown in there  at the moment, I'm not saying it cannot scale.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:10):**  I'm not saying we cannot do other things in it, but it's mostly herbs, mostly salads,  mostly some tomatoes, et cetera.  It's a very small acreage, I think in the US it's a couple of percent of the agriculture  land we can ask Manon because for sure they did research on that.  So if we want to have a large impact on chemicals, on water use, we need to look at large broad  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:31):**  acre crops and we need to figure out what to do with rice, what to do with grain, what  to do with soy, et cetera.  So I'm very interested what's already possible.  I got some very interesting new, no teaser, but we've got some interesting new episodes  coming up of things of, okay, how do we bring this to a landscape scale?  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:47):**  Because I think we're ready, we're there, we have amazing examples of individual farms.  And now the question is, okay, what are we going to plant, where and why, and how can  technology help with that?  And how can we predict things?  How can we figure out where to plant the trees?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:02):**  And I think there's so much we can learn from that space, but most of it is directed at  things that at the end of the day don't help farmers to make transitions.  So I think that's an underlying, I would always push on, okay, is there, I mean, Robin O'Brien  of Replant Capital, quite a large investor in the space in the US, always asks the question,  is there a farmer on your board or in your team?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:23):**  And if not, then I would be worried.  So I think that's for all of us who didn't grow up on a farm and don't have that life  experience, definitely get close to it because otherwise you end up building things that  are just not so relevant in the space.  So I think that's a short overview.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:39):**  The series is only two episodes in, so we have a whole thing to discover.  We'll be doing webinars around it.  We'll do quite a bit.  So we're already at the beginning there, but of course we had discussions on technologies.  So I see Stefanie raised in the audience and we had discussions in the past on technology  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:54):**  and I'm always fascinated by it.  We're using it now to do this conference or this webinar, which would have been possible  a couple of years ago.  All right.  Thank you.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:06):**  I would like you to introduce Manal as well, but maybe a question and we can dive into  that into the Q&A because you're referencing, I think, to what extent the AgTech is actually  helping farmers.  I also would like to dive into sort of coming from the other side, the maybe technological  phobia from a very nature-based perspective and how can we integrate that a little bit  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:33):**  and what your vision is on that.  So maybe we can get into that during the Q&A because I think it's good also to get more  people involved.  Maybe you can give an introduction to Manal as well.  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:48):**  I'm very happy Manal is here.  I had the great pleasure to interact with Rie Groh in the past after a warm introduction  from Eric Smith of the Grantham Foundation.  He said, you absolutely have to talk to him.  And then I did that.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:02):**  So I was amazed of what's possible from space, from a distance, remote sensing and what is  not possible yet, but it was what we're very close in and she, Manal, has an amazing experience  more than 12 years into space, knows everything about remote sensing.  And so I think we're very lucky to have her here.  It's very early.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:18):**  So I'm also very happy she got up in California to be with us today.  So very warm welcome Manal and please introduce to whoever doesn't know Rie Groh, of course,  introduce yourself, but also Rie Groh and your fascination for tech in the regeneration  space.  Good morning, everyone.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:36):**  I don't know everything about remote sensing.  Let's start there at all.  I did spend a PhD trying to figure it out, but I can't claim that I know everything about  it.  Thank you for having me.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:48):**  Thank you, Akun and Bart for all of your efforts and for building a community and for always  asking the right questions and trying to start the conversation and make everyone think.  I really enjoyed the first fresh talk and super excited to be joining you on the second  one.  So as you mentioned, I'm based in California.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:07):**  It's almost eight o'clock.  It's not too early.  My name is Manal.  I am an agronomist with a PhD in remote sensing and precision ag.  I am the boots on the ground.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:20):**  It's so cool what you said, Koen.  And I totally relate to when you're trying to build a company and build a product that  speaks to farmers and in theory wants to make things easy.  It's just so important to make sure that, you know, you have real farmers on your team.  And I'm privileged and really honored to have our agronomy having real farmers, people that,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:40):**  you know, have to skip work for two days because they have to plan their cover crop, which  is pretty cool because that's the kind of feedback.  And that's how you test that.  What you're doing actually makes an impact.  So I'm the head of, global head of BD at Regrow.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:57):**  Regrow is a platform.  Our platform is on a mission to quantify and scale regenerative agriculture.  We work with the global agri-food companies and we're really keen and work towards enabling  farmers and companies and food processors and CPGs to become climate healers.  So adopting and promoting regenerative ag is something that is feasible and doable for  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:25):**  them.  Perhaps I'll start where you left, Koon, about the technology piece, about how it's important.  You know, regen ag, regenerative agriculture is this squishy status of people.  Am I an agerative agriculture?  Am I qualified to be considered that?  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:46):**  It's just, it's a little bit tricky, especially when it's hard to define success for you to  be like, okay, I check mark this, I did this for that purpose.  So that's always where the discussion with farmers start.  And I work on daily basis with growers and with co-ops, which are the closest people  to the farm that are thinking about how we can get that grower to see what can regenerative  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:14):**  agriculture do for them.  And the conversation always starts like, why do you want to adopt that practice?  What is your goal?  Are you trying to solve an erosion issue in your soil?  Are you trying to enhance your soil health?  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:25):**  Are you trying to counter for water lodging that happens on your field?  So it's so important to start with, I'm doing this practice for this purpose, because that's  how success can be defined.  And that's how you want to increase the adoption by showing that effect, by solving a real  problem and not, oh yeah, it's a hype and someone is paying me to do it.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:47):**  If we do it for the right reasons, it's going to be, it's going to exist longer and the  trend is going to increase.  So with that being said, around the region ag, the technology part is quite fascinating.  And I split the technology into two sectors, like what's happening on your farm.  There's all the technology of the planters, of the seeders, of the machinery that's on  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:10):**  your farm that are able to perform strip till, that are able to do seed placements between  your corn rows for cover crop.  That's a fascinating piece of the technology.  And growers and farmers, they have invested for not themselves maybe, but their co-op  have that machine that is available for them to use or to rent.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:35):**  So that's kind of the technology that's on the ground.  There's the machinery, there's the technology around the seeding, around the different generics  of seeds that works really well for certain climates.  And as I said, growers are connected.  They have farm management systems, they store that data, they have it saved.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:57):**  And on the other side, there's that technology that really plays a big role in region agriculture,  which is imagery, which is the capability to record an action that did not happen.  For example, if you did not till, if you went through your soybean rotation and corn and  beans and you did not do tillage, then that is a practice that could be detected by the  remote sensing, by the imagery.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:24):**  And we're talking about publicly available satellite imagery, the sentinels, the Landsat,  MODIS, different resolutions.  So having the technology that can detect those fields and monitor them over the time period  of your growing cycle, we're able to see through the imaging and say, okay, harvest has happened  and then calculate how much residue was left.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:50):**  And by that, we're able to say, okay, this farmer did actually the no-till practice.  So it's a technological capability, what a model called Optus, Operational Tillage Information  System.  It's a model that actually analyzed this time series of satellite imagery to produce this  kind of information.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:13):**  Was there a cover crop?  Was there the absence of a tillage practice?  So that's where the technology could also assist in making it easier for a grower to  document what they did, to verify their practices and to understand their management as well.  Another key component that I think is so important when I think about technology is the fact  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:38):**  that it's all connected.  And what does that mean?  And that's something at regrow that we're really, really passionate about.  And it's something that we've highlighted when we're talking region or even when we're  just talking about agronomy throughout the year, when we're trying to monitor your fields  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:55):**  or provide a nitrogen recommendation.  Is that information that is in your equipment?  Are we able, and this is a piece that we were able to solve with our platform, is you're  able to connect to that farm management system.  So let's say, on your John Deere equipment, you did the practice, you did the planting,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:17):**  you did document those activities as events.  Having the technology where you can log in, bring in that data and start at a point where  you're like, okay, I can start at a point where I'm showing all my practices for the  past five years.  So I can understand.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:39):**  That's where regrow comes and helps.  Now we can tell you what's your baseline, where you are today.  And that's what our technology by leveraging models like the DMDC, for example, denitrification  decarbonization model, it's a model that is able to quantify.  So quantify what is your carbon stock and what can happen in the future.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:04):**  So it runs scenario planning tool.  It shows this grower.  If you decide to adopt this practice, which could be like a cover crop practice or no-till  practice, this is the potential that you can sequester carbon in your field.  It's all connected.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:21):**  You do the practice and it's even historical practices.  They're all on your farm management system.  You connect that, you fill in the information automatically.  You don't have to do that.  Just connect via API, your farm, and you populate that information.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:37):**  And then you're able to understand, okay, where am I today?  Because the model does take into consideration your field, your climate, your soil, everything  about your own field to be able to assist you by giving you scenarios of what can happen  when you adopt this regenerative practice on your soil health, on your sequestration,  and how you can capture on that potential new revenue.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:05):**  What do you see missing the most?  Like what would you absolutely love if tomorrow morning suddenly with some kind of magic existed?  What I would love to see the most is not on the technology side.  I'd love the market to mature faster.  I'd like more support for growers.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:27):**  I deal with growers on a daily basis.  I work with them and they have a lot of questions.  Like there is no one solution fit all.  What I would like to see is more localized enablement.  When a grower wants to adopt a practice, he has a goal.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:45):**  He knows that this works for his soil type.  And he understands that this is better for him because they all want to build resilience.  They all want to be able to give their kids a chance for inheriting that farm and making  a business from it.  So our incentives are all aligned.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:00):**  It's just a matter of being resourceful of what would work for him.  How can the local infrastructure enable him to make that decision and answer all his questions  and be confident in like this makes sense and this does solve my problem.  So it's the conversation at the farmer level.  I'd like to see that more maturing and him being more enabled and knowledgeable.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:29):**  And on the technology side and the market side, I'd like to see more maturity of initiatives  that not just announcements of, yeah, we want to do this, we want to do that, but more plans  of how we're going to walk with our growers to get to that position where it makes sense  what they're doing.  They're being rewarded and all of that.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:57):**  So that's what I would like to see soon.  Great.  And anything very briefly, I know we're to transition, but what's overhyped the most  with you having been in this space for a bit and working with growers constantly?  Do you get annoyed by some tech crunch messages?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:16):**  Do you get annoyed by some announcements?  What is hyped too much with you in the tech space?  Many that's a conversation by itself.  You have to pick one?  If I have to pick one, the commitments, they get announced without an action plan.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:33):**  Like, great, we want to get a hundred thousand acre adopting a practice that makes sense.  Great.  I love these conversations.  How?  And that has been the driver of, for us at Regrow to build what we can build, which is  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:48):**  the scale.  So yeah, we try to solve the most annoying questions, which is how do I get that?  And that's what our purpose is to bring scale to regenerative ag and for that adoption.  Great.  Thank you so much.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:04):**  I think Brett is going to step in now.  Well, we'll dive, it's indeed it's time, which is too bad because I think we can dive into  this for the whole session actually, but we'll do that also.  And thank you everyone for sharing the questions already and keep them coming.  We'll get back to that right after we've introduced Wouter as well.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:25):**  Yeah.  Hello Wouter.  Wouter Swachamaker, he's, I think originally an engineer.  Wouter became more of a venture builder actually and a business developer throughout his career  and he's now active for the seaweed company and they're focusing on well, valorizing all  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:46):**  the possibilities with seaweed, regenerating both the oceans, but also using that to help  regenerate the soil, which is an interesting connection, I think between the ocean and  land.  I won't share any more on the seaweed company, I'm quite enthusiastic also about what you  do, but I would like to give you the stage Wouter and share a little bit more about yourself  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:12):**  and what you guys do as well.  Yeah, thanks a lot Bart and everyone.  Great initiatives to be here and happy to share something on the seaweed company and  the work we're doing and actually where many other people can help us with.  And as you introduced already, I have some experience, some perfect experience in the  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:33):**  past and, but actually feel we're in the moment that we have to valorize more of our natural  resources to actually create more wins, actually seek solutions where you can create exponential  wins.  So not per se exponential growth, but wins.  And I found that personally into seaweeds and actually before me, some other people  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:57):**  already found that and they found it the seaweed company.  And that's why I want to talk to you about.  So I have a couple of slides.  I want to walk you through, give some background where we're at and happy to answer any questions  that are later on.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:14):**  So I will share my screen.  And actually it starts with capturing the value of seaweed because that's the mission.  We believe there's more value into seaweeds than we've seen so far.  And actually if you like seaweeds like us, you understand that there's a huge end-depth  potential actually in something like seaweeds, not very much known in this part of the world,  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:47):**  this part being Europe or maybe US, but actually it can have a lot of impact.  Ocean restoration, it can help coastal communities.  It can help health and wellbeing, but also sustainable farming.  And especially the sustainable farming part is something I'd like to share more about  today.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:08):**  Because what's the seaweed company?  The seaweed company actually was founded three years ago from the belief that some new industries  need to be arise.  And actually we started with a unique approach, looking at a vertical integrated company.  So if you look at the moment at the seaweed company, after three years, we own and operate  
**[0:32:31-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:31):**  four farms globally, Morocco, India, Ireland, where we create a sustainable traceable biomass  flow.  And on the other hand, we turn them into products and make sure we actually generate awareness  for the demand of seaweeds.  Again, there's a huge potential for products, but we decided we have to choose right.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:57):**  And we have to choose the right ones in order to get the traction and get the market running  also.  What our belief is, and this is a small background into seaweeds, there are about more than 10,  20,000 species of seaweeds, but you can classify them in three big categories, green, red,  and brown.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:23):**  And actually it can be seen as a commodity and you can extract stuff from it and it's  a commodity, but the combination of it is where huge value and potential is in.  And this is what we believe.  A concept that we recently joined and where we believe we can create the awareness for  seaweeds is something unique that we as a vertical integrated company can actually bring  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:52):**  to market.  And we call that our blue farming approach.  The interesting thing about using seaweeds and utilizing them and utilizing the bioactive  ingredients into the seaweeds is that you can create great products that do great things  that generate exponential winds.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:15):**  And in this sense, we can combine the creation of products like a bio stimulant, our top  health plants products that the farmer can use for their lands, help them reduce fertilizer,  make sure the water holding capacity of the fields increase and increases the biotic and  abiotic stresses of the plants with the natural product that actually in a previous life has  also regenerated the oceans and created jobs.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:49):**  So it's actually almost our blue farming approach, we try to position it also as a, as a, as  a exponential wind, help a farmer make a step on the sustainable farming ladder and on the  other hand, restore oceans.  And we have a range of products, I just explained about the bio stimulant, but we also have  some animal feed products, for example, for chicken, chicken can be co-fed with some natural  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:19):**  seaweed supplements.  And actually those seaweed supplements prove to yield better health for the chicken, have  less meat rejection for the, for the farmer and the farmer needs to use less antibiotics.  So the same thing you actually see on happening to the soil for the bio stimulant, we can  make sure we can see happening with animals and increasing the life, the wellness of animals.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:51):**  And as such, we believe we're seeing this potential and the first direction we see with  the farmers we work with is that we have to set emissions also in this area.  So we believe, for example, in Europe, in the next years, we can make sure half a million  to a million farmers actually understand the power of seaweeds and how they can use them  to make a step on the regenerative ladder and become more sustainable.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:22):**  We can improve animal health and life, we can regenerate lands and in the same time,  we mitigate climate impacts, recreate jobs and actually strengthen coastal ecosystems.  So this is an interesting story about seaweeds that which is, I think I couldn't mention  it, landscapes and seascapes.  So it's a real rich story and we're really proud that we work with a couple of farmers.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:49):**  We work with a couple of big companies that actually want to embrace the benefits of this.  Interesting and this is maybe another view on our company is where does the technology  come into play into the seaweed phase at the moment?  And to make it to make it easy, I would like to mention three areas.  And the three areas, I have a couple of examples to give you a sense where is the technology  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:20):**  level at the seaweed company, for example, or the seaweed industry as a whole.  And that comes into play and this is pretty logical, mainly marine biology.  Understanding how seaweeds grow.  For example, here Dr. Stephen Cran, one of the founders of the company in the R&D lab  in Ireland, understanding how the life cycle of astral gases grows and how we can make  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:46):**  sure that we can do next year harvest even better than this year.  This is marine biology.  Another word, tech and engineering.  I mean growing seaweeds, harvesting seaweeds requires quite a bit of tech.  It might seem like relatively low tech, but it hasn't been done before.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:11):**  So for example, on the left hand side, we went to United Project where we actually grow  seaweeds 14 kilometers out of the coast in Scheveningen in the Netherlands.  Something which is a pioneering project, never has been done before.  Growing seaweeds in an ocean with 15, 20 meter waves high.  This is stuff we're pioneering.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:34):**  We're also pioneering in solutions like how do you kind of automate, improve the efficiency  of the seeding and harvesting.  And the last word of tech, and maybe in this sense, tech is not really high tech, but it's  I think like Coon described, it's a, yeah, you can look at it broadly, is a biotech.  And this understanding of the bioactive components of the true value that are in products.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:04):**  So over here you see, for example, the bio stimulants.  How do we make sure that we use, for example, the right seaweed extract with some additions  and some other seaweeds that can actually bring those exponential benefits you would  like to see.  Also the natural feed supplements, for example, for our poultry.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:25):**  We have the experience and the expertise with our science team to make sure that we kind  of make the blends that actually do not only bring the health and wellbeing benefits, but  also make sure we can increase food conversion ratios by which the business case can also  work for the farmers.  And this is also a very important part of the tech.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:45):**  It might not be really hardcore tech, but it's really science tech.  And as such, I hope you have a bit of a glance of what we're doing at the seaweed company.  And I'd like to close off with something what we all can do.  Let's be an ambassador for something like seaweeds.  Let's be a consumer to make sure demand is picking up or let's be a farmer that actually  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:15):**  embraces the fact that bio stimulants based on natural products can help you make a step  into sustainable agriculture.  So I hope you get a sense of seaweeds, the seaweed company and the work we're doing.  So thank you very much for your attention.  Thank you, Mauter.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:36):**  If you can.  Yeah.  Like, thank you very much.  I think very interesting and we got some questions in the chat as well.  And I want to, we're going to open up the stage for multiple questions and also getting  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:52):**  back to some of the questions that were asked to Manal and some of the questions that people  had for you, Mauter, and I have a few as well.  So for everyone, if you want to jump in, please feel free.  But someone that I want to introduce first and also give the stage for a question is  Jan Marte Droz.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:13):**  He's working for Leiland, but maybe Jan Marte, you can introduce yourself.  You had a question for Manal and yeah, I also have some questions with you, but maybe you  can, you can introduce yourself a little bit and then ask your question you had for Manal  and then we'll get back to the questions for you about it as well.  You're muted Jan Marte.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:39):**  I did turn on my video, though.  Thanks Bart.  Thanks Koon.  Thanks Manal for your explanation on regrow.  You mentioned the DNDC as one of the tech options out there that can help farmers in  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:56):**  their journey towards regeneration.  I'm involved in a pilot project together with the Dutch agri-lander Rabobank looking at  carbon farming or actually stimulate regenerative agriculture through carbon payments, as we  now agreed to frame it.  The partnership is not yet public, but we are working behind the scenes to do baselines  
**[0:42:28-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:28):**  and to find models that are appropriate, that are sensitive to regenerative technologies,  which is not easy to find.  And DNDC was on our shortlist, but we actually decided to pull the plug because it requires  very detailed spatial and temporal data in order to come up with modeling results.  So my question is, do you have examples of working with DNDC in a farmer friendly way?  
**[0:43:04-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:04):**  And if not, or if so, are there any other options out there that provide reliable estimation  of emission reductions that can be done based on existing data or simple queries?  Sorry for the background noises.  My kids all woke up, so a disclaimer.  Thank you for your question, John, and for exploring, working with models similar to  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:40):**  the DNDC.  When it comes to modeling, it's this catch-22.  You want a model that requires all these inputs, so you understand the right environmental,  the social, the weather, the soil, the environment, what kind of microbes you have.  So you do need all these inputs so you can understand what is the environment and how  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:01):**  favorable it is to sequester, under what condition, under what practices.  So it's good that the model require input.  At the same time, it's painful that the model requires input.  And I think that's the problem that we're solving, is where is that information?  How can we make it from a user perspective super friendly?  
**[0:44:23-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:23):**  And I will share with you what our current project with a project developer here in the  US, we're working with them and they're using our regrow platform.  So their growers, for example, have a lot of their information about what kind of fertilizer  they used, what was the cropping cycle for the past five years, when they planted, what  did they harvest, what was the amount of yield that they got.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:51):**  All of that information is in their farm management system.  So connecting to that farm management system helps us answer automatically all of the questions  related to the agronomical practices.  Then by connecting to data sources similar to the prism, the weather data sources or  the soil type, publicly available data sources that can answer a good chunk of the inputs  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:18):**  around the environment, the soil, the weather, and all of that.  So the two pieces of information need to exist.  It is a model that requires knowing about what has happened, what have been your practices,  to be able to understand where you are today and how much you can sequester.  The best thing or the best approach of it is where does this data exist?  
**[0:45:43-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:43):**  Great.  It is on your farm management system.  Let's connect to it.  Let's get it.  So we're able to run these simulations with minimum interaction.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:53):**  In addition to the DNDC, we run, for example, Optus, the operational tillage information  system, which is using the satellite and the remote sensing to fill out gaps, previous  gaps in the data around if a cover crop was available, if a tillage practice has been  performed.  So along with the combination of those three sources of data, you're able to cover what  
**[0:46:17-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:17):**  does the DNDC need to run.  And I'm happy to share more examples with, I'll probably drop in a link for resources  for all of you guys to go check out a couple of videos and some workflows that are very  farmer friendly.  And it's what our farmers are using to enroll on some programs here in the US.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:41):**  Thank you.  Thank you Manal.  Maybe to follow up with that, and that's partly what I want to ask you as well, Jaumeit.  You're talking about combining a lot of data as well and integrating with what is already  there, but also introducing new data.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:58):**  And I think, Jaumeit, I heard you say in a different podcast also, raising the question,  maybe you can elaborate on it if I'm not saying it correctly, but who is owning the data and  to what extent are farmers owning the data they produce or where does it land in this  well developing space also in getting this knowledge.  So Jaumeit, if you don't want to extend on that, maybe Manal, you can answer already.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:26):**  No, I can't.  Yeah, I'm here.  No, there's, so there's, after I did the podcast, I got a lot of feedback from farmers, from  tech people and from everybody in between.  For me, tech and agriculture is new-ish.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:50):**  I used to work with Solidarity.org working on sustainable value chains, and it had set  up a digital unit.  But especially in development space, you work with farming communities that have very little  access to data and even issues like literacy or basic stuff like power and IT devices is  already a challenge there.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:17):**  Coming to the Netherlands and working with Vailand, I was surprised about the enormous  amounts of data that are collected by the machines that Manal referred to that are collected  using remote sensing through social media, etc.  But for all or the majority of these tech companies, and then I mean both IT tech companies  and engineering tech companies, it seems that the farmer becomes more and more a business  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:47):**  model rather than a client or a partner.  It's I find it staggering to see how little access farmers have to data regardless of  whether it's their own data or it's somebody else's data.  There's an NGO, it translates into a bull nature, it translates into farmer and data  that has recently been set up in Netherlands to address this issue because also regulators,  
**[0:49:14-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:14):**  the Ministry of Agriculture, for example, are not even aware that the way agricultural  companies control and use these data and limit the access of the data to the farmers themselves  is a problem at all.  On the other hand, the farmers can do relatively little with a huge heap of terabytes of data.  So it requires interfaces, it requires analysis, it requires support, and it's just I think  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:47):**  another service industry that is developing around the farming community in order to make  sense out of this data.  But my analysis is that the farmers' interest is not put first in designing the systems  that govern these data.  The public stakeholders, I think, are failing to provide such a thing, leave it to the private  
**[0:50:09-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:09):**  sector and the private sector by definition is more driven by profit or by their own benefits.  And I think this is a serious impediment for regenerative agriculture because the stuff  we do is highly data intensive.  We need to monitor things, we have very tailor-made specific interventions in specific locations  so not all farmers are the same and in order to get to restore values and at the same time  
**[0:50:41-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:41):**  reap profit from a farm, you need really top-notch knowledge and intelligence and technology.  So I think open space, farmer-owned and controlled and privacy-proof systems are required and  there needs to be, well, attention in the public space and with government and civil  society stakeholders that this is not something we should leave to the big agri-tech companies.  Otherwise the same thing will happen that happened to GMOs 20 years ago, it was shunned  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:23):**  by the public, it was shunned by the NGOs, it was shunned by the governments, it was  left to the private sector and you could argue whether they created the Frankenstein but  they definitely did not create a farm-refers technology with GM.  Maybe Manal, you would like to, I'm very curious what your views are as well in this.  Very good points, Jarmatine.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:52):**  What I would like to add is or emphasize and echo what you were saying around these kinds  of practices to see the effect on the soil, it takes time.  You do the practice, you start seeing its effect on your soil and being able to quantify  it and feel it 10 years, 15 years from now and you need to take measurements to see how  much you are sequestering, how much your soil activity is or how your baseline is at  
**[0:52:18-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:18):**  the moment.  So it is data intensive and understanding that the purpose of capturing that data is  one to document and report on your advancement, your success so you could be rewarded accordingly  and it's also needed for you to understand and find the practices that actually did make  an impact on you.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:45):**  So it's answering your question and it's also answering the questions for the market for  you to be able to sell something which is for example your carbon sequestration potential.  So the purpose behind the data is to enable you, the grower, it should be owned by the  grower.  The models are at a point where they could be farm specific so we're asking you about  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:07):**  what you did just the past five years, how's your own soil, your own amendments, what you've  been doing on your farm and this is all meant for you to make a better choice.  That is the perspective of that data is for you to know what is the best thing for you  to what kind of practices would work best for your soil, what kind of practice will  give you the best financial potential and then the data come in to show that you have  
**[0:53:33-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:33):**  done that practice.  So the purpose of the data is to assist the grower and I think there's a huge role as  you mentioned Jean-Martin around what does the public sector, rules and regulations around  that but it's definitely something that we are very keen and passionate about.  Our grower first perspective of this technology, his privacy, his data and bringing value to  
**[0:54:03-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:03):**  him.  Thank you Manal, I'm speeding up a little bit.  I really feel that this is in a broader sense maybe a subject we can dive in separately  as well and we can continue to do so after the summer.  Maybe there's probably a lot to build there as well.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:21):**  I wanted to ask Vauter one more question before I ended up as well.  We had a question for you actually from Andrew S. Kaller.  Did you already answer it in the chat Vauter or not?  I answered one I believe but I'm not sure.  I'll follow up with a question maybe a little bit more relevant in this context and maybe  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:47):**  we cannot fully answer it but it's a question also to dive into.  As you said we're pioneering a lot of new things and we're trying to get technology  to help us there.  Because it can be a chicken and an egg right?  You need the technology to make it the business case work.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:06):**  On the other hand the business case isn't working so the technology might not have a  business case.  How do you look at driving technological advancements in such a pioneering space as the one you're  active in?  It's a good question and I think maybe two answers which pop into my mind now.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:28):**  One is just go and do stuff step by step on the one hand.  Just make small steps yourself with the company you can do to get your incremental results  learn from it and see what happens and the other is team up.  Actually the majority of the work actually going into the sewage field as I described  for example that United project in the North Sea it can only work because you cover it  
**[0:55:56-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:56):**  together with other parties in the space.  It's only then that usually these products get funded by public money or sometimes even  private investors.  So you have to team up there and in that sense if I look at our company we try to be a vertically  integrated company but still we do not do everything ourselves.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:18):**  We also need to partner there and that's the vision we do have.  Understand the total chain but work together on all these areas where you need to work  together and also orchestrate that together.  Well that the developments can advance where they need to.  So on one hand just go do it make incremental steps and learn and team up together.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:43):**  Really important.  All right thank you.  Thank you very much.  I think this is also an interesting topic to dive into someone referred to.  I'm not sure if it's relevant here but like the big challenges for example as has been  
**[0:56:59-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:59):**  done with the solar race where student teams are sort of used to drive a technology that  is not yet feasible that cannot be used yet but find different ways to sort of moonshot  technologies and drive and for it was an interesting as well.  But thank you for your additions.  I think we are it's always just one hour that we that we're having here which is feels a  
**[0:57:23-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:23):**  little bit too short but do you have any final remarks or things you wanted to add?  To share before I go to thank our speakers.  Yeah I mean I think we just literally pun definitely intended scratch the surface.  I mean there are some great questions of of harness for smallholder farmers.  I think there's a lot happening there.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:42):**  Anything from processing do it yourself or open source systems all the way up to you  how to design systems at scale but also Glenn was asking something on soil health and also  their technology is playing a big role but also a big role but obviously and things are  coming in terms of carbon measurement I'll put it in the link but also simply observing  and helping to observe your land and and do simple soil health tests which give a lot  
**[0:58:06-0:58:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:06):**  of power back to the farmer and we've done an interview with Abby Rose with on that quite  a few years ago that have used technology to help farmers to start observing their souls  much more with very simple things like things that everyone can do even if you have issues  with a light bulb but most farmers don't because they keep their equipment running all the  time so I think that the term of technology in agriculture is just incredibly wide so  
**[0:58:32-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:32):**  yeah an hour if we go from seaweed to to satellites there's there's everything is there in between  so naturally we only scratch the surface so this begs the question of a lot more of these  conversations.  Yeah all right well thank you and maybe to continue with that and we are at the end but  we're trying to host more of these conversations obviously Coon is doing a lot of interviews  
**[0:58:58-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:58):**  zooming in to specific questions here so I always recommend following the podcast but  we're going to host multiple conversations where we have only have conversations and  Q&A I would say and zoom in on multiple questions we'll try to do it on a monthly basis so if  you like to continue the conversation with us please follow us on LinkedIn or find other  ways I will make sure to follow up this meeting as well and share the the stream so you can  
**[0:59:28-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:28):**  you can watch it back or share it with other people when you want to.  For now I really want to thank Wouter and Manal for sharing their stories and also Jan  and Härte for dropping in from from Nylon so thank you very much I hope we we see you  again and wish you good luck also I hope you succeed because then I think we all succeed  so thank you thank you very much for your presence and Manal enjoy your day which is  
**[0:59:58-1:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:58):**  starting so thank you for those that want to stick around for a few minutes to to ask  some questions maybe to us feel free but the the speakers will leave us in a bit and yeah  thanks everyone for being here as well so always a weird ending digitally but you're  welcome have a great day bye bye you too bye bye all right  If there are people that want to ask us something maybe maybe I'm not sure about if you want  
**[1:00:41-1:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:41):**  to stick around maybe maybe you want to join the conversation but we usually keep the room  open a little bit for those that want to yeah I'm looking to download the chat the meeting  chat yeah okay I think it's yeah it's part of the stream it's part of the stream but  oh perfect okay well thanks guys enjoy your afternoon and evening  yeah thank you bye bye  
**[1:01:10-1:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:10):**  Gunnar are we going to dive into all these questions I can now understand why you have  always multiple podcast questions that you can dive into make a podcast when we did it  when we did the ask me anything where it's like an hour and I just try to plow through  as many fun content as possible and usually yeah we get somewhere there and never never  there because it's just an endless one so it's it's yeah every question raises more  
**[1:01:43-1:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:43):**  questions which is which is fine because it makes sense  Oh someone has a question I think Glenn raised his hand I can see well hi Glenn oh hi hi  hi guys really good to finally meet you I've been listening to all your podcasts for such  a long time and thinking oh yeah I've got to go reach out one day here's my opportunity  we're tackling the project so the problem the bigger regenerative agricultural problem  
**[1:02:07-1:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:07):**  in a different slide it's slightly different sort of way so we're at the carbon farm based  in jersey in the channel islands and we actually farm carbon as a living that's what we do  so currently we're working on a farm jersey hemp and we're transitioning them into regenerative  agriculture and the way we do that is we produce biologically complete compost understand what  the state of their soil health is and the soil succession is and then we improve that  
**[1:02:34-1:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:34):**  soil succession to suit what they their plants need to grow and then we see that their plants  increase photosynthesis capability and the transfer of co2 into soil carbon exponentially  because hemp is a is a plant of sequestration significance it can it can pull down about  30 tons per hectare per year which is probably two to three times more than any tree can  do and we can measure this and what we're doing is we're entering that into the blockchain  
**[1:03:05-1:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:05):**  and we're issuing carbon credits on behalf of business on behalf of farmers to business  offsets and paying farmers to farm carbon so we're literally walking them through the  transition of regenerative farming and measuring it independently for them and entering it  into the carbon markets  grateful great to finally meet and and i definitely have to dive into it yeah it's quite a bit  
**[1:03:33-1:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:33):**  about hemp etc but obviously i haven't and we have not done anything on fibers i think  so far so yeah well we're using we're using hemp predominantly as a viral mediation crop  so that has been used like that yeah so it's a great way of regenerating soils for trees  and we're you know we the tree loss is obviously a lot less if you proceed it with hemp and  yeah it's we're finding then when you can actually move the soil succession to suit  
**[1:04:07-1:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:07):**  the plants and becoming more fungal as you get towards trees and you balance your microbiome  around the roots then the plants can actually deposit a lot more stable soil carbon into  the you know into the soils which can be measured and then you know offset  amazing now i think there's a lot to discover or to to figure out and you know how to speed  up these processes how to speed up agroforestry processes how to bring down the failure rate  
**[1:04:37-1:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:04:37):**  of trees and and all of that because it's a it's definitely holding back and holding  back the agroforestry pledges that we've seen around so i put up one of the questions you  know maybe we ought to start looking looking more at natural systems rather than technology  in one of the chat things i think technology is definitely something that's going to come  along and it needs to come along desperately but at the moment it's actually quite easy  
**[1:05:02-1:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:02):**  to do the measurements without technology so for example soil organic matter that can  be measured soil carbon you can figure out what the soil carbon levels are and you can  see whether they're increasing or falling the other measurements is of course the soil  health so we can do the elanigums soil food web analytics and work out where the fungal  bacteria ratios are which relate to the plants can you do it here as well is it is it oh  
**[1:05:31-1:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:05:31):**  yeah costly at a few thousand hectares or um or what's your feeling there so we've got  we've got a young lab tech who actually is at university at warrick university and she's  at the moment doing comparisons between elanigums counts and a dna count so we're actually seeing  for the first time what the you know the differences are a human count comes in at you know a very  reasonable price the same cost as you know any chemical analysis um obviously a dna count  
**[1:06:03-1:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:03):**  is going to come at five six seven hundred pounds or whatever ridiculous um so it'll  be interesting to see the comparison you don't know yet like i don't know yet okay that's  going to be interesting it will be interesting um but just to give you an idea we're we're  bringing in we're doing soil sampling um we're doing sort of like a package for about 75  pounds which will do a total carbon that's including the microbial carbon um and that's  
**[1:06:31-1:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:31):**  that's sort of affordable but it's still quite expensive for a farmer um but you know that  can be that can be accounted through the carbon offsets anyway yeah no definitely i mean i  see we just recorded an episode i mean some people are selling obviously to to the front  runners like stripe etc who are actively in the market for let's say the experimental  stuff the biochar the enhanced weathering potentially hemp i don't know if you're selling  
**[1:06:56-1:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:06:56):**  to them as well so there's definitely a moment in in time now where you can finance some  of this through carbon credits to not not crazy amounts but definitely crazy amounts  per ton and to to kick start a lot of this and the others will follow is is the the current  thinking but of course we don't know if we're in a bubble of carbon credits at the moment  but definitely there's a lot of money out there so i think it's yeah the the uk government  
**[1:07:22-1:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:22):**  is doing quite a major area a deal with this so i know they put out this thing the other  day um that uh if businesses don't submit their esgs i think i heard it on your one  of your podcasts if they don't businesses don't submit their esgs alongside their tax  returns then they're less likely to get a government to a contract um and that was but  that would be interesting yeah so um and that follows through to investments that banks  
**[1:07:48-1:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:07:48):**  make as well so banks have to submit all of the investments they make um and what their  environmental strategies are and again if they all line up then the government is going  to support them if they don't then they won't get the government support which is now opening  up the market so that now we're finding um big emitters um are now seeking ways of offsetting  so the obvious the low hanging fruit of the farmers of course we're just going to get  
**[1:08:12-1:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:12):**  the measurements in place to do it absolutely and the standardization and the double counting  sometimes and i mean but there's yeah there's a lot moving there i'm i should i'm talking  to strive to get them on the podcast here to explore that more their leading role as  okay as one of these players so the way we do it just to really i know i'm taking up  a lot of time which i apologize for but so the way we do it is through the blockchain  
**[1:08:39-1:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:08:39):**  um so you know the the carbon coming from top from bottom up you know the carbon goes  through a methodology um which is accepted by the uk carbon code um and then that goes  off for verification and certification um and then you get a dark green carbon credit  um or a light green carbon credit so a light green carbon credit would be a lower value  carbon credit which say accounts for trees um or if you want a dark green carbon credit  
**[1:09:07-1:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:07):**  that would actually account that would go to a local regenerative farmer who's um a  signed up on the regenerative organic certification so that means he's he's not using any chemicals  um you know soil health animal health and people health are top of the level um and  then it's just very simple um doing the the total carbon audits and the soil food web  super interesting things that don't worry about taking time super interesting stuff  
**[1:09:33-1:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:09:33):**  sorry about it i think it's great this is so there are no rules here so uh anyone can  step in and agree that you did i also wonder um with i mean you're you say you do the you  use the blockchain right but it's also about it's mainly about the input in the blockchain  so the blockchain make sure that uh it's controlled and certified but you can still um input or  lie i would say with with the input you're doing on on the amount of carbon that you're  
**[1:10:07-1:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:07):**  actually storing how does it work for you you shed a little bit on how you measure it  but what is the control mechanism actually in making sure that the carbon that you say  you are sequestering is actually happening yeah that's a really good question and this  is one of the things that we've been um we've been tackling them quite hard and i heard  one of the um one of the statements came up in the earlier discussions about you know  
**[1:10:33-1:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:10:33):**  the farmer um actually being control in control of the measurements or understanding the measurements  or something we find that is where your double accounting will really start to cause problems  so the way the carbon farm has positioned itself is to actually work with the farmer  as an independent auditor but we also guide them through the regenerative transition if  you see what i mean so you know what we do is the with their three tests we four tests  
**[1:11:02-1:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:02):**  we really do we do the the biologicals through an independent soil food web lab tech we do  chemistry looking for the total soil carbon we do that through an independent um recognized  laboratory in the uk um we do physical which the farmer tends to do themselves so that's  water infiltration um and the soil parameters but the the fourth one we do which i think  is the key to it is the um the practices of the farmer so and the way that's done is what  
**[1:11:35-1:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:11:35):**  is their certification so if their certification is um conventional um i know certification  then they can't even enter onto the scheme if it's organic they can enter onto the scheme  um but then there are certain parameters like tillage if they do that or um use of certain  chemicals you know coppers or sulfates or things like that then they would obviously  that would knock knock them off uh knock certain points off but if they're regenerative organic  
**[1:12:01-1:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:01):**  certificate um in other words soil health people health and animal health are key to  it and they um they obviously have to go through their accreditation to get the regenerative  organic that solves that problem um and then we just measure it through as i say those  measurements which i gave you know those different parameters of biological chemical and physical  data sets i think that's also what we just discussed with the satellites and uh because  
**[1:12:29-1:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:29):**  that's maybe potentially because you said we don't need that much of technology and  i think it's it's good to start with with what nature is actually doing and try to have  technology in a supporting role but maybe for example in seeing what is we zoom in on  the practices for example using satellite data on seeing what has actually been done  on a farm is that something you you see as potentially helpful for example yeah we use  
**[1:12:55-1:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:12:55):**  we use satellites we currently use satellites but we can only allocate a light green carbon  credit if through satellite data um so in other words you know if if the offsetter doesn't  want to go for the higher value carbon offsets you know where we're talking above uh 25 30  pounds a unit um if they only want to spend about five pounds a unit or whatever um then  we'll use satellite data because it's it's relatively cheap to do that um the cost is  
**[1:13:24-1:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:24):**  in the measurements as you've just quite rightly alluded to so if if the if the client comes  to us and say they want light green carbon credits that's absolutely fine we can do that  we can send a satellite over and measure it um but that tends to be for carbon credits  that are um not local so that's if someone wants to grow trees in south america or something  like that um and obviously there's all the um you know all the problem problems that  
**[1:13:50-1:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:13:50):**  could be associated with that with climate change obviously the trees can burn down or  there could be political problems or all the rest of it so it attracts a much lower value  carbon credit but for a local carbon credit you know higher value where you get all the  um the added bonuses you know food security biosecurity water security then that attracts  a much higher carbon credit our carbon unit yeah all right yeah cool i wanted to i'm not  
**[1:14:19-1:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:19):**  sure if kun if you still have time to stick around normally we we keep it open for about  uh 15 to 30 minutes i think it's i would like to continue the conversation a little bit  but also invite maybe the people that are sticking around if they want to say something  sure i can't i can't stay much longer but i'm very happy to answer as many questions  to the camera i've got this great opportunity you guys have set up like and now great to  
**[1:14:43-1:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:14:43):**  have you i think uh yeah i see that josepe who's in the yes as well i'd like to connect  with you glenn hi uh good to meet you and thanks kun and uh and barth for setting this  up and glenn very interesting so i'm responsible at the live kindly collective which is a collective  of plant-based meat alternative companies um produce plant-based meat alternatives and  we're also have an agriculture division where we implement regenerative agriculture and  
**[1:15:14-1:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:14):**  uh putting in place a system to generate carbon credits and we recognize all the complexities  but glenn it's interesting you mentioned sort of the measurement is not the issue and i  just wondered how do you deal with how do you prove permanence of the carbon credit  that seems an issue that we i mean we're also combining these different you know remote  sensors local sensors local samples putting that into models and machine learning but  
**[1:15:44-1:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:15:44):**  that still proves you know it's still a multivariate problem with a lot of variables that interact  together so i just wondered how you deal with that issue and yeah and then related to that  which which credit agency is actually you're working with that it's actually issuing the  carbon credits yeah really good questions there um thanks for asking them so permanence  is just a matter of time um if you look at if carbon is a is a farmer's bank account  
**[1:16:10-1:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:10):**  um soil organic matter is their current account in other words it comes in and goes out but  soil carbon is their deposit account so the longer they can actually keep their soil organic  matter levels up and the biodiversity the soil biodiversity is is is suitable to what  the plants requires then the stable soil carbon will start to accumulate and you can you can  measure that over a period of time so that's pretty straightforward um the other side of  
**[1:16:37-1:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:16:37):**  permanence is what you do with the biomass the above ground carbon if that carbon is  is sent off for um i don't know uh incineration worst case scenario then that would go as  a negative um but if it's um if it's composted or um you know made into hempcrete which is  what we do a lot with our biomass then obviously that locks it up and that acts as a positive  um so that's the way we deal with permanence um as regards to which um which group we work  
**[1:17:09-1:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:09):**  with we use the uk carbon code um so that one you know what that is is set up the um  the template for uh farmers or um consultants like us to actually use um we have actually  improved the the basic carbon code so we've we've almost done a fork on the carbon code  to create a much more um concise you know for whatever the context of the farm is um  to suit that farm so depending on what that farm is growing um we can we can change that  
**[1:17:43-1:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:17:43):**  carbon code just slightly to to basically support the farmer so at the end of the day  the whole point is the farmer farms carbon um and initially if it's difficult for them  to cover the cost the business i work for the carbon farm will cover the costs initially  until ecosystem services cut in and then the costs reduce dramatically to the farmer um  so that they can then start issuing the carbon credits on their own on their own behalf okay  
**[1:18:10-1:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:10):**  thank you i have a bit of a follow-up question if you still have time or at least the thing  that i'm struggling with a little bit and i wonder all of you what you think but um  it's also when you start measuring right so it's about the the amount of carbon that you  actually harvest but correct me if i'm wrong so if you want to you're already doing a great  job you almost have like you did a perfect job for like maybe indigenous uh indigenous  
**[1:18:39-1:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:18:39):**  people having a huge area that is perfectly holding the carbon already that is not incentivized  and then by capturing it can we sort of define like this is this is the amount of carbon  that that should be this area should be capable of of holding and you are already having like  30 so that's that's good good and then you can you can add up to it is it yeah yeah so  i'll tell you how we do it um it's it's not actually fixed and we haven't come up with  
**[1:19:12-1:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:12):**  um we haven't we haven't pushed this towards the uk carbon code but we've talked to them  a bit about it and offer and ask them whether they'd accept it but it's just a thought it's  just something we're throwing out there and it's open for discussion and you know it's  open there to be you know cut down basically um but the uk has some really tight figures  on this so um back in the 1700s soil organic matter was around 30 atmospheric um co2 was  
**[1:19:41-1:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:19:41):**  around 240 parts per million um in 2021 soil organic matter was three percent and atmospheric  carbon is uh what 420 parts per million so it's obviously soil is a major contributor  to the whole climate change initial issue um so we're using three percent as our baseline  um and then we're also looking at the biology um so there's no point in having say five  percent soil carbon or so you know sort of carbon but actually have no life in the soil  
**[1:20:10-1:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:10):**  um because that indicates that the cat the the the farmer might have been putting down  loads of manure but also following it up with glycerate or something like that um so if  the soil carbon levels are anything above three percent and there's a really good healthy  soil food web um present then we believe that farmers should be entitled to some um you  know compensation and that's something that isn't recognized now right so you're lobbying  
**[1:20:38-1:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:20:38):**  for that yeah yeah so um where we are here in jersey is we're part of the uk but we're  not um so we have our own government and our own laws and we have our own money um but  we're a protectorate of the uk as well so we can we can use the uk's carbon code and  we can develop that code for ourselves and so that's what we're proposing to do is to  develop that code um to input to put in this new parameter and we're seeing where the people  
**[1:21:07-1:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:07):**  will it you know if businesses will accept it um and if businesses do accept it and then  there's a transaction then there's no reason why it can't be included into the more um  universal code code but i think i think Bart is a key point that you're mentioning because  paradoxically what this uh what this means is that you you know the worst farming practices  have the biggest delta between let's say the baseline and the additionality right so you  
**[1:21:32-1:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:21:32):**  get like this paradoxical situation where if you're really doing good regenerative agriculture  you can actually make less money today so that's why we're really focused on uh you  know also showing the annual uh sequestration uh potential because it's rather than to see  it as a pool of soc that you uh sequester and then you create one credit that is really  a long term and permanent proven uh carbon you also want to look at the short-term carbon  
**[1:22:01-1:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:01):**  cycles and what is it really that you capture every year as a as a net uh sequestration  and then you can apply that also to farmers that are already in the regenerative uh you  know space yeah and potentially you could even look back i think right with some of  the satellite data goes back i think 16 or 17 years so you can actually see i mean that's  a long time not very long but still like you could theoretically see okay who has been  
**[1:22:24-1:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:24):**  in it for a while and and who didn't take out his uh carbon removal device aka the plow  and because that's the danger obviously if that delta is too big we or the soul in terms  of trees etc like we're going to incentivize the wrong behavior yeah yeah yeah except for  satellite gives you as glen was also mentioning it gives you a sort of you know approximation  yeah of course now the new the new um flex satellite that esta is launching next year  
**[1:22:53-1:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:22:53):**  and we're actually sorry 2023 that's going to be a big improvement because it's going  to be the resolution okay i think i think 15 centimeters something like that it's really  really big but this same problem comes back it doesn't matter what technology you use  until you can actually get technology into the soil ie a bot in the soil that can measure  the um the microbial as well as the carbon you know the the organic carbon and non-organic  
**[1:23:20-1:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:20):**  carbon then you're never going to get an accurate carbon an accurate figure so the way we do  it is to actually see how the farmer's um soil succession is mimicked by the microbial  succession and that's that that's mirrored so if your fungal bacteria ratio is say one  to one and you're trying to grow row crops um then that shows that there's been good  practices by that farmer over a period of time and um and what we're finding with the  
**[1:23:47-1:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:23:47):**  great study in new zealand on regenerative farms is within one growing season you can  actually increase the um the soil health or soil carbon levels up to a certain amount  or you can sequester so much carbon and then years you know following years after that  um the the percentages drop dramatically but there is an increase each year if you see  what i mean so it's that initial um it's that initial period where you get the serious sequestration  
**[1:24:13-1:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:13):**  and then it's just like topping up continually and that's how nature plays the game because  she doesn't want to show that um she doesn't want to throw the whole succession out of  balance to what the crop that you're trying to grow or it's suitable to grow so so glenn  glenn and maybe i don't want to take too much time from the others i see just because it's  very interesting so but then on the measurement of the uh fungal material ratio do you only  
**[1:24:40-1:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:24:40):**  work with sampling or so do you work with sample with sensors soil sensors and if so  which which are sort of proxies for the soil health in terms of bacterial and fungal activity  uh there's no sensors out there currently that can um can can uh are as good as the  human count and the human count by no means is up to scratch um there's too many variabilities  um so what we tend to do is we just use one person to do all of our soil samples and she's  
**[1:25:12-1:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:12):**  really really busy um but at least we get some sort of like um you know continuation  from her um and we're desperate we are there is a lot of work at the moment being done  um i think there's three different um groups who are actually trying to develop uh some  sort of machine learning um through the microscope so you know you can we're just teaching the  machine to actually recognize shapes of microbes so it can be a much more accurate um count  
**[1:25:42-1:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:25:42):**  than um you know than the human count but we're about two or three years off that um  i've heard of there's also bots which are being developed in australia um which are  using phosphorescent um spectrometry um which is able to um you know which is quite quite  interesting um accuracy again you know so there's lots going on it's a really exciting  world but at the moment we're about two years off and we just have to still use the human  
**[1:26:10-1:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:10):**  eye which isn't the best but it's the best we've got at the moment okay thanks all right  i uh potentially we can we can dive into this uh in one of the conversations after the summer  as well i think there's a there's a it's an interesting conversation but i i also want  to be mindful of all of your time i think we are uh nearing uh the end of the sort of  the open space as well maybe we we can have one more uh remark from hannes and then uh  
**[1:26:40-1:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:26:40):**  wrap it up i would say because hannes has been asking quite a few questions uh so hannes  i'm not if you're still here uh yeah hi i i might drop out my battery is low but i just  had a question about the the value of the carbon credits against the value of the of  the crop on the hemp if sold is there can you yeah elaborate on that relation and then  maybe also asking if you plan on leaving the island scaling to other geographies or or  
**[1:27:11-1:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:11):**  is that too early um as far as evaluation is concerned that's a really good question  um that's what you can actually get for it so um we are currently negotiating for farmers  we reckon we've got a hit about 50 pounds a ton to make it worthwhile for a farmer to  um to farm a ton of carbon per hectare um we're we're hitting about 35 pounds a ton  at the moment which is interesting um but we've got to get it up to 50 pounds and i  
**[1:27:38-1:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:27:38):**  reckon we'll do that this year um because of all the um the you know the ex the other  benefits that come along with it the water security food security and all the other issues  we can sell that we think um as far as um with regards to the hemp well actually a healthier  soil produces a more healthier crop um and as i've always said mother nature's or the  microbes work 24 7 365 days of the year so i'd rather employ them for free than a load  
**[1:28:07-1:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:07):**  of staff so the profitability of the hemp crop increases dramatically alongside the  the amount of carbon in soil so actually if you can have your cake and eat it um if you  farm regeneratively and measure it um what was your other question sorry i forget  geography yeah it's a really really good really good question that i'm glad you've asked it  um we're completely um uh changing the whole uh strategy of carbon credits um i can tell  
**[1:28:41-1:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:28:41):**  you we are now um how can i say it best we're trying to privatize the environment um so  we're using crypto coins we're using blockchain and we're going to give everyone an opportunity  to potentially um purchase a crypto coin a carbon coin in order to actually offset their  emissions directly to the farmer and that's quite exciting because that will really localize  the whole carbon trading system so there will be a lot of need for um businesses or um you  
**[1:29:12-1:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:12):**  know to offset their carbon their carbon locally in which case we'll be looking for farms all  over the world to actually do that so it's a really exciting um area that that that's  developing  thanks a lot also for your for your question uh yeah great that you uh jumped in i think  uh glenn if i pronounce it right uh so uh good to hear from you as well and uh hope  
**[1:29:41-1:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:29:41):**  you join more of our conversations because i think it's there's a lot there's a lot to  talk about absolutely well it's been a great pleasure meeting you i really has i've been  meaning to get in touch with you guys for a long long time but i love the podcast and  i love what you're doing and keep up the good work  all right thank you everyone thank you kun uh and uh yeah see you next time cheers thank  
**[1:30:05-1:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:30:05):**  you bye-bye cheers thanks bye-bye  dear friends of the podcast i'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it why are we doing this  course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[1:30:28-1:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:30:28):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and i've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned  what have we seen in the space over the last years how have we built our decision-making  framework what to focus on with the podcast how have we picked interviewees and what questions  should you ask what is happening in the space what should you read what should you listen  
**[1:30:53-1:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:30:53):**  what should you watch how to approach this space for whom is this course you the soil  builders and investors in the space the soil builders people working in this space entrepreneurial  farmers fund managers vehicle builders crowd investing platform builders agtech companies  farm to gut food companies permaculture keyline designers holistic management consultants  etc etc people that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own  
**[1:31:20-1:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:31:20):**  money to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are  putting other people's money to work through foundations institutional capital banks insurance  companies etc is this course free no this is pay what you think it's worth meaning i  have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and i'm very aware that among  the listeners of this podcast and we have people with very different means so i'm inviting  
**[1:31:45-1:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:31:45):**  you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to consider paying  what you think it's worth thank you so what is this course it's currently a series of  17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus pdf slides so you don't have to ride  along we're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive  agriculture is so risky how to invest what kind of frameworks you could and i think should  
**[1:32:13-1:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:32:13):**  build what to invest in what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you  could find if you're a soil builder every lesson will have a digging deeper part where  i will share what kind of reports what kind of interviews what kind of videos you can  look into if you want to dig deeper we're going to look at nutrient density landscape  design and a lot more so what is it not it's not a list of investable deals unfortunately  
**[1:32:37-1:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:32:37):**  that doesn't exist in this world we're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture  and food revolution it's also not investment advice before making any investment please  find professional investment advice so get ready get a cup of coffee a cup of tea or  whatever you're drinking click on the link below sign up and i'm really looking forward  to your feedback.

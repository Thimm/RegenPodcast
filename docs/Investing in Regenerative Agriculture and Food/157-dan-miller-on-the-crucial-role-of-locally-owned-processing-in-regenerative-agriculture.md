**[0:00:12-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:15):**  This is a check-in interview with Dan Miller, the founder of Stuart, the crowdfunding platform  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:18):**  specifically made for regenerative farmers.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:21):**  With Dan we talk about what has happened in the RegenAg movement in the last 18 months  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:25):**  of COVID, where the big centralized ag and food systems showed to be super fragile.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:30):**  What is needed to build a decentralized system and how do we finance that and how do we invest  
**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:34):**  in that?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:35):**  Disclaimer, we're a small investor in Stuart.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:40):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:44):**  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:48):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:53-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:00:53):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:00):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:02):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:06-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:06):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:08):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:13):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:17):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:21-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:21):**  our work.

**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:42):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:44):**  Welcome to another interview, this time a check-in interview with Dan, the founder of  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:48):**  Stuart.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:49):**  And with him, we were right in the middle of the beginning of the pandemic in I think  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:54):**  it was May 2020.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:01:55):**  So I'm very happy to have him back and to be able to ask everything around how to get  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:01):**  the crowd, how to get a lot of people active as an investor in the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:06):**  revolution and evolution.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:08):**  So welcome back then.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:09):**  Glad to be back.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:10):**  It feels like years ago, but it's not.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:12):**  It's only 18 months, but still a lot has happened in that block of time.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:16):**  Of course, I will link the previous interview recorded below, but if you had to introduce  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:21):**  yourself for a sentence or two, and also what Stuart does and is for all the people that  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:26):**  didn't listen to the previous interview.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:28):**  Sure.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:29):**  Stuart's a platform to provide financing to regenerative farms.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:33):**  The financing raise online through our platform.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:35):**  So it's really about bringing new funders into regenerative agriculture and providing  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:39):**  alternative funding that's aligned to the needs of those farmers and ranchers.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:44):**  My background prior to Stuart, I was a co-founder of Fundrise, which is the first and largest  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:48):**  real estate crowdfunding platform.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:49):**  So I've spent 10 plus years now building platforms to raise alternative capital online, going  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:02:55):**  to the crowd, letting individuals participate in funding and particularly for regenerative  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:00):**  ag because of the narrative and I think the social and cultural importance of the work.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:04):**  I find the best funders not to be institutions that always second guess themselves and want  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:08):**  lots of data, but to be people who believe in this work and are willing to step forward  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:13):**  to support the producers that are doing it well.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:16):**  And what has, I mean, apart from growing, I'm imagining growing, but let's, let's unpack  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:20):**  that.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:21):**  What has changed in the last 18 months?  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:22):**  I mean, we last talked to the beginning of the pandemic.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:25):**  I think that really set a new trajectory for regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:29):**  Prior to the pandemic, it was a niche topic.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:32):**  People were interested in it, but it wasn't a broad base, but the pandemic led to the  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:36):**  supply chain shutdowns, like a boom of local purchasing from farms.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:41):**  And I think a realization that the centralized industrial ag system was not resilient enough  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:46):**  and did not support what was needed in a time of crisis.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:51):**  And so a lot of people started looking at regenerative ag and regional food systems  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:54):**  and building a regional infrastructure to support those types of farms.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:03:58):**  From our end, it's led to a boom in funders and people trying to support these projects.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:04):**  On the farmer side, there still were people joining regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:08):**  I don't know if it's necessarily led to a boom in them entering the market, but it's  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:11):**  definitely led to more viability, more purchasing, bigger markets.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:15):**  And I think the stage is now set for the longterm growth of regenerative agriculture and its  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:20):**  growth to a point where it's actually competing in terms of volume and size with the broader  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:25):**  agricultural market.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:26):**  It's still a tiny part of the market, but it's where the growth is.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:29):**  And I believe where the opportunity is and ecologically it's where it has to be because  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:34):**  you have to use the resources that you have available.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:37):**  And have you seen, because we all I think saw the boom in the regional food systems  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:42):**  during the first lockdowns or pandemic phases.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:45):**  And then have you seen from like the producers you finance and work with that it dropped  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:50):**  off or a good quantity of that state?  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:52):**  Like has it been like a good growth phase as well?  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:04:56):**  Of course, a super rocky ride because it was a roller coaster, but has it been a net positive  
**[0:05:00-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:00):**  also on the amount of sales or has it disappeared again a bit when things opened up and of course  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:08):**  where it then entered other lockdowns, et cetera.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:09):**  But how has been that ride for many producers?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:12):**  It was a rocky road.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:13):**  I think March, April 2020 was just remarkable.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:16):**  People were getting calls from customers who hadn't bought in five years, you know, trying  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:19):**  to buy out everything the farmer had.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:21):**  So that was just a huge increase in demand, which the farmers tried to sustain, but ultimately  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:28):**  it's hard to sustain that type of demand without the right infrastructure, without the right  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:31):**  labor.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:32):**  So then it kind of dropped down and I would say now it's equalized to kind of ongoing  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:37):**  long-term demand, but not that the crazy kind of panic buying that existed during that period.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:42):**  But it has given farmers now the confidence to invest more in equipment, infrastructure,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:48):**  labor to scale their business because they know the markets are there.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:51):**  They know the demand is there, but they need some capital to scale that up.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:55):**  And that means they might be reaching out to Stewart to get it financed.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:05:59):**  Have you seen an uptick as well in terms of maybe even sizes if they go to processing,  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:04):**  et cetera?  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:05):**  Obviously it can be quite a bit of money.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:07):**  Has the platform processed more individual loans?  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:10):**  I mean, I see a lot of emails coming in regularly, but it seems to be on the up also on the financing  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:16):**  side through the platform.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:17):**  We're definitely doing more loans.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:19):**  We're doing a few loans a week now.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:21):**  Most of our loans sell out in minutes to hours, any loans of a few hundred thousand dollars  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:25):**  or less sell out generally within an hour or two.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:28):**  We now raising money for a loan that's $1.5 million where that'll probably take a month  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:33):**  or something like that.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:34):**  So we're seeing the loan size take up.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:36):**  We're seeing demand take up.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:37):**  The biggest change we've seen is now the demand for food systems infrastructure.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:42):**  So for shared processing, shared distribution.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:45):**  So for a lot of these producers, livestock being a great example, the processing is available  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:50):**  for the enormous producers, but for the small to midsize ranchers, there's not distributed  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:55):**  processing facilities.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:06:57):**  So we're working with a handful of networks of livestock growers to finance modular processing  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:03):**  facilities with equipment that's designed for that type of use that will give them control  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:07):**  over processing and end markets.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:10):**  And then they often end up aggregating a brand under that same type of facility too, so they  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:14):**  can all sell together.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:16):**  So we're seeing the decentralized farmer networks aggregate and they need a certain amount of  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:21):**  infrastructure to take that next step together.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:23):**  And now they're just building it themselves.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:25):**  And it works very well for us because we started by funding producers.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:29):**  Now we can fund the infrastructure that helps them get it to market.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:33):**  And the USDA and public policy in response, I believe, to the pandemic has seen the need  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:38):**  for small scale processing.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:40):**  And there's a lot of grant money and kind of loan guarantee money that's now flying  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:44):**  in.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:45):**  And that happened to be, I would say, at the beginning of a transformation, I think, in  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:49):**  the kind of agricultural value added processing infrastructure in the US and around the world  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:53):**  because producers want control over the supply chains.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:07:56):**  They don't want to just have large monopoly companies control processing and exclude their  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:01):**  access.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:02):**  And the fact that there's like all this attention for that now, I think the Biden administration  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:06):**  made a number of announcements, of course, focused on the US, doesn't mean that it is  
**[0:08:10-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:10):**  easy for these groups to find a financing or do they end up mostly ended up either through  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:17):**  Stuart or friends and family?  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:19):**  Like are the banks ready to finance these things now or it's talk is cheap and actually  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:23):**  doing it is difficult?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:25):**  Talk is cheap.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:26):**  The banks are not ready to finance these things, even with incentives like loan guarantees.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:30):**  They're just complicated deals to understand.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:32):**  You have kind of a size of infrastructure they're not used to.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:36):**  You have networks of small scale producers aggregating.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:38):**  So they're kind of non credit.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:39):**  There are a lot of scrappy operations coming together.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:42):**  You have a pretty big capital cost.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:44):**  Most of these facilities are, you know, five million plus in reality to build the infrastructure  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:49):**  and build the equipment and have some working capital.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:52):**  It's a few million dollars.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:53):**  So that requires a decent amount of equity, a decent amount of debt.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:56):**  So a little bit of grant money is not going to get you there.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:08:59):**  All we do is specialize in financing regenerative farmers and ranchers.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:03):**  And these are still complicated deals for us.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:05):**  I think the thing that we found is hardest about them is all the different skill sets  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:09):**  they need.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:10):**  You know, for example, a producer comes to us, a network of livestock ranchers, and they  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:15):**  want to build this type of facility.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:16):**  But in order to do it, they need real estate expertise to find the right piece of property.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:21):**  They need construction management to put together a budget and oversee it.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:24):**  They need some operational expertise around the processing and market sales.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:28):**  So there are all these other skill sets around these types of projects that don't relate  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:33):**  to being a producer.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:34):**  And it's unlikely, pretty much impossible, that a producer would have all of those.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:38):**  So we're bringing in different freelancers and experts in those subject matters, real  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:43):**  estate and construction being two that are critical but not normally of the experience.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:48):**  And so I think what our business line will look like around food infrastructure is providing  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:53):**  the financing for those facilities, also helping the farmers find grants and other money that's  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:09:58):**  out there, but also helping make connections to people that can execute the specialty elements  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:04):**  of these businesses that the groups don't experience.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:07):**  So they kind of have the local network, they have an understanding of the supply and the  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:10):**  end markets.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:11):**  But there's all that other experience that needs to be developed.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:13):**  So by doing one of these, it's very complicated.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:16):**  But as you do more and more, we have three that we've funded and probably five more in  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:21):**  our pipeline, we're really starting to see the similarities amongst them and become an  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:26):**  expert in them.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:27):**  There could be hundreds basically in this space here.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:29):**  And for a producer, what would be simply the difference if you had to walk us through if  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:34):**  you would have a decentralized, partly co-owned maybe a slaughter facility, a processing facility  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:41):**  compared to sending it somewhere?  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:43):**  Like how fundamentally or life changing is that for your bottom line?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:47):**  It's fundamental to the business.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:48):**  The two things at Salesforce, one, access, you know, these huge processing facilities,  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:54):**  they're not interested in someone sending five cattle, you know, they want huge contracts  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:58):**  of big supply.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:10:59):**  So you can't get bookings, you can't get the supply slots you need, or you get bumped all  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:04):**  the time.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:05):**  And then the second is quality and the type of cuts.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:08):**  A lot of these livestock ranchers have buyers who want certain cuts, and they want things  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:13):**  in a certain way, or chef wants it this way, or the customers like a special cut.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:17):**  Most of these big facilities, they don't really care about the kind of end customer in terms  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:21):**  of the type of cut and the flexibility of what they're doing.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:25):**  They're just doing kind of mass market production.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:27):**  And so you don't have that custom and flexibility.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:30):**  So what these smaller facilities do, and they're not tiny, but they end up, you know, compared  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:35):**  to a hundred million dollar Cargill or Tyson facility, they're small.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:39):**  What they do is they give control over access and control over end product.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:45):**  And then we're also working with them on shared ownership structures.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:47):**  So a lot of these types of facilities, you know, decades or generations ago would have  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:51):**  been co-ops.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:52):**  Now, there's been a lot of new thinking on Petrol Purpose Trust and Steward Ownership  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:56):**  Models.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:11:57):**  So we're trying to also bake that into these facilities so they would be owned by producers  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:01):**  and employees.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:02):**  Any excess profit would be either reduced of the cost infrastructure in terms of the  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:07):**  service costs and paid as bonuses to producers and employees.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:11):**  So I see these types of facilities as they shouldn't be a profit center.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:14):**  They're a service to producers.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:17):**  And if you cut out that profit margin and instead that's shared with the users of the  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:21):**  facility, it creates aligned incentives and also make sure the cost of the service is  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:25):**  as competitive as it can be for them.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:27):**  It's almost like a public service basically, but specifically for in this case, the livestock  
**[0:12:32-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:32):**  industry.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:33):**  Do you see that in other sectors as well?  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:34):**  I mean, it seems like the livestock space, maybe we saw the breakdown even more as we  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:39):**  saw the many slaughterhouses, industrial ones had to close and whole supply chains just  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:44):**  disappeared or blocked for weeks and months, especially in Corona time.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:48):**  Do you see that in other parts as well?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:51):**  Or does the livestock industry be sort of the cutting edge at the moment?  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:55):**  We're seeing it all over.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:12:56):**  Livestock is where a lot of it's happening because the size and scale needed and the  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:01):**  USDA kind of inspections and the heavy regulations around it.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:04):**  But we are looking right now at a oyster processing facility that will do for aquaculture and  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:09):**  that will help regional oyster growers have their oysters processed, cold pasteurized,  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:15):**  packaged and available for sale.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:17):**  We're seeing some with milling, with grains, heritage grains.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:21):**  They need infrastructure to get the product to market.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:24):**  We're seeing some with hemp, particularly for fiber processing where you have a lot  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:27):**  of processing capacity that's needed.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:30):**  So pretty much with any agricultural product, there needs to be processing to get it to  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:35):**  a stable state, but also to do value added products.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:38):**  And they really need to be selling direct and doing value added products to be viable.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:43):**  And so every sector needs its own processing infrastructure.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:46):**  We even had a group of organic hazelnut growers reach out to us for their own processing.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:51):**  So that's why you need to think about like serving that regional network of growers who  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:55):**  are specialty in a certain product, who can share their capacity.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:13:59):**  And I think we're going to see hundreds or thousands of these systems and it's a whole  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:03):**  network of components are needed.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:05):**  One company I've been very impressed with who's providing a lot of the modular USDA  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:10):**  slaughter units that we're financing is called Frisla.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:13):**  They're in Western Washington state and they helped build the first USDA certified mobile  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:19):**  slaughter unit over a decade ago.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:21):**  And now they're a leader in the market in terms of providing these kind of modular units  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:26):**  that can be expanded or adjusted based on the size of the facility.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:30):**  So it's really a network of kind of infrastructure, producers, financing, ownership models, like  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:37):**  all of it's kind of coming together to support what this looks like.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:40):**  And it really gives control back to producers.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:43):**  It also lets producers enter the market and have more reliability to reach end markets.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:48):**  So I think this will let production grow to then meet the market need to really supply  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:53):**  larger contracts like bigger restaurants or bigger purchases, let's say from hospitals.  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:58):**  That's always been the problem.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:14:59):**  One farm can't supply the contract, but if you have aggregated networks of farms through  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:05):**  processing facilities, they can combine their sales to provide reliable output.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:09):**  And then you can of course start to finance the farmers again, or maybe in some cases  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:14):**  you have already because if the outlook increases or improves and the margins improve and there  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:20):**  is need for more scale, I mean, you said many of these might be ready to scale if there  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:25):**  were more stable or better markets, better margins, etc.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:28):**  And if that's been taken care of through processing and marketing, then there's an enormous opportunity  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:33):**  for the underlying farmers and ranchers to grow as well.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:36):**  And obviously there might be there might be need for finance.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:39):**  Yes, it's reflexive.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:40):**  You know, more infrastructure supports more farmers, more farmers need more infrastructure.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:45):**  And that's why we've jumped into this space, because if we're financing producers who are  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:49):**  having trouble getting their product to market, then we should finance the capacity to process  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:53):**  it, get it to market.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:55):**  And then we're expanding in terms of providing kind of the freelancer expert support for  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:15:59):**  marketing or digital tech or operations.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:02):**  So we're just kind of touching all elements of the production to end market.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:07):**  And even on the way back, we have a vermicompost company we're working with.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:09):**  And I think recycling of nutrients is an element of these systems that's often forgotten.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:14):**  Yeah, we never talk about how these nutrients get back to the soil, let's say.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:18):**  And that's something there is a lot of infrastructure needed there as well.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:23):**  And on Stuart itself, I mean, you had a Series A fundraise.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:27):**  How did that get about?  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:29):**  What was needed in terms of growth of Stuart itself to get to the next level, more people?  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:34):**  What has happened in Stuart itself?  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:36):**  Yeah, that was one of the big changes.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:38):**  18 months ago, the company was still self-funded.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:40):**  I kind of had begun starting, it was like January, February 2020, to reach out for investment  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:47):**  partners, which was obviously terrible timing to reach out for investment partners.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:51):**  So it ended up taking a lot longer than we thought.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:54):**  But I had self-funded Stuart for four years.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:16:56):**  My goal with the business was to get it to a point where we had outlined the market we  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:02):**  were supporting, we had proven the viability of our model, and we were starting to grow,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:07):**  and we could find aligned funders who really believed in what we were doing and were in  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:10):**  it for the long term.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:11):**  So we weren't interested in the traditional venture route of kind of hyper growth and  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:15):**  exit.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:16):**  And so we ended up meeting a lot of family offices who were in the regenerative ag space,  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:22):**  who have, you know, the intergenerational wealth, and they're focused on the very long  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:25):**  term.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:26):**  They care about return, but they also make sure that we're aligned in terms of values  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:31):**  and we're uncompromising.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:33):**  And so we put a round together led by the Grantham Foundation, who's just an amazing  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:37):**  organization investing in companies supporting climate solutions, but also providing grants.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:43):**  Their kind of whole thesis is around accelerating climate solutions.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:47):**  And then it was co-led by two other family offices, Triple, which is led by the Milgram  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:53):**  family and Beck Milgram in Australia, and then Evie Steyer, who started her own venture  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:17:58):**  firm, Ponderosa VC, recently.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:01):**  And they're all on the board.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:02):**  We actually have a board meeting later today.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:04):**  So I really was happy to find aligned long term investors alongside those investors.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:09):**  We had users of our platform, gave them the chance to invest in the company.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:13):**  And that was the kind of the goal from the beginning.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:15):**  Broad based ownership and steward, letting individuals, family offices, high net worth  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:20):**  funders, letting many people participate in the ownership of our company.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:24):**  Similar to steward ownership models we're talking about, you know, we're a network  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:27):**  business.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:28):**  The value of our business relates to the strength of our farmer producer network, infrastructure  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:33):**  network, freelancer network, funder network.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:36):**  And if all the people using our platform can share in the upside of the platform, then  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:41):**  they're not only incentivized to use it, but the benefit of our system goes to everybody.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:45):**  So we're also looking at broadening our ownership and providing more methods for people to share  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:51):**  in the upside.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:52):**  And that was the goal from the beginning, that it should be equitable.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:18:55):**  If you're going to have a solution for regenerative ag that is kind of changed the market, it  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:00):**  has to be distributed, but it also has to be equitable and the ownership has to be shared.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:03):**  Yeah, no, I completely agree.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:05):**  And we were fortunate enough to be a very, very small investor as well.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:09):**  And of course, Eric Smith, we had on the podcast of the Grantum Foundation, I will link the  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:14):**  interview below.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:15):**  And the other two new board members are quite close as well.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:18):**  So if they're listening, a shout out to them.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:20):**  And in like, we've talked us quite a bit, we talked before, I mean, 2020, everything  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:27):**  was weird and different, but you were definitely not just building this for the US, you did  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:31):**  a deal, I think, in Tasmania, and one in Switzerland, how are the plans, let's say, beyond the border  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:37):**  of the US and what's going to happen or what is happening there?  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:41):**  That's always been my goal from the start.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:42):**  I live in London.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:43):**  So I'm from the US and most of our companies in the US, but we're fully remote.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:47):**  I'm in London, our COO is in New Zealand, and we have 12 other staff in the US.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:52):**  So from the beginning, the goal is to be in lots of regions, be in lots of places, be  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:19:56):**  prepared to support the broader global movement for regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:00):**  It certainly is a global movement.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:02):**  The lack of funding exists across border.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:05):**  There's no reason why it's special to the US.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:07):**  That's just where we were based and where I'm most familiar.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:10):**  But we started, we have seen demand in other countries.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:14):**  Probably the kind of biggest hold up to us working abroad was around our payment infrastructure,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:18):**  that we have a payment platform that's US based.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:22):**  If we're going to fund projects abroad, we had to build another payment system, which,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:25):**  you know, two payment platforms is very difficult integration.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:29):**  And now that payment provider in the US is willing to set up a pilot and is planning  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:33):**  to support international payments.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:36):**  So our hope is by the end of the year, we'll have a method for our US user base to fund  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:40):**  projects abroad and we'll probably bring in local family offices and funders in those  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:45):**  markets to support them and build a syndicate of local capital with our US capital that  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:50):**  we can replicate around the world.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:52):**  Canada is probably the first place we're looking at.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:54):**  We were in Growers and Co magazine recently and we've done a partnership with Growers  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:20:59):**  and Co called Growing Change.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:00):**  So we're already working together on supporting small scale ag in Canada.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:05):**  And that's with Jean Martin Fortier, who's, you know, I have admired him for a very long  
**[0:21:10-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:10):**  time.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:11):**  And he's, you know, the ultimate leader of this movement.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:13):**  And then we're also looking at supporting some of the markets that we have investors.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:17):**  So Beck Milgram are families from Australia, they're hoping to support farms in Australia.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:22):**  That's a market we're interested in.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:24):**  And then Switzerland too, we've already funded one farm in Switzerland.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:27):**  And one of our investors is Swiss based site.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:29):**  That's kind of how I see us working abroad of having an investor in our company who's  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:33):**  willing to allocate some of their capital for local funding and us doing deals alongside  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:39):**  that with our broad user base.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:41):**  I mean, we'll see whether people want to fund projects outside the US if they're US funders.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:47):**  I expect they would.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:48):**  I think they probably find it really interesting to be able to fund farms around the world.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:52):**  It will require local servicing, local diligence, local site visits.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:56):**  So we will have to build out our capacity.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:21:57):**  But I would say by the end of the year, we'll at least have the kind of tech infrastructure  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:01):**  to do it.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:02):**  That's super interesting.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:03):**  And we mentioned, I don't think we talked about it last time, because I don't think  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:07):**  it was around, but there you have launched, I'm not sure if it's even called a fund, but  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:12):**  like some kind of structure to bridge loans or to not only do individual deals.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:16):**  Can you share a bit more on that?  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:18):**  Because normally when we see crowdfunding, we see, okay, something goes online, like  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:22):**  you said, it either fills up in minutes or in hours or in days.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:25):**  But there are other aspects there that also need financing and need something to get to  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:29):**  that point where you can go to the broader community or to your own community to raise  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:33):**  the necessary funding.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:35):**  Sure.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:36):**  So Stuart, from the beginning, the goal is to be a broad financial services platform  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:40):**  that's creating different financial products that are custom designed for regenerative  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:45):**  ag.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:46):**  So the first product we launched that's had a lot of success is the individual farm loan  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:50):**  product.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:51):**  So a loan to a specific farm, fixed term, fixed rate, and you hold the loan through  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:55):**  maturity.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:56):**  And that's sold to participants on our platform.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:22:58):**  They buy a per rata that slice that loan.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:01):**  We service and administer the loan.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:03):**  We're the lender of record.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:04):**  We don't take a spread.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:05):**  You know, a loan at 6% to a farm gets paid directly to the farmer.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:10):**  What we found is that there was a need from producers for quick capital for bridge loans.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:15):**  You know, they might have a property next door to them that was coming up for sale,  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:18):**  but they had to close in 30 days where they had a grant that they had to spend the money  
**[0:23:22-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:22):**  upfront to get reimbursed.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:24):**  All types of kind of use cases where they needed money really quickly, guaranteed, and  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:29):**  couldn't go through the time that a campaign naturally takes to do.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:33):**  So we decided to fill the market on both sides.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:36):**  We created a, it's almost like commercial paper where users on our platform are lending  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:40):**  money to us in nine month term with a fixed interest rate, currently 4.5%.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:46):**  They can withdraw that funding at any time with 90 days notice, almost like a three month  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:49):**  notice period, relatively liquid.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:52):**  And then we're lending those funds as a series of bridge loans to different farm projects  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:57):**  that need them.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:23:58):**  Most of them for land purchases, some of them for advances for grant reimbursements, others  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:03):**  for immediate kind of equipment and indices and needs.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:06):**  And then a lot of those bridge loans end up being either paid back directly from proceeds  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:10):**  or refinanced through our platform with a term loan.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:13):**  So now we can kind of do a one, two.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:14):**  We can move, you know, within weeks to close the deal with a bridge loan and then set up  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:18):**  a campaign to refinance that loan through a term loan.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:22):**  And we're developing more products.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:24):**  So that's our goal of like, let's figure out everything a farmer needs.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:27):**  Let's develop a financing product around it.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:29):**  Let's distribute that broadly and then let's keep listening and figure out what else they  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:33):**  need.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:34):**  And that, I mean, you said something interesting on the weak spot.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:37):**  I think the speed here in general is quite breathtaking.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:40):**  You wrote a really nice medium post.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:41):**  I will link it below as well on, I don't remember where the farmers, but they had to buy, they  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:46):**  could buy the neighbor and.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:47):**  A studio health farm in Vermont.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:49):**  Yeah, and everybody else said no and was very interested.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:52):**  And then at the end, they obviously said no, but you are steward was able to say yes or  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:57):**  no very, very quickly.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:24:59):**  Can you talk us through that story as it always also includes actually not just a, an agriculture  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:04):**  piece, but also hospitality piece.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:06):**  This is a really great example of like, you know, the theory of the products, but then  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:10):**  the reality of how they're used.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:12):**  So studio health farm, it's a fourth generation farm in Southwest Vermont.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:16):**  When it was taken over by the new generation a decade ago, they converted from, you know,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:22):**  they stopped spraying.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:23):**  They were growing grain before there was an ecological collapse.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:26):**  They learned about Allen's savory.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:27):**  They brought in livestock, they've restored the land.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:30):**  And so they've grown a livestock business on this farm.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:33):**  They also restored an old school house that was on the property and they were going to  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:37):**  live in it, but they needed some extra funds to pay off the construction costs.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:41):**  And so they rented on Airbnb and since they've put it online, it's become one of the most  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:45):**  popular properties in all of Airbnb.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:47):**  It's actually booked out 18 months, every single night, 18 months ahead.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:51):**  It's crazy.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:52):**  They said they put it like online at the first of January, the full year filled up like in,  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:57):**  I don't know, an hour or day, like crazy.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:25:59):**  The full year, right now, the all of 2022 is filled out.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:03):**  We're in February, 2020, all of this year and then through the spring of next year.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:07):**  Because it's so special or because it became such a hype as well.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:10):**  It's special and it became a hype or.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:13):**  It's special.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:14):**  Well, I think it's two things.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:15):**  One, people are looking for authentic environments to stay in and visit, particularly, you know,  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:20):**  COVID times too, where there's lots of space and it's a beautiful landscape.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:23):**  But they also beautifully restored a historic building with nice wood and timber and they  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:29):**  have a sauna.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:30):**  So I think it's also like they know the market and they provide a beautiful design aesthetic  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:35):**  with the farm.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:36):**  But what this property is allowed is giving them the capital to support the growth of  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:40):**  their operation and give the land time to heal so it could sustain more livestock.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:45):**  So now they have revenue from their farmhouse, their schoolhouse, they have sheep that they  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:50):**  raise and then they also now do are doing sheepskin.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:52):**  So they're doing all types of creative things.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:55):**  Most farmers have off farm income.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:26:58):**  That's the reality of American farming and most around the world is people get jobs somewhere  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:02):**  or a wife works in town.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:04):**  But this schoolhouse let them stay on the land and be farming full time.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:08):**  So there was a huge benefit to that.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:10):**  And have a lot of people come that potentially would end up buying their products and produce  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:14):**  as well.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:15):**  Yeah, they buy products and they learn about regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:18):**  So you know, very successful farm, tons of revenue through their bookings and farm sales.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:24):**  And they had the chance to buy adjacent property.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:27):**  But farmers are always talking to their neighbors, you know, they're always trying to position  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:31):**  themselves to buy more property if it becomes available.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:34):**  An owner who had a property for a few decades next door that really completed their property  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:39):**  you know, what was going to move to Florida, he said he'd give them a first shot at it  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:43):**  if they could close quickly, which was 30 days.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:47):**  In reality in ag lending, it's hard for a regenerative farmer to get funding but speed  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:51):**  is there's no speed at all, you know, normal loans six plus months.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:27:55):**  So the traditional routes wouldn't work for them, not just because they're not a fit,  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:00):**  but because of the time.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:01):**  And so we stepped in with a bridge loan provided a $970,000 loan for them to buy the property.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:07):**  They now have a campaign on our platform to refinance that with additional money to improve  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:12):**  the buildings on that property for their farmstay business.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:15):**  So they've already validated the revenue with the farmstays on their current property.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:20):**  Now they're expanding that to the adjacent property plus they'll be able to carry more  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:23):**  sheep.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:24):**  So it's really a great story.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:26):**  And it shows the breadth of the products we have, you know, filling the short term need,  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:29):**  but then also providing the long term funding.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:32):**  And that's the one that is filling up now.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:34):**  That is the one and a half million that will maybe take a month or so.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:37):**  Correct.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:38):**  So if any of you are interested that that's on the platform now.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:41):**  And it's a six year loan at 6% interest, and then they'll refinance it at maturity.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:46):**  Okay, yeah, interesting.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:47):**  I don't know when, when, if when this comes out, if it's still open, but we'll definitely  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:52):**  link it below.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:53):**  And so what is this year?  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:55):**  I mean, we're sort of at the beginning of 2020.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:57):**  What are you excited about?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:28:59):**  What are you looking forward to?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:01):**  What are big milestones you want to get?  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:02):**  By the end of the year, we already talked one about one, which is some international  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:06):**  ones through the payment system, and being able to get us invest stores to invest overseas  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:12):**  with ease as well.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:13):**  What what are others?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:14):**  The I mean, the day to day right now is growing our US lending business, more funders, we're  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:20):**  working with a lot more family offices now, which helps bring bigger checks to some of  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:25):**  these bigger deals to help anchor them.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:27):**  The thing that I'm just every day most interested in is the food systems infrastructure, I think  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:32):**  we're way ahead, and we're really diving into learning about that how to finance it, how  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:37):**  to bring other types of funding together.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:39):**  And some of these deals, we have like five or six types of capital, our loan, local high  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:44):**  net worth money, revenue based financing, preferred stock, new market tax credits, USDA  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:49):**  grants, even tax incremental financing.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:52):**  So it's how do you weave together all the different types of capital out there around  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:29:56):**  these facilities that are critical for growth, job creation, the prosperity of regenerative  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:01):**  agriculture.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:02):**  And so if we can build a model to align all those types of funding together, and then  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:06):**  the operational system of how they should be built and managed, I think that would have  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:11):**  enormous impact in the broader market and really enable the growth of regenerative ag.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:15):**  So I think we're at like the point where the market's moving, there's lots of interest,  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:20):**  but it's still have to be stuff to rebuild the entire infrastructure that was destroyed  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:25):**  over 100 years.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:26):**  But I'm seeing those networks aggregate and hopefully our goal at stewards to really propel  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:29):**  the growth of those networks and deliver resources and connections that they otherwise need or  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:35):**  don't have.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:37):**  But I am excited to see it.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:39):**  And then we've also had some team meetups, we're a remote team, but we had our first  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:42):**  company meetup in our last October at my family's farm in Easton, Maryland on the Chesapeake  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:47):**  Bay.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:48):**  We have some more planned for this year.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:49):**  So I love going out and visiting farms and getting together with our team and investors.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:54):**  And for me, that's what the point of this originally was around food and access and  
**[0:30:59-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:30:59):**  those types of experiences.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:00):**  And so I just love the work I'm doing at Stewart and I feel like it's not only making impact,  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:05):**  but it's allowing me to use the skills I have to support regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:10):**  I like farming, but I'm not a farmer.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:13):**  My mother was a farmer, but she left that as soon as she could.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:16):**  So it's a way to honor my family's tradition, but also use the kind of finance, tech, real  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:21):**  estate lending kind of skills that are needed for the market.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:26):**  And that's what I find in regenerative ag.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:28):**  Everybody can contribute.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:29):**  It's not just about being producers.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:30):**  If somebody is great at marketing, they can help some of these farmers create a great  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:34):**  brand and do direct to consumer sales.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:36):**  And so there's really a role for anybody interested in this market outside of just becoming a  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:42):**  farmer, which obviously is important, but there's more to creating a food system than  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:46):**  just producers.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:47):**  And do you get, what are the biggest critiques or do you get pushback on the relative layering  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:53):**  between brackets, high interest loans?  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:31:56):**  Is that something like, oh, 6% and four and a half, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:01):**  Because agriculture is such a low margin business, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:05):**  What are the biggest critiques that people come to or do you get a lot of farmers that  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:09):**  don't want it?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:10):**  Or is it mainly like, I cannot get financing anywhere else.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:14):**  There is margin here.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:15):**  Let's get going.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:16):**  What are the biggest pushbacks you get on the whole piece of sewer thing?  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:19):**  Sure.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:20):**  I think interest rates definitely one of them, but it's really an anchoring question.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:24):**  The market is used to subsidy.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:26):**  So subsidize interest rates, subsidize food prices.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:30):**  We don't take any spread on our capital.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:32):**  We're just trying to build a market of, what does it take to attract funders, mission aligned  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:36):**  funders, but people who still are putting their money at risk and expect some return.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:41):**  And then what rates can the farmers actually afford to pay?  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:44):**  And so most of our loans are between like 5% to 8%, 5 being better revenue, more collateral  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:50):**  cashflow, 8 being scrappier earlier in their business cycle, equipment and less collateral.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:32:57):**  But we're finding most farms work with it, realize over time that it's not just about  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:01):**  rate, it's about having the right type of funding that arrives when you need it with  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:05):**  design for your needs.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:06):**  So most of our loans have six to 12 months of interest deferment upfront to give them  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:11):**  time to use the capital, generate revenue to start to pay it back.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:15):**  So I definitely have the view that the custom design financing for that specific farm is  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:20):**  the best.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:21):**  And another way we counter the interest rate thing is we also try to bring other funding  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:25):**  to farms to bring down the cost of capital.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:27):**  We have a grant writer who writes grants for farms.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:30):**  We've gotten a lot of value out of producer grant or local food promotion grants from  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:34):**  the USDA.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:35):**  So if you blend a grant with a loan that brings down the cost of capital.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:38):**  And we are also working alongside the FSA and banks on loans where they take the first  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:44):**  mortgage.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:45):**  Normally, they kind of say they'll do it and they don't end up doing it, but sometimes  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:48):**  it does happen.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:49):**  I view us as really creating more of a capital market for regenerative ag, a true market  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:54):**  of people providing funding and who need funding.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:33:58):**  And then that's going to be the cost that it's going to be.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:00):**  And the more people you bring to the market, the lower you can bring the funding.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:03):**  But there is some balance.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:05):**  So I think for our model, it's just that we're having to prove the viability not just of  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:09):**  our the way we do financing, but of regenerative ag.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:12):**  And I think most of the questions still are about are these businesses profitable?  
**[0:34:18-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:18):**  Agriculture is so hard.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:19):**  How do we make them successful?  
**[0:34:20-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:20):**  And that's what we're learning every day.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:22):**  It's about doing direct sales.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:24):**  It's about controlling your processing and markets.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:27):**  It's about having the kind of labor and equipment you need to grow the operation.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:31):**  It's about really just dialing in all aspects of the business.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:34):**  So it's definitely hard.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:36):**  It's not easy for any farm to work with.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:38):**  There's no farm that just all the time, everything's fine.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:41):**  But there is viability.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:42):**  And so that's what we're trying to prove that there is viability in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:46):**  There are people who want to support these types of farms.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:48):**  There are people who are interested in doing this type of work.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:51):**  And if we can prove viability outside of the kind of subsidized ag system, then surely  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:34:56):**  if the policy shifted to provide more resources to these farms, it's easier.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:01):**  But unfairly, regenerative ag has to prove it on its own.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:04):**  You know, while conventional ag is cynical, while they're just living off of subsidy.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:08):**  But that's just how it is.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:09):**  That's not going to change for a long time.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:11):**  I think that people in the renewable energy space can they have they have a few stories  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:15):**  on that as well.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:16):**  Like, why do they get subsidies in the fossil fuel industry is like incredibly subsidized  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:21):**  left and right.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:22):**  And yeah, they had to prove and now they're they are definitely on the good side of things.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:27):**  And luckily, there's a bit of money coming.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:29):**  But it took quite a while.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:30):**  Hopefully, this goes faster.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:32):**  And that's where I think a lot of people they just want, you know, wholesale change overnight.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:35):**  It's not going to happen.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:36):**  It's going to take decades.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:37):**  It's a real climate crisis.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:39):**  But you just you can't create a whole new agricultural system in a few years.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:45):**  And it is very hard to convince conventional farmers to change their ways and change the  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:50):**  system that they're locked into.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:51):**  They might not love it, but it works for them.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:54):**  And so it's about building viability and regenerative agriculture, not trying to rush too quickly  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:35:58):**  and make lots of claims that then get undermined when these businesses can't sustain themselves.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:03):**  So we're in it for the long haul.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:05):**  And do you see like what has been the success rate in the sense like is it working in like  
**[0:36:09-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:09):**  how many loans have gone into trouble?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:12):**  Is it something you publicly share or maybe none or what has been like the difficulty  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:17):**  rate, let's say on that side?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:19):**  Yeah, we are public about it.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:20):**  We've made over 50 loans under our Participate Loan Program.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:24):**  Two of them have been in default, but those are more of we're just adjusting payment schedules  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:28):**  and helping the farms resolve issues.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:30):**  So every farm run into challenge, they have a labor issue or they had an equipment breakdown.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:36):**  Some of these they lost a key customer say to repivot for markets or they were on a piece  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:40):**  of land and the landowner became problematic and they had to move land.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:44):**  So we're generally finding that like the end markets are there, the demand for the product  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:49):**  is there, but in any business operationally, you know, things can get out of whack and  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:54):**  there's support.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:55):**  So generally what we do on those is we accrue interest for a period, come in with our consulting  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:36:59):**  expertise to help figure out where the problem is for the business.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:03):**  We've even provided some bridge loans from our balance sheet to help cover gaps and then  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:08):**  get them on the path.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:09):**  Even the solution for those challenges is more funding to help fill the gap that they  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:14):**  have, you know, and one of them was a farm that was selling into Chicago from Milwaukee  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:19):**  was only delivering 200 orders a week, but the capacity they had could do 600 orders  
**[0:37:23-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:23):**  a week.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:24):**  So they ended up basically with a lot of sales and not enough margin and they needed a direct  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:28):**  consumer digital assistance to drive orders in Chicago to get 600 a week.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:33):**  So they now would have really high margins and that really doesn't relate to production.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:38):**  That relates to, you know, digital marketing and logistics, but the farmer doesn't necessarily  
**[0:37:44-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:44):**  have that expertise.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:45):**  And so we had a team member who went out there for a week, stayed with the farmer, went through,  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:49):**  you know, the whole business, visited customers and helped kind of figure out where the problem  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:54):**  was and then we've provided him with a technical assistance and a freelancer who's helping  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:37:59):**  them solve those challenges.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:00):**  So I'm of the belief that you're going to have to accommodate, that's, you know, that's  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:05):**  our model, you're going to have to adjust for the circumstances of the farmers.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:08):**  We find our funder base, we communicate transparently, give them a chance to speak with the farmers  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:13):**  and by having those direct links, they tend to be more forgiving of, okay, you know, there's  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:18):**  a plan in place, let's do this to try to adjust it.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:21):**  So you know, we don't pretend that there won't be any defaults, there is risk in this market,  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:25):**  but we're learning what challenges farmers are running into, how we can get ahead of  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:30):**  them, what kind of expertise and capacity we need to deliver to help them.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:34):**  And that's how our business has grown, of like, you can't be a passive lender in this  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:37):**  market, that's why banks are scared of it, you can't just lend money and I hope that  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:42):**  it's fine.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:43):**  You have to be involved in assisting these businesses and that means you need to build  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:47):**  an expertise in financial reporting and in grant writing and indirect consumer sales  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:52):**  and in online logistics platforms.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:38:55):**  So you kind of end up having to know everything about all aspects of the market in order to  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:00):**  help these farms be successful, but every time we run into a challenge, we learn something  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:04):**  new that we can replicate elsewhere.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:06):**  So we're really, we're learning a lot and I think we'll be able to prove the viability  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:11):**  of the model, but this is why, you know, originally I self-funded the company and self-funded  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:15):**  the loans.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:17):**  Nobody was going to fund these types of deals without any sort of track record.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:20):**  Now we have a four or five year track record and there's more people funding, but it's  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:24):**  still people who are early in the curve of acceptance and really willing and hoping that  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:30):**  regenerative agriculture can be viable.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:33):**  But the kind of traditional funders that want all the data and want everything proven for  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:36):**  them, the market's not there yet.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:39):**  It's definitely early and at the same time, I wouldn't say late, but we're definitely  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:44):**  on our way.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:45):**  So it's, I want to be conscious of your time as well and thank you so much for sharing  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:49):**  this update.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:50):**  We need to do it sooner than 18 months, but we'll definitely check in before that as I  
**[0:39:55-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:55):**  think it's going to be a very exciting year, very exciting end of the year.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:39:58):**  I'm imagining with potential outside US deals, which will be super exciting.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:03):**  So let's keep in touch.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:04):**  Let's hope to have you back soon and share more on how to get the crowd, how to get the  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:10):**  general audience, how to get the quote unquote normal people to buy this stuff actually involved  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:15):**  in the investing side of the regenerative agriculture revolution as well.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:18):**  I would love to.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:19):**  I enjoy conversations you're about as knowledgeable and well connected in the regenerative ag  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:24):**  world as anybody.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:25):**  So it's always a nice check in and to kind of hear what you're seeing and what we're  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:28):**  seeing.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:29):**  But it's definitely the market's growing, the interest is there and now it's about  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:32):**  proving it and it has to be proven.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:34):**  And I think that should be expected that you have to show that it works and show that it  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:38):**  can be viable ecologically and economically.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:40:42):**  And I'm confident of it, although there's still definitely things to work out.

**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:41:34):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:41:39):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:41:43):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:41:44):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:41:48):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:41:53):**  and recording this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:42:55):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:00):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:05):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:09):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:12):**  Thank you.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:13):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:15):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:43:21-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:21):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:23):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:43:28-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:28):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:34):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:43:38-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:38):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:40):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:45):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:49):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:53):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:54):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:56):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:43:59):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:44:02):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:44:04):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-miller-2#t=0:44:10):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

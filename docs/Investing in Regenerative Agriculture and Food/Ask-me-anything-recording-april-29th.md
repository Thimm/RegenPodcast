### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Sat, 30 May 2020 11:30:07)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:04-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:04):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:14):**  And then we get started.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:15):**  So a very welcome, it could be early morning, it could be okay morning, could be late in  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:20):**  the afternoon, depending where you are.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:22):**  After the success of our previous Ask Me Anything webinar, which was two weeks ago, three weeks  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:28):**  ago, about three weeks ago, we decided to do another one in a different time zone to  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:32):**  give some people also the chance to call in and not just watch the recording.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:38):**  I'm going to share my screen for a few seconds, as I mentioned, just to set the stage and  
**[0:00:43-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:43):**  give a short introduction.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:44):**  I think most of you know who I am, but if you don't, and if you just found this invite  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:49):**  somewhere, then I'm more than happy to briefly introduce myself.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:00:54):**  So let me come to move this around.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:13):**  So basically, welcome to this Ask Me Anything webinar.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:16):**  Obviously, you can ask me anything related to food and agriculture and investing.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:20):**  I don't pretend that I have any of the answers, but I've interviewed a lot of people in the  
**[0:01:24-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:24):**  past.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:25):**  So maybe I can point you somewhere where somebody has thought about your issues before and feel  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:30):**  free to jump into the questions of others as well.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:33):**  We've seen that last time it was very helpful.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:36):**  People were putting things in the chat books, et cetera, other resources.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:40):**  Just to give a bit of background, I'm the host of a podcast.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:43):**  We've done over 80, probably 85 interviews, depending a bit how you count with investors,  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:49):**  with farmers, with scientists, with fund managers, and a lot more.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:53):**  Always to see how to put money toward to regenerate soil at scale.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:01:58):**  Not saying that we should scale every single farm, but we should definitely, let's say,  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:02):**  repeat the process and regenerate a lot of soil.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:06):**  Regenerate people, we focus a lot on the nutrient density of food.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:10):**  Regenerate local communities, which we know in many places are in a very bad shape.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:15):**  I think primarily because the agriculture system isn't working, plus many other reasons.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:20):**  And obviously regenerate ecosystems, which was the original reason why I got into this  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:26):**  space because I got very interested in the carbon side of things, and then obviously  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:29):**  discovered all the other extra or the other impacts that regenerative agriculture can  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:34):**  have when done well and when done at scale.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:37):**  While generating a fair return, which is obviously leading to a lot of debate, what is a fair  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:41):**  return, is that even possible, depending on how degraded your land is, et cetera, et cetera,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:46):**  et cetera.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:47):**  But I think it's the quest we're looking for.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:49):**  Can you invest in a way that makes sense for the investor, the soil, the farmer, the land  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:54):**  owner, local community, et cetera, while generating a return?  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:02:58):**  So that's sort of the North Star we're pushing for.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:02):**  You can find anything, obviously, in your favorite podcast app.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:04):**  Doesn't mean you have to listen to it on SoundCloud, which is our current hosting provider, but  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:08):**  you can find it anywhere, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, Stitcher.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:13):**  If you use one app and you cannot find it, please let me know because it means we have  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:17):**  to make sure it gets listed there.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:21):**  So what is regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:22):**  We got quite a few questions last time on that.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:25):**  So I pulled a general definition.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:28):**  We can have probably in one hour ask me anything about this.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:31):**  But it's a system of farming principles, very important.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:35):**  So there's no one recipe focused on increasing biodiversity, enriching soils, improving watersheds,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:43):**  and enhancing ecosystem services.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:44):**  And I think this gives a nice overview just to set a bit of stage.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:49):**  And obviously, usually the next question is, what's the difference between organic?  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:54):**  What's the difference between biodynamic?  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:56):**  What's the difference between sustainable?  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:58):**  And it really depends.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:03:59):**  It depends.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:00):**  Organic is not always regenerative.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:02):**  Even biodynamic is not always regenerative and sustainable agriculture for sure is not  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:06):**  regenerative.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:07):**  And I think the next very brief, very simple, simplified overview gives that quite clearly.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:16):**  Extractive is the current system we're in.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:17):**  We've been discussing sustainable agriculture for a long, long time.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:23):**  And we see a shift to regenerative.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:25):**  Why?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:26):**  Because we, sustaining the current agriculture and food system is probably something we don't  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:31):**  want to do.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:32):**  Why would you want to sustain a system that has depleted aquifers, that has depleted soils,  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:37):**  that has created enormous dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico and actually in many other  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:41):**  places?  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:42):**  And so we really started searching for it actually a number of farmers a number of years  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:47):**  ago for a system that can restore, can regenerate.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:50):**  So if you say, what's the difference between organic?  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:52):**  Organic can be done regeneratively, but you would have to ask the questions we saw before,  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:56):**  like, is it increasing biodiversity?  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:04:58):**  Is it increasing soils, improving soils?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:01):**  Is it improving watersheds?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:02):**  And if it's not, it might be sustainable or it might be actually extractive.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:05):**  I've seen organic systems which are definitely not sustainable and not regenerative.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:10):**  So it's not a replacement of organic.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:13):**  It's just a different set of questions that we should ask.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:15):**  And I think the easiest question I always ask is, does it build soil or not?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:20):**  Is it measurable?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:21):**  Are people actually measuring the improvement of soils?  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:24):**  And then we get into a discussion how to measure that and so on.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:28):**  If you want to learn more, if you're completely new to this, definitely jump into a number  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:33):**  of these books.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:34):**  They're great talks about them as well.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:36):**  You don't have to buy the book if you're not a reader per se, you can get great talks about  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:40):**  it with David Montgomery on YouTube.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:43):**  Kiss the Ground, the book is great.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:44):**  Kiss the Ground, the community is very interesting as well.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:46):**  If you want to really see the farmer's version, definitely read Dirt to Soil by Gabe Brown.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:53):**  And any of these three books will give you a very good introduction into the subject.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:05:59):**  And with that, I will stop my screen sharing and we'll get to the Q&A.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:09):**  There we are.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:11):**  And I actually want to start with the question of Connie who cannot be here because she is  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:17):**  in St. Louis.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:19):**  But I think it's quite a technical question, not on the food side, but on the investment  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:23):**  side.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:24):**  So I will type it into the chat.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:26):**  And for anybody who has questions, please type them into the chat.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:32):**  So Connie is mentioning that she's been digging into alternative equity structures, which  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:36):**  is something we've discussed a few times on the podcast.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:40):**  And I think it's interesting for a number of different reasons because we probably need  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:44):**  different investment structures to invest in regenerative agriculture and food, both  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:49):**  in the food side of things, so the food companies, but also in the agriculture side of things.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:53):**  And the traditional either debt or equity probably is too rigid for many of this.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:06:59):**  So she was asking very specific on safes and convertible debt.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:07):**  What is possible there?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:08):**  What are the different, what are people doing?  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:11):**  And I already answered her, so I will actually put it in the chat as well.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:15):**  But there are a few, it's not an easy question, but there are a few places where you can look  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:18):**  for alternative investment structures.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:21):**  And they're not necessarily food and ag focused so far, so I will just put them in the chat  
**[0:07:28-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:28):**  for you to see.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:30):**  But there is stuff happening basically.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:32):**  So the first one is IndieVC, which is not, it's software focused, but basically puts  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:38):**  money to work in growing software companies that are making money.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:44):**  So they're only putting money to work in companies that actually have sufficient cash flow.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:49):**  And they're very successful in that.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:50):**  And they're really creating this revolution in the software world where they're not going  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:54):**  for the IPO exit.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:55):**  They built the exit into investment structure, et cetera.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:07:59):**  The second one is Purpose Capital.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:00):**  We've interviewed them, the founder Armin, I think two years ago or a year and a half  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:05):**  ago on alternative buyout capital.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:08):**  It made a long way, they've come a long way since then.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:11):**  And one of the deals they did actually was with Organic Rome, which is a large organic  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:15):**  distributor in the US, and they provided together with RSF, social finance, the alternative  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:21):**  buyout structure for that.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:22):**  So the company Organic Rome moved to a steward ownership model and needed to buy out the  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:28):**  current investors and Purpose and a number of other players provided that capital.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:33):**  But obviously didn't get the control of the company because the company moved to steward  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:36):**  ownership.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:37):**  So there's a very interesting tension between steward ownership and still wanting to raise  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:41):**  money.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:42):**  And in this case, being able.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:43):**  Air Tribe is not focused on Ag Tech whatsoever, but it's focused on software as well.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:50):**  But they did a crowdfunding for equity, but with a buyback in building to it.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:08:58):**  So they actually, the crowd could invest.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:00):**  Purpose was behind this as well.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:01):**  They moved to a steward ownership model and they managed to raise quite a bit of money.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:05):**  But again, without giving away control of the company and the investors, the crowd investors  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:11):**  could be any of us, are being bought out by free cash flow over time.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:16):**  If you're interested in this, definitely check out that link because they explain all the  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:19):**  terms.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:20):**  They explain the full thing, why they're moving to steward ownership and also why they're  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:24):**  raising money in this way.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:25):**  They were successful.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:26):**  They closed their round relatively quickly.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:29):**  Another example is more in the ag space is the Perennial Fund.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:33):**  We've interviewed Brendan and they will definitely come back on the show.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:36):**  There's a lot of interest in their skin in the game, profit sharing or free cash flow  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:41):**  sharing model while they're helping farmers to go to Regenerative Organic.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:46):**  It's a pilot still.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:47):**  They will close probably the fund in I think September and then we'll see.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:52):**  They will start working with about eight farmers.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:09:54):**  And we've done a Q&A with Brendan and Phil actually in the past on this channel.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:00):**  So there are these small experiments but predominantly people fall back to either debt or very rigid  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:07):**  debt or equity.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:10):**  And there's one more which is actually, let me see if I have it as well.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:16):**  I will put that later in chat.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:17):**  So there's the Impact Terms platform which is part of Tonic where I spent part of my  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:21):**  day job where we look a lot at alternative exits as well and how do you build in the  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:26):**  impact terms into the term sheets.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:28):**  Not just nice words where you're signing any kind of contract but actually build them into  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:32):**  your term sheet.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:33):**  So there's a lot of experimentation happening.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:35):**  I would love to see a lot more in food and ag because we don't have enough yet.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:39):**  We see some in software.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:40):**  We see some in other places but we need more creativity in terms of deal structures also  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:46):**  here.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:48):**  And that could be a good segue to your question, Thomas, if you want to jump in or you want  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:54):**  me to copy paste it into the chat.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:10:59):**  You're on mute at the moment.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:05):**  Okay so as a food entrepreneur with a proven product market fit in regenerative elements  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:10):**  in Spain, where do you look for current active angel investors who are seeking fundable seed  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:14):**  stage businesses to invite the regenerative food agri-food space in Europe?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:18):**  I think the first question would be why are you raising capital?  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:23):**  What is it for?  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:25):**  You're still on mute.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:30):**  I'm muted here.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:33):**  Hi Konan, thanks for everyone.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:40):**  I'm based in Spain where we are working on the largest regenerative agricultural project.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:49):**  We are aiming to restore a million hectares of land in Southern Spain and there are a  
**[0:11:54-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:11:54):**  number of players involved here such as the Kommelland Foundation, Avelar and others.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:12:01):**  And what I'm working on is a private company that aims to capitalize on the market opportunity  
**[0:12:08-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:12:08):**  is identified in the fast growing food spread market, Almond spread and this is the category.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:12:16):**  And in order to move into this space, we need to raise some funding mainly for the production,  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:12:24):**  the equipment, marketing, branding and so on.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:12:28):**  And so the ideal investors we are looking for are those who understand the benefit of  
**[0:12:35-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:12:35):**  regenerative and they are looking for a long term impact investment space which is actually  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:12:44):**  already something we are setting up with other partners.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:12:49):**  But what I'm working on is a separate project so that's why I'm super grateful for you and  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:12:56):**  keep on doing your great work.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:12:58):**  Thank you so much for this.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:00):**  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:04):**  And in terms of size, do you need to set up a spread factory which could be quite expensive?  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:13):**  What is the size you're thinking of?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:16):**  Is it 10,400,000?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:17):**  What's more or less the range which you think about?  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:25):**  So I'm working with some partners.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:28):**  So we have a outsourced manufacturing so that's not a problem.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:34):**  It's mainly for long term brand building and really to address the consumer needs.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:43):**  So what I'm looking for is an offer in the range of 150,000 to 200,000 euros in exchange  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:53):**  for equity in the company.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:13:55):**  So this could be a great opportunity for investors looking for a long term value generation in  
**[0:14:05-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:05):**  a space that is already well established in Southern Spain supported by many partners.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:14):**  And if you know, I think you have done many interviews with Commonland so they're working  
**[0:14:19-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:19):**  on a 20 year base and so this also can give a confidence because I personally know everyone  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:27):**  involved there.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:28):**  So this could be another value add to this.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:32):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:33):**  I will link the interview with Michio, which was completely at the beginning of the podcast.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:38):**  I think Michio of Commonland, which was probably, I don't know, number three or four, we did  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:46):**  on the project in Spain.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:47):**  They are the landscape they're managing.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:49):**  In terms of the early stage investing, the seed stage is often the most difficult because  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:14:57):**  it's by far the most risky even though you're in an established landscape that is moving  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:00):**  forward.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:01):**  And for many, I would advise to find it as local as possible.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:07):**  You need someone, especially angel investors need to have a connection, at least in my  
**[0:15:12-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:12):**  experience with the company.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:14):**  And in this case probably also with the landscape or with, they definitely need to be convinced  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:19):**  obviously and they need to understand regenerative agriculture, they need to understand the length.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:23):**  In this case, you're asking them to invest in a food company and they either need, they  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:29):**  probably need some kind of connection with the land because why would a German investor  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:34):**  or a Dutch investor, unless they really, really know the landscape well and have been there,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:39):**  et cetera, why would they invest so far away as they can have probably easier or closer  
**[0:15:45-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:45):**  investment opportunities?  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:46):**  And it's annoying, but it's like with every kilometer you're away from your, it just gets  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:52):**  more difficult in terms of cultural differences, in terms of language, in terms of distance  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:15:57):**  literally and they're not very few that are super comfortable with, okay, I'm based in  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:02):**  Greece and I'm going to invest in Spain just like that.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:07):**  Major deals is different because you have the space or doing due diligence or visiting.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:12):**  I mean, as soon as you get to a different size, you also need different experiences  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:19):**  on board.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:20):**  And then there are usually a number of players.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:22):**  I mean, we have a number of interviews we did with players that are interested in the  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:26):**  food space of this.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:27):**  I mean, Triodos is one with their organic growth fund.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:30):**  Quadia is another one.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:33):**  But they all look at sizes, million plus, et cetera, simply because of the diligence  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:39):**  costs.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:40):**  So if you look at smaller examples like that, usually you end up with, and you mentioned  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:45):**  what kind of angel investors would be interested in that.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:49):**  And the chances of finding someone outside Spain are not so large.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:55):**  Obviously, anybody listening interested, please get in touch with them.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:16:58):**  From us, this is not investment advice, but it's usually the closer, the better, because  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:06):**  they will have a connection with the space.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:07):**  They will have a connection with the landscape, with the land.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:10):**  And especially for slightly smaller deals like that, you will need that connection because  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:15):**  it's going to be a difficult due diligence process because there's not too much to do  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:21):**  due diligence on.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:22):**  And so there needs to be that easy social connection.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:25):**  Now it's difficult, obviously, because we're in a COVID world where even if you're nearby,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:29):**  you cannot build that relationship.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:31):**  But I would really see what is already happening in that landscape and what can you raise,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:37):**  even could be partly crowd, could be partly or smaller tickets.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:40):**  I'm not saying it should be 100 euros each, but smaller tickets of 5K, 10K, obviously  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:45):**  depending on the country where you're at, can you easily find a platform to handle that?  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:49):**  That really depends.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:50):**  I don't know Spain that well.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:52):**  But trying to see if you can embed it as much as possible local, because it's going to be  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:17:55):**  difficult, I think, to find an investor from Paris or an investor from Rotterdam to say,  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:00):**  OK, of course, Almond, I understand.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:03):**  Let's jump in.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:05):**  Maybe it's not the answer you wanted to hear, but it's what I see.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:09):**  But for others to receive your better experiences, please jump in.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:18):**  And with that, definitely, I mean, we're a small group this morning or this afternoon,  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:21):**  so we last time we had so many people that it was that the chat was filling out constantly.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:27):**  Please unmute yourself if you want to be on video or not.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:31):**  Let me know.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:32):**  And but ask your questions if you if you have them.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:38):**  Don't be shy.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:44):**  Oh, there's Matus.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:18:57):**  Let's do Matus first and then we jump to Magdalena.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:02):**  Thank you and thank you for the work you are doing.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:05):**  I don't have any particular burning specific question when it comes to investing in regenerative  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:09):**  Al, but I am curious about.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:11):**  Hey, I think or not.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:13):**  I do.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:14):**  I do.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:15):**  And carbon credits.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:16):**  And no, but I'm curious to know what's your greatest challenge in the world you are doing.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:22):**  Right.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:23):**  What what what are you struggling day to day personally in building this community and  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:29):**  informing and encouraging investment flows into regenerative Al.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:34):**  That's a very good question.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:35):**  OK, let me let me think about that while we're answering the question of Magdalena and then  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:39):**  we'll come back to that because I have a few, but probably you'll be.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:43):**  Yeah, I will.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:45):**  I will come back to that.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:46):**  So I like that.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:47):**  Thank you.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:49):**  In the chat, Magdalena wrote, what's in your opinion, the argument that most convinces  
**[0:19:53-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:19:53):**  farmers to move to regenerative as they operate on very thin margins and increased profitability  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:00):**  or the expert of the aspect of reduced climate risk?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:03):**  So there are a number of I mean, if you, for instance, read what's the book called The  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:10):**  Call of the Reed Wobbler of Charles Massey.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:13):**  He is a farmer based in Australia.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:16):**  He documents a number of, I think, seven or eight case studies of farmers moving.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:22):**  And actually, it's the same with Kate Brown.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:23):**  You see many, maybe of the earlier ones, the early ones that make the transition or are  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:28):**  in the transition because nobody's done.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:30):**  Ten, fifteen years ago, they moved out of necessity because they simply hit a wall.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:35):**  Their margins run out and they couldn't they couldn't buy the inputs anymore.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:40):**  They couldn't buy all the inputs anymore.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:41):**  So they were forced to figure out, okay, cover crops are cheaper.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:45):**  Let's experiment with that.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:46):**  They were they were their hands were forced.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:48):**  Now we are in a different world, I think, ten, fifteen years later.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:51):**  And there's a lot more information.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:53):**  First of all, online, you can discover and learn and you can dive deep into many of these.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:20:58):**  Obviously, it's not the same following a Kate Brown or Richard Perkins or somebody online  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:03):**  as doing a course or actually having an experience that grown missed on your farm.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:08):**  But I think now it's becoming more the pull factor.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:11):**  And previously it was much more to push factor of people literally farmers not being able  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:17):**  to change and not being able not to change because they had to either you were going  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:20):**  bankrupt.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:21):**  And obviously very place dependent.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:24):**  So now I see more farmers that are seeing their yields starting to top or starting actually  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:31):**  to go down in many of the most advanced commercial agricultural lands.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:35):**  And they see their input costs going steadily up.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:38):**  So they see those two lines are somewhere, hopefully connecting.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:44):**  They're not touching yet, but in some cases they are.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:47):**  And they start to think, OK, how can I if how can I either improve the yield or push  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:51):**  the input costs or inputs down?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:53):**  And that's a long journey.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:54):**  You can kind of do that from one day to the other.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:21:57):**  But it's it's often out of necessity.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:02):**  But I think many more farmers now start to see the business opportunity.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:05):**  They start to see the specialty crop markets, depending a bit on their size.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:10):**  They start to see I mean, we're in a huge food crisis at the moment where anybody that  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:14):**  sells directly to consumers is doing amazingly.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:16):**  And everybody that sells directly to restaurants and food services is having to change overnight.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:22):**  So there are a lot of opportunities as well.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:24):**  You see big companies, general meals, the known actually during long term contracts  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:28):**  with certain farmers.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:29):**  So I think now the opportunity becomes more interesting.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:31):**  And then obviously the carbon part, the water part and the biodiversity part aren't there  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:36):**  yet the markets, but we see the first movements.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:39):**  So I think we're switching now sort of I have to change because of out of necessity to I  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:46):**  see a better opportunity.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:48):**  And I think there are a number of ways we can learn from that.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:52):**  I think one of obviously for anybody, it really depends on the crop type.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:56):**  It depends on where you are.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:22:57):**  But speak to your farmers locally, like find farmers, spend time with them.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:01):**  Because that's where you learn by far the most.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:04):**  I think the wine industry is funny enough somewhere we can learn.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:07):**  I mean, if there's any industry where they're really good at selling soil, in this case  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:11):**  there are, it's definitely the wine industry and the higher end ones build that story around  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:16):**  place and you know that this type of grape grown in different region, everybody knows  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:22):**  that it doesn't taste the same, but somehow we think that the tomato should be.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:26):**  So there's a lot to learn there.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:28):**  And you see a lot of them have been working the soil very differently and pure for quality,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:33):**  maybe not for the carbon part, maybe not for other reasons.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:37):**  But I think there's a lot to learn there.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:38):**  So we definitely talk to a big group of grain farmers if you want to know more about that.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:43):**  Talk to a group of vegetable farmers or produce and try to figure out.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:48):**  But I think, I hope at least, that I see the first signs.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:51):**  We're starting to switch to a more opportunity pool than it was a push before.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:23:57):**  But I mean, I heard stories where in this, I think third year of drought in the Netherlands  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:02):**  and in Germany, so a lot of farmers will be pushed unfortunately as well because it's,  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:07):**  yeah, we're in literally in crazy times.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:10):**  Does that answer your question?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:14):**  Yeah, that answers quite well.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:17):**  Thank you.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:18):**  And then to Mateusz, the biggest, I mean, time is an easy answer, I would say the biggest  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:28):**  struggle, but I think bigger because I showed it yesterday to someone.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:32):**  Like I have a list of more than 200 interviews I would like to do.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:36):**  And it doesn't include the check-in ones that I would love to check in back with Michio  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:40):**  on common land and see how XYZ is doing.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:43):**  So I think a struggle, but it's a luxury problem because I know many podcasters that have a  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:48):**  an issue of finding new stories.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:51):**  I don't have that issue at all.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:53):**  Thanks to many of you that have been suggesting great people to interview.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:24:56):**  So it's more figuring out what to focus on and which ones to interview than it is to  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:03):**  finding interviews, et cetera.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:06):**  And that's a good struggle to have, but it's also, I mean, we're probably going to release  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:14):**  an episode a week over the next months because there are just too many that I need to do  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:18):**  and I would like to do to stick to the every two week schedule.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:23):**  So I hope we'll manage to scale it up and it simply means more time, obviously some  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:27):**  investments in terms of editing.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:30):**  But that's okay.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:31):**  I mean, we have the pipeline.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:32):**  So one struggle is I think selecting which ones.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:36):**  Another one, a lot of people are asking for investment advice or asking where do I find  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:42):**  investors like Thomas is doing and I don't really have a perfect answer.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:45):**  Like it's would be great if I have a list and say, okay, of course these people are  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:48):**  interested in that.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:49):**  These people are interested in that.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:51):**  The truth is that there's simply, there is interest.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:54):**  There's definitely interest.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:55):**  It's not all public.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:56):**  It's not all easy to access.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:25:58):**  They're not, there's not a nice public directory that's up to date.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:02):**  I mean, there's some small lists, et cetera, but it's very difficult to answer that question  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:06):**  and I would love to, it's like, I mean, make introductions and I mentioned people, but  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:11):**  the flow of capital would be nice if that speeds up.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:15):**  But it's not easy.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:16):**  I mean, people are raising capital for something in Australia, which is very different from  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:19):**  an ag tech investment in Germany and it's all falls on the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:23):**  and food hat.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:24):**  So our umbrella.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:25):**  So it's not so easy to do that, but I think, yeah, that that's sort of, it would be easier  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:30):**  if that flows faster, but I think it shows where we are in the sector.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:34):**  And a big struggle for me personally is the number of times I get approached from someone  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:40):**  in selling an input base, like a biological that could replace some other inputs, chemical  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:46):**  input.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:47):**  And I had a discussion on that with yesterday actually, and a lot of people, yeah, it would  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:50):**  be great to do this interview about this one ingredient that can help millions of farmers  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:55):**  to replace XYZ.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:26:56):**  And I simply had no idea if that's true.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:00):**  It usually sounds like magic.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:01):**  So probably it's not like I don't have the background or the context to, to understand  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:05):**  the biological side of things.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:07):**  So to understand that this input company is actually doing something interesting, or it's  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:11):**  just a lot of blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:13):**  And they're trying to build a big input company.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:16):**  So I really, I'm always trying to be friendly when I answer to that.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:19):**  Like I don't know.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:20):**  And if I do one, I have to do more.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:22):**  And if I do one interview in this space, in the biological space, like the input space,  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:28):**  I probably need a framework to decide which one, because if I get 10, I cannot do all  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:31):**  of them.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:32):**  So that's, that's a personal struggle.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:33):**  Like the input space, I really don't understand enough about to, to, to make a judgment call  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:39):**  of let alone to invest.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:41):**  I mean, I'm not investing in this space.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:43):**  I'm a retail investor.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:45):**  But let alone to, to interview someone in that space.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:48):**  It all sounds amazing.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:49):**  It all sounds like magic.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:50):**  Like they can replace all the chemicals you want and the plants grow twice as fast, et  
**[0:27:55-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:55):**  cetera.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:27:56):**  And, and I just don't have the context to, to decide on that.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:00):**  Apart from that, I think in the space we see, um, enormous growth.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:05):**  I think there are enormous opportunities now.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:08):**  There's still a lot of discussion.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:10):**  Um, I mean, with the podcast, I try to both focus on the, the soil people, like people  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:16):**  that are working the land, people that are setting up businesses, people that are making  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:20):**  regenerative agriculture grow.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:22):**  And I'm trying to focus on the investor side of things.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:25):**  So the finance people, the London city people, the Milan people, the Wall Street people,  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:30):**  et cetera, and to get them enthusiastic about soil.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:32):**  I think the challenges on both sides are pretty much similar.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:35):**  Like it's very difficult for Wall Street people to imagine what is possible with agriculture  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:41):**  unless they've seen it.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:42):**  So they need to go quite deep and they need to read the books, but visit the farm, spend  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:45):**  a lot of time on the land to see what's possible.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:48):**  And when that happens, they go.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:49):**  But until that moment, they, they're stuck in, yeah, but organic yields less and they're  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:54):**  stuck in these pieces that, that are very difficult to, to answer.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:28:58):**  So to get finance people to understand the potential here, but also the limitations and  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:03):**  the flexibility we need.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:04):**  And that's definitely a challenge.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:07):**  And the other challenge from the other side is the, to get soil people to understand finance  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:11):**  a bit more or to at least trust or to at least be interested in it is also a challenge.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:16):**  So on both sides, I've tried to be that bridge.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:18):**  And that it's definitely a challenge to, to see what's possible with money when handled  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:23):**  well and to see what's possible with agriculture.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:24):**  So both worlds are, need to meet a lot more.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:27):**  So my usual answer is always go and visit some farmers, especially the more advanced  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:32):**  ones, spend a lot of time there and you will learn a lot.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:36):**  Anyway, I've been talking about, does that answer your question?  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:41):**  It does.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:42):**  Thank you.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:43):**  Thank you for providing multiple, you know, perspectives on, on, on that one question.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:48):**  And as Thomas had mentioned previously, thank you for the work you are doing in being the  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:54):**  bridge.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:55):**  And you've also mentioned in this call a three year drought.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:29:59):**  I can only agree with that.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:01):**  That's exactly what we are experiencing in Poland, but it's a year another one.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:05):**  Good for the hay, of course, it's price, but you know, for everyone buying that hay, things  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:11):**  are not, not looking nice, but what's your biggest challenge at the moment?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:17):**  Our biggest challenge is, so just, just into, because I know who you are, but just to, just  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:24):**  to, um, very brief introduction, who are you?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:30):**  And I mean, you were in Poland, you mentioned, but for anybody that doesn't know.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:33):**  So I am a farmer being involved in the family operation of, uh, 700 hectares, uh, uh, of  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:41):**  organic, uh, grassland.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:44):**  And I am also working as a, as an investor with a VC fund based in Poland dedicated to  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:48):**  act tech and I'm involved in that in a set of agricultural projects all around the world,  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:30:54):**  mainly in emerging markets, uh, which deal with, you know, bridging or bringing capital  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:00):**  to those projects in the forms of, uh, debt or equity or both.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:05):**  And, and then on the farm level, uh, you know, the biggest challenge, and it always was like  
**[0:31:10-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:10):**  that is predictability of, uh, of, uh, government policy, both, you know, the Polish national  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:18):**  government, which is a translation of common agriculture policy of the EU, uh, and kind  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:24):**  of figuring out your way within that.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:27):**  Uh, and as, as much as we are, let's say happy with where the EU policies going and how,  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:34):**  uh, how it is being shaped.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:37):**  Uh, there are always fine details in translation of that policy into the national law.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:43):**  Um, we sometimes surprises us and let me put it that way.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:47):**  And the understatement, which is an understatement, I think.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:31:52):**  I mean, let's not get into that because anyway, um, um, and then the biggest opportunity that  
**[0:32:01-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:01):**  we see, or maybe I see within our family business is, uh, placing the carbon that we are storing  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:09):**  on the market.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:10):**  And of course, you know, short term, the idea is, okay, let's make more money on that.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:16):**  But in the, let's say more advanced scenario, more ambitious one, I would like to use that  
**[0:32:22-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:22):**  as a, as a tool for, um, let's say reshaping, uh, both the Polish agriculture scene and  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:30):**  more broadly European to more regenerative agriculture, because once you start measuring,  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:34):**  okay, how are we doing with carbon flows and how we can improve, uh, then things will move  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:40):**  in the, in the right direction.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:42):**  And you've interviewed Chuck from, uh, soil capital, who's doing wonderful work in that,  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:47):**  in that particular, um, you know, uh, domain.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:50):**  Um, yeah, so that's the logic.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:54):**  They just released a nice research.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:55):**  Let me see if I can get it up in two seconds.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:32:58):**  I must go on.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:01):**  I'd share that on LinkedIn as well.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:05):**  It's quite interesting.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:06):**  Let me put it in the chat for anybody that wants to read a bit more on profitability,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:11):**  farming, regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:13):**  It's a question we always get, obviously like, is it more profitable or does it actually  
**[0:33:16-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:16):**  work?  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:17):**  And they've been showing with a group of farmers in Belgium that the farmers, they follow the  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:21):**  most profitable ones are actually also the most regenerative ones, which is, doesn't  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:25):**  mean that you're more profitable because you're a generative, obviously there's nothing, but  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:29):**  it does signal something interesting that it's at least it's possible.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:33):**  Um, just to get to a question of Chen, sorry, I missed that one before because there were  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:37):**  two questions coming in at the same time.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:39):**  Are there critical technologies that would enable regenerative agriculture to be more  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:42):**  widely adapted?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:43):**  And if so, um, what are those that are promising?  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:48):**  Very good question.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:49):**  I think we do miss a number of crucial technology parts and one is definitely, I mean, Mattos  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:33:55):**  presented, um, an easy, reliable way to measure soil carbon on a farm level.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:01):**  So not just on one piece of like one square meter.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:04):**  And we have a lot of different ways.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:05):**  They all give different answers and we're going to figure out how to model that and  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:10):**  how to make that into one, um, one number.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:12):**  But it seems that the level of carbon in your soils is a good proxy for a lot of other things.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:18):**  Um, a good proxy for biodiversity, both above and in your soil and a lot of other interesting  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:24):**  things.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:25):**  We definitely have to measure other things, but if we could do that structurally and consistently,  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:32):**  that would be great.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:34):**  So there, there, there is an investment case.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:37):**  They're an ag tech case, let's say on the soil organic matter.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:41):**  Um, it's very tricky because it flows during the year.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:44):**  So it goes up and down.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:45):**  It's literally the soil breathes, I think we can say as a, um, as an analog to the human  
**[0:34:50-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:50):**  body.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:51):**  So to get that stable and to get a good number that you can actually pay out on, like, look,  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:55):**  you start X tons of carbon, you removed it from the atmosphere.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:34:59):**  It's still there.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:00):**  We can measure it and now we can pay $15, $20, et cetera on that.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:04):**  So that would be really, really nice.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:07):**  Um, go ahead.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:12):**  Go ahead.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:13):**  That's very insightful.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:15):**  And the second piece I would personally love to see, I don't have the prototype here, but  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:19):**  next versions of the bio nutrient meter and other devices that measure a nutrient density.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:26):**  So to really make the case, healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy gut systems, and  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:31):**  healthy people.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:32):**  And then obviously healthy ecosystems.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:34):**  Um, we see the experiments there from tick origin, which is actually the best of this  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:38):**  in the episode, um, on nutrient non density because most of the episode was about what's  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:43):**  not in food.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:44):**  Um, we see other pieces with Joe Clepperton.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:46):**  We see Dan Barber making moves.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:48):**  We see, but it's still all very, very early stage.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:51):**  And to be able to measure also as a farmer during the year, if you're having annual crop,  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:56):**  like what's happening in the crop and what's happening in the leaves, what's happening  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:35:59):**  in the fruit, what's happening, whatever you're growing and would be very interesting and  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:03):**  connecting that back to the soil management.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:05):**  And obviously as consumer, I would be super interested to know what's actually in the  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:09):**  food and then get that connection.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:11):**  Like does it, um, would this food be nutritious for me or not, which very much depends where  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:16):**  you live, which very much depends on your, your own microbiome.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:19):**  So we're going to see a lot of that soil microbiome, what's in your food and your gut microbiome.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:25):**  And that's, there's going to be a lot of new super foods, but I think that that's sort  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:29):**  of a useless term because the super food really depends on where you are and what kind of  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:34):**  soil management is there.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:36):**  So there are also technology measurement, good protocols, good software to translate  
**[0:36:40-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:40):**  that into something that we as consumers or the farmer can use to change their behavior.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:47):**  That would be another piece that I would love.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:49):**  And then the third technology piece, but it's, I haven't seen too much on that is on the  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:52):**  landscape size.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:53):**  Like how do we get this even on big farms, how do we get this from a farm to farm level?  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:36:59):**  Like we're going to change this farm more regeneratively, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:02):**  How do we get that to a landscape level?  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:03):**  And I think common land is one of the few organizations working on that, not really  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:08):**  with the technology angle, mostly with the social angle, like what's happening in this  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:11):**  landscape, in this river shed, watershed, what's happening in this bio regional system.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:16):**  And I think we're going to hopefully see technology helping us to make decisions of what to plant  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:21):**  where and why, like which element trees should be where, and do we want that to help clean  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:27):**  up a river?  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:28):**  Do we want that to grow elements like to make these fundamental decisions on a landscape  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:32):**  level, not just on a farm level.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:34):**  And there, I have not seen, I mean, we're going to see for sure climate model, satellite  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:39):**  using, but can we use technology to answer that very fundamental question, like what  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:44):**  to plant where and why, especially if we're dealing with trees, they're going to be there  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:48):**  for a while.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:49):**  Like they're not animals, you cannot move them next week if that happens to be useful.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:54):**  No, you plant them for 20 years or plus, and that means you need to be very sure where  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:37:59):**  to plant them as we are in a climate that's changing, as we are in a landscape that's  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:03):**  changing.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:04):**  And I think technology won't replace us in a sense.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:07):**  Like I think they're very good regenerative designers.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:09):**  They're indigenous peoples that have an amazing amount of knowledge to how a landscape should  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:16):**  look or could look.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:17):**  But I think we can augment that with a lot of the climate models and with a lot of technology  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:21):**  over the next years to help make better decisions.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:26):**  That's very helpful.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:27):**  Thank you.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:28):**  Thank you so much for the question.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:32):**  And then do you have any startup companies in region X-Base?  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:35):**  Maclena is asking that you're particularly excited about right now.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:39):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:42):**  I mean, I'm biased towards one in the Netherlands as I'm an advisor, which is Soil Heroes.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:48):**  I'll put it in the chat.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:49):**  I will interview them over the next few months, a few, like at least once or twice.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:38:56):**  I'm excited about it because it might trigger this market of carbon biodiversity and water.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:04):**  I just interviewed another player in that market, Nori in the US, which I'm actually  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:09):**  a customer because I bought last year my soil removal credits or my carbon removal credits  
**[0:39:14-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:14):**  for them and they reached out.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:15):**  And so I'm definitely enthusiastic with them as a customer.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:19):**  As an investor, I don't know.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:20):**  I haven't done any work with them or as a potential investor.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:25):**  What are companies?  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:26):**  It's a good question in terms of AgTech.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:33):**  I think any company, honestly, that's starting or trying to tackle this food piece, like  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:39):**  companies, new food startups that are really going after the nutrient density and trying  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:44):**  to explain that to consumers, which is not easy whatsoever.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:47):**  But I would love to see more experimentation there.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:49):**  How do we as a sector explain this very complex, very interesting soil story to a consumer  
**[0:39:56-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:56):**  in a supermarket or consumer in a shop?  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:39:58):**  How much time do you have?  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:00):**  And I think Tomas has experience with that actually in terms of elements.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:03):**  How do you explain this goes beyond organic?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:06):**  And how do you explain with every package of elements you actually, or with every spread  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:10):**  you buy, you actually build soil?  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:13):**  That's going to be a very important piece of this puzzle to make sure that the general  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:18):**  consumer is interested in good food, better food, et cetera, but doesn't have the time  
**[0:40:23-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:23):**  to go very deep, pun intended, into the soil.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:27):**  How do we explain that to them and how do we make sure that we get buy-in from the general  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:33):**  consumer?  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:34):**  Because if we don't, we can never reach the impact we want to have.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:39):**  So I haven't seen too many food companies that really proudly say soil on their packaging  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:43):**  or start to explain that.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:45):**  We've seen General Mills doing something in the US, Danone doing something, but it's still  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:51):**  very, very nascent.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:52):**  And I think we're going to see interest from the superfoodies, the ones that are really  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:57):**  interested in nutrients.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:40:58):**  I hope to see some movements there to see if we can get consumers to buy into this,  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:04):**  which we sort of do when you buy locally and you buy at your farmer's market, you buy for  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:07):**  taste, et cetera.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:08):**  But in the processed or more processed space, I haven't seen too many companies that are  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:14):**  really tackling that.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:16):**  I would be excited to see that.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:17):**  I haven't seen too much in terms of he's forming a company.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:22):**  So I would say the BioNutrient Meter, like the Ben Kittrich is on the journey from a  
**[0:41:28-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:28):**  foundation to a for-profit.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:30):**  When that happens, I will be very excited about the company.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:33):**  Until now, it's a foundation.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:34):**  So I can, I mean, I'm also excited about that.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:36):**  But that again comes to the nutrient density measurement part.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:40):**  Peak origin, definitely on an interesting journey on the measurement of mostly in larger  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:45):**  supply chains, the nutrient density.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:50):**  And then, I mean, it's geeky, but I'm very excited about the Perennial Fund as an investment  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:55):**  structure.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:41:56):**  Very interested in carbon yield, which is a similar structure there people are experimenting  
**[0:42:01-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:01):**  with.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:02):**  I'm quite excited about a number of crowd investing platforms.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:07):**  I still have to interview Go Stewart, but there's one in France I would love to interview  
**[0:42:12-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:12):**  to give people, normal retail investors like me and you, to invest in a local farm that's  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:19):**  in transition.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:20):**  I would love to be able to do that.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:21):**  It's one of the reasons I'm doing the podcast because I can't invest in many of these things.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:24):**  Like where can I put 100 euros to work to actually help this transition?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:29):**  So any crowd investing, democratization of impact investing in this space, I'm following  
**[0:42:36-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:36):**  very focused just because I would love to see that blossom because I think we need it.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:43):**  Not too many interviews I've done yet, but there are some on the roll over the next months  
**[0:42:47-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:47):**  to explore that a bit more.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:49):**  What does this mean for your average investor that can put a few thousand, but cannot put  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:55):**  a hundred thousand?  
**[0:42:56-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:56):**  Thanks.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:42:57):**  Can you just repeat the name of the peak origin you said?  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:03):**  Yes, peak origin.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:04):**  I will put it in the peak origin.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:09):**  And it's the interview.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:10):**  Let me find it.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:11):**  It's actually the most listened interview and we didn't understand why, which because  
**[0:43:16-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:16):**  suddenly just before Christmas last year, it went up in the streaming data basically.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:23):**  And we were wondering what was happening.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:26):**  And it's the interview with Greg Schumacher.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:27):**  I'll put it in the chat.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:30):**  And it turned out that John Kempf, who we interviewed as well of advancing eco agriculture  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:35):**  mentioned it in his newsletter as an interview to definitely listen to.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:39):**  But I saw the newsletter like a few months later because I was checking it and I suddenly  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:43):**  thought, ah, okay, that's why he suddenly picked up.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:46):**  So it has over, I think we're at 2000 streams or something, which is by far or which is  
**[0:43:51-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:51):**  the most listened episode so far, which shows, I think the interest for people in nutrient  
**[0:43:58-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:58):**  density.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:43:59):**  It's more than 2000 actually.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:01):**  And they are mostly on the larger supply chain.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:03):**  So they work with big supermarkets to measure in their supply.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:07):**  If you buy X tons of apples, normally a supermarket doesn't just mentions the sugar level they're  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:14):**  looking for, but they'll mention anything about nutrients because they don't have the  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:17):**  capacity to measure.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:18):**  And they are introducing that capacity to measure when your apples are arriving to actually  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:23):**  see how fresh they are, to see what kind of nutrients are still left in.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:27):**  And he made two very interesting, which I keep repeating all the time.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:31):**  In terms of, we looked at apples and spinach, they mostly looked at, and they mentioned  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:36):**  in terms of spinach, like how many days does it take for the nutrients to be gone?  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:40):**  Basically after you harvest your green leaves, mostly spinach, but this is in general for  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:45):**  green leaves.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:46):**  And it takes about seven days, meaning that if your green leaves, your spinach is harvested  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:51):**  in California, if you live in the US and it's shipped to New York, the moment it arrives  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:44:55):**  there, it's pretty much empty, which makes a very interesting case for a regional, local,  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:00):**  fresh mostly like freshness of food, apparently for the nutrient density, for how many nutrients  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:04):**  are in it is very, very important.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:07):**  The same with apples.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:08):**  If you eat apples, let's say they're harvested in fall and you eat them now, we're in April  
**[0:45:12-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:12):**  now, you can be pretty sure whatever way they store it, that it's pretty much water and  
**[0:45:18-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:18):**  sugar.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:19):**  And Greg made the joke, it's better than the Snickers, but it's pretty much water and sugar.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:23):**  It tastes nice, I mean, there's sugar in it, but if you want to eat it for the health reasons  
**[0:45:27-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:27):**  and benefits, probably you can eat something else.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:31):**  And so I think we're going to, with them, we're going to discover a lot of things we  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:35):**  probably didn't want to know about the food system, that many cases we buy something and  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:40):**  it's just mostly water and there's not too much nutrient in it anymore.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:45):**  And they are now slowly, they're a small company, but they're slowly start looking into the  
**[0:45:48-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:48):**  management side of things as well.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:50):**  So how does the soil management changes the end nutrients in the supermarket or how does  
**[0:45:57-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:45:57):**  it first of all, and then the second question is obviously how, and so that will be very,  
**[0:46:00-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:00):**  very interesting, something I'm definitely going to check in with them.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:03):**  They've mostly focused on normal supermarket, organic versus non-organic, but normal traditional  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:08):**  commercial large scale industrial agriculture and just showing the differences between them.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:13):**  They're onto something quite interesting.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:15):**  Based in Boston.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:18):**  Okay.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:19):**  Yeah, thanks.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:20):**  I will definitely check them up.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:21):**  That sounds super interesting.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:22):**  I haven't heard of them yet.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:24):**  Yeah, they're quite in stealth mode, honestly.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:27):**  They haven't been too open.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:29):**  I think they launched a database recently, so you can see actually they've been measuring  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:34):**  I think the top 20 fresh produce you could buy in the US in the supermarket and they've  
**[0:46:40-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:40):**  been measuring different supermarkets against each other.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:43):**  Who actually had, over the different weeks, like who had which apples in which supermarket  
**[0:46:48-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:48):**  had the most nutrients.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:49):**  So it's quite interesting what they are up to.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:52):**  Which company is that?  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:54):**  Teak Origin.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:46:55):**  So it's the one, it's the last interview I put in the chat and it's the name basically.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:06):**  And Teresa is asking, let me see if I didn't miss anything.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:08):**  Oh no, Thomas, sorry.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:09):**  Speaking of investments, I lately recognized a lot of miscommunication and misinterpretation  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:13):**  between startups as an investor when it comes to raising capital.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:17):**  Have you heard, if you hear about NDVC or would like to know your thoughts about their  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:24):**  alternative investment model and could it be applied to region egg?  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:29):**  So NDVC is the one I mentioned before that works in the software.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:33):**  So they mostly invest in software as a service companies that basically need money to grow,  
**[0:47:37-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:37):**  but they are generating cash.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:39):**  Like it's not, they're looking for a business model.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:42):**  I think the short answer is yes, we're going to see a lot more.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:45):**  But what I think about their structure, I mean, I haven't invested with them and they  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:49):**  haven't invested in me, but I've been following them for a while for the reason that they  
**[0:47:53-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:53):**  are innovating on investments.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:47:54):**  Like they are challenging the normal Silicon Valley way of investing.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:00):**  Like we invest a lot and we hope for an IPO, I'm paraphrasing here, obviously, and they  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:05):**  are investing in companies that are actually generating capital can actually pay back the  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:09):**  capital out of free cash flow, out of profit sharing, out of something.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:14):**  Their terms are completely public, so anybody can go to GitHub, can go to their website  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:17):**  and actually see how they invest, which I think is very, very interesting.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:21):**  And what I think is very interesting and what we can learn in terms of region egg and food  
**[0:48:25-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:25):**  is that they have built an exit in the investment.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:27):**  So from the beginning, the moment we enter into an agreement, the exit is already built  
**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:32):**  into the investment structure.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:34):**  So there's no waiting for a big fund to buy us.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:37):**  There's no waiting for an IPO.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:39):**  We know that if we hit these milestones, we'll pay back that, that goes back to the investor  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:43):**  and we up to a maximum of a certain return, which is also discussed in advance.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:48):**  So I think those type of discussions to build in the exit into the investment is something  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:48:57):**  that's very, very important and very interesting for the region egg and food space because  
**[0:49:01-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:01):**  it sort of solves a lot of the issues of traditional equity and traditional debt, which is not  
**[0:49:07-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:07):**  flexible and traditional equity, which obviously needs an exit.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:11):**  And I will put another link in the chat, which I just found also because it's similar to  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:16):**  the question Connie was asking.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:20):**  Impact terms, which is a project of Tonic actually where I spent a big chunk of my week  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:31):**  and the impact terms project or platform.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:33):**  And we have a quite a big database of alternative exit structures there.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:37):**  So please dive into that, have a look and definitely let me know if you have any questions.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:45):**  So does that answer your question?  
**[0:49:47-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:47):**  You're not.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:49):**  Okay, perfect.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:50):**  Then Teresa was asking a question, which country or region is the most advanced in regenerative  
**[0:49:56-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:56):**  agriculture?  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:49:57):**  Ooh, that's a tricky question.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:01):**  I think it seems, but I'm saying seems for a good reason that obviously Australia and  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:10):**  the U S is more advanced.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:11):**  My hunch is that because of communication and because of most of the books are written  
**[0:50:17-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:17):**  in English, most of the information comes from there.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:22):**  I don't know if, if you look at the acreage, if they're the most advanced, if we look at,  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:26):**  for instance, if we take organic as a, as let's say a step in the right direction, absolutely  
**[0:50:32-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:32):**  not perfect.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:33):**  And maybe Austria is the most advanced because they have the percentage wise, the largest  
**[0:50:38-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:38):**  organic acreage or Hector's in the world compared to how many, how much land they have.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:45):**  Maybe Sardinia in terms of in terms of Island, because most of it used to be organic.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:49):**  I mean, partly or recently that changed.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:51):**  So it depends a bit how you define it.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:53):**  I think they did a research that less than 1% of the agriculture land in the U S you  
**[0:50:59-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:50:59):**  could call sort of regenerative or on the way to regenerative and which is obviously  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:04):**  very, very low.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:05):**  So the short answer is none of the regions are super, super, super advanced, maybe some  
**[0:51:09-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:09):**  small countries and a good way, or maybe a way to look, okay, where are they considering  
**[0:51:16-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:16):**  soil more or have considered soil longer is probably to look at organic sales and organic  
**[0:51:23-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:23):**  and local organic rooms.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:25):**  I mean, what's the percentage of land that is organic doesn't mean that that's perfect,  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:29):**  but at least it provides a platform to go beyond because you have a group of farmers  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:33):**  that at least thinks differently in terms of input and output and think slightly differently  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:38):**  in terms of, in terms of soil management.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:43):**  Maybe Cuba.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:44):**  I mean, there are some countries that were sort of forced to, to not import because the  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:48):**  input costs were just simply too high or didn't arrive anymore.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:51):**  In the case of Cuba, when, when the Soviet union disappeared, they couldn't import many  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:51:55):**  of the inputs anymore and they were forced, which wasn't a fun process, but we're forced  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:00):**  to mostly be self-sufficient also in terms of fertilizer, et cetera.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:04):**  So they made a huge shift and actually are still, I think 75% or something is growing  
**[0:52:10-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:10):**  on the Island itself.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:12):**  So it's an interesting study and interesting case study.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:16):**  Okay.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:18):**  Okay.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:22):**  Okay.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:24):**  Any other questions?  
**[0:52:26-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:26):**  We have a few minutes.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:28):**  I mean, we have as long as we want, but the zoom line is open.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:36):**  And if not, I am going to thank you.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:38):**  I will definitely follow up obviously on this.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:42):**  I will put all the links we shared and the notes coming out of the chat and we'll share  
**[0:52:49-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:49):**  those with also the people that couldn't coin.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:52):**  Because this is obviously a horrible time for the U S and Latin America.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:56):**  But it's a, it works well for us.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:52:59):**  So I'm planning to do more of these.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:00):**  I don't know when yet, maybe in a month or so.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:02):**  I definitely will let you know.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:04):**  You can find more on the podcast on investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:09):**  You can find more on LinkedIn if you find me as well.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:11):**  And do send me a message with any, any questions I try to get to them.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:15):**  The influx of messages is increasing a lot lately, but it's a, it's, they're all, they're  
**[0:53:20-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:20):**  all interesting and good.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:21):**  So I get to them, it might take a few days.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:23):**  And that's a, that should be okay.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:25):**  If they're very, very urgent, put urgent in it and I might look at it a bit before.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:30):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:31):**  If that's it, wish you a great day, great evening, depending on where you are and thank  
**[0:53:36-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:36):**  you for, for your attention.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:39):**  Thank you.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:40):**  Thank you.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:42):**  Thank you.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:43):**  Bye bye.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:44):**  That's good.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:45):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:53:53-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:53):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:53:57):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:01):**  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  
**[0:54:05-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:05):**  audio, asking the question, how to put money to work in regenerating soils.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:09):**  And I've been following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:14):**  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:17):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  
**[0:54:19-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:19):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:22):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:24):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:54:26-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:26):**  And what questions should you ask?  
**[0:54:28-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:28):**  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:54:29-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:29):**  What should you read?  
**[0:54:30-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:30):**  What should you listen?  
**[0:54:32-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:32):**  What should you watch?  
**[0:54:33-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:33):**  How to approach this space for whom is this course?  
**[0:54:37-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:37):**  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[0:54:41-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:41):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:54:46-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:46):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line

**[0:54:54-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:54):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:54:58-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:54:58):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[0:55:03-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:03):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  
**[0:55:08-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:08):**  et cetera.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:09):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:55:10-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:10):**  No, this is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:13):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:17):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:55:22-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:22):**  different means.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:23):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:55:28-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:28):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:31):**  Thank you.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:32):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:55:33-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:33):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:40):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:42):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:55:47-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:47):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:55:52-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:52):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:55:56-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:56):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:55:58):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:56:03-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:56:03):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:56:07):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:56:12):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:56:13-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:56:13):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:56:15):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:56:17):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:56:21):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:56:23):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-29-2020/#t=0:56:28):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:00:36):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:00:37):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:43-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:00:43):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:00:44):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:00:49):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:00:54):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:00:59):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:01):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:05):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:07):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:12):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:17):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:21):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:25):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:28):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:33):**  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:38):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:42):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:47):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:54):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:57):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:01:58):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:02):**  I'm Koon van Seijen, your host.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:04):**  And in the podcast of today, I'm joined by Michele Manelli, CEO of Salchetto Winery from  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:08):**  Multipulciano Tuscany, Italy, one of the pioneers when it comes to sustainability and wine.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:13):**  And they're also B Corp.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:14):**  Welcome, Michele.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:15):**  Thank you for inviting me.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:18):**  And to start with a personal question, how did you end up in the biodynamic wine scene  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:24):**  in Multipulciano Tuscany?  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:26):**  Because you don't have a history from there.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:28):**  Well, it was a dream, simply to be a farmer, an entrepreneur and a politician.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:35):**  And so far, I think I kind of achieved all of them together by making wine, which is  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:44):**  a nice part of agriculture, quite rich of culture and complex.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:50):**  It's also a complex business.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:52):**  And so it's an enterprise.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:02:55):**  And at the same time, when you see and when you have a vision of your company that one  
**[0:03:06-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:06):**  will is to create a socially virtuous model and things that the business is a central  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:18):**  part of society in terms of possibly generating an overall value.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:24):**  And it's a relevant one for environmental matters, for social matters, then you become  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:30):**  also, you catch this political dimension.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:33):**  And you started about 20 years ago, I think you became head of the winery in 1970, if  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:40):**  I remember correctly.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:42):**  Did you start immediately with sustainability?  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:45):**  Or how did it start?  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:46):**  And where did that come from for you personally?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:49):**  No, actually, at the time, I definitely had my personal values.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:03:56):**  Even though I think that more than considering myself as someone actively at the time involved  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:06):**  in environmental challenges, for example, in general in sustainability challenges, which  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:10):**  was by the way, very, quite a boutique niche definition, you know, in the late 90s, it  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:17):**  was a starting point.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:20):**  And it was definitely not a common way to approach whatever I would say.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:28):**  I think I had a negative reaction.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:30):**  I was feeling that we needed to challenge the deterioration of our environment and our  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:40):**  society.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:41):**  And this was definitely my first challenge.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:43):**  And this was one of the reasons I wanted to try to do it from agriculture.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:48):**  By the way, as a privilege from a very nice corner of very, very pretty corner of the  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:04:56):**  world, which is Tuscany and the Montepulciano, particularly.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:05:00):**  And so I came here and I from the beginning, imagine to run organically to be inspired  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:05:08):**  by biodynamics.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:05:09):**  I started to build up the opinions together with pioneers such as Daniel Schuster, for  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:05:15):**  example.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:05:16):**  So there were values in the sense the way we wanted to create our relationship with  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:05:23):**  car, with workers or in general any stakeholder, let's say that there was a value.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:05:29):**  But then this consciousness of how it would have been important to create from the business  
**[0:05:36-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:05:36):**  change, grow further later in time, especially when I decided in the early 2000s to first  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:05:51):**  convert the company from a personal one to a public, sorry, to a limited one.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:05:57):**  And start a path of growth which would involve those investors and then also create some  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:05):**  bigger scale.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:07):**  That's when I really started to face the idea of how can I be more responsible in making  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:13):**  my business.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:15):**  And when it comes to, because at that time, the early 2000s, you brought on a number of  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:19):**  investors.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:20):**  What was the role of sustainability in that?  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:23):**  Or was it really still maybe part of the inside of the company and how did they respond to  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:28):**  your values in Latin, to your vision of where you wanted to bring this winery?  
**[0:06:34-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:34):**  Well, intuitively everybody was understanding that we had the part of our mission, the way  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:44):**  we were approaching the projecting of our company and our marketing mix in general.  
**[0:06:51-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:06:51):**  There was an attention, a special attention to these themes and it was intuitively appreciated.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:07:00):**  But it was never at the beginning considered a specific added value as it became furtherly.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:07:10):**  In some way, I have at the time particularly first brought up the skills of the company  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:07:18):**  in a more traditional way, keeping the transparency over this evolution.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:07:25):**  And then when it became clear that we were turning around into a specific direction,  
**[0:07:36-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:07:36):**  everybody was more than happy and more than interested in following this path.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:07:47):**  So you also not only brought the people in the company, the employees, etc. on this journey,  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:07:53):**  but you also took your investors on the journey.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:07:56):**  Oh yeah, definitely.  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:07:58):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:07:59):**  And then, I don't exactly know when, but you decided as well to try to influence not only  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:08:04):**  the 50 actors you have in Multipulciano and you manage, but also your neighbors and your  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:08:11):**  colleagues in the industry.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:08:12):**  Can you tell a bit more about this alliance of Vinum that you started in Multipulciano  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:08:17):**  to push for sustainability and to push the brand and the marketing around this really  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:08:22):**  old and sustainable tradition of winemaking?  
**[0:08:26-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:08:26):**  Well, the alliance is an extremely interesting project we are running and started a few months  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:08:34):**  ago of producers of multiple channels that want to try to lead some change, you know,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:08:41):**  probably an incubator or a think tank of innovation for the territory on the dimension of marketing  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:08:51):**  also, but sustainability and efficiency.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:08:55):**  Definitely the first step is try to recognize who we are and how we should approach our  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:09:02):**  being in Multipulciano territory.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:09:05):**  But before this, I would like to point out what we did as Arqueto and myself also in  
**[0:09:14-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:09:14):**  contributing to the growth of the know how and in sustainability of the wine value chain  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:09:25):**  in Italy, because together with many partners in the academics, in the scientific community  
**[0:09:32-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:09:32):**  and also certification bodies, governmental one, since now 2013 as an official group,  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:09:42):**  we have worked to build up a national standard for sustainability in wine.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:09:49):**  So to really put together all the experiences that were really, really many and very intense  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:09:57):**  that were run in wine in trying to create models of management of the sustainability  
**[0:10:04-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:10:04):**  in wine could find a common house or more specifically could find a common way to define  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:10:14):**  the borders of sustainability and the signs of sustainability then and also to create  
**[0:10:18-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:10:18):**  the tools for managing it along the chain and last but not least, being able to transparently  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:10:26):**  certify these approaches and communicate them to public.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:10:32):**  This was the real big mission that was run first by the forum for wine sustainability  
**[0:10:36-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:10:36):**  and which then led the way to Equalities, a company that is controlled by the consortio  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:10:49):**  of Italian wines, the federation of the consortio of Italian wines, Fedor Doc and also partnered  
**[0:10:55-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:10:55):**  by technical, let's say, supporters as CSQA, Valor Italia, the big certifiers for our food  
**[0:11:05-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:11:05):**  and wine industry or Gabriela Rosso as a communication leader in communication in this field in Italy  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:11:17):**  to create a national standard and it happened, it's extremely complete and interesting tool.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:11:24):**  It's now being diffused and I really dedicated a lot of energy in these last years to really  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:11:30):**  be able to have a common instrument where the whole industry could.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:11:34):**  When I mean all industry, I mean just basic agricultures, those who transform the big  
**[0:11:40-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:11:40):**  bottles or companies like ours which represent a piece of the cake too, not that control  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:11:49):**  the whole value chain and are maybe committed to high quality like we are so it's really  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:11:55):**  something for everybody.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:11:57):**  This was a great project that really I am very satisfied to see grow.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:12:05):**  And do you see that the fact that you have 20 years of experience of turning your company  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:12:10):**  around gives you extra credibility with your colleagues in the food sector in Italy that  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:12:16):**  you have a place that you can point to like look, it can be done, it's never finished  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:12:21):**  and it's a lot of work but you can put your personal values of sustainability actually  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:12:27):**  also in your company.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:12:28):**  Does it help to have that example?  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:12:30):**  Oh for sure.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:12:32):**  You know, whenever you go around I think that what is most, I mean, when I say go around  
**[0:12:41-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:12:41):**  we often are involved in conferences, seminars or whatever and I see how much it is important  
**[0:12:51-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:12:51):**  for anyone who is observing this process to imagine that it has been done, that it's  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:13:01):**  possible, that it's possible as you were saying to do it and to grow continuously and  
**[0:13:07-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:13:07):**  to keep being updated and in some way on the edge of the efficiency of the market success,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:13:20):**  the known world, etc. and also being extremely efficient in energy wise.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:13:26):**  We have done in 2009 and 2011 this extremely efficient seller in terms of energy and it's  
**[0:13:33-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:13:33):**  possible that we have done indexing in, as at the time, pioneeristically in carbon footprint  
**[0:13:41-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:13:41):**  and water footprint or biodiversity, all these things that are not just an academic hypothesis,  
**[0:13:50-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:13:50):**  when it becomes reality this brings an even greater value for another company that looks  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:13:59):**  into it or anyone involved in the value chain up to the consumer of course.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:14:05):**  And when you, let's say you meet a winery owner at one of the conferences you go to  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:14:10):**  and who hasn't done anything yet but is ready to move, I can imagine it's quite daunting  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:14:17):**  if you look at your winery and its 20 years of experience of turning it around, what would  
**[0:14:21-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:14:21):**  you advise him or her, where would you start, what would you do first and where do you begin?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:14:29):**  Well, if we would be talking by scratch, starting by scratch in the sense of nothing already  
**[0:14:39-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:14:39):**  happened because I think that creating a good control board, how can I say, a control panel  
**[0:14:50-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:14:50):**  sorry, so working a lot in the measurement or in the information management of the processes.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:15:03):**  To get a good overview of what's happening now.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:15:06):**  Yeah, I think this is very important.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:15:11):**  So imagining to create a solid control panel, a solid management of information because  
**[0:15:21-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:15:21):**  then everything becomes effective because okay, then you can decide.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:15:31):**  In the seller, when I'm projecting I am creating efficiency because I'm investing in renewable  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:15:39):**  and this and that but then once you start, if you don't have the possibility to control  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:15:44):**  what is effectively happened, you will never be able to understand if you're really achieving  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:15:51):**  and if your investment is working well, this is the concept.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:15:57):**  And I say it because of course in our industry, we are typically a little bit smaller so we  
**[0:16:03-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:03):**  tend to less care about these dimensions because we think that it's something that is...  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:11):**  For big companies.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:12):**  Yeah, for big companies.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:14):**  I think that generally the reporting is extremely important and of course that already start  
**[0:16:21-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:21):**  by reporting which is not only meant to report the economical dimension but all the others  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:29):**  too.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:30):**  So creating from scratch sustainability report just beside the annual economical one.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:38):**  In general, I would say that this is the point.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:42):**  You just have to start by considering that your company project is based on a wider value  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:48):**  that is not only the economical one.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:50):**  It must be an integrated, it must be harmoniously integrated and you have to always think that  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:55):**  anyway there is always a chance.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:16:57):**  There is always a chance to find a better solution for a process for whatever choice  
**[0:17:02-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:02):**  you have to make in your company management that contributes to all the dimension.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:14):**  I can't believe that there isn't.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:17):**  The point is just looking for it.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:19):**  And so if you want to be sure to look for it, you have to create a reporting system  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:25):**  and then you have to create an attitude and an approach to the business which is multi-dimensional.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:31):**  Which is agile, tinkering, constantly improving.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:35):**  Never be satisfied basically with what you have.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:37):**  It can always be done better.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:39):**  Exactly.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:40):**  And when it comes to your winery, you started with looking at energy, then you started looking  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:45):**  at water, biodiversity, you're measuring a lot.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:48):**  The water footprint and of course also the CO2 footprint of the bottles and then at the  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:53):**  end wine.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:54):**  What's the next step for Salcato?  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:17:57):**  What's the next step for you in terms of sustainability and regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:18:04-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:18:04):**  Well in the last 12 months I have finally started to work to innovate in the social  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:18:13):**  dimension.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:18:14):**  I think that of course I am very happy to have invested and innovated much more in the  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:18:20):**  previous 10 years in environmental matters because there was a need for that.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:18:27):**  There was a much more, you know, there was a higher expectation of innovation in this  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:18:34):**  field.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:18:35):**  But I think that was one of my dreams.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:18:37):**  I wanted to go higher, to meet higher standards of social management of the company.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:18:48):**  And by that I mean workers first and then community, local.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:18:57):**  Of course in the wider sense of community I have already done stuffs in the previous  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:02):**  years like these projects that I have reminded a lot of shared projects of research.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:07):**  And for example now we have introduced in 2017 a welfare plan.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:11):**  It's the first codified welfare plan for a wine industry in Italy.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:18):**  I'm very happy about that.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:20):**  And this will allow by the way to increase the benefits to our works and in some way  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:25):**  the overall remuneration with tax advantage which is also even efficient in terms of economics  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:32):**  which is very bright by the way regulation that in Italy is introduced and nobody knows.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:39):**  And so we have worked on this innovation and this is very interesting.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:45):**  We have worked for, now we have a plan for hosting children of the local primary and  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:53):**  schools.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:54):**  This is also very interesting.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:19:57):**  And by the way I know it's probably out of the topics but it's…  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:20:06):**  Nothing is out of the topic on this topic.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:20:08):**  Well you know just a few weeks ago I was in a meeting with a manager of a big winery here  
**[0:20:14-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:20:14):**  in the territory because we are also doing a project for technology transfer for sustainability  
**[0:20:24-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:20:24):**  for the other wineries of the area which is planning to create a software that will allow  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:20:33):**  any winery to manage the equalities standard so the sustainability standard with much more  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:20:38):**  easiness because it's a software.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:20:41):**  It's a very interesting project.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:20:42):**  And I was there with this manager whose son at eight years old visited the winery here  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:20:49):**  with the school, our winery.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:20:52):**  And he started saying you know since the kid went to visit your winery at home we speak  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:00):**  continuously about renewable energy and he asked me questions and he wants to put a solar  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:05):**  pad a little.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:06):**  It starts very early.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:07):**  And you know you melt down when someone tells you something like this.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:12):**  You really want just to…  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:14):**  You are like…  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:15):**  I don't know what to say.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:18):**  It was really one of the biggest satisfaction I had in the recent years honestly.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:24):**  That's it.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:26):**  So that is a bit of an next challenge.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:29):**  To get your influence beyond your farm gate.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:34):**  Of course you've worked with the wineries that may be a bit further away and with the  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:38):**  board to create a standard and now you're looking more and more into the other stakeholders.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:45):**  Yeah with local stakeholders and as I was saying workers.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:51):**  How many do you have?  
**[0:21:52-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:21:52):**  Well in this moment long term workers are 14 and with seasonal workers that I mean on  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:22:00):**  the touristic part only we get to 20 and then we have of course now since a few years we  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:22:07):**  don't have any more seasonal workers in the fields because it's now we have a very efficient  
**[0:22:13-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:22:13):**  offer of outsource labor for the peaks of work in the fields.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:22:23):**  And so that's where we…  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:22:24):**  And by the way this is also something we are working to.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:22:28):**  We are working to grow the quality, the standards also of our suppliers.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:22:39):**  We've always worked even accidentally.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:22:43):**  You know when in 2008 I think it was something like this.  
**[0:22:49-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:22:49):**  We decided to purchase only wood source materials from certified PFC or FSC chains which was  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:04):**  very pioneeristic at the time.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:07):**  It was very complicated to find the suppliers at the time you had to really… it took months  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:14):**  to find a guy that could make labels for us, cardboard boxes or anything.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:20):**  The corks was really tough.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:23):**  And what was very interesting is that over time the local suppliers started, that were  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:27):**  our previous ones, started to get certifications to service and then the certification was  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:34):**  spread around.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:35):**  And this is the thing so…  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:37):**  The impact of the pioneers.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:39):**  Yeah this is the impact of just making things, innovating, changing, creating the… starting  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:45):**  some of the process and then something happens.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:49):**  Even if we were super small suppliers, clients for all them.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:55):**  But you know it's a seed.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:23:57):**  And this is the same again for the social aspects that we want to transfer to the labor  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:04):**  companies.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:05):**  And this is very important.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:09):**  And is that something that let's say we'll talk again in a year from now, is that something  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:14):**  you want to look back at that you really made some big steps on the social part?  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:20):**  Will that be the focus of this year?  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:22):**  Yeah this is it.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:25):**  This is my focus now.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:27):**  And in terms of… when you're looking at barriers for… when your colleagues see you  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:34):**  doing it so successfully and as an example, what do you think is the barrier for many  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:38):**  of them to not doing it yet or maybe just started looking at it a few years ago and  
**[0:24:43-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:43):**  not 20 years ago?  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:44):**  What are the main barriers for this regenerative agriculture approach to scale in the wine  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:50):**  business?  
**[0:24:54-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:24:54):**  Well I think in some way you consider it not a priority because for some reason you think  
**[0:25:07-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:07):**  that it's not something that is going to bring direct value or not something that is more  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:14):**  important than something else.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:16):**  Then you don't have models to refer to.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:18):**  Not everybody is ready and has the attitude of going to the unknown.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:26):**  The process of innovation is something that requires some kind of violence that you have  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:35):**  to make.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:36):**  Any extraordinary action sometimes is something that needs special help for that.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:41):**  It's an attitude.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:42):**  It's legitimately not everybody should have.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:45):**  And so many need examples.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:48):**  Otherwise it would run into issues.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:50):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:51):**  Many.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:52):**  And also it's a kind of investment because you have to imagine that for especially bigger  
**[0:25:58-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:25:58):**  companies when they have to change a process that works and maybe makes money, it's a strange  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:06):**  investment you know.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:08):**  Or at least it's…  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:09):**  Yeah, how do you explain that to the family or to your investors and to the owners?  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:14):**  To the investors, exactly.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:16):**  Maybe there's one or two brothers and sisters and maybe the brother wants it but the sister  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:22):**  doesn't care about it.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:25):**  It can happen.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:27):**  And so this is definitely…  
**[0:26:30-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:30):**  So I think that bringing out examples and successful ones is an essential element of  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:39):**  diffusion of these good practices.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:42):**  And then of course there is also hopefully the idea that the market will help us because  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:26:56):**  if we start to offer, sometimes the manager requires an offer.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:27:02):**  So if we start to offer more and more it will be then a virtual circle that will generate  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:27:11):**  expectations in this sense from other companies.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:27:13):**  Have you seen, speaking of the market, have you seen that change a lot in the last 20  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:27:19):**  years?  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:27:20):**  For sure.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:27:22):**  For sure and I think that still today we are not seeing prevalence of consumers that are  
**[0:27:38-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:27:38):**  ready to choose, let's say, a sustainable product rather than another one because it's  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:27:48):**  sustainable.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:27:50):**  And I think that this will never happen or at least it's not ready to happen soon unless  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:27:55):**  something extremely radical changes in the society, I would say.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:28:00):**  I consider that though there are more and more people that are ready to put this value  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:28:06):**  beside other values, which is already something extremely important.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:28:11):**  And I mean, okay, the consumer is interested to have a good product in the sense, for example,  
**[0:28:19-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:28:19):**  in a wine must be quality at the right price with the right services around it, right packaging  
**[0:28:29-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:28:29):**  in terms of if you consider it as a service in some way, and sustainable as an added value  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:28:38):**  of the others.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:28:40):**  This is, I think, is the way to read the market today.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:28:45):**  And it is extremely important to read it this way because we are in front of what we were  
**[0:28:52-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:28:52):**  10, 15 years ago imagining only, which was that the point is not creating a green product.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:03):**  The point is making become a green product the economical product, you know, so making  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:10):**  the green product become the successful one, which is a totally different approach.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:16):**  So it doesn't even have to be co-green, and let's hope to be now almost, and it's quite  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:25):**  true, let's imagine to be beyond this point.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:29):**  The point is that we have to make the best product, which is also the best product for  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:34):**  the society and the environment.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:36):**  Yeah, the best product, which is by definition has to be green and sustainable.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:41):**  Exactly.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:42):**  And I think that this is the consumer that we have in front of us.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:46):**  Now in wine in particular, we see that the consumers, even in wine, are approaching this  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:29:56):**  theme just as for other products.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:30:00):**  We have, the problems are similar to other categories, are the definition of the sustainable  
**[0:30:09-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:30:09):**  product and the transparency of the proof, of the certification or confirmation process  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:30:20):**  of the sustainability skill.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:30:24):**  So basically this is the biggest problem, one of the two big problems.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:30:28):**  The second, I would say, is that we have a very fragmented typically offer and distribution.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:30:37):**  And in general, we have a big barrier to climb, which is our distribution channels.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:30:48):**  We see, and I don't know if it's similar for other categories, but we see that our distributors  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:30:53):**  are often, so the distribution chain, let's say in general, it's often the one which is  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:00):**  pulling back because again, they don't understand, so they don't invest in these skills.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:06):**  They don't know, they're not ready to really promote a product which has these skills because  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:13):**  they don't understand these skills.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:16):**  And so they don't want to put their face on it.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:19):**  What would be a solution for that fragmented distribution or the distribution channels  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:25):**  that are now maybe slowing it down or holding it back?  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:28):**  What do you see as a solution there?  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:30):**  In fact, I see the same solution as for the general problem of how to see growing sustainability  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:37):**  in our value chain.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:38):**  So it means, again, less standards, more solid.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:48):**  This is the point.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:50):**  So at least we have to freeze a little bit the situation and say, OK, this is sustainability  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:57):**  we have defined.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:31:58):**  These are the standards.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:00):**  And so we have to see them more visible in the market so that at least a dimension is  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:08):**  created.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:09):**  It's like organic today, for example.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:11):**  It took a while.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:13):**  But I'm sure, and I've seen some even last week, a little survey made by Rome University.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:21):**  They went out to say, what is not organic food or healthy food as we were imagining  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:27):**  10, 15 years ago being related to organic.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:29):**  They went and said, what is a sustainable food or why?  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:33):**  And the consumer said it's organic.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:36):**  Because it's the only label brand that is so well known.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:43):**  So now there is even further confusion because organic is not a sustainable system.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:48):**  It's just the best practice for farming.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:32:52):**  And it's even best practice, which is not considering best practice that is just limiting  
**[0:33:02-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:02):**  chemicals in the farm.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:04):**  But it's not at all talking about the first step.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:06):**  It's a little first step.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:07):**  It's not talking about energy.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:08):**  It's not talking about water.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:09):**  It's not talking about biodiversity management.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:12):**  It's not talking about social management.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:14):**  So they don't even care.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:17):**  They can't control.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:18):**  They don't control if you have, I'm sorry to be shocking, but if you have immigrant  
**[0:33:27-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:27):**  workers without any legal care or social care and paid half of the minimum wage, to make  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:42):**  an example, which suddenly happen.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:45):**  You can still be organic.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:46):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:47):**  Which suddenly happens in the world in today.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:33:52):**  And so this is something that is, so the first solution is this, is to be more organized  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:00):**  in governing this process of standard, transparency, and one label, one brand, or at least two  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:07):**  of them that talks the same language, et cetera.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:09):**  Which is what we are, as I was saying, we are trying to do as an industry.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:14):**  And with the qualities we have, we have a very, very good chance to make this, to make  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:20):**  a difference.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:21):**  And then once this is done, it's of course a matter of just, it happens by itself.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:31):**  It happens by itself.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:34):**  It's a cultural issue by the way.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:38):**  What do you mean by that?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:39):**  I mean that at the end we can't imagine, when I say culture, I just want to point that it's  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:47):**  a complex dimension that requires a diffuse knowledge.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:53):**  We have, you know, I make this example.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:34:57):**  When in the 60s, so after the war, the European Union partners imagined the system of the  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:05):**  wine appellations.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:07):**  They had a dream.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:09):**  They had a vision.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:10):**  The vision was we have to promote a quality agriculture.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:14):**  We have to also control it.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:16):**  But we have to really promote a quality agriculture that is going to be more healthy, more successful,  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:23):**  and valuable for the consumer and for the producer.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:26):**  So they were defining, in some way they were writing down on paper the rules to define  
**[0:35:32-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:32):**  a wine.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:33):**  They had to meet and say, okay, what is wine, and their common codification.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:37):**  Wine is made of grapes, certain alcohol.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:40):**  Then what is an appellation?  
**[0:35:42-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:42):**  Okay, it needs a territory.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:44):**  It needs a certain yield per hectare and maybe farm in a certain way.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:50):**  It requires a certain process of aging.  
**[0:35:53-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:35:53):**  And then it needs to meet specific requirements of, you know, biological parameters like alcohol,  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:01):**  acidity, et cetera.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:04):**  So they defined something that then became, okay, the identity.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:10):**  Then there were so many of them started to interpret it.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:13):**  I mean, I call them so many, but like a wine expert, like a journalist, okay, then this  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:17):**  appellation has this card because it's made of this grape in this territory.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:20):**  We did this descent.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:22):**  And they started to create a dimension of quality, you know, a language, codifying.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:29):**  It was something complex.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:31):**  There was a government involved political bodies, the industry of farming, but also  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:39):**  industry of services like media.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:42):**  And then the consumer started to get involved.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:45):**  They wanted to participate.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:46):**  They wanted to visit.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:48):**  They wanted to buy a course of wine or a book on wine.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:52):**  So in this sense, we can call this a culture.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:56):**  So I think.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:36:59):**  And that is what we have to aim as a vision to create.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:05):**  We need a new culture because sustainability.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:07):**  Today, it's for the last 20 years, it has been research and development has been, you  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:14):**  know, so it was a great it was fermentation, you know, a lot of fermentation around a lot  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:19):**  of projects, not the cows, but positive cows.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:23):**  Now we have to see the next step in which we codify and create the main signs so that  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:30):**  within these signs, within the new the new appellations, the appellations of sustainability,  
**[0:37:36-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:36):**  we can we can see with more order the growth of the all value chain and the industry, the  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:44):**  market in this sense.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:46):**  This is this is, I think, what we have to aim.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:50):**  And in some way we are doing it.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:52):**  Italy is Italy is working in this direction.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:54):**  It's working.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:56):**  Everyone is.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:37:57):**  But probably Italy is one of the most the most advanced country.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:05):**  It's hard to imagine sometimes.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:07):**  But it is.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:09):**  I would like to end with a final question on let's imagine and I hope so that a number  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:15):**  of smart impact investors are listening to this this podcast.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:20):**  And what would you tell them if they would like to get into the regenerative or the sustainable  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:26):**  winery or agriculture?  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:27):**  Let's let's look specifically at winery space.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:31):**  What what would be your advice to look for?  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:33):**  Maybe they're based in the US, maybe they're based in Europe, maybe they're based in South  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:37):**  Africa.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:39):**  What would be some of the questions you would ask if they want to invest in a winery?  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:43):**  What would be the questions you ask to a winery to see if they are they're truly sustainable,  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:48):**  they're truly thinking this holistically?  
**[0:38:50-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:38:50):**  Well, I would first of all, I would ask do you I would if I have to have a if I have  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:01):**  time, let's put it this way, not in the sense in our interview, but in my in my assessment  
**[0:39:07-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:07):**  of this company, I would I would start to understand the what is the general approach  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:15):**  of at the different level.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:17):**  So what is the knowledge of of the of the different tools that are existing today of  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:26):**  measurement and management of sustainability?  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:29):**  So what is the knowledge of what today are these these elements of this of this of this  
**[0:39:36-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:36):**  picture?  
**[0:39:37-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:37):**  Then I would then I would, of course, at the same time and as strongly try to understand  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:44):**  if they are solidly also basing their project on the knowledge of the market in the more  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:50):**  traditional way.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:51):**  So definition of quality, as we were saying before, efficiency and marketing, whatever,  
**[0:39:57-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:39:57):**  because I think that there must be today you have to develop a specific culture, as we  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:40:04):**  were saying before.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:40:05):**  So in anything in the sustainable approach.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:40:09):**  So I mean, knowing what is a carbon footprint, a water footprint, knowing how to implement  
**[0:40:14-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:40:14):**  these these indicators in your management and so on, being updated in these in these  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:40:23):**  know how very well updated.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:40:25):**  But on the other hand, never forgetting this probably at a financial investor level that  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:40:32):**  we are not creating, we're not selling carbon footprint, we're selling a good bottle of  
**[0:40:37-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/#t=0:40:37):**  wine first.

**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:00:48):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:00:53):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:00:55):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:00:59):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:01:01):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:01:06):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:02):**  Thank you so much for the invitation.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:04):**  We are so glad to be here with you and thank you for the introduction.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:08):**  Yeah, thank you Koen.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:09):**  I think you said everything about Pretatera already.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:11):**  I just took it from your website.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:13):**  So actually you said it.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:15):**  To start with a personal question, a bit of background on both of you.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:18):**  What brought you to regenerative agriculture, agroforestry?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:22):**  Why are you working on soil?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:24):**  Okay, so first of all, I am a biologist and a forest engineer and I started my work working  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:31):**  with forest regeneration, forest restoration and forest management as a biologist.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:38):**  And then afterwards I studied forest engineering so that I could understand how human beings  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:45):**  could manage the forest for their livelihoods.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:50):**  So the idea was that I understood that as human beings we couldn't just plant forests  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:02:58):**  to preserve it, but we should plant forests to produce, to make our living from it.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:04):**  And from that point on I started working with agroforestry systems or complex production  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:10):**  system that looks like the forest.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:12):**  So first I understood how the forest worked and then I started to plan productive systems  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:20):**  that were inspired in the forest.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:23):**  And that's how I started to work with soil, start working with regeneration and with agroforestry.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:30):**  Yeah, for me it was pretty much the same, but I'm a forest engineer, also a master in  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:36):**  agroforestry, MSc, I have an MSc in agroforestry.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:40):**  And I looked for this specific master to understand more about agroforestry.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:45):**  Since my first year of studies in the university as an engineer, I looked and studied a lot  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:51):**  about agroforestry, especially here in Brazil where we are now.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:03:56):**  There are things happening, not that much that are now, but there are a lot to do to  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:00):**  learn and I learned as much as I could.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:03):**  I went for this master, I learned even more.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:05):**  So then I started working in Africa where I did my thesis and everything and with communities.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:12):**  So I'm passionate about people and how things work and why they work and why they don't.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:18):**  So my real field of work is local knowledge.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:22):**  So understand why people do what they do and what they understand for the very nature that  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:28):**  you don't know how to systematize yet, but we can.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:33):**  So I started to study this as much as I could also.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:37):**  And agroforestry was always there, like it permeated all the fields of study I did.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:42):**  So I believe that everything you're going to do has to be with a scientific view, but  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:47):**  you have human livelihoods, local knowledge, overview of all this.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:53):**  So that's my passion on agroforestry.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:56):**  And was it easy to find a master on that?  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:04:58):**  I mean, you said I specifically searched for it, which sort of suggests it wasn't that easy.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:03):**  And the second part to the question was that livelihood focus and local community knowledge  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:08):**  focus, was that part of the master or did you bring that into your thesis?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:12):**  Well, it wasn't easy or it was actually because there is only one in the world.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:18):**  You can study agroforestry, of course, you can do a master or a PhD on agroforestry studying  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:23):**  like interactions between species or designing our space and to our stratification or anything  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:30):**  that goes with agroforestry.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:32):**  But to do a specific master on agroforestry, there is only one in the world that is in  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:36):**  Bangor in the UK, Wales.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:39):**  It's a very good and old school and they are really good.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:43):**  Even though that's in Europe, in North Europe, in Great Britain, you can still learn a lot  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:49):**  because the professors, they come from e-craft and other organizations.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:53):**  So it's really important to master.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:05:56):**  And so it was easy to find the thing that was only one.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:00):**  And I brought quite a lot of local knowledge into my thesis because you could go for in  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:06):**  field, but I worked with e-craft afterwards.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:09):**  So I developed my thesis in Zambia, working with four different, three different tribes,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:15):**  actually communities there.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:17):**  And the whole approach was about how to take the right decisions based on local knowledge.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:23):**  So yeah, I brought it in and I had been working in Amazon before and after.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:28):**  So I tried to merge how human beings think all over the world, despite where they come  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:35):**  from or what background they have.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:37):**  And how did Pretatera come about?  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:40):**  Because going from what you studied, obviously starting a company is in some cases a huge  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:45):**  step in other cases, a very small step in Europe, both cases, what triggered the start  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:50):**  of that company?  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:51):**  Well, actually, it was a big step for us.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:06:55):**  We both have a long story working as independent consultants.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:01):**  But we met actually working in Fazenda da Toca, which is one of the biggest organic  
**[0:07:08-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:08):**  farms in Brazil, where we had the opportunity to develop a way to systematize the agroforestry  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:17):**  logics into a large scale framework.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:22):**  So there in Fazenda da Toca, we understood that we had this huge demand of other farmers,  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:30):**  other people who are looking for this kind of knowledge, because so far, people were  
**[0:07:35-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:35):**  only discussing agroforestry for smallholder farmers, not in a large scale.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:42):**  And only in Fazenda da Toca that we really started discussing this logic of large scale.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:48):**  And we had all the time people asking us if we could help them to plan a system to implement  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:54):**  in their own lands.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:56):**  They were looking for this.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:07:57):**  And then we said, well, we should start an initiative that we could spread this to more  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:04):**  people not only in one farm, but to more people.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:07):**  Can you describe that farm a bit?  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:09):**  Would you say a large scale, just for people that have never heard about it, have never  
**[0:08:12-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:12):**  seen it?  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:14):**  How many hectares?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:15):**  What kind of acres?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:16):**  What kind of trees are we talking about?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:18):**  It's a large, large farm.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:20):**  Actually, it's 2300 hectares.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:24):**  It's a very large farm.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:25):**  It's not everything in agroforestry, of course.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:28):**  So we had, I would say we implemented close to 100 hectares of agroforestry focused on  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:36):**  citrus, on lemon for exportation.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:40):**  And so we planted along with the lemon.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:43):**  We had bananas.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:44):**  We had African mahogany.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:46):**  We had eucalyptus.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:48):**  We had native species for biodiversity and for biomass production and also the grass  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:55):**  management in between the rows of trees.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:08:59):**  So the focus of Fazenda da Toca is not only agroforestry, is organic production.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:06):**  Especially eggs, for organic eggs production.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:10):**  And so they also work with grains, organic grains for the chicken, for feeding the chicken.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:16):**  I just want to add one thing.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:18):**  It's over 5000 acres, the Fazenda da Toca.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:22):**  And we were by this time the chiefies of the RD section.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:26):**  So the research and development section of Fazenda da Toca.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:30):**  So we came in to develop the designs, the proper designs that were economically viable  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:35):**  enough to, like, to the Roy and all the estimations, the economic estimations that could be.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:41):**  So you work with the whole management process of the creation of those first systems.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:49):**  And that's what we scaled in Fazenda da Toca.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:52):**  And now they are with another initiative, another company called Risoma, where they  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:09:58):**  are scaling up even more in other regions of Brazil.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:02):**  That's a spin-off from Fazenda da Toca.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:05):**  We were there when they first started.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:07):**  Yeah, they have an amazing work.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:09):**  And then you were approached by others and you thought, okay, let's set up a company  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:12):**  to do this multiple times in different continents as well, because you've worked in Indonesia,  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:18):**  a lot in Africa, in Brazil.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:20):**  So what was that phase after leaving that farm and leaving the place where you could  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:24):**  experiment this to start doing this on your own and with other farms?  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:28):**  Yeah, actually together we have over almost 30 years of experience in agroforestry.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:34):**  So it was not that big step as we thought, but in that we basically were doing consulting  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:42):**  while being there and at the same time creating our own ideas, philosophy and beliefs on agroforestry  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:49):**  and how to change and how to break paradigms.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:53):**  And then when we first start, we already have potential clients and it starts to grow, like  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:10:58):**  exponentially and we start to make it better and better and systematize our own process.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:05):**  So it has been a huge wave actually.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:09):**  We didn't expect that it would be that big, that you could help so many people at the  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:14):**  same time and go beyond boundaries that we thought you'd be in.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:19):**  And it grew very fast because in the beginning we were understanding what our clients or  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:26):**  what the people that we were going to work with, they were looking for, what they needed.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:32):**  And so we talked with a lot of people and we understood that what they need is a proper  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:39):**  design, a proper planning of the system, a complex system.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:43):**  Design is the key.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:44):**  So walk us through a typical client or actually an example if you want to share, but choose  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:49):**  what you want and how do you go about finding that design and thus your approach?  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:54):**  Yeah, we have, I think I can describe, we have several kinds of clients.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:11:59):**  Since smallholder farmers, smallholder farmers that we take very much care and we respect  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:05):**  a lot because they help us to build not only portfolio, but experience.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:11):**  And we can help these people that otherwise would be not having this kind of literature  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:15):**  or knowledge available easily.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:18):**  So we can spread the word.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:19):**  But we also have NGOs, companies and big investors and impact investors.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:27):**  You want to describe a little bit?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:29):**  So the logic is pretty much always the same.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:32):**  Depends, it varies on the scale that we are working.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:36):**  So for instance, one work we did in partnership with WRI in the Amazon.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:42):**  And so they hired us to plan and implement an agroforestry system with smallholder farmers,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:49):**  with local communities that were looking for regenerate their soil.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:54):**  Because we have this very serious problem in the Amazon that smallholder farmers, even  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:12:59):**  though they are settled now, they use a kind of agriculture, which is let them burn.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:07):**  That is very ancient, but it's not sustainable anymore if you don't let the soil rest for  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:13):**  enough time.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:14):**  And so what we were looking for was a design specific for these farmers and for this context.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:21):**  And so we understood what we do in the first place is like a diagnostic.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:26):**  We understand all the context.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:28):**  We do all the local knowledge, acquirements, assessment.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:32):**  So we understand what is it that they already cultivate, the crops, the species, what are  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:38):**  the native species in the forest, the species that they like to manage in the forest, they  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:43):**  harvest in the forest and what are the species that they already grow.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:47):**  Mainly there they used to plant cassava.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:50):**  That's the most important crop for them.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:53):**  And so necessarily the system had to have cassava for them.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:13:58):**  So we just complexified the cassava production.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:01):**  Yeah, we brought species together.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:04):**  This is one kind of client, as you ask.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:06):**  But we have other ones like Verstechen, for instance, or La Grama in Peru.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:13):**  The work they do are very similar.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:15):**  They are people that are trying to match or to meet the expectations of their clients  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:20):**  that are buying those regenerative products or let's say organic so far.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:26):**  And these companies they buy from out growers.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:30):**  So they don't really own land, but they're trying to improve the livelihoods of these  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:34):**  people around the world, especially on the tropics.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:38):**  And basically they promote organic agriculture, I would say.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:44):**  But now they are trying to have one more step on that going into regenerative agriculture  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:49):**  or agroforestry.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:50):**  So what we do is we go to their place, as Paulo just explained, we try to understand  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:14:56):**  all the backgrounds, the expectations, the basically livelihood that people have.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:01):**  And we plan upon that a new agroforestry system that is adherent enough, that could work for  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:07):**  these people.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:08):**  And what the company starts to deliver is not just a premium price for their products,  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:14):**  but also a regenerative system, a model that these forest dependent people can use to improve  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:21):**  their land while you produce with enough profit to keep doing the kind of agriculture they  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:27):**  does, but now improved.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:30):**  And I just want to compliment that what Pritata does, what we do is the whole process.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:36):**  We analyze, we plan, we implement, we train, we do capacity builds, we monitor, we monitor,  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:43):**  we do the whole process.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:45):**  So you literally go to the ground besides doing our own farm or the projects that are  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:50):**  around, we generally go and do at least the first plots and the first implementation we  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:15:56):**  do ourselves, being present, understand the whole process.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:00):**  And it's important that we usually implement on the ground a few modules that can be replicable,  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:09):**  that can be scaled up by them.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:11):**  So the farmers understand the system, they understand the logics and they would implement  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:17):**  and grow it and make it in bigger areas or in their own lands.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:22):**  So that's pretty much what we did in La Gramma.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:25):**  We planned a system for ginger and turmeric production for the high mountains in the Amazon,  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:32):**  in the Peruvian Amazon.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:35):**  And the idea would be it's not only organic, organic is not enough.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:40):**  They're supposed to plant a system that is more biodiverse, like the environment where  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:44):**  they are, like the landscape where they are, and that needs to be more resilient as well.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:50):**  So that's why we diversify their system.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:16:54):**  We put not only ginger and turmeric, but also fruits, also timber, also nuts and also service  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:02):**  species, also trees that were supposed to be pruned to produce biomass and cover the  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:07):**  soil.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:09):**  Before making it into a monologue and open spaces to you to make more questions.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:14):**  I think it's extremely interesting.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:16):**  You mentioned the complexifying.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:17):**  I love the verb, complexifying.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:19):**  I think the move from one cash crop, which could be pepper or ginger or cassava or something  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:26):**  going, I mean, it's very much obviously in line with regenerative agriculture going away  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:30):**  from monocultures, which sometimes is difficult to imagine when you are, I don't know, a grain  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:36):**  operator in the Midwest and you have to, you start maybe putting together different types  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:41):**  of grain and harvesting in different times, obviously cover crops, et cetera.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:45):**  But when you are in agroforestry, it's sort of more natural.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:48):**  But also there, we often think of plantations of one type, maybe coffee or maybe something  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:52):**  else.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:53):**  And that complexifying obviously brings a lot of questions with it.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:17:57):**  And I think that might be one of the reasons why agroforestry hasn't grown as much or is  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:03):**  growing now instead of 40 years ago or 30 years ago, because the complexifying we've  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:07):**  known and seen, but we haven't seen it, as you said before, at a larger scale.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:12):**  So what is different now that suddenly you see all this activity at agroforestry beyond  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:18):**  one acre or one hectare, but actually at 2,300 and large?  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:22):**  People are talking about large agroforestry systems over the last, I think, five years,  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:27):**  maybe before as well.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:28):**  But what has changed in your mind that suddenly agroforestry at larger scales is possible  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:33):**  or seems possible?  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:34):**  I just want to make you one little statement here.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:37):**  What we do that is different is to make a tailor-made design.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:42):**  So that's what brings replicability.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:44):**  I think I can answer your question pretty well, what has changed now.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:50):**  But basically, you have to keep in mind that this complexity, that how to manage-  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:55):**  It's context-specific.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:57):**  Yeah, it's context-specific.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:58):**  Completely.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:18:59):**  Exactly.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:00):**  So it has to be tailor-made.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:02):**  It has to be specific for the area, for the people.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:05):**  But not to be annoying, but 40 years ago, it also had to be tailor-made.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:09):**  Like, I mean, has the knowledge increased enormously?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:13):**  Do we have new technology that we suddenly know?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:16):**  We suddenly discovered this?  
**[0:19:18-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:18):**  Or what has changed in 2020 or 2015 when suddenly this boom of Ernst Goetsch and a lot of other  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:25):**  people suddenly we are talking about scale and not small, cute things anymore, which  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:29):**  is amazing, which is great.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:30):**  I'm very happy about it.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:31):**  But I'm wondering what changed.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:33):**  You have to make your knowledge.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:34):**  I would say that firstly, in the public policies, agroforestry was only focused for smallholder  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:42):**  farmers.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:43):**  So this is the first thing that has been changing in the last few years because larger farmers  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:49):**  are starting to take it seriously.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:51):**  I would say that this is the first thing.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:19:54):**  The second thing, many people actually ask us, why is it that agroforestry is not everywhere  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:00):**  yet since it's so amazing, it's so perfect, it's so-  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:04):**  It's the solution for-  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:06):**  All the problems.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:08):**  And actually the complexity is a good thing, but also it's a challenge.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:13):**  The complexity is very difficult to manage.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:16):**  People don't understand, don't know how to manage complexity.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:19):**  And that's the most difficult part of agroforestry.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:24):**  Because if you are a farmer and you have only one product, you have to understand all the  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:28):**  agronomic parts of this one crop.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:31):**  You have to focus on the market for this only one crop.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:34):**  And okay, you can do that.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:36):**  But once you grow to two crops, to a crop and a nut, or two crops, a nut and a timber  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:42):**  in the end of the system, so you raise up the complexity, so you have to plan very hard.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:48):**  And what we did was to understand the system, this complexity, in a systematized way.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:20:57):**  So the systematization for us is key, is the most important thing.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:01):**  So we have to plan every step.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:03):**  We have to understand all the crops involved.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:06):**  We have to understand all the management along the cycle.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:10):**  So if we plan a system for 40 years, we would have to know when do we plan to prune a timber  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:17):**  tree, which are the years that we are going to prune this timber tree.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:21):**  So we have to build capacity for the people who are going to manage to prune timber trees.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:27):**  So we have to know when we are going to prune the fruit trees.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:32):**  We have to know how to prune service trees.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:34):**  So it's a lot of complexity.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:36):**  So there's like a step by step process to systematize the design and to understand how  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:42):**  to manage it all along the process.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:45):**  And most important of all is to plan the costs.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:48):**  You have to understand all the costs involved, not only in the implementation, but along  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:53):**  the whole cycle.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:54):**  So if you understand, if you know every year which are the management actions that you're  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:21:59):**  going to take, you can predict a little bit.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:02):**  Of course, you will have changes along the way, but you can predict how much is it going  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:07):**  to cost.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:08):**  And if you know how much it's going to cost, you can start modeling it financially.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:13):**  And this is what was missing, actually.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:16):**  We have to plan the agroforestry system in a systematized way and in an economical way.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:22):**  We have to see how viable economically it will be.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:26):**  Because in Fazenda da Toca, for instance, we used to plant eucalyptus as a service species,  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:33):**  but we have to prune every year this eucalyptus.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:37):**  So how much does it cost to prune this eucalyptus?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:40):**  So we did this study all over again, understanding what is the operation to prune it?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:48):**  How much does it cost?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:49):**  Which is how long does it take for the operators to do it?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:53):**  And this data wasn't there.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:54):**  There was no data set on pruning.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:56):**  This data, there is no data.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:22:58):**  We have to produce this data.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:00):**  Most of the data on agroforestry, there isn't yet.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:04):**  I mean, as machinery, we have a lot of machinery for agriculture and for forestry, but not  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:10):**  agroforestry machinery.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:11):**  The same is for data, because you have one specific data in one specific place in the  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:18):**  world with this species and that.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:20):**  So when you try to complexify and use interactions between data, this big data of forestry, it  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:29):**  is not there yet.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:31):**  But what you can do is create those kinds of designs that are modular, replicable and  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:37):**  elastic.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:38):**  So you can consider one species in a functional niche or in a functional group.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:45):**  So you can add several species to that same group and it doesn't matter if you are implementing  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:50):**  Africa in Europe or in South America in the tropics.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:23:55):**  We can go for a specific logic that we can apply succession and stratification.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:01):**  Just talking about the two main principles of agroforestry.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:04):**  Can you explain them a bit for anybody that hasn't dove deep into that yet?  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:10):**  So, well, succession is the time.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:13):**  Why is stratification are the floors?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:15):**  So basically every plant, we will occupy a specific floor, a specific layer of the forest,  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:22):**  talking on the land like a tridimensionally.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:26):**  So you're talking about the vertical occupation of those species.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:30):**  That's stratification.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:32):**  While succession is the timing they occur.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:36):**  So every time of the succession.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:38):**  So if you have one plant that lives one year, it's an annual plant, let's say.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:44):**  So it will stay there for one year.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:46):**  During this time, it will occupy a specific strata.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:50):**  And this strata can be high, upper high, medium or low.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:54):**  So it doesn't matter.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:55):**  The plant will have a specific strata that it occupies.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:24:58):**  Doesn't matter the size it is or how high it is.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:02):**  So for every grass, it has a specific strata that it occupies, generally it needs a lot  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:08):**  of sun to be upper crown.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:10):**  But for trees, they have like a lot of different kinds of possibilities.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:16):**  But those are the two main things you work on agroforestry to occupy the space, tridimensionally.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:21):**  So to sum up, succession would be how long the species or the group of species will stay  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:28):**  in the system.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:29):**  So if you have a species that will last for 40 years and takes like five or six years  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:35):**  to grow up, while it's growing, you can plant in the same point, in the same time, other  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:42):**  species that are short period.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:44):**  So they won't compete with each other because the one that lasts longer is not big yet.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:50):**  So it's the same thing.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:51):**  You can plant maize over here with a Brazil nut right next to it because the Brazil nut  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:25:58):**  is not going to compete with the corn with the maize.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:01):**  Rather it will be benefited by the shade.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:04):**  By the shade of it.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:05):**  Which I mean, I just want to pause a second because for, I wouldn't say centuries, but  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:08):**  for a long time, what you just explained was something that we couldn't understand, or  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:13):**  at least if we grow corn or we grow one crop, and you sort of thought about it as 2D, like  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:18):**  only two dimensions, it either grows or doesn't grow.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:20):**  That's more let it.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:21):**  And you're basically saying and everybody else who's working agroforestry, let's look  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:25):**  at it 3D because you have all the space up and down and you have time.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:29):**  So actually you're almost going 4D because you add the time component to it, which you  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:33):**  have to plan for because it takes six years for this Brazil nut to grow up, which means  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:37):**  you need six years of other cash flow.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:39):**  If you would only do that, you would have a quite a big problem in your bank account.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:42):**  So it completely changes the discussion to and makes it much more complex.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:47):**  And to that actually my question, this sounds amazing.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:50):**  And that's why probably everybody's saying agroforestry is the system to the solution  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:54):**  to any problem we ever had.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:26:56):**  But then if you start working with a smallholder farmer, how do you make sure that he or she  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:00):**  has the space and time to think about that and to manage when you leave a complex system  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:06):**  like that?  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:07):**  How do you make sure that any farmer that you've worked with, even if you're there in  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:11):**  the beginning, you've worked with the pilot plots, et cetera, at some point you need to  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:14):**  go to the next line.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:15):**  How do you make sure that that complexity and all that knowledge doesn't get lost?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:19):**  Yeah, we have to monitor.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:21):**  We have to be close.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:22):**  But you have to simplify.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:25):**  Yeah, we have to simplify and to explain before.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:28):**  So all of them, when we implement a system, they have like this gun chart of activities  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:35):**  and years at least.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:36):**  So they have to know, OK, I'm in the first year of my system.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:39):**  I have to prune the fruit trees.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:43):**  I have to prune my service trees.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:45):**  I have to clean, to cut down the grass in the middle.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:50):**  So we we organise, we systematise the operations in a simple gun chart.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:57):**  That's just it.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:27:58):**  But you have to simplify it a little bit.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:00):**  Of course, you have the eutopic agroforestry super complex, but you have the ideal agroforestry  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:07):**  that is viable economically, that is viable technically for the farmer to manage.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:13):**  So that's why you have to simplify and to systematise the operations along the time.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:18):**  Yeah, and let's say that you have you can see in a line and you start with bare land  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:25):**  or monocrop, let's say.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:26):**  It's pretty much the same.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:28):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:29):**  It's exactly is a green desert or whatever adjective you you have to give to that.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:34):**  But yeah, you understand the point.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:36):**  And on the other side, you have forests, a real forest.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:40):**  I mean, doesn't have to be a tropical forest, but the maximum of this environment that these  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:44):**  environments can provide by that time.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:47):**  So you have a complex forest.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:49):**  But in the in the middle, you can have a sort of kind of production that doesn't have to  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:28:55):**  be the big complex agroforestry, but can have three, four species or occupy the system properly  
**[0:29:01-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:01):**  for dimensionally.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:02):**  And you have a lot of benefits that you can even imagine.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:07):**  You are just grasping of the benefits that this kind of complex system can can give it  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:12):**  to us.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:13):**  And I would even pose, as you said, that agroforestry has been there since the beginning of agriculture.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:22):**  If you talk about like 13,000 years ago in the present, like it was there before the  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:29):**  very first agriculture we did, we did on the boundaries of forest is or in the clean clearance  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:34):**  of forest.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:35):**  So it was agroforestry in some way.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:37):**  We just lost that.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:39):**  And if a few years ago, few, few years ago, and you just simplified too much to have this  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:47):**  maze or nothing or beans or maize.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:51):**  And what you are trying to do now is recover some of this knowledge, but using technology  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:29:58):**  in our favor.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:00):**  And even if you think about photosynthesis, we can there's a lot of people talking today  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:07):**  about like improving photosynthesis through more carbon dioxide and the right amount of  
**[0:30:13-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:13):**  sun or or adding fertilizers or organic fertilizers or bio fertilizers.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:22):**  But you can you can do that to just changing the shape of our plantation using stratification.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:31):**  So you can have a wave of you can you can make our surface different instead of having  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:37):**  a plain surface on the canopy.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:40):**  You can have like a waved surface.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:44):**  I have to explain that.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:45):**  So because obviously Walter is doing a wave on the video, but nobody can see that.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:49):**  So basically, if you imagine a flat plain land somewhere and if you just plant corn  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:53):**  or one crop, they're all going to be more or less the same height, which means they  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:57):**  all capture sunlight at more or less the same time.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:30:59):**  They probably shut up at the more or less the same time to get overcooked, etc.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:03):**  But if you integrate other species that have different heights, you basically create a  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:06):**  wave on the landscape, which is different for wind, which is very different for sun.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:10):**  And basically, as any farmer is a solar entrepreneur that tries to get as many sun lights as they  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:15):**  could possibly get and turn them into sugars or something useful.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:18):**  You want to have as many solar panels out there, which means as many leaves, as many  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:22):**  surfaces that can do photosynthesis.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:24):**  So as soon as you go into a wave, you basically intensify your possibility of capturing sunlight  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:31):**  and doing photosynthesis instead of having this flat surface where for kilometers and  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:35):**  kilometers and kilometers, you don't see anything else than a line.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:38):**  You try to create different areas to capture sunlight.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:42):**  Yeah, as Cisco explained it way better than me.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:45):**  I don't have to pay anything else.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:47):**  That's just perfect.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:48):**  That's my job, asking questions.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:50):**  I would just add that you can go for 1.6, like 60% more surface area for photosynthesis.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:31:58):**  So that's the way you could harvest it 60% more.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:01):**  So it's a lot of improvements, which is a nice bridge to my next question.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:04):**  I think you might get a lot of attention as well, but I definitely get a lot of people  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:09):**  that are very excited about this as well.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:10):**  And investors that want to invest, they are convinced about Agroforestry.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:14):**  They've read some books, they've maybe visited some farms, hopefully, they've seen some videos.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:18):**  What would be some tips from your side, as you have seen so many Agroforestry systems  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:22):**  that worked and so many that didn't?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:24):**  What would be one or two key questions that investors should ask or things they should  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:28):**  look out for when they are getting active in the Agroforestry world, which is super  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:32):**  exciting, but obviously full of noise and full of things that we don't know yet are  
**[0:32:35-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:35):**  not going to work?  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:37):**  Okay.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:38):**  So I would say that the investor should look for the planning.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:44):**  And what does that Agroforestry is looking for to be?  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:49):**  I mean, why the person planted that Agroforestry and what is it supposed to produce?  
**[0:32:56-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:32:56):**  So are you planning to harvest first short term crop or are you going to harvest coffee?  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:06):**  How is your planning?  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:07):**  How does it look like?  
**[0:33:09-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:09):**  And so you will understand when is it going to pay itself at least or when is it the break-even  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:17):**  point so you can understand a little bit what are the revenues, the incomes inside the system?  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:23):**  Go for the management.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:26):**  Go for the management.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:27):**  For all the investors, go for the management.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:28):**  Try to see, okay, are you going to do this kind of complexity?  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:31):**  Are you going to plant like this way?  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:33):**  Okay, okay.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:34):**  I understand all the benefits of Agroforestry for environmental services, carbon in the  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:38):**  soil, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:40):**  But now tell me how you're going to manage that?  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:42):**  What you're expecting?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:44):**  What is the machinery?  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:45):**  What is the people that is going to be working on that?  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:49):**  Is it going to work?  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:50):**  You have seen that before?  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:51):**  If not, of course, no problem.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:33:55):**  We haven't seen so much large scale agroforestry in the world.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:00):**  But let's say, is that well planned?  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:02):**  How are you going to manage?  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:04):**  Because it's not that complex, actually.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:08):**  The problem is that, for instance, in Brazil, we have many opportunities for public financing,  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:14):**  for financing the agroforestry systems, either for smallholder farmers, but for big farms  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:21):**  as well.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:22):**  But the banks won't give the financing if there's not a proper planning.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:29):**  You have to know when are you going to harvest?  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:32):**  How much do you plan to harvest?  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:34):**  So you have to have this planning.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:35):**  So it's the same logic as for finance, something like that.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:41):**  And I would say that it's not that complex.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:43):**  Because we planned a project, a coffee design, we planned and implemented a coffee designed  
**[0:34:51-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:34:51):**  for Minas Gerais, for a region where they produce this very special coffee, super high-quality  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:00):**  coffee.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:01):**  They were looking for not only organic, but a complex agroforestry system, but not that  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:06):**  complex that they wouldn't be able to manage.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:09):**  So we planned, it wasn't a super complex design, actually.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:14):**  We had, together with the coffee, we had macadamia nut, the cedar.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:22):**  So we had coffee, a nut, and a timber tree, and a few species for service species that  
**[0:35:30-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:30):**  we call it, to bring diversity and to bring nitrogen and biomass from the system.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:37):**  So we just diversified the production.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:39):**  We have coffee and macadamia nut.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:42):**  And when we did the economical modeling, we understood that the macadamia could provide  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:48):**  the same amount of revenue as the coffee did.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:52):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:54):**  What do you see in terms of, I mean, obviously the ecosystem returns and obviously the non-financial  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:35:59):**  returns, but can you explain that a bit more?  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:01):**  Like the financial returns for potential investors or companies, what do you see there?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:06):**  Do you see these huge changes?  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:08):**  Because that's the same as coffee, which was and is the cash crop.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:12):**  That's enormous.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:13):**  That changes everything for the farmer.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:14):**  If because of the implementing and the maintenance, et cetera, obviously aren't as high as well.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:19):**  So what changed there if you had to look at that example in terms of broad changes in  
**[0:36:24-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:24):**  terms of costs and revenues?  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:26):**  Yeah, again, we are talking about diversification.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:29):**  So if you diversify, the main thing you have to see your soil, your land as your biggest  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:37):**  asset, especially if you're talking about climate change or global warming scenario.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:44):**  So you have to think that you have to save our main asset.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:47):**  That's our soil.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:48):**  And in that way, the system is key.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:51):**  Again, the design, we have this microclimate creation besides all the nitrogen and biomass  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:36:58):**  and everything and carbon in the soil.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:00):**  So if you look into that, you have you going to diversify your species.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:04):**  Since you diversified the species, crops in the in the in the area, you consequently diversify  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:11):**  your income and you're going to be more resilient for the market.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:16):**  So once you see that, another key factor for investors to ask is how is it planned when  
**[0:37:22-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:22):**  you give a Roy, a VPN, NPV, how did the guys came to those numbers?  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:32):**  What we do generally is do that modularly per species.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:38):**  So every time you have to change a species in our models, the whole model you change,  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:44):**  but you understand perfectly how much it is a species, not perfectly, of course, but you  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:48):**  can have a prognosis of how much one tree will produce and how much this tree is going  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:53):**  to produce if it's under shades, how much it produces if it's planted with other species.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:37:59):**  So you can infer by experience, by literature, by by local knowledge, you can infer partially  
**[0:38:12-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:38:12):**  how it's going to change.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:38:13):**  And from this, this very basic table of knowledge and numbers, you can do different models,  
**[0:38:22-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:38:22):**  you can do different economical models and end up seeing our cost as the main tool of  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:38:33):**  decision making that you can have.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:38:35):**  So you can go and say, OK, so this tree is giving me a good revenue, but it's costing  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:38:42):**  a lot to manage.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:38:43):**  And this other one is not costing that much and the revenue is similar.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:38:47):**  So we can adapt our system to a proper and profitable system.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:38:53):**  Yeah, I would say that you just have to compare it with the monoculture.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:38:58):**  So for instance, this one of the example of coffee, if we compare it with a monoculture  
**[0:39:05-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:05):**  crop plantation of coffee, we have five five thousand plants of coffee in the monoculture  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:14):**  and we have three thousand in the other design, in the agroforestry design.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:19):**  We have three thousand coffee plants plus five hundred macadamia nuts.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:26):**  Of course, that in the same area, we will produce a little bit less coffee, of course,  
**[0:39:32-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:32):**  because there are less coffee plants.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:35):**  But we will have a second product of this of this design.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:39):**  So we just have to know in how many in one hectare or in one module, how many plants  
**[0:39:45-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:45):**  of each species of or of each crop are there and how much your prognosis says that it's  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:52):**  going to produce.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:54):**  Of course, we used the information of the monocrop information.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:39:58):**  So we know that this variety of coffee produces five kilos of coffee per year.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:05):**  But since it's a little bit under shade and all, we'll say we'll be conservative and say  
**[0:40:10-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:10):**  it produces four kilos per year.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:14):**  And the same thing is for plant per plant.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:16):**  And the same thing about the macadamia produces, for instance, 20 kilos of of nuts per year.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:22):**  And so if we know for one plant, we know for the whole system.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:27):**  Then you can change, you can adapt.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:30):**  And one thing that Paulo said that is extremely important is that the people used to say or  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:35):**  get confused thinking that agroforestry produces more.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:39):**  It doesn't.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:40):**  Agroforestry will not produce more.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:42):**  It will produce more per area, but not per plant.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:45):**  So if you have a cacao production and say that in agroforestry you're going to produce  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:48):**  more, that's a lie.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:50):**  That's not true.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:51):**  It is definitely that's not true.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:40:54):**  But definitely you can have more calories going there together at the same time.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:00):**  So you're going to have much more production and resilience.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:03):**  So what you look for and what you aim at with agroforestry is optimization rather than maximization.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:13):**  Maximizing a system is not right.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:16):**  We did that with the green revolution.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:19):**  Didn't go well, didn't went well.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:20):**  And we didn't solve the problems we believed we would.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:24):**  But if we optimize our system, it will be resilient and you have more yields per area,  
**[0:41:32-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:32):**  but not per species.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:33):**  So you have to consider this tradeoff is extremely important.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:37):**  And you need to find the customers for the different species, obviously, because there  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:41):**  are only so many macadamia nuts you can eat yourself.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:44):**  So it needs to be a certain level of scale which fits in the context that there are in  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:48):**  your area buyers for a right price for the extra crop.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:52):**  And I think often there it's that's lacking.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:54):**  You need almost to buy your full rotation if you were an annual crop farmer.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:41:59):**  If you're a perennial farmer, you need to find different people or someone that buys  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:02):**  all your sellable produce, not your service trees, but the other ones.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:06):**  And then you need a bit of scales in some cases, obviously, to do that.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:10):**  I was going to ask you, how do you monitor your projects when you're not there or when  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:14):**  you're how do you make sure to keep track?  
**[0:42:17-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:17):**  I think which is a question for investors as well.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:19):**  What do you monitor in terms of data, both on the ground, in the ground, in the trees?  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:24):**  What are your key monitor aspects you look at?  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:26):**  Well, there are different tools and different approaches and every project is different.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:31):**  So you don't have one answer to that.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:34):**  But you're a forest engineer, so you work a lot with statistics.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:39):**  And so you do experiments all the time.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:42):**  What you have done, I think that comes handy.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:44):**  To use as an example what we did in the Amazon, we create an index called the API, the Forestry  
**[0:42:52-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:42:52):**  Performance Index, that you use very visual features to classify how the system is going.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:00):**  So instead of measure complicated things.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:03):**  So imagine a forest dependent person living in the Amazon, being a smallholder farmer  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:10):**  and without even access to a city or to a lab.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:14):**  So you cannot test leaves or content or even simple soil analysis.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:20):**  So what we do is rather than this, we count the number of species, the amount of biomass  
**[0:43:27-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:27):**  in the soil by size, by how thick it is or biodiversity, what kind of birds we're seeing  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:37):**  that lands or yields in a very simple way.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:43):**  So comparing this using metrics of comparing this to literature, the things that have been  
**[0:43:51-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:51):**  proved.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:52):**  So you know pretty much that if a soil has that much of covering, it's pretty much like  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:43:57):**  the carbon content will be between this and that.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:00):**  So doing correlation and using new technology, let's say new technology is WhatsApp.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:07):**  So trying to have these people engaged.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:10):**  Which is great because you can take pictures.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:11):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:14):**  Things are there already.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:15):**  You have all the technology you need.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:16):**  You just have to be smart, smart, fast, doing quickly and have these people engaged so they  
**[0:44:22-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:22):**  can show what they are doing and you can see remotely a lot.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:26):**  And even now and then or when the project can pay for that, when we are close enough,  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:32):**  things change, we can have labs.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:34):**  So you can collect soil leaves and do the normal and follow the procedure for chemical  
**[0:44:42-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:42):**  analysis.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:43):**  Pretty much what we need to understand in monitoring is just the productivity, like  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:48):**  how much the trees are growing, how much they are producing and the costs involved.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:54):**  So how long are you taking to manage your production system?  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:44:58):**  What are the inputs that you're putting in it?  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:02):**  And it's pretty much it.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:03):**  So there are a few indicators that will tell us about the environmental quality, which  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:09):**  is what Walter said.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:10):**  The biodiversity, the number of species, pretty much it.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:14):**  And the soil covering.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:16):**  And that's a very simple and easy way to monitor and you can do it in a remote way.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:23):**  What's up with the farmers?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:25):**  Super interesting.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:26):**  I want to ask you an experimental question that I haven't asked a lot on the podcast.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:30):**  If you look in agroforestry, you've already mentioned a few things that were missing or  
**[0:45:34-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:34):**  are missing.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:35):**  But to really make this scale and grow and be replicable, I mean, you're working on a  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:39):**  lot.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:40):**  But if you had to focus on only one thing, and I'm using the ITN framework for that,  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:44):**  which is importance, tractability and neglect thickness.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:47):**  So is there something in agroforestry that's very important?  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:49):**  Like it would be absolutely crucial if that could be fixed.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:52):**  It would be amazing for the world.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:54):**  It's very solvable.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:55):**  Like we know how to do it.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:56):**  We don't have to invent anything new.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:45:58):**  It's not nuclear fusion or anything.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:00):**  And it's neglected.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:01):**  Like there are very few people working on it.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:03):**  What would be the thing in agroforestry that would be super important, super solvable and  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:08):**  doable and also traceable and monitorable?  
**[0:46:11-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:11):**  And what is the thing that most people are not working on?  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:14):**  Design.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:15):**  I would say design.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:16):**  Design.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:17):**  The system.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:18):**  You come back to design.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:19):**  Design.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:20):**  Yes.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:21):**  You come back.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:22):**  That's key.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:23):**  That's key.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:24):**  There's a huge amount of knowledge spread around the world about monocrops, about each  
**[0:46:31-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:31):**  crop, about each species.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:33):**  And it's everywhere, you know?  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:35):**  So if you plant.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:36):**  The shelves.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:38):**  So you don't have access to it.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:39):**  So what we need is to put all this knowledge together.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:43):**  And to use this, apply it to a systematized production system.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:48):**  This is something that we've been working on a long time now.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:52):**  And it's probably going to take even longer to finish because it's very complex.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:46:57):**  It's like something like a tool, like a software where we can build this huge database about  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:05):**  species.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:06):**  So we have a huge list of species and crops and all the parameters about them.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:11):**  What are their succession?  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:13):**  What are their strata?  
**[0:47:14-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:14):**  How do you manage them?  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:16):**  Which region are they going to produce?  
**[0:47:20-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:20):**  How much do they produce?  
**[0:47:21-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:21):**  Which time of the year do they produce?  
**[0:47:23-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:23):**  All the information about them.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:25):**  All the carbon information together.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:27):**  All the yields, the trade-offs.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:29):**  The crown architecture.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:31):**  All the information about those species and crops.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:34):**  And with this in hand, you'll be able to plan a much proper and viable design.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:43):**  But you have to have this knowledge.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:45):**  And an adherent.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:46):**  And an adherent with empowerment.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:49):**  How does indigenous knowledge fit into that?  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:52):**  Like traditional knowledge?  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:53):**  Which you mentioned, some of it is lost, some of it is there, some of it we probably half  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:47:58):**  remember but don't really.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:00):**  Because there's so much knowledge uncovered as well in other languages, not even written.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:05):**  How do you get that into a system?  
**[0:48:07-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:07):**  You systematize it.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:08):**  So local knowledge is a whole process.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:10):**  That's very important.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:11):**  It's an anthropological approach, definitely.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:16):**  And you translate that into math or into text.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:21):**  Ecraft has a tool called the ATT.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:24):**  ATT is a pretty good tool.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:27):**  Quite old now, but you can start from that.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:29):**  But basically you talk to people.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:31):**  You understand and you take things that make sense.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:34):**  You leave things that doesn't make that much sense aside for a while.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:38):**  And you just systematize it.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:40):**  You just say, okay, so it makes sense with that.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:42):**  So it goes in a column.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:44):**  And you start to make sense out of this all.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:48):**  And how often are you wrong in the sense that you put it in a column and actually it should  
**[0:48:51-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:51):**  have been in another one?  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:53):**  Or the thing that wasn't important you thought actually turned out to be quite important?  
**[0:48:57-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:57):**  Because actually we are very conservative, I would say.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:48:59):**  Because for instance, when we put a production, youth for species, for instance, we always  
**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:06):**  put it in the database per plant, of course.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:09):**  So we always put a little bit less.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:12):**  It's very important.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:13):**  Everything should be conservative.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:15):**  And probably you'll be wrong in the end because you plant less and probably you'll be under  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:20):**  promise and over deliver.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:23):**  Maybe over deliver will be the problem.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:26):**  I think you have to be conservative.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:29):**  But everything will be there with your weight.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:31):**  So you change your weight.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:32):**  So let's say that one specific tree will flower and will bloom in Brazil.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:38):**  Just after 40 days after the blooming, you plant the maize.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:42):**  As a typical example.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:44):**  So it will be there with other scientifically improved information and it will have a weight  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:51):**  of 0.2, let's say.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:54):**  And you're going to wait until that makes more sense than the scientific one and you're  
**[0:49:58-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:49:58):**  going to adjust the weight.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:00):**  So everything comes handy.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:01):**  It's not like you'll be wrong all the time or you'll be right all the time.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:05):**  You just have to have a framework.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:07):**  You know the way you go.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:10):**  You know the path.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:11):**  But you have to build it along the way, of course.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:14):**  Because you're talking about agriculture.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:16):**  You're talking about management, a biological system.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:19):**  So it's much more complex than just planting it.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:22):**  And it will vary a lot according to how much it will rain, all the weather of each year.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:28):**  And if you have any problem with some pests or some diseases, you'll have to adapt, of  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:34):**  course.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:35):**  But you have like a framework.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:39):**  You know where to start, where you're aiming, where to finish.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:44):**  So it's not that much complicated.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:47):**  What our dream, I would say, like our dream and also our goal is to build this tool and  
**[0:50:53-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:53):**  to make it available for people.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:50:55):**  Somehow that it will become like a platform where you plan your design based on this big  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:02):**  database and you will monitor your system, like the productivity, the growth of the trees,  
**[0:51:07-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:07):**  the timber, everything.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:08):**  And then you feed the database as well.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:12):**  So if we have a productivity for one specific tree in Sao Paulo state in Brazil, and the  
**[0:51:21-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:21):**  same tree will produce a little bit different in Sumatra Island in Indonesia.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:28):**  So in that design, they will feed the database like a huge platform.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:36):**  That would be like a dream.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:38):**  And maybe that will happen.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:40):**  We're working on that.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:42):**  Which answers one of my questions.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:44):**  If you had a magic wand, what would you change overnight?  
**[0:51:47-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:47):**  If you could do anything, I think I can answer the question for you.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:50):**  You would make sure that system would be there tomorrow, tonight, basically.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:54):**  Yeah, I would add one thing with this magic wand.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:51:59):**  I would like to make it disappear all the fakers in the world.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:04):**  Let's say all the people that are saying that doing something is not doing and is actually  
**[0:52:09-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:09):**  jeopardizing the real work on agroforestry and is blowing the process of adoption.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:17):**  Because you do believe that agroforestry can solve pretty much all the problems in the  
**[0:52:20-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:20):**  world.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:21):**  So you just need serious people.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:23):**  And it's a nice bridge, actually.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:24):**  We've talked about the financial side and investors.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:26):**  If you would be in charge of a $1 billion investment fund tomorrow morning, not with  
**[0:52:30-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:30):**  a magic wand, like you had to do the work, you cannot just outsource it.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:34):**  How would you invest that?  
**[0:52:36-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:36):**  And I'm asking this question because I think there's going to be a lot of influx of capital  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:39):**  and we as a sector need to be ready.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:42):**  So I understand it's a lot of money and you don't have to go to the dollar.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:46):**  I want to put $200 million there, etc.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:48):**  But what would be the main pieces you would invest in to really, let's say, move agroforestry  
**[0:52:54-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:54):**  forward, but also obviously with an investor hat on?  
**[0:52:58-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:52:58):**  Well, actually, it's a lot of money and with this huge amount of money, maybe we could  
**[0:53:03-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:03):**  take like 5% of it to develop the software.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:07):**  But all the rest should go on the ground.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:11):**  To plant trees, should go to the forest dependent people, should go to finance collecting seeds,  
**[0:53:20-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:20):**  building nurseries, buying tractors and everything to...  
**[0:53:24-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:24):**  Cut all the administration fees.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:28):**  Cut all that people are using.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:30):**  Cut them all and go straight to the ground and make agroforestry.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:34):**  And just 5% for the software because you don't believe that you can do it too.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:38):**  You know, it's not that much complicated, but to put agroforestry in the ground with  
**[0:53:43-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:43):**  one billion, how much you said?  
**[0:53:46-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:46):**  One billion, nine zeros.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:47):**  No, I would say you can do a lot with that.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:50):**  A lot.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:51):**  How much?  
**[0:53:52-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:52):**  How many hectares you would say we can plant with that?  
**[0:53:54-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:53:54):**  Yeah, I'm just thinking about the Great Green Wall, but that's a subject for a next podcast.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:01):**  For another episode.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:02):**  Yeah, but it's a good, I mean, 5% on the software to monitor, to make it accessible for anybody  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:09):**  that's not touched by the other 95 that you invest in the land and in the trees and in  
**[0:54:14-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:14):**  the soil.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:15):**  I think it's a very good answer.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:16):**  And a question I asked and I actually interviewed him yesterday, John Kemp, he always asked  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:20):**  in his podcast about conventional and extractive agriculture, what do you believe to be true  
**[0:54:25-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:25):**  that others don't?  
**[0:54:26-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:26):**  And I like to ask it in terms of regenerative agriculture, we can ask it in agroforestry  
**[0:54:30-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:30):**  as well.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:31):**  Like what do you two believe to be true that others don't believe to be true in agroforestry  
**[0:54:36-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:36):**  or regenerative agriculture, whatever you prefer?  
**[0:54:38-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:38):**  Trees.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:39):**  We have to have trees.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:42):**  I think like many people believe that you can add this, like bio-fertilizers and make  
**[0:54:49-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:49):**  the plant healthy and so the soil will be healthy enough.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:53):**  Otherwise you can just rebuild your soil to make plants healthy.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:54:57):**  There's one thing, one machine called the tree that can do all the job.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:04):**  And trees are, we have to believe, you have to understand that trees are social beings.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:08):**  They were here way before we mammals, so not even human beings, but mammals were here.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:15):**  So plants have been here on earth for a long while and they don't move.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:21):**  So well, they move a little bit, but they, since they're stuck to the place they were  
**[0:55:25-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:25):**  born or they grow, they germinate, they have to cope with all the solutions being there.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:34):**  So they are extremely adapted and so they have to cooperate between each other.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:40):**  So when you have a complex system, so what we believe is that you cannot do regenerative  
**[0:55:45-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:45):**  agriculture if you don't add trees to the system.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:50):**  You have to have trees and you have to have biodiversity because each species has its  
**[0:55:56-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:56):**  own role in the system.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:55:59):**  So each tree or each crop will cycle a different nutrient, will relate to a different microorganism  
**[0:56:08-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:08):**  in soil, so we'll be able to capture the sun in a different moment of the day.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:15):**  So you have to have this diversity and the trees, they are the most important component  
**[0:56:22-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:22):**  of the landscape actually, because they are the ones who bring all the ecosystem services  
**[0:56:28-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:28):**  that we are looking for.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:30):**  They fix the carbon, they regulate the microclimate, they protect the soil.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:35):**  They bring the rain.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:36):**  Exactly.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:37):**  They suck the water to the soil.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:39):**  They cycle the nutrients very, very deep in the soil and bring it to the surface.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:45):**  So it's for free, you know, just put them on the ground, just put the trees on the ground.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:50):**  And that's pretty much what we are looking for, putting trees in the ground.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:56:54):**  You have to be humble because when you talk about nitrogen or carbon, carbon fixation  
**[0:57:00-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:00):**  or photosynthesis, even though that's the main thing, plants do photosynthesis, they  
**[0:57:06-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:06):**  change the nature, change the solar, as you said, like they harvest the sun and use carbon  
**[0:57:12-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:12):**  dioxide.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:13):**  But it is still a short sight way of seeing because we don't know.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:17):**  We have to be humble.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:18):**  We just have to let nature do its job.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:22):**  So it's more complex than we believe you have actually understood so far.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:27):**  So put trees in the system, they will work a lot.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:29):**  And to end with the final question, I always say that, but it's usually not true.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:33):**  But to end with a final question, I know you're working on and actually Filipe, who I interviewed  
**[0:57:38-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:38):**  before of ReNature was already mentioning it a bit on a big degraded land project in  
**[0:57:42-0:57:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:42):**  Brazil with cattle and silver pasture.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:46):**  Can you explain a bit that so to make it concrete, as we're ending this podcast, what that project  
**[0:57:51-0:57:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:51):**  is about, what you're doing there?  
**[0:57:53-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:53):**  It's large scale.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:54):**  Fernando introduced us, also mentioned it.  
**[0:57:56-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:56):**  What are you doing on the ground there?  
**[0:57:57-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:57):**  And obviously there are trees involved.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:57:59):**  Yeah, there will be.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:01):**  So this project is supposed to be a model for the whole region because in southern,  
**[0:58:09-0:58:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:09):**  in western Brazil, the most important activity is cattle ranching.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:16):**  And they are free, actually.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:19):**  They are extensive production.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:22):**  But if it's not made properly, eventually you will degrade your pasture, of course.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:29):**  And it's related to deforestation, not because not only because it's occupying the land where  
**[0:58:35-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:35):**  it used to be a forest, but also because there is no trees in the pasture land.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:40):**  So you have this huge area of pasture land without trees.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:45):**  So the idea, the focus on this project is to develop a production system that could  
**[0:58:51-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:51):**  merge the cattle ranching, the cattle production with trees in the landscape.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:58:58):**  And diversifying the youth, not only the money coming from the cattle, but also from the  
**[0:59:05-0:59:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:05):**  trees.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:06):**  Yeah, respecting the animal production, I mean the animal welfare, while rebuilding  
**[0:59:13-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:13):**  the system.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:14):**  So adding trees.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:15):**  It's an audacious project.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:19):**  We want to create the best cattle ranching agroforestry system in the world.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:26):**  So that's what we're talking about, it's an amazing and audacious project.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:30):**  How big is it?  
**[0:59:31-0:59:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:31):**  What are we talking about?  
**[0:59:32-0:59:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:32):**  And it's just to paint the picture.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:34):**  From what I understand, it's very degraded land.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:36):**  So what are you planning to introduce just to make it visual for the podcast listeners?  
**[0:59:41-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:41):**  What should we imagine that it's now and what should it be in five or ten years?  
**[0:59:45-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:45):**  Well, we still don't know the species or the design properly at the very beginning of the  
**[0:59:51-0:59:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:51):**  project.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:52):**  So you're surveying now.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:53):**  Yes, actually our part is to plan the design and to implement it on the ground.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=0:59:59):**  So we are talking about one farm with 1200 hectares and this is going to be the model  
**[1:00:06-1:00:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:06):**  farm.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:07):**  Potentially it can grow to 23,000 hectares.  
**[1:00:12-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:12):**  But the idea is that other farmers in the region will get inspired from it, will understand  
**[1:00:18-1:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:18):**  it and try to do it by themselves as well.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:21):**  It's going to involve obviously different tree species and different management of the  
**[1:00:26-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:26):**  cattle, I can imagine, to not have it overgrazed like they're doing now.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:30):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:31):**  It's going to be a lot of work.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:34):**  We are very excited about it, but definitely we'll add a lot of timber trees.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:39):**  We'll add some nut species to produce nuts and we'll have to plan the grazing very well.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:46):**  It's going to be a big challenge.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:48):**  And it's extremely multidisciplinary.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:52):**  So we will be working with several schools of possibilities.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:00:59):**  It's ambitious.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:00):**  It's a big project.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:01):**  We'll see you next month.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:02):**  I'm looking forward to checking in in another podcast to see how the design, but especially  
**[1:01:07-1:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:07):**  the implementation, obviously is coming along.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:09):**  I want to thank you so much, Paul and Walter, for your time today and your enthusiasm and  
**[1:01:14-1:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:14):**  sharing the progress in agroforestry, the challenges, the opportunities, what's missing,  
**[1:01:20-1:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:20):**  what's going well and basically getting us up to speed.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:22):**  Great.

**[1:01:30-1:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:30):**  And we really believe in agroforestry.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:32):**  We are so sure that if we plant trees and we systematize and we plan the system, we  
**[1:01:39-1:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:39):**  can improve so much all the landscapes, all the production systems, and that's our mission.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:45):**  That's what we are working for.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:47):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:48):**  Thank you, Koen.

**[1:01:50-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:50):**  Planted trees, added trees to your land.  
**[1:01:53-1:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:53):**  And don't believe in only one answer.  
**[1:01:55-1:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:55):**  Believe in the trees.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:01:57):**  I saw a great quote of I think it's the savory hub person in the Nordics or in Norway or  
**[1:02:04-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:02:04):**  in one of the Nordic countries that said underperforming landscapes and underperforming ecosystems.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:02:09):**  And I think we cannot even imagine what we could actually produce both on perennial lands  
**[1:02:13-1:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:02:13):**  and annual and especially when we start mixing the two.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/21/paula-costa-valter-ziantoni#t=1:02:16):**  So thank you so much for opening a lot of doors and opening a lot of images that we

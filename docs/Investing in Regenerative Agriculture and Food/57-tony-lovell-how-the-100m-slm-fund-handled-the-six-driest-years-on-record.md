**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:14):**  You will listen to a check-in interview with Tony Lovell where we discuss how his 100 million  
**[0:00:18-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:18):**  dollar RegenEgg fund is doing after 6 of the driest years ever recorded.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:25):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:30):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:34):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:39):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:45):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:47):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:51):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:57):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:03):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:07):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:11):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:15):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:20):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:24):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:29):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:33):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:41):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:44):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:45):**  Welcome to the podcast, today I'm speaking to Tony Lovell, co-founder of SLM Partners.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:49):**  I interviewed Tony before in October 2016 as the second interview ever on this podcast  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:54):**  and I'm very happy to check in with him again and see how things have developed in the last  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:58):**  almost three years.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:00):**  Welcome again Tony!  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:01):**  Thank you very much, pleasure to be here.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:03):**  So to start with a question, I will definitely link the interview we've done before in the  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:07):**  show notes below.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:09):**  But for those who haven't heard it, what is SLM, what has been the strategy of the fund  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:14):**  in Australia?  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:15):**  So let's get into a few of those details.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:17):**  SLM Partners was, SLM stands for Sustainable Land Management.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:22):**  So we started in 2012, raised $75 million from a Danish pension fund, another $30 million  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:28):**  worth of finance from an international bank, Rabo Bank, an incredibly supportive agricultural  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:35):**  bank.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:36):**  Both of those groups are very supportive of the agriculture.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:39):**  What we did was we acquired large areas of what we described as inherently good quality  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:46):**  country that had been degraded by inappropriate management, unintentional but inappropriate  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:51):**  management.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:52):**  And as a result of 150 years of set stopping in a seasonally dry, erratic rainfall and  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:58):**  ecosystem, productivity, production, performance, biodiversity, everything had gone south, had  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:05):**  reduced.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:06):**  So the intention was to acquire that property, spend money on infrastructure, water fencing  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:12):**  upgrades and then change the grazing management with the intention to over the life of the  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:18):**  fund, a 10 to 15 year fund, double carrying capacity, half cost of production and be a  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:23):**  large scale, low cost producer of high quality grass fed protein.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:27):**  That was the project fund, the project thesis and it remains the project thesis.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:32):**  We also said that we would, as the opportunities arose, monetise, I don't like the term, but  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:39):**  ecosystem services, so carbon offsets, water and air quality offsets, whatever came available,  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:45):**  biodiversity credits.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:47):**  And we've been able to do that as well.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:48):**  So that's the basic thesis of the fund, a very simple process, buy the land, do the  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:53):**  infrastructure, change the management and allow nature to recover and bring back the  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:58):**  productivity that land inherently is capable of.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:02):**  And in terms, just to give people a sense of scale, this is in Australia, so everything's  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:07):**  big.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:08):**  How much land did you buy and what?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:10):**  Because we can imagine, OK, it's about a hundred, just north of a hundred million dollars you  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:15):**  raised.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:16):**  How much land does that get you?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:18):**  What are the dimensions which you think of?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:19):**  OK, well, the total amount of land that we have in the fund itself is four hundred eighty  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:24):**  thousand hectares, actively developed with water and fencing and the infrastructure is  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:31):**  about half of that, two hundred and twenty, two hundred and forty thousand hectares.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:35):**  And the other two hundred thousand hectares is large scale in Australia.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:40):**  Mulga is a leguminous native tree and it's a carbon project, so a regenerative carbon  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:46):**  project with less intense management.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:49):**  But the intense management is on the remaining part of the country.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:52):**  So it's a fair chunk of land.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:54):**  And when did you start?  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:56):**  I mean, you said 2012.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:58):**  When did you raise and did you start buying your first properties?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:00):**  Was it the same year?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:01):**  Was it slightly after?  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:03):**  We started raise.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:04):**  We had our first close in June 2012 and we started acquiring properties shortly thereafter.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:11):**  First active took possession of our first property at about December 2012, January 2013,  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:18):**  had finished our acquisition stage by the end of 2014 and then just stepped into long  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:25):**  term management and waiting for it to rain, basically.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:28):**  Yeah, because let's discuss that a bit.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:30):**  You've discussed some drought before in 2016 when we did our first interview and you even  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:35):**  discussed the decision you made within the holistic management decision making framework  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:40):**  to actually destock.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:42):**  Where are you now as we're talking in July 2019?  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:45):**  And I think it did rain a bit finally.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:49):**  OK, so a couple of things on that.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:51):**  The land that we've got is in terms of holistic management talk is brittle tending.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:57):**  So it's erratic and unreliable rainfall patterns.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:00):**  Long term average rainfall for the country we've got is around that three hundred and  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:03):**  seventy five millimetres a year.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:06):**  But that can vary widely.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:08):**  We bought in 2012 off the back of two very good seasons.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:13):**  Our country also gets beneficial flooding.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:15):**  So we'd had two very good seasons.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:17):**  Unfortunately, with conventional management, the benefit that we should have received from  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:22):**  that was pretty much ephemeral and didn't really run through.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:26):**  So we then ran into six of the driest years on record.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:31):**  Effectively, if the average rainfall is three seventy five millimetres, we were down to  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:35):**  like one hundred millimetres, two hundred millimetres.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:38):**  So we were less than half of long term average rainfall year on year, six years in a row.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:44):**  What that means is the first year is tough.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:47):**  The second year compounds off that.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:50):**  Keep going forward five or six and it gets pretty challenging to put it mildly.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:54):**  One of the things that we do, I think is critically important, is we match our stocking rates  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:59):**  to our carrying capacity.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:02):**  And I describe us as being fully stocked, as in properly stocked.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:05):**  We had the correct number of stock for what the land itself could carry.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:09):**  We assessed the land could carry no livestock and we matched to that.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:14):**  I believe nothing is more economically damaging than running animals on land when the land  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:20):**  can't sustain that.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:21):**  It's also incredibly ecologically damaging and socially damaging, but it's fundamentally  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:26):**  economically damaging.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:28):**  We have probably in the last three to six months actually had some reasonable rain.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:34):**  We had between 90 and 130 millimetres.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:37):**  We are still a long way short of where we we would like to be on a long term average  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:41):**  basis.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:42):**  But that was combined with some beneficial flooding as we speak on the land that we've  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:49):**  got that received the beneficial flooding.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:52):**  We are back up to just shy of 5000 cattle and we should be able to run those through  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:56):**  for the next six to nine months.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:58):**  And we're hoping to get some follow up rain to run to continue the project moving forward.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:02):**  Yeah, because I can imagine it has been extremely challenging, especially as you are in a project  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:08):**  that has a sort of deadline after you mentioned 10 to 15 years.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:12):**  It's not as you can could run it maybe longer, but theoretically, at least the fund has an  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:17):**  ending date, it's not an evergreen.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:19):**  How has that been the process with your investors and with all the people involved that you  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:24):**  got those six horrible, very dry years right at the beginning basically of the fund?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:29):**  Has it been a tough process to basically get around?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:33):**  It's been character building.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:34):**  I have far more character than I ever thought I'd needed.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:37):**  So it's been very challenging during that period of time.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:40):**  The good thing from two points of view, the investors understood at the start, so the  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:44):**  basic pitch was we would buy land that was inherently good quality land that's been degraded  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:49):**  by inappropriate management.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:51):**  And over the life of the fund, we would double carrying capacity and reduce cost of production.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:56):**  The question that was always asked was how long would that take?  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:00):**  The typical how long is a piece of string type question.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:03):**  And my answer to them was always consistent to everyone we sat in front of when we're  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:06):**  looking at raising capital.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:08):**  It was very much it depends.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:10):**  It depends on seasonal conditions.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:12):**  If we get a run of good seasons, it could take us three years.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:16):**  If we get a run of average seasons, it could take five or six years.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:20):**  If it's really tough, it could take seven or eight.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:23):**  Now we ran into the longest, toughest, driest period on record on white records, white settlement  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:28):**  records here in Australia for that particular block of country.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:31):**  The investors not necessarily ecstatic about that, but they appreciated and they understood  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:37):**  that.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:38):**  And they are a long term investor.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:40):**  Our financier Rabobank, our manager there basically said to me, they don't panic too  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:45):**  quickly.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:46):**  And I think that was because they're a purely agriculture bank.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:50):**  They understand that process.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:52):**  So on the ground, the interesting thing has been the staff, our team have been very positive  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:59):**  the whole way through because they can see the benefits of the decisions we're making.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:04):**  They can see that playing out on the land.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:06):**  And especially after we did get the rain event and the flooding that came through, it is  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:11):**  noticeable the difference in response of our country managed appropriately or managed the  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:16):**  way that we consider to be the correct way to manage it compared to conventionally managed  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:20):**  country over the fence on our neighbors' properties.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:23):**  I think that's a very interesting point, both from the investor and financier perspective,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:27):**  as I think the Danish Pension Fund, but correct me if I'm wrong, has other positions in cattle.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:33):**  And obviously, Rabobank is one of the biggest lenders in the world, probably the biggest  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:37):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:38):**  And the drought was there for everyone.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:40):**  So what has been the difference on your land or the land you're managing versus the neighbor's  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:45):**  land?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:46):**  And has that been interesting to your investors, but also to your staff?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:50):**  I mean, you mentioned your staff, but also to your investors to see the differences that  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:54):**  your decisions and your management has made?  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:57):**  I think from the investor's point of view, they're basically in a holding pattern.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:02):**  They're not overly concerned about it.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:04):**  They're not actively involved in it because, let's be honest, there's not much they can  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:08):**  do about it.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:09):**  Where they had a review of the process, they had a look at what we were doing, and they  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:13):**  said, OK, well, everything we've said would happen is happening.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:16):**  It's just a case of waiting for seasonal conditions to swing back.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:20):**  And long-term averages, reversion to the mean, is something.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:23):**  I mean, unless there's been an incredible collapse in climate, this country will revert  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:28):**  and come back to some of our above-average seasons to balance up the below-average seasons.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:33):**  That's just what happens.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:34):**  And we have to be patient and wait for that to occur.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:38):**  The interesting thing is on the land itself, the way I describe it is we're going broke  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:43):**  slower than anybody else.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:45):**  We weren't making money because we had no stock, obviously.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:49):**  But because we weren't feeding and we weren't degrading our ecosystem, we were holding our  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:55):**  own and we were actually in a position that when the rain did come, the very interesting  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:59):**  observation from several of our managers, and you could see it on the land, was that  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:04):**  our land had far less runoff.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:06):**  So this is land that has been passed and desperately looking for rain for five or six years.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:11):**  And when the rain event did turn up, the amount of land that rejected that rain was terrifyingly  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:18):**  disheartening.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:19):**  It was just shocking that, you know, nice, steady, gentle rain, but it ran off because  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:24):**  the land had been so degraded that it was unable to accept that rain when it did arrive.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:29):**  We had very little runoff in our country, which means that what we did was we got the  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:32):**  benefit of the moisture when it did turn up.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:35):**  That will take time to build on that again and again, but you start to build an ecosystem  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:41):**  that actually accepts the moisture when it's available, whereas in a lot of cases, a lot  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:46):**  of these seasonally dry ecosystems have been so degraded that they actually reject the  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:51):**  thing that they most desperately need when nature does provide it, which is a fairly  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:56):**  perverse but unfortunate reality.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:58):**  And do you see that in these six years of drought in the neighbors or in the same area,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:04):**  has it been basically a lot of people closing up or selling or really growing broke, like  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:09):**  you mentioned before?  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:12):**  Has it grown the interest in regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:14):**  I think that's my bigger question.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:16):**  Do people see the difference now with the land you're managing?  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:19):**  I mean, we've discussed this in the first episode that it's very, very difficult to  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:22):**  go against centuries of agriculture and to be called stupid land management.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:26):**  I think you were mentioned more than a few times in the communities you entered.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:31):**  Has these extreme conditions, have they created maybe more space for the region X space?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:36):**  I think there's definitely more space in there.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:38):**  I think the opportunities, the number of, we've got neighbors who join us on a couple  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:43):**  of different places and they fly light aircraft because of the distances out here.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:48):**  And the number of times they've said to us that they know when they're coming over SLM  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:53):**  country, because from the air, it's not shiny.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:56):**  Meaning it's green.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:58):**  Well, not necessarily green, but it's not shiny.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:59):**  So if it's a bare ecosystem and it's been polished flat by animals and inappropriate  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:05):**  management, then the sun's reflecting off it much more strongly.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:09):**  So we have, if I look at some of the neighboring properties and some of the infralarge areas  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:14):**  of that land out there, not just the neighbors, but that whole ecosystem.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:18):**  And if you were using a single term to describe it, my term is hard or harsh.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:22):**  It's sharp.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:23):**  It's got definite edges to things and the plants themselves look hard and harsh and  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:27):**  sharp.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:28):**  Everything's got a roughness to it.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:30):**  If I look at our country, you can see some softness to the edges.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:34):**  You can see that we do have some herbage and some soft cover and the trees have actually  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:38):**  got some leaves and some foliage on them.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:41):**  The edges are a little bit rounded and a little bit more soft and gentle is what I see on  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:45):**  our country.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:46):**  Now, in terms of the acceptance in the neighbors, we've had one of the neighboring families  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:52):**  and they are a very good long-term family in the district.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:54):**  They've been very successful conventionally.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:56):**  They've just recently done some of the grazing management and the changing, and that came  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:00):**  as a pretty big shock to one of the three brothers.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:05):**  Their biggest challenge is what they actually do with it now in terms of how they change  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:09):**  their management, how they work that, especially having come through six fairly tough years  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:14):**  financially for them to make the changes they need to make.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:18):**  How do they actually fund that?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:19):**  And that's the questions that start to come through.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:21):**  But there is an awareness and an opening up of that definitely.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:24):**  Yeah, because it seems like many of the pioneers, at least in Australia and also in other places,  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:31):**  started from a place of basically being nearly broke and being forced to change.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:36):**  I don't see many that had a huge amount of money in their bank account, had the luxury  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:40):**  of thinking about it, but many actually are forced to change either because of drought  
**[0:15:45-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:45):**  or because of other decisions.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:46):**  And then that change is needed and is almost forced upon them.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:49):**  And luckily, some make the decision or at least go into the regenerative route and slowly  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:54):**  get out.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:55):**  Obviously, it's not easy.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:56):**  It's very complex.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:57):**  And transition finances, as maybe this family needs, is something that is absolutely necessary  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:03):**  once you've made the decision to speed it up, basically.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:06):**  Yeah, I think there's a couple of things in there.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:08):**  I think that it's like human beings, as an older man, a lot of times the reason that  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:14):**  you actually get fit is one of your friends dies of a heart attack in their 50s and you  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:18):**  go, God, mortality is hitting me in the face.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:20):**  And so shock to my system and I need to change something.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:23):**  From the agricultural point of view, yes, it usually is a desperation because if things  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:27):**  are working for you and you have a big pot of money in the bank account, why change?  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:32):**  Why risk changing something that's working well for you?  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:35):**  You need to have some degree of discomfort before you actually make that change.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:39):**  I think that's important.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:40):**  Or there needs to be something changing in your mindset or your ecosystem for you to  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:45):**  want to make that move.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:47):**  So on the transitional finance part of it, I think the important thing and the interesting  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:50):**  thing is that let's compare a couple.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:52):**  And that's why I gave the example and my description, my somewhat flippant description was that we're  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:56):**  going broke slower than everybody else, which is important in times like this because it  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:01):**  means you can survive and sustain and come out the other end.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:04):**  You need to have some sort of a buffer underneath you.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:07):**  I think what's interesting is some of the neighbors who were feeding their sheep and  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:11):**  feeding their stock and they're out every day buying in feed, buying in hay, buying  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:16):**  in cottonseed, buying in whatever to keep their animals going.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:20):**  And at the end of the thing, they say, well, you know, they will cover their feed cost.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:24):**  And you go, that's nice.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:25):**  But it didn't cover all the fuel and it didn't cover all the wear and tear and didn't cover  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:28):**  all the emotional stress and strain on them doing that.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:32):**  And critically importantly, it didn't cover the damage to the land and the decrease in  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:37):**  your asset base.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:39):**  The problem is that in conventional financial reporting, that asset base, the land itself,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:45):**  the inherent productive quality of the land, whether that's organic matter or soil carbon  
**[0:17:50-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:50):**  or whatever, whatever factor we want to sort of base it on, that's not taken into account.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:57):**  And so they will, you know, people say out in that country, say, oh, it always bounces  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:00):**  back.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:01):**  It always bounces back.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:02):**  It's like dropping a tennis ball.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:03):**  It bounces back, but never quite as high as it bounced the first time.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:07):**  And it slowly keeps bouncing lower and lower.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:10):**  And people lose sight of what it did look like.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:13):**  And there's no direct economic connection between where the land could be and where  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:18):**  it is.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:19):**  They don't see that vast gap in productive capacity.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:23):**  Second thing I think is critically important in making the transition, especially when  
**[0:18:26-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:26):**  things are dry, too many people wrap themselves up in their value as a human being, as a farmer,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:35):**  as a rancher is having animals.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:38):**  And if there are no animals on the property, what are they doing?  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:42):**  And if they've completely destocked and taken all the animals off at some level, it's an  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:46):**  admission of failure.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:49):**  Whereas my perspective is it should be an admission of success because you've done the  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:52):**  right thing.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:53):**  But a lot of these people consider that they haven't got any livestock in there and they're  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:56):**  not doing it tough and they're not covered in dust and sweat and dirty clothes and out  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:01):**  there struggling and doing what they think is the right thing.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:05):**  Then their personal value has been degraded because they're not doing the hard stuff and  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:10):**  they're not toughening it out.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:11):**  And we often had that.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:12):**  We had some managers who asked, so what are you guys doing?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:15):**  What are you guys doing?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:16):**  And I sort of said to them, well, it depends how you want to go.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:19):**  You can just say, well, we're just doing so.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:21):**  Or you can say, what we're doing is we're doing all the work that nobody did before  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:26):**  because they were doing the wrong stuff.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:27):**  So we're catching up.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:28):**  We're maintaining the property.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:29):**  We're getting everything ready for when the seasons come our way, which is what we've  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:32):**  done and we're getting the benefit of it now.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:35):**  Meaning putting in water, infrastructure, fencing and all of that.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:40):**  We'd already done the water and fencing infrastructure.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:43):**  In a lot of these cases, I sort of describe it that in some of these areas, people ran  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:48):**  out of ecological, emotional and social capital, financial capital two or three generations  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:53):**  ago and they've been going through the motions and there are a significant number of people  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:57):**  who are probably trapped on the land because they inherited it and it's their third or  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:02):**  fourth generation and they have to do the right thing to keep the whole family thing  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:05):**  going.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:06):**  So what our guys were doing was basically tidying up, just pushing rubbish into piles  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:11):**  and holes and cleaning up, straining up all the old fences.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:15):**  We put a lot of internal single wire electric fences, but obviously you've got the previous  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:18):**  existing fences that are on the property.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:20):**  A lot of those need to work.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:22):**  So they're straining up all those fences and just going back and tightening things up and  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:26):**  just general, keeping ship shape and bristle fashion, bringing the quality of the property  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:31):**  up.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:32):**  That's been the big part of it.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:33):**  So it's all been productive work.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:36):**  Yeah, maintenance of vehicles, tidying up sheds, just little things like spending a  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:42):**  half a day and screwing the roof down, taking the old nails out and putting screws in so  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:46):**  that if a big storm does come through, you don't lose the roof off the shed.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:50):**  A massive number of things that are probably jobs that have been accumulating for 30 or  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:55):**  40 years that you didn't get a chance to do and you wouldn't get a chance to do in a good  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:00):**  season because you're out moving the animals around and doing all the work that comes with  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:03):**  that.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:04):**  In a bad season when you should be adjusting your numbers down, taking advantage of that  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:09):**  to do that big catch up work, you're out there feeding animals, feeding animals and keep,  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:14):**  so you never get out of that locked in loop of being busy for the sake of being busy.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:20):**  Yeah, it's extremely interesting.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:21):**  I mean, taking the good years and not bad, but adjusting to that and using the time to  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:27):**  do, I mean, 30, 40 years of small tasks that end up being quite a lot.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:32):**  And if you're on 120,000 acre property, 40,000 or 50,000 hectare property, those little tasks,  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:38):**  if you have a small task per hectare, you've got 50,000 tasks.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:41):**  It's a few months work.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:42):**  It does.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:43):**  It adds up very rapidly.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:45):**  And if we look, I mean, we talked in October 2016 and now we're in July of 2019.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:52):**  What have you seen changing in the Regen-ac sector?  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:56):**  We can get into the investor part a bit later.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:58):**  I think it's very interesting because I think for both of your financiers and investors,  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:02):**  it was the first time they got into Regen-ac or one of the first at least.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:06):**  But in general, what have you seen changing in the sector as somebody that's deep on the  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:10):**  inside and is actually one of the biggest funds in the space?  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:14):**  I think there is an increasing awareness of the need to make some changes in how we're  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:20):**  doing agriculture.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:22):**  How directly that transfers or translates into action from an investor point of view  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:28):**  is a little bit questionable.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:30):**  There's a couple of things that happen.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:33):**  So in Australia, they're talking about obviously we have the Australian carbon trading scheme.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:37):**  So SLM has four projects with the federal government selling carbon offsets.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:42):**  So we are, as a result of our change in management, we're regenerating and regrowing mulga and  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:47):**  producing more biomass and getting offsets for that.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:50):**  So that's been a very positive part of the process in terms of monetizing that.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:55):**  Which is above soil carbon, right?  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:57):**  It's not soil carbon, but it's coming, right?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:59):**  It's coming as well.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:00):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:01):**  It's basically tree cover.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:02):**  It's increasing tree cover.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:03):**  Okay.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:04):**  Soil carbon is still a fair distance away practically in Australia.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:06):**  There's been some credit sold.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:08):**  But in terms of getting it to scale, we've still got a gap between where we are and where  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:14):**  we need to be on that.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:15):**  The federal government is talking about a biodiversity project in terms of getting funding  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:20):**  for biodiversity.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:22):**  And Queensland, one of the states in Australia, has a biodiversity fund that they're sort  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:28):**  of doing some projects with.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:30):**  So there's some government funding and some awareness around the biodiversity and how  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:34):**  they actually, early stages in terms of what do they measure, what do they record, what  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:39):**  do they pay and reward based on, is still to be determined.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:44):**  But at least there is that move starting.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:46):**  Investor Group on Climate Change and some of the other larger institutional groups,  
**[0:23:51-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:51):**  I think the gap you've got is between a project size that makes sense from a third party manager  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:59):**  like an SLM to run, where you have to have a certain amount of capital involved to be  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:03):**  able to generate enough fees to be able to pay for the people that need to be there to  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:08):**  run the project.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:09):**  So there's a certain minimum size and how you balance that minimum size up with a project  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:15):**  that makes sense with the requirement for the larger institutions to be able to deploy  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:21):**  their capital in big chunks.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:23):**  So some of these multibillion dollar institutions, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds,  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:31):**  et cetera, want to be able to write a single ticket of $100 million or $500 million.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:37):**  But they don't want to be the only investors, which means they're looking for investable  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:43):**  products that's $250 to $500 to a billion, which is pretty hard to make sense of in the  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:49):**  regenerative space.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:50):**  So that's the gap is between the project size that the current group managers of regenerative  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:58):**  agriculture can realistically run and hand on their heart, tell an investor they can  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:03):**  package and put together and show some track record on and the sheer size that the big  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:10):**  investors want in a project.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:12):**  And that's where there's some gaps in that part of it.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:15):**  So basically from the $100 million to the $250 to $500 million, which is not a lot,  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:21):**  but it's a two and a half slash five times, which makes everything very, very, very, very,  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:26):**  very different, very complex and you need yeah, you need a lot of different things,  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:30):**  a lot of different managers, a lot of land to be able to buy if you come for the buy  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:34):**  and hold strategy.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:36):**  And you've and you've got if you think about it, you're it's not a direct relationship,  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:40):**  a direct scaling relationship.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:42):**  But you need to be able to have two to two and a half times as many people on the ground  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:47):**  who had the training and experience in regenerative ag.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:50):**  And that is the number of people who are out there doing that.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:53):**  Going back to our first the start of the conversation where the people who've made the change to  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:57):**  regenerative ag are usually family farmers who have had some stress or some strain in  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:02):**  the system and have made that move.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:05):**  Having made that move, they've solved their problem or they've alleviated their concern.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:10):**  They're not then saying to themselves, I'd rather leave the family farm that I've spent  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:14):**  all this time and effort getting back on track and I can see all the benefits and my family's  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:19):**  happy and we're making money and the land is happy and my life is good.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:24):**  That's our resource base in terms of the intellectual capacity and the experience of running these  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:29):**  properties.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:30):**  But you can't pick them out of that and say, let's go and run something else for an institution  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:33):**  because they don't want to do that.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:35):**  Why would they?  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:36):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:37):**  They've created their own piece of paradise.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:38):**  And why would they leave?  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:39):**  Exactly.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:40):**  So then what you've got to find is who do I get to fill that gap in and how many of  
**[0:26:46-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:46):**  those people are out there of the right experience, capacity, quality, attitude, et cetera.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:54):**  I can find enough to run $250 million worth of whatever the investment is.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:59):**  Can I find enough to run $500 million?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:01):**  Well, that's twice as many people.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:02):**  And I've just got, you know, you start to run out of people, unfortunately, on the way  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:07):**  through as well, I think.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:08):**  Is that the biggest constraint in the sector at the moment?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:11):**  I don't think it's the biggest constraint.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:13):**  I think it's the gap that you've got is somebody coming into investing in regenerative ag,  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:20):**  there is a transition period.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:23):**  So you're either where we are in large scale, extensive country that hasn't had a lot of  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:28):**  artificial fertilizer and artificial inputs, but has been degraded.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:33):**  You're waiting for seasonal conditions to allow nature to recover.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:37):**  And that little hockey stick curve, that little change is going to take some period of time,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:42):**  you know, three to seven to 10 years, whatever that period is.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:45):**  You start to move into, say, a transition from conventional cropping, high fertilizer,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:51):**  high tillage, et cetera, to a more natural, less intrusive cropping program, you're taking  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:59):**  land off artificial support.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:03):**  And that land is going to take a while to change and heal itself up because the biology  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:07):**  that's needed for the crop to grow without those artificial fertilizers has been suppressed  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:13):**  because of the artificial fertilizers.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:14):**  There's going to be a gap in that period of time.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:17):**  So for an investor to come into the program, what they've got to do is really have a recording  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:22):**  timeframe.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:23):**  They've got to have an overall picture that's at least a 15 year investment horizon.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:28):**  So when they start, they're in for 15 years and they probably need to look at it in year  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:33):**  five and year 10 and not worry about in the middle.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:36):**  If they look at it too often, they're going to see the drops and not understand what's  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:40):**  happening.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:41):**  And they've got to say, okay, we're in here for 15 years minimum.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:45):**  And during that time, we will look at it seriously in year five and seriously in year 10.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:50):**  That's from the reporting side of it.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:53):**  From the balance sheet side of it, what needs to come onto the program in terms of the balance  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:58):**  sheet is appreciating and actually recording that the real asset you've got is the ecological  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:04):**  health and resilience of your land.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:08):**  And how do you actually track that?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:11):**  And that's the biggest thing that's probably been missing from an SLM's point of view is  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:14):**  during that six years, we have made changes on the land, but that's not reflected somewhere  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:19):**  because it's waiting to come out of the productive increase once the seasonal conditions change.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:25):**  But if you had some reporting process that had biodiversity measurements, whatever they  
**[0:29:30-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:30):**  are, soil quality, health, soil carbon measurements, some aspect that gave you a real feel for  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:37):**  what the asset base itself was doing so that even during that time while that transition  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:43):**  is happening, you can see my asset is improving and I'm waiting, I'm going to get the benefit  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:48):**  of that in year five, year six, year eight.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:51):**  That's probably the two things that I'd see is the investment horizon and the frequency  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:56):**  of checking in, especially with the regenerative process, and the second thing would be bringing  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:02):**  somehow into your accounting system and your record keeping system the real asset, which  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:08):**  is the ecological health of your land.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:10):**  And is that the biggest thing you would do differently if you do it all over again?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:15):**  What would you do differently looking at the fund, looking at SLM with the knowledge obviously  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:20):**  you have now, you wouldn't know six years of drought.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:22):**  I mean, that's unpredictable.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:24):**  But what would be your change?  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:26):**  Yeah, this is basically sliding doors.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:29):**  I mean, if we had had the seasonal conditions on the way through a couple of different seasonal  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:34):**  events, everything would have changed.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:36):**  And you look back and the biggest problem you've got is that you look back and compare  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:39):**  what actually happened with an imaginary alternative scenario in which no problem occurred.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:45):**  Okay.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:46):**  And obviously there is some problem that would have occurred.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:48):**  Yeah, it could be something else.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:51):**  We probably raised less capital than we needed for the strategy itself.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:54):**  The original strategy was a $300 million fund, a $300 million fund.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:58):**  We would have been in three or four different geographic locations in Australia.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:03):**  And while things were tough in one, they would have been, we would have balanced that off  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:06):**  a little bit.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:07):**  So a bit of the diversification aspect of that.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:10):**  From the infrastructure point of view, maybe a couple of slight changes there.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:14):**  It's really hard because you're looking at looking back on six incredibly tough years.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:19):**  It sounds that you wouldn't have done so much different actually, except for raising more  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:23):**  money, but of course you tried to do that.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:25):**  It wasn't that you said no to $200 million somewhere along the way.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:30):**  Exactly.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:31):**  I mean, this is the thing is that probably 90 to 95% of what we did, we would have, or  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:34):**  I would do again, there's a few things we would have changed.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:37):**  If I had known we were coming into six incredibly tough years, then I would have said, you know,  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:40):**  stayed at home and done something different.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:42):**  But having said that, we would not have achieved what we've achieved on the ground.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:46):**  So if I look at it, you know, we're selling, providing millions of carbon offsets per annum  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:50):**  into the Australian government fund.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:52):**  We have regenerated the ecosystem.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:54):**  We have made major changes on the land.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:56):**  We are seeing the benefits of that coming through now.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:59):**  What we've done, drought itself doesn't degrade a grassland.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:04):**  Management during and after the drought is what degrades the grassland.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:07):**  And what we've done is we've managed appropriately during that time and we're starting to see  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:11):**  the benefits of that.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:12):**  So my fundamental belief is that over the investment period of the fund, you know, that  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:17):**  10 to 15 years, you know, we would double current capacity, half cost of production  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:21):**  and 100% convinced that over that timeframe, we will achieve exactly that.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:26):**  And obviously with the current capacity based on the actual carrying capacity of the land,  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:31):**  not just some imaginary number.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:33):**  And you've proved that you are able to adjust to that as you basically destock because  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:39):**  the current capacity in the dry years was very, very low, maybe even zero.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:43):**  So you, yeah, there's a current capacity is not just a number that you, that comes out  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:48):**  of their spreadsheet.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:49):**  It's a number that's based on the land.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:50):**  Current capacity is what comes up from the land.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:52):**  So what the land itself can do, the stocking rate is what we put down on the land.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:56):**  So we match the number of animals with what the land can carry.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:59):**  And if you get that right, then that's, that's number one factor, get that right.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:04):**  And things start to work really well.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:06):**  And the way that that will work, what we'll show is basically the number of animals that  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:10):**  we did graze, the number of animals that we did sell, the number of animals that went  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:13):**  into the marketplace.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:14):**  And that's pretty much, you know, in black and white and with Australia's national livestock  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:19):**  identification scheme, where every animal has a radio frequency tag in its ear, they're  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:25):**  either there or they're not, it's pretty straightforward.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:27):**  And so what is happening for the next, let's say the next part of the year until the end?  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:32):**  Are you hoping for rain?  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:33):**  Are there any other big events here?  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:36):**  Is there rain coming?  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:38):**  As you know, what, what, what, how does the year look like the rest of 2019 for you?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:43):**  The rain that we got that the 90 to 130 mils of rain that we got was out of the forecast  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:48):**  is that we expected to get somewhere between five and 10 mils.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:50):**  So it's surprises on the upside.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:53):**  The number of times that the rain has actually turned up a surprise on the downside outweighs  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:57):**  that.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:58):**  The seasonal conditions are showing being sort of average long term for the next six  
**[0:34:04-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:04):**  to 12 months.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:05):**  No dramatic changes.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:07):**  Having said that, the country that we're in looking at 150 years worth of records each  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:12):**  month can be a record breaking month and it can come out of nowhere.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:16):**  Normally a very large long term drought is broken by a very out of nowhere type rain  
**[0:34:22-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:22):**  event.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:23):**  A big cyclone will form, an out of season cyclone, some big tropical rain event will  
**[0:34:26-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:26):**  start to come through.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:28):**  That's incredibly unpredictable.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:30):**  So what we do is we deal with the reality that's on the ground.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:33):**  And at the moment we have had some flooding through our land.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:36):**  So on 140,000 hectares, we've probably had 30 to 40,000 hectares received beneficial  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:42):**  flooding.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:43):**  We've done our assessments of our carrying capacity on those and we've got animals in  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:48):**  that match that with the intention that those animals have a solid six months worth of feed  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:52):**  in front of them.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:53):**  They're young breeding females, which means that during that period of time, if the seasons  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:59):**  don't improve dramatically, we have taken them from a smaller weight to a larger weight  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:04):**  and they become an animal that can be sold into the feedlot market or whatever.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:09):**  If we do get a good seasonal change, they're an animal that then can get joined and become  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:13):**  a reproductive animal producing calves down the track.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:16):**  So we've got a couple of options there.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:18):**  And I want to end with a question that John Kemp often asked and I borrowed it from him  
**[0:35:23-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:23):**  and adjusted it slightly.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:25):**  What do you believe that is true about Regen Ag that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:31):**  That it works.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:32):**  I think it's a perfect answer.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:33):**  Thank you, Tony, so much for your time.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:35):**  Thank you.

**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:37):**  And I will definitely check in earlier this time, not after almost three years.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:40):**  That's fine.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:41):**  Hopefully you get some beneficial rain, not too much, not too little, just the right amount.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:44):**  We'll take more than less, trust me.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:48):**  We can cope with as much as nature will provide.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:50):**  Thank you so much, Tony.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:51):**  Have a great day.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:52):**  Been a pleasure.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:53):**  Take care.

**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:38:33):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:38:35):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:38:40):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:38:45):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:38:50):**  if you're a soil builder.

**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:39:06):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:39:08):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:39:10):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:39:14):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:39:16):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

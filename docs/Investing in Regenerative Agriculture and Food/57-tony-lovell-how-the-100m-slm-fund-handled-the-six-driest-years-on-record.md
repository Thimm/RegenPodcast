**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:14):**  You will listen to a check-in interview with Tony Lovell where we discuss how his 100 million  dollar RegenEgg fund is doing after 6 of the driest years ever recorded.  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:30):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:45):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:57):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:11):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:24):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:36):**  For more information please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  And now, without further ado, the interview.  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:45):**  Welcome to the podcast, today I'm speaking to Tony Lovell, co-founder of SLM Partners.  I interviewed Tony before in October 2016 as the second interview ever on this podcast  and I'm very happy to check in with him again and see how things have developed in the last  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:58):**  almost three years.  Welcome again Tony!  Thank you very much, pleasure to be here.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:03):**  So to start with a question, I will definitely link the interview we've done before in the  show notes below.  But for those who haven't heard it, what is SLM, what has been the strategy of the fund  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:14):**  in Australia?  So let's get into a few of those details.  SLM Partners was, SLM stands for Sustainable Land Management.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:22):**  So we started in 2012, raised $75 million from a Danish pension fund, another $30 million  worth of finance from an international bank, Rabo Bank, an incredibly supportive agricultural  bank.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:36):**  Both of those groups are very supportive of the agriculture.  What we did was we acquired large areas of what we described as inherently good quality  country that had been degraded by inappropriate management, unintentional but inappropriate  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:51):**  management.  And as a result of 150 years of set stopping in a seasonally dry, erratic rainfall and  ecosystem, productivity, production, performance, biodiversity, everything had gone south, had  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:05):**  reduced.  So the intention was to acquire that property, spend money on infrastructure, water fencing  upgrades and then change the grazing management with the intention to over the life of the  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:18):**  fund, a 10 to 15 year fund, double carrying capacity, half cost of production and be a  large scale, low cost producer of high quality grass fed protein.  That was the project fund, the project thesis and it remains the project thesis.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:32):**  We also said that we would, as the opportunities arose, monetise, I don't like the term, but  ecosystem services, so carbon offsets, water and air quality offsets, whatever came available,  biodiversity credits.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:47):**  And we've been able to do that as well.  So that's the basic thesis of the fund, a very simple process, buy the land, do the  infrastructure, change the management and allow nature to recover and bring back the  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:58):**  productivity that land inherently is capable of.  And in terms, just to give people a sense of scale, this is in Australia, so everything's  big.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:08):**  How much land did you buy and what?  Because we can imagine, OK, it's about a hundred, just north of a hundred million dollars you  raised.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:16):**  How much land does that get you?  What are the dimensions which you think of?  OK, well, the total amount of land that we have in the fund itself is four hundred eighty  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:24):**  thousand hectares, actively developed with water and fencing and the infrastructure is  about half of that, two hundred and twenty, two hundred and forty thousand hectares.  And the other two hundred thousand hectares is large scale in Australia.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:40):**  Mulga is a leguminous native tree and it's a carbon project, so a regenerative carbon  project with less intense management.  But the intense management is on the remaining part of the country.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:52):**  So it's a fair chunk of land.  And when did you start?  I mean, you said 2012.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:58):**  When did you raise and did you start buying your first properties?  Was it the same year?  Was it slightly after?  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:03):**  We started raise.  We had our first close in June 2012 and we started acquiring properties shortly thereafter.  First active took possession of our first property at about December 2012, January 2013,  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:18):**  had finished our acquisition stage by the end of 2014 and then just stepped into long  term management and waiting for it to rain, basically.  Yeah, because let's discuss that a bit.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:30):**  You've discussed some drought before in 2016 when we did our first interview and you even  discussed the decision you made within the holistic management decision making framework  to actually destock.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:42):**  Where are you now as we're talking in July 2019?  And I think it did rain a bit finally.  Yeah.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:49):**  OK, so a couple of things on that.  The land that we've got is in terms of holistic management talk is brittle tending.  So it's erratic and unreliable rainfall patterns.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:00):**  Long term average rainfall for the country we've got is around that three hundred and  seventy five millimetres a year.  But that can vary widely.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:08):**  We bought in 2012 off the back of two very good seasons.  Our country also gets beneficial flooding.  So we'd had two very good seasons.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:17):**  Unfortunately, with conventional management, the benefit that we should have received from  that was pretty much ephemeral and didn't really run through.  So we then ran into six of the driest years on record.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:31):**  Effectively, if the average rainfall is three seventy five millimetres, we were down to  like one hundred millimetres, two hundred millimetres.  So we were less than half of long term average rainfall year on year, six years in a row.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:44):**  What that means is the first year is tough.  The second year compounds off that.  Keep going forward five or six and it gets pretty challenging to put it mildly.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:54):**  One of the things that we do, I think is critically important, is we match our stocking rates  to our carrying capacity.  And I describe us as being fully stocked, as in properly stocked.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:05):**  We had the correct number of stock for what the land itself could carry.  We assessed the land could carry no livestock and we matched to that.  I believe nothing is more economically damaging than running animals on land when the land  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:20):**  can't sustain that.  It's also incredibly ecologically damaging and socially damaging, but it's fundamentally  economically damaging.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:28):**  We have probably in the last three to six months actually had some reasonable rain.  We had between 90 and 130 millimetres.  We are still a long way short of where we we would like to be on a long term average  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:41):**  basis.  But that was combined with some beneficial flooding as we speak on the land that we've  got that received the beneficial flooding.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:52):**  We are back up to just shy of 5000 cattle and we should be able to run those through  for the next six to nine months.  And we're hoping to get some follow up rain to run to continue the project moving forward.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:02):**  Yeah, because I can imagine it has been extremely challenging, especially as you are in a project  that has a sort of deadline after you mentioned 10 to 15 years.  It's not as you can could run it maybe longer, but theoretically, at least the fund has an  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:17):**  ending date, it's not an evergreen.  How has that been the process with your investors and with all the people involved that you  got those six horrible, very dry years right at the beginning basically of the fund?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:29):**  Has it been a tough process to basically get around?  It's been character building.  I have far more character than I ever thought I'd needed.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:37):**  So it's been very challenging during that period of time.  The good thing from two points of view, the investors understood at the start, so the  basic pitch was we would buy land that was inherently good quality land that's been degraded  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:49):**  by inappropriate management.  And over the life of the fund, we would double carrying capacity and reduce cost of production.  The question that was always asked was how long would that take?  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:00):**  The typical how long is a piece of string type question.  And my answer to them was always consistent to everyone we sat in front of when we're  looking at raising capital.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:08):**  It was very much it depends.  It depends on seasonal conditions.  If we get a run of good seasons, it could take us three years.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:16):**  If we get a run of average seasons, it could take five or six years.  If it's really tough, it could take seven or eight.  Now we ran into the longest, toughest, driest period on record on white records, white settlement  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:28):**  records here in Australia for that particular block of country.  The investors not necessarily ecstatic about that, but they appreciated and they understood  that.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:38):**  And they are a long term investor.  Our financier Rabobank, our manager there basically said to me, they don't panic too  quickly.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:46):**  And I think that was because they're a purely agriculture bank.  They understand that process.  So on the ground, the interesting thing has been the staff, our team have been very positive  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:59):**  the whole way through because they can see the benefits of the decisions we're making.  They can see that playing out on the land.  And especially after we did get the rain event and the flooding that came through, it is  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:11):**  noticeable the difference in response of our country managed appropriately or managed the  way that we consider to be the correct way to manage it compared to conventionally managed  country over the fence on our neighbors' properties.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:23):**  I think that's a very interesting point, both from the investor and financier perspective,  as I think the Danish Pension Fund, but correct me if I'm wrong, has other positions in cattle.  And obviously, Rabobank is one of the biggest lenders in the world, probably the biggest  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:37):**  in agriculture.  And the drought was there for everyone.  So what has been the difference on your land or the land you're managing versus the neighbor's  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:45):**  land?  And has that been interesting to your investors, but also to your staff?  I mean, you mentioned your staff, but also to your investors to see the differences that  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:10:54):**  your decisions and your management has made?  I think from the investor's point of view, they're basically in a holding pattern.  They're not overly concerned about it.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:04):**  They're not actively involved in it because, let's be honest, there's not much they can  do about it.  Where they had a review of the process, they had a look at what we were doing, and they  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:13):**  said, OK, well, everything we've said would happen is happening.  It's just a case of waiting for seasonal conditions to swing back.  And long-term averages, reversion to the mean, is something.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:23):**  I mean, unless there's been an incredible collapse in climate, this country will revert  and come back to some of our above-average seasons to balance up the below-average seasons.  That's just what happens.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:34):**  And we have to be patient and wait for that to occur.  The interesting thing is on the land itself, the way I describe it is we're going broke  slower than anybody else.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:45):**  We weren't making money because we had no stock, obviously.  But because we weren't feeding and we weren't degrading our ecosystem, we were holding our  own and we were actually in a position that when the rain did come, the very interesting  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:11:59):**  observation from several of our managers, and you could see it on the land, was that  our land had far less runoff.  So this is land that has been passed and desperately looking for rain for five or six years.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:11):**  And when the rain event did turn up, the amount of land that rejected that rain was terrifyingly  disheartening.  It was just shocking that, you know, nice, steady, gentle rain, but it ran off because  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:24):**  the land had been so degraded that it was unable to accept that rain when it did arrive.  We had very little runoff in our country, which means that what we did was we got the  benefit of the moisture when it did turn up.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:35):**  That will take time to build on that again and again, but you start to build an ecosystem  that actually accepts the moisture when it's available, whereas in a lot of cases, a lot  of these seasonally dry ecosystems have been so degraded that they actually reject the  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:12:51):**  thing that they most desperately need when nature does provide it, which is a fairly  perverse but unfortunate reality.  And do you see that in these six years of drought in the neighbors or in the same area,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:04):**  has it been basically a lot of people closing up or selling or really growing broke, like  you mentioned before?  Has it grown the interest in regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:14):**  I think that's my bigger question.  Do people see the difference now with the land you're managing?  I mean, we've discussed this in the first episode that it's very, very difficult to  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:22):**  go against centuries of agriculture and to be called stupid land management.  I think you were mentioned more than a few times in the communities you entered.  Has these extreme conditions, have they created maybe more space for the region X space?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:36):**  I think there's definitely more space in there.  I think the opportunities, the number of, we've got neighbors who join us on a couple  of different places and they fly light aircraft because of the distances out here.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:48):**  And the number of times they've said to us that they know when they're coming over SLM  country, because from the air, it's not shiny.  Meaning it's green.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:13:57):**  Yeah.  Well, not necessarily green, but it's not shiny.  So if it's a bare ecosystem and it's been polished flat by animals and inappropriate  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:05):**  management, then the sun's reflecting off it much more strongly.  So we have, if I look at some of the neighboring properties and some of the infralarge areas  of that land out there, not just the neighbors, but that whole ecosystem.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:18):**  And if you were using a single term to describe it, my term is hard or harsh.  It's sharp.  It's got definite edges to things and the plants themselves look hard and harsh and  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:27):**  sharp.  Everything's got a roughness to it.  If I look at our country, you can see some softness to the edges.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:34):**  You can see that we do have some herbage and some soft cover and the trees have actually  got some leaves and some foliage on them.  The edges are a little bit rounded and a little bit more soft and gentle is what I see on  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:45):**  our country.  Now, in terms of the acceptance in the neighbors, we've had one of the neighboring families  and they are a very good long-term family in the district.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:14:54):**  They've been very successful conventionally.  They've just recently done some of the grazing management and the changing, and that came  as a pretty big shock to one of the three brothers.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:05):**  Their biggest challenge is what they actually do with it now in terms of how they change  their management, how they work that, especially having come through six fairly tough years  financially for them to make the changes they need to make.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:18):**  How do they actually fund that?  And that's the questions that start to come through.  But there is an awareness and an opening up of that definitely.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:24):**  Yeah, because it seems like many of the pioneers, at least in Australia and also in other places,  started from a place of basically being nearly broke and being forced to change.  I don't see many that had a huge amount of money in their bank account, had the luxury  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:40):**  of thinking about it, but many actually are forced to change either because of drought  or because of other decisions.  And then that change is needed and is almost forced upon them.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:49):**  And luckily, some make the decision or at least go into the regenerative route and slowly  get out.  Obviously, it's not easy.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:15:56):**  It's very complex.  And transition finances, as maybe this family needs, is something that is absolutely necessary  once you've made the decision to speed it up, basically.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:06):**  Yeah, I think there's a couple of things in there.  I think that it's like human beings, as an older man, a lot of times the reason that  you actually get fit is one of your friends dies of a heart attack in their 50s and you  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:18):**  go, God, mortality is hitting me in the face.  And so shock to my system and I need to change something.  From the agricultural point of view, yes, it usually is a desperation because if things  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:27):**  are working for you and you have a big pot of money in the bank account, why change?  Why risk changing something that's working well for you?  You need to have some degree of discomfort before you actually make that change.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:39):**  I think that's important.  Or there needs to be something changing in your mindset or your ecosystem for you to  want to make that move.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:47):**  So on the transitional finance part of it, I think the important thing and the interesting  thing is that let's compare a couple.  And that's why I gave the example and my description, my somewhat flippant description was that we're  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:16:56):**  going broke slower than everybody else, which is important in times like this because it  means you can survive and sustain and come out the other end.  You need to have some sort of a buffer underneath you.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:07):**  I think what's interesting is some of the neighbors who were feeding their sheep and  feeding their stock and they're out every day buying in feed, buying in hay, buying  in cottonseed, buying in whatever to keep their animals going.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:20):**  And at the end of the thing, they say, well, you know, they will cover their feed cost.  And you go, that's nice.  But it didn't cover all the fuel and it didn't cover all the wear and tear and didn't cover  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:28):**  all the emotional stress and strain on them doing that.  And critically importantly, it didn't cover the damage to the land and the decrease in  your asset base.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:39):**  The problem is that in conventional financial reporting, that asset base, the land itself,  the inherent productive quality of the land, whether that's organic matter or soil carbon  or whatever, whatever factor we want to sort of base it on, that's not taken into account.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:17:57):**  And so they will, you know, people say out in that country, say, oh, it always bounces  back.  It always bounces back.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:02):**  It's like dropping a tennis ball.  It bounces back, but never quite as high as it bounced the first time.  And it slowly keeps bouncing lower and lower.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:10):**  And people lose sight of what it did look like.  And there's no direct economic connection between where the land could be and where  it is.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:19):**  They don't see that vast gap in productive capacity.  Second thing I think is critically important in making the transition, especially when  things are dry, too many people wrap themselves up in their value as a human being, as a farmer,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:35):**  as a rancher is having animals.  And if there are no animals on the property, what are they doing?  And if they've completely destocked and taken all the animals off at some level, it's an  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:46):**  admission of failure.  Whereas my perspective is it should be an admission of success because you've done the  right thing.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:18:53):**  But a lot of these people consider that they haven't got any livestock in there and they're  not doing it tough and they're not covered in dust and sweat and dirty clothes and out  there struggling and doing what they think is the right thing.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:05):**  Then their personal value has been degraded because they're not doing the hard stuff and  they're not toughening it out.  And we often had that.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:12):**  We had some managers who asked, so what are you guys doing?  What are you guys doing?  And I sort of said to them, well, it depends how you want to go.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:19):**  You can just say, well, we're just doing so.  Or you can say, what we're doing is we're doing all the work that nobody did before  because they were doing the wrong stuff.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:27):**  So we're catching up.  We're maintaining the property.  We're getting everything ready for when the seasons come our way, which is what we've  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:32):**  done and we're getting the benefit of it now.  Meaning putting in water, infrastructure, fencing and all of that.  We'd already done the water and fencing infrastructure.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:43):**  In a lot of these cases, I sort of describe it that in some of these areas, people ran  out of ecological, emotional and social capital, financial capital two or three generations  ago and they've been going through the motions and there are a significant number of people  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:19:57):**  who are probably trapped on the land because they inherited it and it's their third or  fourth generation and they have to do the right thing to keep the whole family thing  going.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:06):**  So what our guys were doing was basically tidying up, just pushing rubbish into piles  and holes and cleaning up, straining up all the old fences.  We put a lot of internal single wire electric fences, but obviously you've got the previous  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:18):**  existing fences that are on the property.  A lot of those need to work.  So they're straining up all those fences and just going back and tightening things up and  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:26):**  just general, keeping ship shape and bristle fashion, bringing the quality of the property  up.  That's been the big part of it.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:33):**  So it's all been productive work.  Yeah, maintenance of vehicles, tidying up sheds, just little things like spending a  half a day and screwing the roof down, taking the old nails out and putting screws in so  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:20:46):**  that if a big storm does come through, you don't lose the roof off the shed.  A massive number of things that are probably jobs that have been accumulating for 30 or  40 years that you didn't get a chance to do and you wouldn't get a chance to do in a good  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:00):**  season because you're out moving the animals around and doing all the work that comes with  that.  In a bad season when you should be adjusting your numbers down, taking advantage of that  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:09):**  to do that big catch up work, you're out there feeding animals, feeding animals and keep,  so you never get out of that locked in loop of being busy for the sake of being busy.  Yeah, it's extremely interesting.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:21):**  I mean, taking the good years and not bad, but adjusting to that and using the time to  do, I mean, 30, 40 years of small tasks that end up being quite a lot.  And if you're on 120,000 acre property, 40,000 or 50,000 hectare property, those little tasks,  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:38):**  if you have a small task per hectare, you've got 50,000 tasks.  It's a few months work.  It does.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:43):**  It adds up very rapidly.  And if we look, I mean, we talked in October 2016 and now we're in July of 2019.  What have you seen changing in the Regen-ac sector?  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:21:56):**  We can get into the investor part a bit later.  I think it's very interesting because I think for both of your financiers and investors,  it was the first time they got into Regen-ac or one of the first at least.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:06):**  But in general, what have you seen changing in the sector as somebody that's deep on the  inside and is actually one of the biggest funds in the space?  I think there is an increasing awareness of the need to make some changes in how we're  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:20):**  doing agriculture.  How directly that transfers or translates into action from an investor point of view  is a little bit questionable.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:30):**  There's a couple of things that happen.  So in Australia, they're talking about obviously we have the Australian carbon trading scheme.  So SLM has four projects with the federal government selling carbon offsets.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:42):**  So we are, as a result of our change in management, we're regenerating and regrowing mulga and  producing more biomass and getting offsets for that.  So that's been a very positive part of the process in terms of monetizing that.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:22:55):**  Which is above soil carbon, right?  It's not soil carbon, but it's coming, right?  It's coming as well.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:00):**  Yeah, exactly.  It's basically tree cover.  It's increasing tree cover.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:03):**  Okay.  Soil carbon is still a fair distance away practically in Australia.  There's been some credit sold.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:08):**  But in terms of getting it to scale, we've still got a gap between where we are and where  we need to be on that.  The federal government is talking about a biodiversity project in terms of getting funding  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:20):**  for biodiversity.  And Queensland, one of the states in Australia, has a biodiversity fund that they're sort  of doing some projects with.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:30):**  So there's some government funding and some awareness around the biodiversity and how  they actually, early stages in terms of what do they measure, what do they record, what  do they pay and reward based on, is still to be determined.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:44):**  But at least there is that move starting.  Investor Group on Climate Change and some of the other larger institutional groups,  I think the gap you've got is between a project size that makes sense from a third party manager  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:23:59):**  like an SLM to run, where you have to have a certain amount of capital involved to be  able to generate enough fees to be able to pay for the people that need to be there to  run the project.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:09):**  So there's a certain minimum size and how you balance that minimum size up with a project  that makes sense with the requirement for the larger institutions to be able to deploy  their capital in big chunks.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:23):**  So some of these multibillion dollar institutions, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds,  et cetera, want to be able to write a single ticket of $100 million or $500 million.  But they don't want to be the only investors, which means they're looking for investable  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:43):**  products that's $250 to $500 to a billion, which is pretty hard to make sense of in the  regenerative space.  So that's the gap is between the project size that the current group managers of regenerative  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:24:58):**  agriculture can realistically run and hand on their heart, tell an investor they can  package and put together and show some track record on and the sheer size that the big  investors want in a project.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:12):**  And that's where there's some gaps in that part of it.  So basically from the $100 million to the $250 to $500 million, which is not a lot,  but it's a two and a half slash five times, which makes everything very, very, very, very,  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:26):**  very different, very complex and you need yeah, you need a lot of different things,  a lot of different managers, a lot of land to be able to buy if you come for the buy  and hold strategy.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:35):**  Yeah.  And you've and you've got if you think about it, you're it's not a direct relationship,  a direct scaling relationship.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:42):**  But you need to be able to have two to two and a half times as many people on the ground  who had the training and experience in regenerative ag.  And that is the number of people who are out there doing that.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:25:53):**  Going back to our first the start of the conversation where the people who've made the change to  regenerative ag are usually family farmers who have had some stress or some strain in  the system and have made that move.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:05):**  Having made that move, they've solved their problem or they've alleviated their concern.  They're not then saying to themselves, I'd rather leave the family farm that I've spent  all this time and effort getting back on track and I can see all the benefits and my family's  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:19):**  happy and we're making money and the land is happy and my life is good.  That's our resource base in terms of the intellectual capacity and the experience of running these  properties.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:30):**  But you can't pick them out of that and say, let's go and run something else for an institution  because they don't want to do that.  Why would they?  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:36):**  Yeah, that's right.  They've created their own piece of paradise.  And why would they leave?  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:39):**  Exactly.  So then what you've got to find is who do I get to fill that gap in and how many of  those people are out there of the right experience, capacity, quality, attitude, et cetera.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:26:54):**  I can find enough to run $250 million worth of whatever the investment is.  Can I find enough to run $500 million?  Well, that's twice as many people.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:02):**  And I've just got, you know, you start to run out of people, unfortunately, on the way  through as well, I think.  Is that the biggest constraint in the sector at the moment?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:11):**  I don't think it's the biggest constraint.  I think it's the gap that you've got is somebody coming into investing in regenerative ag,  there is a transition period.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:23):**  So you're either where we are in large scale, extensive country that hasn't had a lot of  artificial fertilizer and artificial inputs, but has been degraded.  You're waiting for seasonal conditions to allow nature to recover.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:37):**  And that little hockey stick curve, that little change is going to take some period of time,  you know, three to seven to 10 years, whatever that period is.  You start to move into, say, a transition from conventional cropping, high fertilizer,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:27:51):**  high tillage, et cetera, to a more natural, less intrusive cropping program, you're taking  land off artificial support.  And that land is going to take a while to change and heal itself up because the biology  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:07):**  that's needed for the crop to grow without those artificial fertilizers has been suppressed  because of the artificial fertilizers.  There's going to be a gap in that period of time.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:17):**  So for an investor to come into the program, what they've got to do is really have a recording  timeframe.  They've got to have an overall picture that's at least a 15 year investment horizon.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:28):**  So when they start, they're in for 15 years and they probably need to look at it in year  five and year 10 and not worry about in the middle.  If they look at it too often, they're going to see the drops and not understand what's  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:40):**  happening.  And they've got to say, okay, we're in here for 15 years minimum.  And during that time, we will look at it seriously in year five and seriously in year 10.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:28:50):**  That's from the reporting side of it.  From the balance sheet side of it, what needs to come onto the program in terms of the balance  sheet is appreciating and actually recording that the real asset you've got is the ecological  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:04):**  health and resilience of your land.  And how do you actually track that?  And that's the biggest thing that's probably been missing from an SLM's point of view is  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:14):**  during that six years, we have made changes on the land, but that's not reflected somewhere  because it's waiting to come out of the productive increase once the seasonal conditions change.  But if you had some reporting process that had biodiversity measurements, whatever they  
**[0:29:30-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:30):**  are, soil quality, health, soil carbon measurements, some aspect that gave you a real feel for  what the asset base itself was doing so that even during that time while that transition  is happening, you can see my asset is improving and I'm waiting, I'm going to get the benefit  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:29:48):**  of that in year five, year six, year eight.  That's probably the two things that I'd see is the investment horizon and the frequency  of checking in, especially with the regenerative process, and the second thing would be bringing  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:02):**  somehow into your accounting system and your record keeping system the real asset, which  is the ecological health of your land.  And is that the biggest thing you would do differently if you do it all over again?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:15):**  What would you do differently looking at the fund, looking at SLM with the knowledge obviously  you have now, you wouldn't know six years of drought.  I mean, that's unpredictable.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:24):**  But what would be your change?  Yeah, this is basically sliding doors.  I mean, if we had had the seasonal conditions on the way through a couple of different seasonal  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:34):**  events, everything would have changed.  And you look back and the biggest problem you've got is that you look back and compare  what actually happened with an imaginary alternative scenario in which no problem occurred.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:45):**  Okay.  And obviously there is some problem that would have occurred.  Yeah, it could be something else.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:50):**  Yeah.  We probably raised less capital than we needed for the strategy itself.  The original strategy was a $300 million fund, a $300 million fund.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:30:58):**  We would have been in three or four different geographic locations in Australia.  And while things were tough in one, they would have been, we would have balanced that off  a little bit.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:07):**  So a bit of the diversification aspect of that.  From the infrastructure point of view, maybe a couple of slight changes there.  It's really hard because you're looking at looking back on six incredibly tough years.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:19):**  It sounds that you wouldn't have done so much different actually, except for raising more  money, but of course you tried to do that.  It wasn't that you said no to $200 million somewhere along the way.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:29):**  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, this is the thing is that probably 90 to 95% of what we did, we would have, or  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:34):**  I would do again, there's a few things we would have changed.  If I had known we were coming into six incredibly tough years, then I would have said, you know,  stayed at home and done something different.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:42):**  But having said that, we would not have achieved what we've achieved on the ground.  So if I look at it, you know, we're selling, providing millions of carbon offsets per annum  into the Australian government fund.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:52):**  We have regenerated the ecosystem.  We have made major changes on the land.  We are seeing the benefits of that coming through now.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:31:59):**  What we've done, drought itself doesn't degrade a grassland.  Management during and after the drought is what degrades the grassland.  And what we've done is we've managed appropriately during that time and we're starting to see  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:11):**  the benefits of that.  So my fundamental belief is that over the investment period of the fund, you know, that  10 to 15 years, you know, we would double current capacity, half cost of production  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:21):**  and 100% convinced that over that timeframe, we will achieve exactly that.  And obviously with the current capacity based on the actual carrying capacity of the land,  not just some imaginary number.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:33):**  And you've proved that you are able to adjust to that as you basically destock because  the current capacity in the dry years was very, very low, maybe even zero.  So you, yeah, there's a current capacity is not just a number that you, that comes out  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:48):**  of their spreadsheet.  It's a number that's based on the land.  Current capacity is what comes up from the land.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:32:52):**  So what the land itself can do, the stocking rate is what we put down on the land.  So we match the number of animals with what the land can carry.  And if you get that right, then that's, that's number one factor, get that right.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:04):**  And things start to work really well.  And the way that that will work, what we'll show is basically the number of animals that  we did graze, the number of animals that we did sell, the number of animals that went  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:13):**  into the marketplace.  And that's pretty much, you know, in black and white and with Australia's national livestock  identification scheme, where every animal has a radio frequency tag in its ear, they're  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:25):**  either there or they're not, it's pretty straightforward.  And so what is happening for the next, let's say the next part of the year until the end?  Are you hoping for rain?  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:33):**  Are there any other big events here?  Is there rain coming?  As you know, what, what, what, how does the year look like the rest of 2019 for you?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:43):**  The rain that we got that the 90 to 130 mils of rain that we got was out of the forecast  is that we expected to get somewhere between five and 10 mils.  So it's surprises on the upside.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:33:53):**  The number of times that the rain has actually turned up a surprise on the downside outweighs  that.  The seasonal conditions are showing being sort of average long term for the next six  
**[0:34:04-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:04):**  to 12 months.  No dramatic changes.  Having said that, the country that we're in looking at 150 years worth of records each  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:12):**  month can be a record breaking month and it can come out of nowhere.  Normally a very large long term drought is broken by a very out of nowhere type rain  event.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:23):**  A big cyclone will form, an out of season cyclone, some big tropical rain event will  start to come through.  That's incredibly unpredictable.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:30):**  So what we do is we deal with the reality that's on the ground.  And at the moment we have had some flooding through our land.  So on 140,000 hectares, we've probably had 30 to 40,000 hectares received beneficial  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:42):**  flooding.  We've done our assessments of our carrying capacity on those and we've got animals in  that match that with the intention that those animals have a solid six months worth of feed  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:34:52):**  in front of them.  They're young breeding females, which means that during that period of time, if the seasons  don't improve dramatically, we have taken them from a smaller weight to a larger weight  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:04):**  and they become an animal that can be sold into the feedlot market or whatever.  If we do get a good seasonal change, they're an animal that then can get joined and become  a reproductive animal producing calves down the track.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:16):**  So we've got a couple of options there.  And I want to end with a question that John Kemp often asked and I borrowed it from him  and adjusted it slightly.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:25):**  What do you believe that is true about Regen Ag that others don't believe to be true?  That it works.  I think it's a perfect answer.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:33):**  Thank you, Tony, so much for your time.  Thank you.  It's always a pleasure.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:37):**  And I will definitely check in earlier this time, not after almost three years.  That's fine.  Hopefully you get some beneficial rain, not too much, not too little, just the right amount.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:44):**  We'll take more than less, trust me.  We can cope with as much as nature will provide.  Thank you so much, Tony.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:51):**  Have a great day.  Been a pleasure.  Take care.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:35:54):**  Thank you.  If you found the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast valuable, there  are a few simple ways you can use to support it.

**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:36:27):**  below.  Thank you so much and see you at the next podcast.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:36:46):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:36:56):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:37:09):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:37:17):**  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:37:22):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:37:26):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:37:33):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:37:47):**  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:37:57):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  No.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:38:04):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:38:16):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:38:25):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:38:35):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:38:50):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:39:00):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:39:08):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:39:16):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

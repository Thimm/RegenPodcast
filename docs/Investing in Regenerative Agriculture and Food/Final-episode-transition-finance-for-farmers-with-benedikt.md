### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:13):**  This is already the last interview in the series Transition Finance for Farmers where  my co-host Benedikt Boezel and myself look back at the eight interviews we've done during  the past eight months and what lessons we've learned and conclusions we can draw.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:26):**  Since Transition Finance isn't the most important thing for farmers to speed up their transition  and increase the regenerative practices they use.  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:48):**  This is a special dedicated series on Transition Finance.  Why are we recording this series?  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:57):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  farms, explored farm-size regenerative designs and most importantly started their pilots  and feedback loops.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:08):**  This is where Transition Finance is key.  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility  and the farmers lack of collateral.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:17):**  Furthermore, there is a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give  away.  It is why my co-host aspiring to be regenerative farmer Benedikt Bösel and I are embarking  
**[0:01:29-0:01:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:29):**  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of Transition Finance for regenerative  farmers.  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  
**[0:01:40-0:01:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:40):**  space.  They share their insights how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  on Benedikt's 1000 hectares, which is almost 2500 acres, farm in Germany close to Berlin.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:52):**  This is an open process.  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:00):**  So please share with us any examples of Transition Finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  to interview, etc.  Get in touch via the contact page on the website investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:12):**  That is investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  Welcome to the final episode of the Transition Finance for Farmers series with my co-host  Benedikt Bösel.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:22):**  We've done many interviews and if you want to see them, we'll definitely put a link below  in the show notes.  And we've reached the conclusion of the series, which we started in December 2019, which obviously  
**[0:02:33-0:02:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:33):**  has been a crazy six, seven months, actually eight months when you listen to this.  And we thought it was good to spend a few minutes to sit down with Benedikt and see  what has happened both in the Transition Finance piece and the farm piece, obviously COVID  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:47):**  and everything around it.  So, Benedikt, thank you so much for being back on the show and for our final episode  together.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:53):**  Yes, hi Kun.  Nice to be here again.  What an amazing couple of months we've been through.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:00):**  As tough they have been for many of us.  Also, I think some really positive things happened out of it.  And what great guests we had, what an honor to speak to those amazing people.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:10):**  I mean, I'm really thrilled about what people we could actually talk to and to see how they  think and which direction they are developing.  It's been an amazing journey.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:20):**  Yeah, maybe even partly thanks to the crisis, we were able to get some people that otherwise  would be traveling to conferences, etc.  In this case, they were not.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:30):**  So that was a nice benefit from a very terrible situation.  And we had some amazing guests.  We discussed a lot from the financing, obviously, but also to the ingredients, to do you actually  
**[0:03:40-0:03:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:40):**  need a Transition Finance, which Nicolas very passionately argued that you don't and what  kind of examples are already out there.  But let's start a bit with these months.  
**[0:03:50-0:04:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:50):**  How has been this crazy COVID-19 months for you and the farm as we're talking now, it's  height of the summer, you're harvesting.  What has been the last months like if you look at the crisis and the farm?  
**[0:04:03-0:04:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:03):**  Oh, wow.  I mean, it's been incredible on so many levels.  It's really been a time where you just realize how powerless you are in a sense, right?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:14):**  I mean, any kind of ideas we have, visions we have, projects we've got going on and friendships,  family, whatever it is, you all of a sudden you realize that we all are dependent on an  ecosystem that has to be intact and healthy.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:35):**  And that obviously draws to soil immediately.  I think what has happened, the crisis that has happened is just maybe the right crisis  at the right time for us as a society to reflect on the kind of things that have been driven  
**[0:04:50-0:05:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:50):**  or driving us basically.  So I think and I hope that we come out of this realizing that there's a few things that  we have to maybe take more care of or take more into consideration when it comes to ecosystems,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:04):**  when it comes to also how we treat each other and how society works.  And if you see that COVID was one thing, but there were so many other aspects in the same  time that basically just showed us we can't carry on the way that we are or that we have  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:20):**  been.  So incredible times that we're living in.  I mean, on the farm level, we have actually been incredibly lucky because no one got ill  
**[0:05:28-0:05:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:28):**  and none of the family members got ill, which I'm obviously incredibly grateful for.  And on sort of the operation side, it has been a very valuable time for us, for me personally,  because I was bound to be on the farm.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:44):**  So that was something that usually is not that easy or not that often that I am here  on such a long time day in, day out, because obviously I have-  Where do you see the difference or what have you seen differences because you were basically  
**[0:05:59-0:06:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:59):**  blocked to be on the farm and not travel for conferences, et cetera?  Where do you see that change compared to other years?  I think you get much more sort of grounded and sort of also the speed of things kind  
**[0:06:12-0:06:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:12):**  of slows, not necessarily slows down because the work actually picked up, but it ties you  more to the cycles and the things happening on the farm level.  So you're more in tune with that, which has a very nice, also from a more sort of spiritual  
**[0:06:31-0:06:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:31):**  note, very nice, I guess it's an attitude that comes with it.  And obviously there's a lot of things that usually I wouldn't be doing or usually I wouldn't  have time for that I could actually do when it comes to operational things as well.  
**[0:06:46-0:07:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:46):**  So that was very, that was an incredible time and you really kind of honor what you are  able to do and you appreciate the luck that you have as an individual, but also as a team,  as an operation, as a family, living on the outside, being able to do this incredible  
**[0:07:03-0:07:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:03):**  job and this incredible work that we're doing is, I mean, it's just talking about privilege.  I don't think you can be more privileged than being able to live on the land and care for  the land and grow food and try to work in a community and with the community.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:16):**  I think that's something that I have never seen so clear in a sense.  And did you see, like you obviously grow food, but you grow mostly large quantities.  It's not that you are operating on the farmers market with grain, et cetera.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:31):**  Did you see an interest, anyway, in interest from people as they were discovering again  where food is coming from?  A lot of people I know in the local food movement have seen booms and we discussed it on a few  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:42):**  episodes as well.  Did you see any of that interest as well towards your farm because you're quite visible obviously  online.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:49):**  There's not a lot you can buy directly, but still, did you see a growing interest from  neighbors, people around Berlin, et cetera?  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:56):**  I mean, there has been an incredible spike, I think, of interest on the regional household  or local household level when it comes to baking your own bread and people asking for  grain and flour.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:09):**  And you're asking how many tons can I send you?  Yeah, exactly.  I'm like, I deliver 25 tons per serving, so to say.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:20):**  And it was interesting to see the price developments in the supermarkets when it comes to flour,  for example, things like that.  And I mean, on the projects that we are developing, if it's the Syntropic Agriculture field or  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:32):**  if it's our friends over at Acapulco that do the market garden, there's been incredible  interest.  It must have had a good year.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:38):**  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, they could scale so much it's incredible.  And the interest is huge.  
**[0:08:45-0:09:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:45):**  I think people have really, again, drawn back to the basics and rediscovering food and the  value of food and also rediscovering the area that they come from.  So it's not only about food, it's a lot about food, but it's also not being able to go anywhere.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:02):**  Suddenly they realize how beautiful the areas they live in and suddenly they go on a kind  of holiday just driving 200, 300 kilometers within Germany somehow and appreciating that  a lot.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:14):**  I think that's incredibly valuable as well.  Do you see that in the B&B you're running as well?  Well, I mean, it was closed for most of the time.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:21):**  But obviously now many people come and want to stay and enjoy that.  So I think from many sort of aspects it's been very healing in a sense.  And I mean, on the farm level, we've had an incredible time, I have to say, maybe the  
**[0:09:35-0:09:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:35):**  most incredible time that I've had since I took over in December 16 because we had one  agroforestry planting planned for spring of this year.  And we were planning earlier in the year, maybe December sort of last year, that we'd  
**[0:09:55-0:10:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:55):**  go through companies that we kind of cooperative or that we have a good relation to like Ecosia  or Patagonia or Dr. Bronner's asking them to do a little advertisement in order to bring  people here to help us planting, have like a community planting agroforestry weekend  
**[0:10:13-0:10:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:13):**  or probably a couple of more weekends, but basically try to work with them on getting  people here to help us with the whole planting, which of course, because of the crisis wasn't  possible anymore.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:26):**  So we used a platform that was initiated in Germany where farmers were basically able  to find volunteers or people that would come to work for you for harvesting or for doing  farm related work.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:42):**  And we basically just sat in that wanting to plant 10,000 trees, help needed.  And after that, my phone, it rang, I don't know, for three days in and out.  I basically couldn't take it away from the charger because it was just empty all the  
**[0:10:58-0:11:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:58):**  time.  And the amount of people asking to come to help and enjoying thinking about planting  trees and the interest.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:10):**  How many people showed up?  Well in the beginning, we started with four, then the next day it was eight.  And then it continued towards the end.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:19):**  We were a group of over 35 volunteers.  Wow.  Yeah, planting.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:24):**  How long did it take to 10,000 trees?  Because 10,000 is a nice number.  Well, the 10,000 was a couple of days, I think four or five days basically.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:33):**  But we kind of couldn't get rid of the people in a positive sense.  So that after that, you know, we just continued.  Well, one is still there.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:42):**  Teresa, she's actually one that came in that time and never left, which is obviously something  we're incredibly grateful and happy about.  But this is the kind of stories that we see constantly, right?  
**[0:11:54-0:12:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:54):**  And this is what gives me so much hope.  And I mean, with that group, we planted 10,000 trees.  Afterwards, we planted 100,000 tree seeds.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:03):**  We planted 10,000 all varieties of potatoes.  We planted 300 blackberries.  So you know, it has been an incredible time.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:13):**  And we've been working three weeks, day in, day out.  I was actually only cooking and buying beer and seeing that everyone's kind of happy and  enjoyful.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:25):**  He always says that this volunteer stuff is free labor, but you have to buy a lot of beer  to cook a lot to people.  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:32):**  And I mean, it was really I mean, we're joking about now, but I think it's it speaks for  so much when it comes to farming, because the outlook so often is grim and, you know,  young people are not wanting to take over and things like that.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:45):**  And of course, it's Corona.  So that had an had an influence because people were stuck in their in their flats.  But you know, we had people coming from the local area.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:54):**  We had people coming from further away.  And there were some that were in some sort of tech company in Berlin that wanted to get  out.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:03):**  And some that, you know, are very sort of alternative and all of them were, you know,  talking the same kind of.  How should I say?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:14):**  Well, they were all soil language.  Yes, they loved each other.  They love what was happening.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:21):**  There was a it was a real form of community.  Even if a new people coming in, they were part of the group immediately.  It was really from sort of like a social perspective or.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:35):**  Yeah, I don't know really to to to put it into useful words.  How many Corona babies will we see in seven months?  Well, it's going to be a few, I think.  
**[0:13:47-0:14:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:47):**  We need more people on the land.  So we're planning on maybe bringing out something like wheat dating.  You know, actually, I stole that word from from a dear farmer from Austria.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:00):**  But I think, you know, I mean, it's it's it's jokes.  And I think that's that's what it's about.  How better to meet than when you're planting a syntropic agroforestry field?  
**[0:14:10-0:14:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:10):**  And that's there's no better way to start a relationship.  Absolutely.  I mean, there's a huge variety and diversity and, you know, it's complexity.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:20):**  Exactly.  And it's all about unconditional love.  So that is obviously a good door opener.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:27):**  As we get back to because in that crazy period, we also managed to record actually quite a  lot because when we started, obviously, none of this was happening.  I think the first interview with Trio Dos was still pre Corona.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:39):**  And the first interview we did was in December.  So obviously, we didn't even know that word yet.  So we managed to record quite a bit.  
**[0:14:47-0:15:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:47):**  Looking back, what has been the most surprising thing that immediately now, if you think about  interviews, what pops up as the most surprising thing or the thing that actually still is  with you and a story or an insight that came out of these interviews?  
**[0:15:05-0:15:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:05):**  Wow.  That's that's a tough question.  I couldn't I couldn't, you know, put down one individual one because each of the people  
**[0:15:15-0:15:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:15):**  that we talked to brought not only one, but a few amazing stories and and incredible depth  and insight.  So I think it's difficult to put to take one out.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:28):**  I mean, but there is there's some things that, you know, that that have that have stayed  with me in a sense and that I've obviously then, you know, thought about more and more.  And I think one of the crucial things is really the the marketing aspect or basically building  
**[0:15:48-0:15:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:48):**  a market for the product, which if you think about it makes sense.  And you could think about why.  Well, obviously, you know, but.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:57):**  Yeah, but it's easier said than done.  I mean, you could say, oh, you have to find a market, etc.  But exactly in this case, we went a bit deeper.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:05):**  Exactly.  So helping the farmer with advising him or her on the kind of different systems that  you can use or crops that you can use.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:13):**  That is one thing, having a financial, let's say, support system in place is is also incredibly  important.  But it's it's also just one thing.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:25):**  But really helping the farmer or the farmer himself or herself, establishing a market  first, in a sense, making sure that you have a reliable channel of selling a product at  a certain price for a prolonged period, if possible.  
**[0:16:45-0:17:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:45):**  I think that is really maybe the most important thing, because if you have that, you have  a kind of guaranteed cash flow or you have at least something that is kind of plannable.  And if there is some way of, you know, you being able to making it unique for your context  
**[0:17:06-0:17:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:06):**  and your situation, then that will allow finance, finance, like financing to come in that will  allow investors to work with you in a certain way that that will allow, you know, around  that sort of frame of, I guess, business concept to see where you can tweak the system towards  
**[0:17:29-0:17:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:29):**  a direction that you want to go into.  So I think that that has been something that that is incredibly valuable.  And I mean, you know, Phil from the Perennial Fund of Mad Agriculture.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:43):**  What an incredible name, by the way.  I'm telling everyone the story.  I'm wearing the cap proudly and telling everyone how amazing.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:50):**  I have the caps here.  Yeah.  I'm showing them a video now, which is useless for if you're listening to the podcast.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:55):**  Good choice, Kun.  They send us some very nice caps.  I'll put a link below if you want to order them.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:00):**  Anyway, so this is something that they also are doing quite strongly.  They say, look, we work with the farmers.  And one of the first things that we think about is how can we find a different new form  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:11):**  of marketing for their products?  So we have that that covered.  And once we have that established, we have a basis on developing everything else.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:18):**  And I mean, as I said, you know, you think, oh, yeah, that's obvious.  But it's not because we did a whole series on transition finance and unpacking that completely,  but quite thoroughly and coming to the conclusion now, which I think is a very valid one, that  
**[0:18:35-0:18:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:35):**  unless you have long term, which you said, and an OK or good price, even the best transition  finance in the world is useless for a farmer if he or she doesn't have access to an appropriate  market.  
**[0:18:48-0:19:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:48):**  So a long term offtake agreement with a good price can change basically after that transition  finance can follow because it is suddenly investable and knowledge can follow and peer  network support can follow because you have a base for, OK, we're going to do this grain  
**[0:19:04-0:19:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:04):**  for this and this, or we're going to do this type of rice, et cetera, et cetera.  So let's find the best knowledge in the world to do that with the best regenerative practices  because we have a customer that wants this and is willing to pay for it and is willing  
**[0:19:17-0:19:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:17):**  to actually grow with it, let's say, for the next few years.  And you're saying basically that's the crucial bit is market access, long term and a partner  in that way.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:29):**  And then the other pieces of a successful transition or successful start of a transition  because it seems to be never done, they will follow after having access to a good market.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:39):**  And I mean, it's if you think about our farm, where as of today, we are still obviously  very much grain dominated.  We usually would have a situation that depending on our crop rotation, we have a certain acreage  
**[0:19:54-0:20:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:54):**  per crop and then we would decide and analyze the sort of the crop, the crop's quality  and quantity, of course, and then see to hold to kind of which kind of resellers we will  sell.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:09):**  Maybe you have a contract that we will do before the harvest starts.  But usually, you are just very dependent, very ad hoc, very in the year itself.  And it's very dependent on, let's say, global grain prices in a sense, obviously ecological  
**[0:20:24-0:20:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:24):**  grain prices in our sense, but it doesn't really matter.  And depending on the market, it goes up or it goes down, it's a bit more, it's a bit  less.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:34):**  And you have no way of reliably working on a certain income or on a certain price because  also your product, I mean, they can buy from anyone.  Why would they buy from me?  
**[0:20:50-0:21:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:50):**  There is nothing unique about the grain that I will bring to the table if I not somehow  establish it as such and that is marketing, that is product, that is what are our values,  what is, yeah, also the quality, of course, it has to be.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:08):**  Quality, but all the quality, I mean, like the full integral, the beauty of the landscape,  the rotation, the values of the farm, all of that should end up in the quality.  And that's a much broader concept than a protein level.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:24):**  What's the story?  I mean, I think at this time, if you look around and I think this is something that  we've experienced throughout those past months before we started and up till now, the movement  
**[0:21:36-0:21:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:36):**  of regenerative agriculture is just incredible.  I mean, obviously I think most of us live in a certain bubble, so we tend to maybe overestimate  it.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:47):**  No, never.  I see it clearly.  Everybody focuses on soil, right?  
**[0:21:50-0:22:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:50):**  There's this amazing caption where you have like this poor guy or girl sitting alone at  a party and wondering about why is someone wanting to talk to me about soil?  You know that?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:04):**  Anyway, so I think if you look at the sort of development this topic has taken and people  getting involved, be it large brands, look at Timberland, look at General Mills, look  at Patagonia, obviously, but so many others that you wouldn't expect to be in this space,  
**[0:22:19-0:22:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:19):**  suddenly realizing, wow, there's something happening and we need to kind of get on it.  I think it's only a matter of time until we will see the first sort of financial support  system, the first sort of investors that will think about this space much more differently.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:36):**  I think to be honest with you, the ones that will sort of be the early adopters from a  financing point of view will probably be the ones that will have a big say in the kind  of way it will develop and will obviously build a market not only for themselves but  
**[0:22:54-0:23:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:54):**  also for the others to come.  So that leads me to the conclusion that what now is maybe most important is to get as many  farmers and practitioners as we possibly can to just start, to just get going.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:12):**  It never has to be perfect as such because you have to start small and learn as much  as you can anyway, I think in the beginning, or at least I think it's a wise approach.  But we need to have many, many different small and big and family and, I don't know, a corporate  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:28):**  structures that just start, get going, get the word out, have people come on the farm,  visit.  And get brands to buy it.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:35):**  Yes, exactly.  That seems to be, and get those relationships and educate maybe those food companies, the  small ones, the big ones to at least start buying and start buying food rotations and  
**[0:23:46-0:23:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:46):**  making sure people understand what it means to start buying regenerative grown or ingredients  grown with regenerative practices.  Absolutely.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:54):**  And unless we have a lot of farmers annoying these food companies and say, why are you  not buying this grain?  Why are you not buying this?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:00):**  Why are you not buying that?  Through a long term agreement, then they'll be all be the small ones on the farmer's market,  which is great, but it's not going to grow to broad acre crops, etc. because there's  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:10):**  no direct sale basically, and you need food companies and processors, etc. to be involved.  Absolutely.  And this is spot on.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:16):**  And I think this is about to happen.  And if I was a large brand today, if I was a super market, if I was whatever has a certain  reach selling products or being active in the space, I would get kind of nervous if  
**[0:24:32-0:24:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:32):**  I wouldn't already be doing something in this direction because this is going to be the  next big thing with all the problems and the things that might go bad and go wrong as it  always is.  
**[0:24:42-0:25:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:42):**  It's never perfect from the beginning, but I think the direction is very clear and I  think you can count on it getting more and more speed and growth and attention.  And would that be for investors the way to maybe not transition finance directly yet,  
**[0:25:01-0:25:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:01):**  but to get involved with these farmers and to somehow help them to partner with these  brands or to connect them with food brands they might have also invested in to start  at least part of this new supply web to start building.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:14):**  And then the second step is, okay, we've established a market access for maybe part of your rotation,  maybe the whole rotation if you're super lucky or good, etc.  But let's say part of the rotation.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:24):**  Second step is, okay, how do we finance you speeding up your regenerative practices and  basically get to that five or 10 year goal in a few years less or basically to do a lot  more or do it on all your acreage instead of a few, etc.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:38):**  But the first discussion should be, where's your market?  How do we build that market access?  Absolutely.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:44):**  I think that would be a very progressive approach about doing this.  So how have you been applying that to your farm?  As you mentioned the system before where you harvest, you test the quality and then you  
**[0:25:57-0:26:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:57):**  start looking around, maybe have some contracts in place, but not a lot, which seems a very  unfair system obviously for the farmer, but it's what most annual crop farmers have in  the world.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:07):**  Have you seen a change or an interest in those last months, maybe due to COVID, maybe due  to other consciousness of brands that either contacted you or you contacted them and suddenly  entered in another discussion?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:19):**  Is there movement happening in this case for grain, in this case for your farm, obviously  very specifically?  Do you see chances, opportunities, changes there?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:28):**  Yeah, for sure.  I mean, I think there's amazing chances when it comes to rethinking that whole process.  I mean, if you think about the status quo, if you're selling a grain that we have a cleaner  
**[0:26:43-0:26:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:43):**  for the grain, we can dry it.  So the quality is good, but it's not on a, let's say, consumable quality-wise.  So you have to clean it more thoroughly, of course, and you have to make sure there's  
**[0:26:58-0:27:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:58):**  nothing in there but good quality grain basically.  In this crazy baking months, you couldn't sell unfortunately directly to customers.  No, not at all.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:07):**  So that's not possible.  No, it's really, really complex.  There's a lot of things in the grain, which you didn't want that if you make flour out  
**[0:27:15-0:27:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:15):**  of it.  So that whole cleaning process is actually not complex if you've got everything, but  it's complex as a farmer to also be doing that.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:24):**  So we then sell our grain at the market price, maybe a little premium to a wholesaler that  has obviously facilities to do all the cleaning, then store it, and then reselling it to the  bakeries, so to say.  
**[0:27:42-0:28:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:42):**  And the thing is the kind of value and margin that he or she makes on our product is more  or less the same depending how they obviously plan.  But the process as such is always costs the same amount.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:01):**  So the risk is relatively low.  Of course, they have to figure out from which farmer are they buying, which quality and  so forth.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:08):**  So that's some of their risk, but it's not as complex because obviously you can just  play with what you have.  But compare that to the farmer, we have all the risks.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:22):**  We have in winter the risk, then about how evenly will it start to germinate and then  come out.  Then we have the risk over the winter, is it going to freeze or not?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:34):**  Then we have a risk of whatever it is, we have all the risk, drought not even mentioned,  to then finally have the product.  And even the product as we feel this year, which has been an incredibly challenging year  
**[0:28:48-0:28:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:48):**  when it comes to harvesting because it's raining more or less once a day, we have that and  another risk.  Then we start storing it here and it's another risk.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:58):**  It's just really, really risky.  And the margin that we get out of it is like now it looks like very, very slim.  So just that system does not make so much sense when it comes to risk return profiles.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:18):**  So what we are trying to do is basically find a way of leveraging that risk somehow.  And then the question is, well, how can we, if we're not able to do that whole cleaning  storage process after the harvest, the next thing is, well, how can we maybe utilize our  
**[0:29:36-0:29:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:36):**  own grain in a sense that we can market it directly through us or through a partner?  And this is something that we've worked on and thought about and discussed quite a bit  in recent months.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:51):**  And yeah, I mean, we're not there yet and it's a long process and it's also very complicated.  And again, there's obviously some risks involved in it.  But I think this is something that we as farmers can look into much more strongly because there's  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:12):**  potential there.  There's quality that we can add.  You're saying there's interest.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:17):**  There's interest from these, because also for, let's say it's a brand that needs certain  grains, et cetera.  It's a risk and it's some extra work to not just go through the normal channels, but sort  
**[0:30:27-0:30:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:27):**  of go directly to you and still they need some kind of cleaning.  So it's extra work.  But you're saying because of the story, because of the quality, the whole quality picture,  
**[0:30:36-0:30:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:36):**  not just the quality of the product, but the quality of everything around for some brands  that might be absolutely worth it because they need the storytelling and they need the  values and they want to.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:46):**  And you're saying that, I mean, you're not there yet, but there's more movement than  a year ago or seven months ago when we started this series.  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:54):**  And it's also the consumers that are driving it.  Right.  I mean, by the way, I don't like the word consumers, but clients is also horrible.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:03):**  So yeah, eating people, but that always sounds a bit awkward.  So you know what I mean?  But I think, you know, people that eat, let's keep it there.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:14):**  Which is everyone.  At least I, if you're lucky.  I think they are, they like to have a face or a story to the product.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:26):**  You know, why do we always need to have everything commoditized?  Why does everything has to come out of anonymity?  Because that's where the margins are when you're a brand.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:35):**  I mean, the margins in food are higher up.  Exactly.  I push that poor farmer right down there.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:43):**  So yes, so, you know, I think there is demand for it.  I think there is room for it.  And do you see demand that's big enough to take, like you have quite a large farm and  
**[0:31:53-0:32:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:53):**  maybe there's demand from like a very cute small bar maker in Berlin in his or her kitchen  and garage that's making.  But a discussion I've often, and also with Jeroen, and that actually is coming, should  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:06):**  be online when you're listening to this.  That's the farmer that makes the soy and the grain for the soy sauce we actually had in  this series.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:12):**  He says, yeah, the quantities of a lot of these local food systems are so small that  it's great to sell your beans directly.  That is great to do, but it just doesn't make sense.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:22):**  So do you see, so long question, do you see interest from larger ones that can actually  absorb significant amounts and does make a difference for your farm?  Or is it smaller and does a lot of work and maybe nice margins, but very small quantities?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:36):**  I think the complexity with larger quantities is not getting smaller.  So as soon as you talk about large quantities and suddenly there is demand and they want  more, you can't basically offer that.  
**[0:32:51-0:33:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:51):**  That's also true, yeah.  So I think it is, as it is in general in agriculture, it's all a question of context.  And you obviously need to find your channel and your product and your way and the kind  
**[0:33:03-0:33:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:03):**  of story that you tell and the kind of people that you want to sell to.  So I think it's always a matter of analysis and finding your spot.  And that might take a while, of course, and it's an investment, but I think it's an investment  
**[0:33:17-0:33:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:17):**  that pays out towards the end of the day.  And also, and I think this is again where so much potential comes in in this space,  if this is something that more farmers start and this is something that more supermarkets  
**[0:33:33-0:33:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:33):**  see and realize and also derive value from, because suddenly you have people wanting and  asking, hey, do you also have that regional product that the supermarket across the street  has?  
**[0:33:49-0:34:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:49):**  And people wanting that regional product where there's a story and a face to it in a sense,  then suddenly you can have a farmer next door that hasn't been in that kind of thinking  and he or she comes and is like, hey, you do that with that partner and can I join you  
**[0:34:08-0:34:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:08):**  in doing that?  And suddenly maybe you have three or four or five farms that get together in a cooperative  thinking or a cooperative, let's say production and use-  
**[0:34:18-0:34:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:18):**  And they can get their cleaning machines.  Exactly.  And use the same channel and suddenly they can afford to invest together for some sort  
**[0:34:26-0:34:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:26):**  of processing and then it grows from there.  So there is incredible potential from basically decentralizing many of the as of today commoditized  products from farmers.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:40):**  And this is something that investors will also look at because they realize suddenly  we are talking about scale.  I had that discussion exactly yesterday recording another interview with Ed Byrne of Soilworks,  
**[0:34:51-0:35:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:51):**  which I put down below on the decentralized processing in the US.  Very different story, but very similar characteristics, let's say not the same center of the, not  the same context, but decentralized mostly in this case in meat, but it holds true in  
**[0:35:06-0:35:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:06):**  many others.  We have to look at processing completely, which is a very dirty word, but even then  Barbara now calls themselves a food processor.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:13):**  You have to look at processing completely different, which offers very interesting investment  opportunities for investors and for farmers and for banks and for to get this product  from the farm in a form or shape that can go to a consumer, could be a restaurant, could  
**[0:35:28-0:35:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:28):**  be a brand, could be asked directly, but to have that transformation, if you cannot sell  directly, if there are veggies, if there are certain things, of course, but most of the  food needs some kind of transformation or a lot of food needs some kind of transformation  
**[0:35:41-0:35:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:41):**  and needs obviously a market.  So I think it's a very interesting conclusion where we're reaching after, I wouldn't say  a conclusion like an in-between conclusion, because I'm very much looking forward to checking  
**[0:35:51-0:36:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:51):**  with you once you've signed hopefully more multiple off-take agreements that really give  the farm a long-term view on markets and thus a long-term view on regenerative practices.  And then we can have another discussion on transition finance.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:07):**  Right.  And I mean, I just want to add something to that idea, how starting through that kind  of direct channel, then finding farms around you, because you've proven it in your kind  
**[0:36:20-0:36:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:20):**  of scale and suddenly maybe you find this kind of cooperative way of producing and using  that kind of direct channel in a regional context, that obviously brings all of a sudden  so much more potential that not necessarily has to do...  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:36):**  Work.  Exactly.  It has to do about work.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:39):**  It's about also the kind of system change that might come with it.  So we're talking about soil again, soil health, the kind of quality, the area in total is  also gaining from it.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:54):**  And I've spoken to someone yesterday, Sepp Braun, he's quite a famous farmer in South  Bavaria, and he's pointed out that there's scientific studies that you only need a certain  acreage, let's say three, four, five thousand hectares, for example, in order to actually  
**[0:37:19-0:37:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:19):**  change the climate within that area.  So imagine bringing cooperative structures together and I mean, if it's three or four  farms around our area, you are talking already about four or five thousand hectares.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:35):**  Suddenly if we come into a realm of planting trees, making agroforestry, changing the system,  growing soil, we are changing the microclimate.  We are developing the area.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:48):**  We are going to have more rain because of it sooner or later, hopefully, I guess.  You're complaining about it.  You just complained about the rain.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:56):**  Sorry.  I mean, in harvesting, it's not the best thing.  Yeah, you're right.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:01):**  I should have said it.  But you see where I'm going with this.  Like, there is so much potential coming out of it.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:07):**  Then we get into very interesting areas.  Exactly.  Suddenly we're talking about regional development and we're talking about a future and something  
**[0:38:17-0:38:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:17):**  that you can look out for and that you want to be part of and you make a brand out of  it.  And suddenly we have other people wanting to join in that as well.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:24):**  They use some side product or something that usually you would have no use for and they  turn that into something beautiful and sell it as well.  So I think that is something that I'm just incredibly, how shall I say?  
**[0:38:37-0:38:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:37):**  Excited.  Excited about.  Exactly.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:40):**  If you want to do branding already, you want to stabilize your local climate.  Buy this.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:45):**  Exactly.  Which is not the best slogan ever.  I realize that marketing people have to figure that out.  
**[0:38:50-0:39:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:50):**  But I think it's the most exciting.  It sounds very, I wouldn't even say high level, very ambitious.  Like with farming, we can change, we can stabilize local climates and change local climates.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:01):**  But a lot of the research is coming out now and is actually showing that.  And you need a certain acreage.  You need a certain size.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:06):**  One farm is usually, even in Australia, is not enough because it's huge.  But it's not big enough to have an impact on that.  But as soon as we start bundling together, I mean, it becomes a bear.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:17):**  And we can start thinking, OK, where should we plant the trees on the different farms?  Not on one farm only, but where does this set of trees and which set of trees have the  biggest impact, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:26):**  We can start doing that analysis of a landscape and figuring out where are the most important  hotspots to change agriculture first or to change the practices first.  And then what are the second line of fields we need to attack and then a third, fourth,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:41):**  et cetera, et cetera.  You get a very different analysis.  I think a lot of tech people would be very excited about that and doing that analysis.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:48):**  OK, which fields?  You have a lot more acreage than hectares to play with and to change, basically.  For sure.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:54):**  Because I think this is also one thing.  I mean, as of today, if you are looking for new ways or solutions, you can find a lot,  right?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:03):**  And you can have people that do advising.  If you're lucky enough to find someone that is an independent advisor, then even better.  If you don't know what that means, I advise you to listen to the podcast with Nicolas.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:16):**  As most advisors, the best advisors so far, or let's say the most expensive ones are for  free actually, but they come included in a very heavy chemical package you need to buy  from certain companies that we can all imagine.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:28):**  And they are the ones that offer most advice to most farmers and thus obviously selling  a lot of chemical inputs.  Right.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:35):**  But I mean, exactly.  So I would always only talk to independent advisors.  And so they come and they can tell you, well, you can do this or you can do that.  
**[0:40:45-0:41:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:45):**  But if you are busy and you're stuck in a system and your cash flow is like a zero sum  game or whatever, then do you really have the spirit and the heart and the emotional  freedom to then say, well, OK, then I'll try this or that?  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:02):**  I don't know.  I think it's a big ask.  If you have someone that comes and say, yeah, you can buy this big product and then this  
**[0:41:08-0:41:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:08):**  will enable you to do the same thing.  So I think just having an option of coming somewhere, listening to people or like I don't  know if that's really going to change.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:20):**  But if you come and approach the farmer and offer something that will immediately help  him or her, that will immediately change the profitability of the operation because there  is suddenly a new channel.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:37):**  Then suddenly the game changes.  Suddenly they're like, oh, OK, well, you just took pressure off me.  You just helped me.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:44):**  So now I have to make my life easier.  Exactly.  Now I have the emotional freedom to think about soil, to think about this or think about  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:53):**  that.  To attend a course, to read.  I think it's interesting how we reached this point after nine months.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:59):**  Well, actually, if you look through the different interviews, it's sort of a red line that goes  through all of them and it's very interesting.  That's why we unpacked transition finance to find that it's maybe not the most important  
**[0:42:11-0:42:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:11):**  thing.  And actually, there's one step before or a few steps before, but a crucial one before  that, before you can even think about finance, there needs to be a good business underneath,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:20):**  as all investors know.  And a good business in farming depends on a good market and a long term market.  That makes a lot of sense when we think about it.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:29):**  But yeah, it took us a few months.  Better late than never.  Better late than never, definitely.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:35):**  I want to thank you so much, Benedict.  I'm sure this is not the last time we have you on because I would love updates over the  next months and years of how the transition is going and at some point transition finance  
**[0:42:47-0:42:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:47):**  and market access, et cetera.  But thank you really, really a lot for being my co-host and partner in crime in this series.  Yes.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:55):**  I mean, thank you so much.  What an incredible time we've had and what an incredible time we're living in.  The movements and developments in farming are just going to be, I can't even put it  
**[0:43:07-0:43:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:07):**  into words, but I think we have everything to win for.  I think we have everything that we can make better.  And I am just incredibly positive.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:15):**  So I can't wait to look back on this and be ashamed of the stupid things that I particularly  did, but we maybe also said and the kind of visions that we had, which proved to be completely  wrong.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:30):**  But I think it will all make sense looking back.  Like always.  Yeah.

**[0:44:24-0:44:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:44:24):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:44:37):**  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question, how to put money  to work in regenerating soils, and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:44:48-0:44:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:44:48):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:44:58):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:04):**  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:08):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  
**[0:45:13-0:45:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:13):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  
**[0:45:25-0:45:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:25):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:45:36-0:45:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:36):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:46):**  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:45:53-0:46:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:53):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:04):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:46:09-0:46:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:09):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:46:23-0:46:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:23):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:34):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:48):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:53):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:47:04):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.  Click on the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

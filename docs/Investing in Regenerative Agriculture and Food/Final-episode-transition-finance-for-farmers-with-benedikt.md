**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:13):**  This is already the last interview in the series Transition Finance for Farmers where  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:17):**  my co-host Benedikt Boezel and myself look back at the eight interviews we've done during  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:22):**  the past eight months and what lessons we've learned and conclusions we can draw.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:26):**  Since Transition Finance isn't the most important thing for farmers to speed up their transition  
**[0:00:31-0:00:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:31):**  and increase the regenerative practices they use.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:44):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:48):**  This is a special dedicated series on Transition Finance.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:52):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:54):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:00:57):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:01):**  farms, explored farm-size regenerative designs and most importantly started their pilots  
**[0:01:06-0:01:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:06):**  and feedback loops.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:08):**  This is where Transition Finance is key.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:10):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility  
**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:15):**  and the farmers lack of collateral.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:17):**  Furthermore, there is a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give  
**[0:01:22-0:01:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:22):**  away.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:23):**  It is why my co-host aspiring to be regenerative farmer Benedikt Bösel and I are embarking  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:29):**  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of Transition Finance for regenerative  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:35):**  farmers.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:36):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:40):**  space.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:41):**  They share their insights how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:46):**  on Benedikt's 1000 hectares, which is almost 2500 acres, farm in Germany close to Berlin.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:52):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:54):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:01:57):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:00):**  So please share with us any examples of Transition Finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:05):**  to interview, etc.

**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:17):**  Welcome to the final episode of the Transition Finance for Farmers series with my co-host  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:21):**  Benedikt Bösel.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:22):**  We've done many interviews and if you want to see them, we'll definitely put a link below  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:26):**  in the show notes.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:28):**  And we've reached the conclusion of the series, which we started in December 2019, which obviously  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:33):**  has been a crazy six, seven months, actually eight months when you listen to this.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:37):**  And we thought it was good to spend a few minutes to sit down with Benedikt and see  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:42):**  what has happened both in the Transition Finance piece and the farm piece, obviously COVID  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:47):**  and everything around it.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:48):**  So, Benedikt, thank you so much for being back on the show and for our final episode  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:52):**  together.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:53):**  Yes, hi Kun.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:54):**  Nice to be here again.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:02:55):**  What an amazing couple of months we've been through.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:00):**  As tough they have been for many of us.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:02):**  Also, I think some really positive things happened out of it.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:06):**  And what great guests we had, what an honor to speak to those amazing people.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:10):**  I mean, I'm really thrilled about what people we could actually talk to and to see how they  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:16):**  think and which direction they are developing.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:19):**  It's been an amazing journey.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:20):**  Yeah, maybe even partly thanks to the crisis, we were able to get some people that otherwise  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:26):**  would be traveling to conferences, etc.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:28):**  In this case, they were not.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:30):**  So that was a nice benefit from a very terrible situation.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:34):**  And we had some amazing guests.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:35):**  We discussed a lot from the financing, obviously, but also to the ingredients, to do you actually  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:40):**  need a Transition Finance, which Nicolas very passionately argued that you don't and what  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:45):**  kind of examples are already out there.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:48):**  But let's start a bit with these months.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:50):**  How has been this crazy COVID-19 months for you and the farm as we're talking now, it's  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:57):**  height of the summer, you're harvesting.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:03:59):**  What has been the last months like if you look at the crisis and the farm?  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:03):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:04):**  I mean, it's been incredible on so many levels.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:09):**  It's really been a time where you just realize how powerless you are in a sense, right?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:14):**  I mean, any kind of ideas we have, visions we have, projects we've got going on and friendships,  
**[0:04:22-0:04:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:22):**  family, whatever it is, you all of a sudden you realize that we all are dependent on an  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:31):**  ecosystem that has to be intact and healthy.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:35):**  And that obviously draws to soil immediately.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:38):**  I think what has happened, the crisis that has happened is just maybe the right crisis  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:43):**  at the right time for us as a society to reflect on the kind of things that have been driven  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:50):**  or driving us basically.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:51):**  So I think and I hope that we come out of this realizing that there's a few things that  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:04:58):**  we have to maybe take more care of or take more into consideration when it comes to ecosystems,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:04):**  when it comes to also how we treat each other and how society works.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:08):**  And if you see that COVID was one thing, but there were so many other aspects in the same  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:14):**  time that basically just showed us we can't carry on the way that we are or that we have  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:20):**  been.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:21):**  So incredible times that we're living in.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:23):**  I mean, on the farm level, we have actually been incredibly lucky because no one got ill  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:28):**  and none of the family members got ill, which I'm obviously incredibly grateful for.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:34):**  And on sort of the operation side, it has been a very valuable time for us, for me personally,  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:41):**  because I was bound to be on the farm.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:44):**  So that was something that usually is not that easy or not that often that I am here  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:51):**  on such a long time day in, day out, because obviously I have-  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:55):**  Where do you see the difference or what have you seen differences because you were basically  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:05:59):**  blocked to be on the farm and not travel for conferences, et cetera?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:03):**  Where do you see that change compared to other years?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:06):**  I think you get much more sort of grounded and sort of also the speed of things kind  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:12):**  of slows, not necessarily slows down because the work actually picked up, but it ties you  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:19):**  more to the cycles and the things happening on the farm level.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:24):**  So you're more in tune with that, which has a very nice, also from a more sort of spiritual  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:31):**  note, very nice, I guess it's an attitude that comes with it.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:36):**  And obviously there's a lot of things that usually I wouldn't be doing or usually I wouldn't  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:40):**  have time for that I could actually do when it comes to operational things as well.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:46):**  So that was very, that was an incredible time and you really kind of honor what you are  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:51):**  able to do and you appreciate the luck that you have as an individual, but also as a team,  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:06:57):**  as an operation, as a family, living on the outside, being able to do this incredible  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:03):**  job and this incredible work that we're doing is, I mean, it's just talking about privilege.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:08):**  I don't think you can be more privileged than being able to live on the land and care for  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:12):**  the land and grow food and try to work in a community and with the community.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:16):**  I think that's something that I have never seen so clear in a sense.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:21):**  And did you see, like you obviously grow food, but you grow mostly large quantities.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:27):**  It's not that you are operating on the farmers market with grain, et cetera.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:31):**  Did you see an interest, anyway, in interest from people as they were discovering again  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:35):**  where food is coming from?  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:37):**  A lot of people I know in the local food movement have seen booms and we discussed it on a few  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:42):**  episodes as well.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:43):**  Did you see any of that interest as well towards your farm because you're quite visible obviously  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:48):**  online.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:49):**  There's not a lot you can buy directly, but still, did you see a growing interest from  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:52):**  neighbors, people around Berlin, et cetera?  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:55):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:07:56):**  I mean, there has been an incredible spike, I think, of interest on the regional household  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:01):**  or local household level when it comes to baking your own bread and people asking for  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:08):**  grain and flour.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:09):**  And you're asking how many tons can I send you?  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:12):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:13):**  I'm like, I deliver 25 tons per serving, so to say.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:20):**  And it was interesting to see the price developments in the supermarkets when it comes to flour,  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:24):**  for example, things like that.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:26):**  And I mean, on the projects that we are developing, if it's the Syntropic Agriculture field or  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:32):**  if it's our friends over at Acapulco that do the market garden, there's been incredible  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:36):**  interest.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:37):**  It must have had a good year.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:39):**  Yeah, I mean, they could scale so much it's incredible.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:43):**  And the interest is huge.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:45):**  I think people have really, again, drawn back to the basics and rediscovering food and the  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:51):**  value of food and also rediscovering the area that they come from.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:08:56):**  So it's not only about food, it's a lot about food, but it's also not being able to go anywhere.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:02):**  Suddenly they realize how beautiful the areas they live in and suddenly they go on a kind  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:07):**  of holiday just driving 200, 300 kilometers within Germany somehow and appreciating that  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:13):**  a lot.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:14):**  I think that's incredibly valuable as well.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:15):**  Do you see that in the B&B you're running as well?  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:18):**  Well, I mean, it was closed for most of the time.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:21):**  But obviously now many people come and want to stay and enjoy that.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:26):**  So I think from many sort of aspects it's been very healing in a sense.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:32):**  And I mean, on the farm level, we've had an incredible time, I have to say, maybe the  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:35):**  most incredible time that I've had since I took over in December 16 because we had one  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:42):**  agroforestry planting planned for spring of this year.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:48):**  And we were planning earlier in the year, maybe December sort of last year, that we'd  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:09:55):**  go through companies that we kind of cooperative or that we have a good relation to like Ecosia  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:01):**  or Patagonia or Dr. Bronner's asking them to do a little advertisement in order to bring  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:08):**  people here to help us planting, have like a community planting agroforestry weekend  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:13):**  or probably a couple of more weekends, but basically try to work with them on getting  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:19):**  people here to help us with the whole planting, which of course, because of the crisis wasn't  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:25):**  possible anymore.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:26):**  So we used a platform that was initiated in Germany where farmers were basically able  
**[0:10:33-0:10:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:33):**  to find volunteers or people that would come to work for you for harvesting or for doing  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:41):**  farm related work.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:42):**  And we basically just sat in that wanting to plant 10,000 trees, help needed.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:47):**  And after that, my phone, it rang, I don't know, for three days in and out.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:55):**  I basically couldn't take it away from the charger because it was just empty all the  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:10:58):**  time.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:00):**  And the amount of people asking to come to help and enjoying thinking about planting  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:08):**  trees and the interest.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:10):**  How many people showed up?  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:13):**  Well in the beginning, we started with four, then the next day it was eight.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:16):**  And then it continued towards the end.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:19):**  We were a group of over 35 volunteers.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:22):**  Wow.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:23):**  Yeah, planting.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:24):**  How long did it take to 10,000 trees?  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:26):**  Because 10,000 is a nice number.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:28):**  Well, the 10,000 was a couple of days, I think four or five days basically.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:33):**  But we kind of couldn't get rid of the people in a positive sense.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:37):**  So that after that, you know, we just continued.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:39):**  Well, one is still there.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:42):**  Teresa, she's actually one that came in that time and never left, which is obviously something  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:48):**  we're incredibly grateful and happy about.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:52):**  But this is the kind of stories that we see constantly, right?  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:54):**  And this is what gives me so much hope.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:56):**  And I mean, with that group, we planted 10,000 trees.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:11:59):**  Afterwards, we planted 100,000 tree seeds.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:03):**  We planted 10,000 all varieties of potatoes.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:08):**  We planted 300 blackberries.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:10):**  So you know, it has been an incredible time.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:13):**  And we've been working three weeks, day in, day out.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:17):**  I was actually only cooking and buying beer and seeing that everyone's kind of happy and  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:24):**  enjoyful.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:25):**  He always says that this volunteer stuff is free labor, but you have to buy a lot of beer  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:28):**  to cook a lot to people.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:30):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:32):**  And I mean, it was really I mean, we're joking about now, but I think it's it speaks for  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:37):**  so much when it comes to farming, because the outlook so often is grim and, you know,  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:42):**  young people are not wanting to take over and things like that.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:45):**  And of course, it's Corona.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:46):**  So that had an had an influence because people were stuck in their in their flats.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:50):**  But you know, we had people coming from the local area.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:54):**  We had people coming from further away.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:12:57):**  And there were some that were in some sort of tech company in Berlin that wanted to get  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:02):**  out.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:03):**  And some that, you know, are very sort of alternative and all of them were, you know,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:10):**  talking the same kind of.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:13):**  How should I say?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:14):**  Well, they were all soil language.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:16):**  Yes, they loved each other.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:19):**  They love what was happening.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:21):**  There was a it was a real form of community.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:25):**  Even if a new people coming in, they were part of the group immediately.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:29):**  It was really from sort of like a social perspective or.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:35):**  Yeah, I don't know really to to to put it into useful words.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:40):**  How many Corona babies will we see in seven months?  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:44):**  Well, it's going to be a few, I think.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:47):**  We need more people on the land.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:49):**  So we're planning on maybe bringing out something like wheat dating.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:13:54):**  You know, actually, I stole that word from from a dear farmer from Austria.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:00):**  But I think, you know, I mean, it's it's it's jokes.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:04):**  And I think that's that's what it's about.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:06):**  How better to meet than when you're planting a syntropic agroforestry field?  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:10):**  And that's there's no better way to start a relationship.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:13):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:14):**  I mean, there's a huge variety and diversity and, you know, it's complexity.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:20):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:21):**  And it's all about unconditional love.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:23):**  So that is obviously a good door opener.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:27):**  As we get back to because in that crazy period, we also managed to record actually quite a  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:31):**  lot because when we started, obviously, none of this was happening.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:35):**  I think the first interview with Trio Dos was still pre Corona.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:39):**  And the first interview we did was in December.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:42):**  So obviously, we didn't even know that word yet.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:45):**  So we managed to record quite a bit.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:47):**  Looking back, what has been the most surprising thing that immediately now, if you think about  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:53):**  interviews, what pops up as the most surprising thing or the thing that actually still is  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:14:58):**  with you and a story or an insight that came out of these interviews?  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:05):**  Wow.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:06):**  That's that's a tough question.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:08):**  I couldn't I couldn't, you know, put down one individual one because each of the people  
**[0:15:15-0:15:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:15):**  that we talked to brought not only one, but a few amazing stories and and incredible depth  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:22):**  and insight.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:24):**  So I think it's difficult to put to take one out.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:28):**  I mean, but there is there's some things that, you know, that that have that have stayed  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:34):**  with me in a sense and that I've obviously then, you know, thought about more and more.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:41):**  And I think one of the crucial things is really the the marketing aspect or basically building  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:48):**  a market for the product, which if you think about it makes sense.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:54):**  And you could think about why.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:56):**  Well, obviously, you know, but.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:57):**  Yeah, but it's easier said than done.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:15:59):**  I mean, you could say, oh, you have to find a market, etc.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:02):**  But exactly in this case, we went a bit deeper.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:05):**  Exactly.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:06):**  So helping the farmer with advising him or her on the kind of different systems that  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:12):**  you can use or crops that you can use.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:13):**  That is one thing, having a financial, let's say, support system in place is is also incredibly  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:22):**  important.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:23):**  But it's it's also just one thing.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:25):**  But really helping the farmer or the farmer himself or herself, establishing a market  
**[0:16:33-0:16:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:33):**  first, in a sense, making sure that you have a reliable channel of selling a product at  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:41):**  a certain price for a prolonged period, if possible.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:45):**  I think that is really maybe the most important thing, because if you have that, you have  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:51):**  a kind of guaranteed cash flow or you have at least something that is kind of plannable.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:16:58):**  And if there is some way of, you know, you being able to making it unique for your context  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:06):**  and your situation, then that will allow finance, finance, like financing to come in that will  
**[0:17:13-0:17:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:13):**  allow investors to work with you in a certain way that that will allow, you know, around  
**[0:17:20-0:17:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:20):**  that sort of frame of, I guess, business concept to see where you can tweak the system towards  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:29):**  a direction that you want to go into.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:32):**  So I think that that has been something that that is incredibly valuable.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:39):**  And I mean, you know, Phil from the Perennial Fund of Mad Agriculture.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:43):**  What an incredible name, by the way.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:45):**  I'm telling everyone the story.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:46):**  I'm wearing the cap proudly and telling everyone how amazing.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:50):**  I have the caps here.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:52):**  I'm showing them a video now, which is useless for if you're listening to the podcast.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:55):**  Good choice, Kun.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:56):**  They send us some very nice caps.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:17:58):**  I'll put a link below if you want to order them.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:00):**  Anyway, so this is something that they also are doing quite strongly.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:03):**  They say, look, we work with the farmers.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:05):**  And one of the first things that we think about is how can we find a different new form  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:11):**  of marketing for their products?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:13):**  So we have that that covered.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:15):**  And once we have that established, we have a basis on developing everything else.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:18):**  And I mean, as I said, you know, you think, oh, yeah, that's obvious.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:22):**  But it's not because we did a whole series on transition finance and unpacking that completely,  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:29):**  but quite thoroughly and coming to the conclusion now, which I think is a very valid one, that  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:35):**  unless you have long term, which you said, and an OK or good price, even the best transition  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:42):**  finance in the world is useless for a farmer if he or she doesn't have access to an appropriate  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:47):**  market.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:48):**  So a long term offtake agreement with a good price can change basically after that transition  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:54):**  finance can follow because it is suddenly investable and knowledge can follow and peer  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:18:59):**  network support can follow because you have a base for, OK, we're going to do this grain  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:04):**  for this and this, or we're going to do this type of rice, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:08):**  So let's find the best knowledge in the world to do that with the best regenerative practices  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:13):**  because we have a customer that wants this and is willing to pay for it and is willing  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:17):**  to actually grow with it, let's say, for the next few years.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:22):**  And you're saying basically that's the crucial bit is market access, long term and a partner  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:28):**  in that way.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:29):**  And then the other pieces of a successful transition or successful start of a transition  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:33):**  because it seems to be never done, they will follow after having access to a good market.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:38):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:39):**  And I mean, it's if you think about our farm, where as of today, we are still obviously  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:43):**  very much grain dominated.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:46):**  We usually would have a situation that depending on our crop rotation, we have a certain acreage  
**[0:19:54-0:20:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:19:54):**  per crop and then we would decide and analyze the sort of the crop, the crop's quality  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:01):**  and quantity, of course, and then see to hold to kind of which kind of resellers we will  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:07):**  sell.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:09):**  Maybe you have a contract that we will do before the harvest starts.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:13):**  But usually, you are just very dependent, very ad hoc, very in the year itself.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:19):**  And it's very dependent on, let's say, global grain prices in a sense, obviously ecological  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:24):**  grain prices in our sense, but it doesn't really matter.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:27):**  And depending on the market, it goes up or it goes down, it's a bit more, it's a bit  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:33):**  less.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:34):**  And you have no way of reliably working on a certain income or on a certain price because  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:44):**  also your product, I mean, they can buy from anyone.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:49):**  Why would they buy from me?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:50):**  There is nothing unique about the grain that I will bring to the table if I not somehow  
**[0:20:57-0:21:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:20:57):**  establish it as such and that is marketing, that is product, that is what are our values,  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:05):**  what is, yeah, also the quality, of course, it has to be.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:08):**  Quality, but all the quality, I mean, like the full integral, the beauty of the landscape,  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:14):**  the rotation, the values of the farm, all of that should end up in the quality.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:19):**  And that's a much broader concept than a protein level.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:24):**  What's the story?  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:25):**  I mean, I think at this time, if you look around and I think this is something that  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:29):**  we've experienced throughout those past months before we started and up till now, the movement  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:36):**  of regenerative agriculture is just incredible.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:40):**  I mean, obviously I think most of us live in a certain bubble, so we tend to maybe overestimate  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:46):**  it.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:47):**  No, never.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:48):**  I see it clearly.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:49):**  Everybody focuses on soil, right?  
**[0:21:50-0:21:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:50):**  There's this amazing caption where you have like this poor guy or girl sitting alone at  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:21:58):**  a party and wondering about why is someone wanting to talk to me about soil?  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:03):**  You know that?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:04):**  Anyway, so I think if you look at the sort of development this topic has taken and people  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:09):**  getting involved, be it large brands, look at Timberland, look at General Mills, look  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:13):**  at Patagonia, obviously, but so many others that you wouldn't expect to be in this space,  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:19):**  suddenly realizing, wow, there's something happening and we need to kind of get on it.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:24):**  I think it's only a matter of time until we will see the first sort of financial support  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:30):**  system, the first sort of investors that will think about this space much more differently.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:36):**  I think to be honest with you, the ones that will sort of be the early adopters from a  
**[0:22:42-0:22:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:42):**  financing point of view will probably be the ones that will have a big say in the kind  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:49):**  of way it will develop and will obviously build a market not only for themselves but  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:54):**  also for the others to come.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:22:57):**  So that leads me to the conclusion that what now is maybe most important is to get as many  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:05):**  farmers and practitioners as we possibly can to just start, to just get going.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:12):**  It never has to be perfect as such because you have to start small and learn as much  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:16):**  as you can anyway, I think in the beginning, or at least I think it's a wise approach.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:22):**  But we need to have many, many different small and big and family and, I don't know, a corporate  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:28):**  structures that just start, get going, get the word out, have people come on the farm,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:33):**  visit.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:34):**  And get brands to buy it.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:35):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:36):**  That seems to be, and get those relationships and educate maybe those food companies, the  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:41):**  small ones, the big ones to at least start buying and start buying food rotations and  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:46):**  making sure people understand what it means to start buying regenerative grown or ingredients  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:52):**  grown with regenerative practices.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:53):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:54):**  And unless we have a lot of farmers annoying these food companies and say, why are you  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:58):**  not buying this grain?  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:23:59):**  Why are you not buying this?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:00):**  Why are you not buying that?  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:01):**  Through a long term agreement, then they'll be all be the small ones on the farmer's market,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:05):**  which is great, but it's not going to grow to broad acre crops, etc. because there's  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:10):**  no direct sale basically, and you need food companies and processors, etc. to be involved.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:14):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:15):**  And this is spot on.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:16):**  And I think this is about to happen.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:18):**  And if I was a large brand today, if I was a super market, if I was whatever has a certain  
**[0:24:25-0:24:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:25):**  reach selling products or being active in the space, I would get kind of nervous if  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:32):**  I wouldn't already be doing something in this direction because this is going to be the  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:35):**  next big thing with all the problems and the things that might go bad and go wrong as it  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:41):**  always is.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:42):**  It's never perfect from the beginning, but I think the direction is very clear and I  
**[0:24:46-0:24:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:46):**  think you can count on it getting more and more speed and growth and attention.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:24:56):**  And would that be for investors the way to maybe not transition finance directly yet,  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:01):**  but to get involved with these farmers and to somehow help them to partner with these  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:06):**  brands or to connect them with food brands they might have also invested in to start  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:10):**  at least part of this new supply web to start building.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:14):**  And then the second step is, okay, we've established a market access for maybe part of your rotation,  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:20):**  maybe the whole rotation if you're super lucky or good, etc.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:23):**  But let's say part of the rotation.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:24):**  Second step is, okay, how do we finance you speeding up your regenerative practices and  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:30):**  basically get to that five or 10 year goal in a few years less or basically to do a lot  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:35):**  more or do it on all your acreage instead of a few, etc.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:38):**  But the first discussion should be, where's your market?  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:41):**  How do we build that market access?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:43):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:44):**  I think that would be a very progressive approach about doing this.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:50):**  So how have you been applying that to your farm?  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:52):**  As you mentioned the system before where you harvest, you test the quality and then you  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:25:57):**  start looking around, maybe have some contracts in place, but not a lot, which seems a very  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:01):**  unfair system obviously for the farmer, but it's what most annual crop farmers have in  
**[0:26:06-0:26:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:06):**  the world.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:07):**  Have you seen a change or an interest in those last months, maybe due to COVID, maybe due  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:11):**  to other consciousness of brands that either contacted you or you contacted them and suddenly  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:17):**  entered in another discussion?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:19):**  Is there movement happening in this case for grain, in this case for your farm, obviously  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:24):**  very specifically?  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:25):**  Do you see chances, opportunities, changes there?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:28):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:29):**  I mean, I think there's amazing chances when it comes to rethinking that whole process.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:35):**  I mean, if you think about the status quo, if you're selling a grain that we have a cleaner  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:43):**  for the grain, we can dry it.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:45):**  So the quality is good, but it's not on a, let's say, consumable quality-wise.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:53):**  So you have to clean it more thoroughly, of course, and you have to make sure there's  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:26:58):**  nothing in there but good quality grain basically.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:02):**  In this crazy baking months, you couldn't sell unfortunately directly to customers.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:06):**  No, not at all.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:07):**  So that's not possible.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:08):**  No, it's really, really complex.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:09):**  There's a lot of things in the grain, which you didn't want that if you make flour out  
**[0:27:15-0:27:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:15):**  of it.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:16):**  So that whole cleaning process is actually not complex if you've got everything, but  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:20):**  it's complex as a farmer to also be doing that.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:24):**  So we then sell our grain at the market price, maybe a little premium to a wholesaler that  
**[0:27:31-0:27:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:31):**  has obviously facilities to do all the cleaning, then store it, and then reselling it to the  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:40):**  bakeries, so to say.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:42):**  And the thing is the kind of value and margin that he or she makes on our product is more  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:51):**  or less the same depending how they obviously plan.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:27:56):**  But the process as such is always costs the same amount.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:01):**  So the risk is relatively low.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:03):**  Of course, they have to figure out from which farmer are they buying, which quality and  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:07):**  so forth.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:08):**  So that's some of their risk, but it's not as complex because obviously you can just  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:14):**  play with what you have.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:17):**  But compare that to the farmer, we have all the risks.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:22):**  We have in winter the risk, then about how evenly will it start to germinate and then  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:29):**  come out.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:30):**  Then we have the risk over the winter, is it going to freeze or not?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:34):**  Then we have a risk of whatever it is, we have all the risk, drought not even mentioned,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:42):**  to then finally have the product.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:44):**  And even the product as we feel this year, which has been an incredibly challenging year  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:48):**  when it comes to harvesting because it's raining more or less once a day, we have that and  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:55):**  another risk.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:56):**  Then we start storing it here and it's another risk.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:28:58):**  It's just really, really risky.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:01):**  And the margin that we get out of it is like now it looks like very, very slim.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:07):**  So just that system does not make so much sense when it comes to risk return profiles.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:18):**  So what we are trying to do is basically find a way of leveraging that risk somehow.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:24):**  And then the question is, well, how can we, if we're not able to do that whole cleaning  
**[0:29:29-0:29:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:29):**  storage process after the harvest, the next thing is, well, how can we maybe utilize our  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:36):**  own grain in a sense that we can market it directly through us or through a partner?  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:42):**  And this is something that we've worked on and thought about and discussed quite a bit  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:48):**  in recent months.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:29:51):**  And yeah, I mean, we're not there yet and it's a long process and it's also very complicated.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:01):**  And again, there's obviously some risks involved in it.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:04):**  But I think this is something that we as farmers can look into much more strongly because there's  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:12):**  potential there.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:13):**  There's quality that we can add.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:15):**  You're saying there's interest.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:17):**  There's interest from these, because also for, let's say it's a brand that needs certain  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:22):**  grains, et cetera.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:23):**  It's a risk and it's some extra work to not just go through the normal channels, but sort  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:27):**  of go directly to you and still they need some kind of cleaning.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:30):**  So it's extra work.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:32):**  But you're saying because of the story, because of the quality, the whole quality picture,  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:36):**  not just the quality of the product, but the quality of everything around for some brands  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:40):**  that might be absolutely worth it because they need the storytelling and they need the  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:44):**  values and they want to.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:46):**  And you're saying that, I mean, you're not there yet, but there's more movement than  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:49):**  a year ago or seven months ago when we started this series.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:52):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:54):**  And it's also the consumers that are driving it.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:57):**  Right.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:30:58):**  I mean, by the way, I don't like the word consumers, but clients is also horrible.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:03):**  So yeah, eating people, but that always sounds a bit awkward.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:09):**  So you know what I mean?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:11):**  But I think, you know, people that eat, let's keep it there.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:14):**  Which is everyone.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:15):**  At least I, if you're lucky.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:19):**  I think they are, they like to have a face or a story to the product.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:26):**  You know, why do we always need to have everything commoditized?  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:30):**  Why does everything has to come out of anonymity?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:33):**  Because that's where the margins are when you're a brand.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:35):**  I mean, the margins in food are higher up.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:39):**  I push that poor farmer right down there.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:43):**  So yes, so, you know, I think there is demand for it.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:47):**  I think there is room for it.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:48):**  And do you see demand that's big enough to take, like you have quite a large farm and  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:53):**  maybe there's demand from like a very cute small bar maker in Berlin in his or her kitchen  
**[0:31:59-0:32:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:31:59):**  and garage that's making.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:01):**  But a discussion I've often, and also with Jeroen, and that actually is coming, should  
**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:06):**  be online when you're listening to this.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:08):**  That's the farmer that makes the soy and the grain for the soy sauce we actually had in  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:11):**  this series.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:12):**  He says, yeah, the quantities of a lot of these local food systems are so small that  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:17):**  it's great to sell your beans directly.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:18):**  That is great to do, but it just doesn't make sense.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:22):**  So do you see, so long question, do you see interest from larger ones that can actually  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:26):**  absorb significant amounts and does make a difference for your farm?  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:31):**  Or is it smaller and does a lot of work and maybe nice margins, but very small quantities?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:36):**  I think the complexity with larger quantities is not getting smaller.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:41):**  So as soon as you talk about large quantities and suddenly there is demand and they want  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:46):**  more, you can't basically offer that.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:51):**  That's also true, yeah.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:52):**  So I think it is, as it is in general in agriculture, it's all a question of context.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:32:57):**  And you obviously need to find your channel and your product and your way and the kind  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:03):**  of story that you tell and the kind of people that you want to sell to.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:07):**  So I think it's always a matter of analysis and finding your spot.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:13):**  And that might take a while, of course, and it's an investment, but I think it's an investment  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:17):**  that pays out towards the end of the day.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:20):**  And also, and I think this is again where so much potential comes in in this space,  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:26):**  if this is something that more farmers start and this is something that more supermarkets  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:33):**  see and realize and also derive value from, because suddenly you have people wanting and  
**[0:33:39-0:33:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:39):**  asking, hey, do you also have that regional product that the supermarket across the street  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:47):**  has?  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:49):**  And people wanting that regional product where there's a story and a face to it in a sense,  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:33:55):**  then suddenly you can have a farmer next door that hasn't been in that kind of thinking  
**[0:34:00-0:34:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:00):**  and he or she comes and is like, hey, you do that with that partner and can I join you  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:08):**  in doing that?  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:09):**  And suddenly maybe you have three or four or five farms that get together in a cooperative  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:14):**  thinking or a cooperative, let's say production and use-  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:18):**  And they can get their cleaning machines.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:20):**  Exactly.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:21):**  And use the same channel and suddenly they can afford to invest together for some sort  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:26):**  of processing and then it grows from there.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:29):**  So there is incredible potential from basically decentralizing many of the as of today commoditized  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:38):**  products from farmers.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:40):**  And this is something that investors will also look at because they realize suddenly  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:45):**  we are talking about scale.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:46):**  I had that discussion exactly yesterday recording another interview with Ed Byrne of Soilworks,  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:51):**  which I put down below on the decentralized processing in the US.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:34:55):**  Very different story, but very similar characteristics, let's say not the same center of the, not  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:01):**  the same context, but decentralized mostly in this case in meat, but it holds true in  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:06):**  many others.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:07):**  We have to look at processing completely, which is a very dirty word, but even then  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:11):**  Barbara now calls themselves a food processor.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:13):**  You have to look at processing completely different, which offers very interesting investment  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:17):**  opportunities for investors and for farmers and for banks and for to get this product  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:23):**  from the farm in a form or shape that can go to a consumer, could be a restaurant, could  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:28):**  be a brand, could be asked directly, but to have that transformation, if you cannot sell  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:33):**  directly, if there are veggies, if there are certain things, of course, but most of the  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:36):**  food needs some kind of transformation or a lot of food needs some kind of transformation  
**[0:35:41-0:35:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:41):**  and needs obviously a market.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:42):**  So I think it's a very interesting conclusion where we're reaching after, I wouldn't say  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:47):**  a conclusion like an in-between conclusion, because I'm very much looking forward to checking  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:51):**  with you once you've signed hopefully more multiple off-take agreements that really give  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:35:58):**  the farm a long-term view on markets and thus a long-term view on regenerative practices.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:05):**  And then we can have another discussion on transition finance.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:07):**  Right.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:08):**  And I mean, I just want to add something to that idea, how starting through that kind  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:14):**  of direct channel, then finding farms around you, because you've proven it in your kind  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:20):**  of scale and suddenly maybe you find this kind of cooperative way of producing and using  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:26):**  that kind of direct channel in a regional context, that obviously brings all of a sudden  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:32):**  so much more potential that not necessarily has to do...  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:36):**  Work.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:37):**  Exactly.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:38):**  It has to do about work.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:39):**  It's about also the kind of system change that might come with it.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:44):**  So we're talking about soil again, soil health, the kind of quality, the area in total is  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:51):**  also gaining from it.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:36:54):**  And I've spoken to someone yesterday, Sepp Braun, he's quite a famous farmer in South  
**[0:37:04-0:37:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:04):**  Bavaria, and he's pointed out that there's scientific studies that you only need a certain  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:13):**  acreage, let's say three, four, five thousand hectares, for example, in order to actually  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:19):**  change the climate within that area.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:23):**  So imagine bringing cooperative structures together and I mean, if it's three or four  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:29):**  farms around our area, you are talking already about four or five thousand hectares.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:35):**  Suddenly if we come into a realm of planting trees, making agroforestry, changing the system,  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:42):**  growing soil, we are changing the microclimate.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:46):**  We are developing the area.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:48):**  We are going to have more rain because of it sooner or later, hopefully, I guess.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:54):**  You're complaining about it.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:55):**  You just complained about the rain.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:56):**  Sorry.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:37:57):**  I mean, in harvesting, it's not the best thing.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:00):**  Yeah, you're right.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:01):**  I should have said it.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:03):**  But you see where I'm going with this.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:04):**  Like, there is so much potential coming out of it.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:07):**  Then we get into very interesting areas.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:09):**  Exactly.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:10):**  Suddenly we're talking about regional development and we're talking about a future and something  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:17):**  that you can look out for and that you want to be part of and you make a brand out of  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:21):**  it.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:22):**  And suddenly we have other people wanting to join in that as well.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:24):**  They use some side product or something that usually you would have no use for and they  
**[0:38:29-0:38:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:29):**  turn that into something beautiful and sell it as well.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:32):**  So I think that is something that I'm just incredibly, how shall I say?  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:37):**  Excited.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:38):**  Excited about.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:39):**  Exactly.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:40):**  If you want to do branding already, you want to stabilize your local climate.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:43):**  Buy this.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:44):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:45):**  Exactly.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:46):**  Which is not the best slogan ever.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:48):**  I realize that marketing people have to figure that out.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:50):**  But I think it's the most exciting.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:52):**  It sounds very, I wouldn't even say high level, very ambitious.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:38:56):**  Like with farming, we can change, we can stabilize local climates and change local climates.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:01):**  But a lot of the research is coming out now and is actually showing that.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:04):**  And you need a certain acreage.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:05):**  You need a certain size.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:06):**  One farm is usually, even in Australia, is not enough because it's huge.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:10):**  But it's not big enough to have an impact on that.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:13):**  But as soon as we start bundling together, I mean, it becomes a bear.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:17):**  And we can start thinking, OK, where should we plant the trees on the different farms?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:20):**  Not on one farm only, but where does this set of trees and which set of trees have the  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:25):**  biggest impact, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:26):**  We can start doing that analysis of a landscape and figuring out where are the most important  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:32):**  hotspots to change agriculture first or to change the practices first.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:37):**  And then what are the second line of fields we need to attack and then a third, fourth,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:41):**  et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:43):**  You get a very different analysis.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:44):**  I think a lot of tech people would be very excited about that and doing that analysis.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:48):**  OK, which fields?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:49):**  You have a lot more acreage than hectares to play with and to change, basically.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:53):**  For sure.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:54):**  Because I think this is also one thing.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:39:56):**  I mean, as of today, if you are looking for new ways or solutions, you can find a lot,  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:02):**  right?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:03):**  And you can have people that do advising.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:07):**  If you're lucky enough to find someone that is an independent advisor, then even better.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:12):**  If you don't know what that means, I advise you to listen to the podcast with Nicolas.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:16):**  As most advisors, the best advisors so far, or let's say the most expensive ones are for  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:21):**  free actually, but they come included in a very heavy chemical package you need to buy  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:25):**  from certain companies that we can all imagine.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:28):**  And they are the ones that offer most advice to most farmers and thus obviously selling  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:32):**  a lot of chemical inputs.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:34):**  Right.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:35):**  But I mean, exactly.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:36):**  So I would always only talk to independent advisors.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:41):**  And so they come and they can tell you, well, you can do this or you can do that.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:45):**  But if you are busy and you're stuck in a system and your cash flow is like a zero sum  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:52):**  game or whatever, then do you really have the spirit and the heart and the emotional  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:40:58):**  freedom to then say, well, OK, then I'll try this or that?  
**[0:41:02-0:41:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:02):**  I don't know.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:03):**  I think it's a big ask.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:05):**  If you have someone that comes and say, yeah, you can buy this big product and then this  
**[0:41:08-0:41:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:08):**  will enable you to do the same thing.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:11):**  So I think just having an option of coming somewhere, listening to people or like I don't  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:18):**  know if that's really going to change.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:20):**  But if you come and approach the farmer and offer something that will immediately help  
**[0:41:27-0:41:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:27):**  him or her, that will immediately change the profitability of the operation because there  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:35):**  is suddenly a new channel.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:37):**  Then suddenly the game changes.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:40):**  Suddenly they're like, oh, OK, well, you just took pressure off me.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:43):**  You just helped me.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:44):**  So now I have to make my life easier.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:48):**  Now I have the emotional freedom to think about soil, to think about this or think about  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:53):**  that.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:54):**  To attend a course, to read.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:56):**  I think it's interesting how we reached this point after nine months.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:41:59):**  Well, actually, if you look through the different interviews, it's sort of a red line that goes  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:03):**  through all of them and it's very interesting.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:07):**  That's why we unpacked transition finance to find that it's maybe not the most important  
**[0:42:11-0:42:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:11):**  thing.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:12):**  And actually, there's one step before or a few steps before, but a crucial one before  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:15):**  that, before you can even think about finance, there needs to be a good business underneath,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:20):**  as all investors know.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:21):**  And a good business in farming depends on a good market and a long term market.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:26):**  That makes a lot of sense when we think about it.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:29):**  But yeah, it took us a few months.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:32):**  Better late than never.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:34):**  Better late than never, definitely.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:35):**  I want to thank you so much, Benedict.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:38):**  I'm sure this is not the last time we have you on because I would love updates over the  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:42):**  next months and years of how the transition is going and at some point transition finance  
**[0:42:47-0:42:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:47):**  and market access, et cetera.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:49):**  But thank you really, really a lot for being my co-host and partner in crime in this series.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:54):**  Yes.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:55):**  I mean, thank you so much.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:42:57):**  What an incredible time we've had and what an incredible time we're living in.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:02):**  The movements and developments in farming are just going to be, I can't even put it  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:07):**  into words, but I think we have everything to win for.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:11):**  I think we have everything that we can make better.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:13):**  And I am just incredibly positive.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:15):**  So I can't wait to look back on this and be ashamed of the stupid things that I particularly  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:23):**  did, but we maybe also said and the kind of visions that we had, which proved to be completely  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:29):**  wrong.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:30):**  But I think it will all make sense looking back.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:32):**  Like always.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:33):**  Yeah.

**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:43:35):**  Koen, thank you so much for having me.

**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:44:29):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:44:33):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:44:37):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:44:39):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question, how to put money  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:44:43):**  to work in regenerating soils, and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:44:48):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:13):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.

**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:33):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:36):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:45:46-0:45:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:46):**  No.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:47):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:50):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:53):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:58):**  different means.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:45:59):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:04):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:07):**  Thank you.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:08):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:09):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:46:16-0:46:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:16):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/01/transition-finance-ep9#t=0:46:18):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:14):**  Regen Ag is really, really, really hard.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:17):**  Something we don't talk about often enough when we see the shiny farms, pictures, movies  
**[0:00:21-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:21):**  and documentaries.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:23):**  So today an interview with the founders of Grounded, who we interviewed four years ago,  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:27):**  about the good, the bad and the ugly of Regen Ag.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:30):**  Five-year droughts, losing 70% of your crops and buyers who don't honor their agreements.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:36):**  Plus of course, lessons learned.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:37):**  What is currently working really well and what is Grounded launching soon in the regen  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:41):**  ingredients space.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:43):**  And their big realization when it comes to working with and investing in smallholder  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:47):**  farmers.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:50):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:54):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:00:56):**  First show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:00):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:06):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:10):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:12):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:16):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:19):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:24):**  attention to the dirt, soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:28):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:32):**  our work.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:33):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:35):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:39):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:43):**  For more information on the different tiers, benefits and how to become a member, check  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:48):**  gumroad.com slash investing Regen Ag or find the link below.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:52):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:54):**  Welcome for another episode.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:01:56):**  And today we have two guests that we had previously on the show take like donors and guys, bores  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:01):**  founders of grounded.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:02):**  We had them in March 2017.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:04):**  Almost four years ago.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:06):**  And it's time for an update, actually many updates.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:08):**  I'm very, very happy to have them back on the show.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:11):**  Welcome take line guys.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:12):**  Thanks.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:13):**  Thanks for having us again.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:14):**  Good.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:15):**  And just to set the stage a bit for people, obviously, I will link to the previous interview  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:19):**  we did in the show notes below, but could you briefly introduce grounded back in the  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:24):**  day?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:25):**  And then of course, we're going to talk about grounded currently in 2021.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:29):**  Yeah, I can actually take a step at that.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:33):**  I think maybe you're grounded back in the day in 2017.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:36):**  It was, I think Christ and me and a few people.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:39):**  And we had established a project in the Baviaenskloof in South Africa, where we were trying to restore  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:46):**  a degraded landscape together with some NGOs that we were working with and with the farmers  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:51):**  there.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:52):**  And we had just started to see if we could replicate some of our approaches there in  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:02:58):**  other areas in Zambia and in another area in South Africa.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:02):**  And since then, the organization has progressed quite a lot and also maybe changed.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:08):**  But I think still to our core, what we do is that we work with farmers to help them  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:14):**  to transition into regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:18):**  We build companies that take their produce, process them if necessary, and bring them  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:24):**  to markets.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:27):**  And yeah, so we then also actually help buyers access the produce from the farmers.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:34):**  So that's in a nutshell, maybe what we do.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:36):**  In essence, that hasn't changed.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:38):**  But I think the execution has completely changed.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:40):**  Yes.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:41):**  Based on many, many lessons.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:43):**  That's the biggest difference.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:44):**  I think we were very optimistic at that moment.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:47):**  We've over, Tecla actually and the team, they've got a lot of hurdles in the Baviaenskloof,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:52):**  close to raising investment, first planting.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:54):**  Yeah, let's talk about that one, because that was the project we mentioned a lot last time.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:03:59):**  What was the original idea and what has it pivoted, morphed or emerged into?  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:05):**  And now you're still partly involved.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:07):**  But let's take us through the journey of the Baviaenskloof, because I think it's a great  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:10):**  example of a lot of lessons learned and what we can take away from that and what you obviously  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:16):**  bring to other landscapes now.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:18):**  Yeah, so the original idea in the Baviaenskloof, so it's a sort of semi arid landscape where  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:24):**  the predominant farming method was grazing goats, extensive grazing, so in mountains  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:30):**  like on thousands of hectares.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:33):**  But a lot of the mountain land was severely degraded because of overgrazing, actually  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:37):**  not by the farmers who are there now, but already over generations this has been happening.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:44):**  And it was identified by ecologists as a very important biome, also because of its potential  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:49):**  to capture carbon actually.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:51):**  So there's a keystone species there called speckbohm, which is a tree.  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:58):**  It's a tree, exactly.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:04:59):**  And you can plant it from cuttings and it showed really good results in initial restoration  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:06):**  efforts.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:07):**  So the idea was to help those farmers restore their lands using as part of that maybe like  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:14):**  speckbohm, this tree.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:17):**  And then we as Grounded came in to see, okay, can we actually also ensure that that sort  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:24):**  of makes economic sense for the farmers to do so instead of we just plant trees on their  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:29):**  degraded land, but they continue with their goat farming practices as they had been doing  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:33):**  previously, that would not make a lot of sense because then the goats could come in again  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:37):**  and eat the trees and then, you know, there's just zero effect.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:42):**  So what we started doing is seeing, okay, is there a way to actually transform the farming  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:49):**  system entirely?  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:50):**  And that was, I think in hindsight, maybe overly ambitious.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:54):**  Especially the word entirely.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:56):**  Exactly.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:05:57):**  Because then we came up with a plan for the farmers to transition away from goat farming  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:03):**  and towards essential oils.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:06):**  So we set up a company that would enable the farmers to grow crops like lavender and rosemary  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:12):**  in the area and process them locally and then sell them.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:17):**  And then the farmers signed like holistic land management plans that they promised to  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:22):**  take their goats off the land in return for like all kinds of benefits that they would  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:26):**  receive through this company.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:29):**  And so we started off very optimistically because we thought this is going to be great.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:33):**  And ambitious.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:34):**  I mean, this is going from goat farming to farming.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:37):**  Rosemary is a step, let's say a huge step.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:41):**  So that is a step.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:42):**  But then we added an extra step on top of that because we thought that's not enough.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:46):**  Like we're also going to do it organic.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:48):**  And they hadn't been growing organic before.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:51):**  So they had like zero experience on that.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:54):**  So yeah, but we thought now this is it should be relatively easy.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:06:58):**  You know, the advisor still does like the numbers look great.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:02):**  The agronomist said no, these crops will grow fantastically in the area.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:07):**  Maybe good to know that the essential oils industry in South Africa is very small.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:11):**  So the amount of advice that we could get was sort of limited.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:16):**  So it was a little bit like pioneering, but everything on paper looks fantastic.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:21):**  Your spreadsheets looks amazing.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:22):**  Your PowerPoints looked amazing.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:24):**  And it looked even better if we made it really big.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:29):**  You added a few zeros here and there and move some farmers around.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:32):**  So the bigger the better basically.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:34):**  And also the faster the better.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:36):**  Of course in your spreadsheet, you know, then your returns just great.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:40):**  Okay, I'm exaggerating a little bit, but it was like we were really optimistic.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:45):**  And so we started off planting lavender or at least the farmers did that.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:49):**  And then actually immediately came like stumbled on a few challenges there.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:55):**  It was much harder than we thought to get the lavender plants to actually grow in that  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:07:59):**  landscape.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:00):**  Started rosemary as well, which did a lot better.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:03):**  But then one rosemary field got clapped by a pest and 70% disappeared again.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:11):**  So on the growing side, we had challenges.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:12):**  And you did a bit I mean, it was big.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:15):**  This wasn't a few like half a hectare here and there.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:18):**  This was a lot of hectares.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:19):**  No, we started with 100 hectares, which I wouldn't recommend if anybody is listening,  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:25):**  I would not recommend starting off any kind of project with 100 hectares, maybe start  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:29):**  off with like half a hectare or something or one, maybe maximum five, but not as many  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:34):**  as we did.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:36):**  Also because it's just much more difficult to manage 10 hectares than a half, you know,  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:40):**  as Yeah, plus your financial risk is way bigger, obviously.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:44):**  So yeah, maybe long story short, eventually, yeah, it was actually it's, it was a really  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:51):**  tough process.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:53):**  Because as you can imagine, the farmers put a lot of time and effort into making this  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:08:58):**  work as did I and the lot like the rest of the team, we worked like really, really hard.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:05):**  But eventually, we had to come to the conclusion that all the lavender fields that we had established,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:10):**  which I think was about 60 hectares or something, I don't remember exactly, we had to write  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:14):**  them off, because it was just impossible to get it to grow.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:19):**  The rosemary on the other hand, did really well.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:22):**  But there, we found out that the variety that we planted actually didn't get the highest  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:28):**  prices in the market for the oil.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:30):**  And there was another variety, which was much more attractive, which we then started planting  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:36):**  as well.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:37):**  And those are still actually doing fairly okay.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:41):**  Yeah, we will get to the ingredient part and the buyer part and the markets, etc.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:45):**  But what would be the biggest takeaways I think is one of the biggest is starting smaller  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:50):**  or not being overly optimistic in terms of size, but anything else that you really want  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:56):**  listeners to hear?  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:09:57):**  I mean, obviously, you wrote a number of really interesting blog posts, which I will link  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:01):**  below, because you basically took apart all the lessons learned of the Bavarian schools  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:06):**  and of others.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:07):**  But as a biggest takeaway guys, what do you want the listeners of the podcast to know  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:11):**  about this project and what they maybe won't have to go through?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:14):**  The biggest takeaway and I raised my hand here is I think we work with farmers, farmers  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:19):**  that are really ready to go through change.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:22):**  We mix it up with teams with people with all sorts of knowledge.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:26):**  So we had a wide group of people supporting us, everybody was on track.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:31):**  And if you then see how difficult it is to get to that transition, now imagine that all  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:37):**  these farmers have to go through this transition.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:40):**  Everywhere in the world, we hope to see these farmers completing this transition.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:44):**  And I think to me, the biggest takeaway is all these hurdles in between.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:48):**  We still strongly believe in Regen Agri.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:51):**  But seeing the perfect examples that you see today, how they work, they have made that  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:56):**  transition, they are there.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:10:57):**  They were maybe in a certain spot or certain area that favored the conditions to make that  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:02):**  transition.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:03):**  But in the Bavarian's Club, the conditions are not very favorable for that path.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:08):**  And to me, that is the biggest takeaway.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:10):**  If we've exposed our success directly to the success of the farmers, and that working with  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:18):**  them and trying to make the complete transition, even if you mix bringing all outside knowledge  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:23):**  and everybody's on the same page and everybody works day and night to get there, and then  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:28):**  still you make, everybody must make some of these mistakes.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:31):**  So to get through the transition and complete it, I think that's the biggest challenge.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:35):**  And that, I think, is something we're focusing on.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:38):**  It's focusing on making that transition work, and then especially for us as ground in an  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:43):**  African context often.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:45):**  I think I can maybe add some, like, give some specifics to things which were actually difficult.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:50):**  You mean the weather, obviously.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:52):**  Exactly.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:53):**  So for example, the weather.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:54):**  So this is actually quite a significant thing because when we started there, it was five  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:11:59):**  years ago, and we didn't know back then, but that was actually going to be the start of  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:03):**  a drought, which still lasts until today, and which is a horrible drought.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:08):**  The farmers have never seen the water levels this low.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:11):**  It's actually a little bit scary.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:13):**  They need rain at some point now because this is…  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:17):**  Yeah, you mentioned it's semi-arid, but soon it's going to be arid.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:20):**  Yes, definitely.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:22):**  And without water, nothing grows.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:23):**  No.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:24):**  So for example, in the first two years when we started, we had 90, so 90 millimeters of  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:29):**  rain over a period of two years, which is like a desert kind of environment.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:35):**  And the effects you see then is like, so for regenerative agriculture to work, you want  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:39):**  to build up life in the soil, but that helps if you can actually then have stuff growing  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:45):**  on the soil as well.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:46):**  You know, these things like interact.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:48):**  So how do you, for example, plant or establish cover crops if you have no water?  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:53):**  You know, this is something which is like maybe sounds a bit trivial, but was a real  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:58):**  challenge.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:12:59):**  So then you do get more challenges with weeds, for instance, if there are no cover crops  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:03):**  to…  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:04):**  So it all sort of then interlinks.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:07):**  And in this case, it wouldn't have made sense to look at historical data because this  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:11):**  is a historical drought, which you wouldn't have been able to predict.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:14):**  Exactly.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:15):**  So you're going in blind basically in many of these places.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:18):**  Exactly.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:19):**  Yeah, that is just, and now it's actually so dire that they've had to even stop irrigating  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:25):**  some of the rosemary fields, which I listened to our previous podcast and then I was like  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:30):**  proudly saying like, oh, this is all very water resilient because the farmers now use  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:34):**  10 times less water than they used previously.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:37):**  But now there's so little water that they don't even have enough water for this.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:42):**  And then of course, like if external condition like that beats you, then there's just,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:47):**  you know, very little you can do.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:50):**  Although I must say on the positive side that despite this drought, the farmers have actually  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:13:56):**  like, okay, because when you get a little bit of rain, then you can quickly plant cover  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:00):**  crops, etc.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:01):**  And they have now transitioned into regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:06):**  And that is actually working fantastically.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:09):**  The farmers are super excited about it.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:11):**  What's the current situation from let's say the pessimistic or what went wrong because  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:16):**  many things did, but what's the current were a number of years in your I think you just  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:21):**  went to the Baba Yans globe, like what did you see?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:23):**  And what's the current even though there's been an historic drought?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:27):**  What's happening in the field on the field in the soil?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:30):**  Yeah, on the soils, it's amazing.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:33):**  Actually, I like I stood on a plot where a farmer had like applied regenerative and then  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:38):**  right next to it, he hadn't done that.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:40):**  And the difference is just incredible.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:43):**  And what was the difference then?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:44):**  What kind of approaches of methods?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:46):**  So on the one field, he had implemented like compost tea, all sorts of like a cover crop  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:53):**  mix.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:54):**  So they had actually implemented a full regenerative program.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:14:58):**  We had a guy who was the general manager who was like very much involved in this and who  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:02):**  look, I'm not the expert, so I can't give you the details, unfortunately, but it worked  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:07):**  really well.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:08):**  So all the farmers make their own compost tea on the land, they can put it directly into  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:12):**  the irrigation systems that works very well, if they can irrigate.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:17):**  And then yeah, these cover crops also, so you can just see the effects in the soil.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:21):**  And that is only like after one or two years.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:24):**  So it's actually nice.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:25):**  The farmers can also see immediate benefits.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:28):**  It's a much more closed loop system, they don't need to get inputs from outside, especially  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:32):**  if you need organic inputs, they can get super expensive.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:36):**  So the farmers are happy about that as well.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:39):**  They've still got the rosemary fields, which despite the fact that they can't irrigate  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:43):**  are still standing, they don't grow as well, but they're surviving.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:47):**  So hopefully when they get rain, you know, they'll get like better yields again.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:52):**  And they process those into oil as well as a part of it is dried and is used in the food  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:15:58):**  ingredient industry as a preservative.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:01):**  There's a molecule in rosemary, it's called carnosic acid that's used as a food preservative.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:06):**  And actually, they now found a market for just dried herbs.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:11):**  So that's actually sort of working, like despite a lot of things.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:16):**  Maybe another anecdote on this is that carnosic acid, if you have a very healthy soil, healthy  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:21):**  plant, and then you put it under a lot of stress, then that carnosic acid is like a  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:26):**  protection mechanism of that plant.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:28):**  So if you have a very healthy plant, and the more carnosic acid, you would say the more  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:32):**  value that product has to the industry.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:35):**  So we had buyers that promised us a green company, say we want more organic sourcing.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:40):**  So they said, we're going to help you, and we're going to pay you for the improved quality.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:45):**  And two years later, after all the hurdles, all the challenges, all the mistakes, the  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:50):**  farmers actually said, give us two years and they deliver it.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:53):**  And then that company backed off.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:55):**  Later on, it turned out to be a huge fraud scandal at that company.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:16:58):**  But so you're saying this, the healthier the soil, the more of this specific piece, or  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:04):**  it has to be stressed because of the drought.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:08):**  Yeah, it's a combination.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:09):**  So first, a healthy plant and then put it under stress.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:12):**  But it has to do with a lot of factors.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:14):**  So the right variety for this, it has to do with the right plant, the right harvesting  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:18):**  times, indeed, when it's under stress, and also the right processing.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:22):**  So it's difficult to say it's just the soil is just that it's a combination of factors  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:26):**  that improve that plant's defense mechanism.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:29):**  And that's what they later on extract from it.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:32):**  And obviously, you figured this out in the last years, because it's not that you go in,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:36):**  we're going to do essential oils, and you already have this as a plan B or something  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:40):**  not, this is something you happen to find out on the road.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:44):**  Sometimes you have a bit of luck, and then you need to capitalize on that luck.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:47):**  And that then didn't happen.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:48):**  And now there's another company, a family business, and they say, yeah, we first want  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:53):**  to have a couple of batches and see if we really can get it out of it and if it really  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:57):**  works.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:17:58):**  But then they say, yeah, but we actually need volumes.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:00):**  And then it takes another two years to get to the volumes they want.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:03):**  And so, you know, in the meantime, we've completely the business itself.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:08):**  So we see the transition on the farmers, but the business itself has set so many hits after  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:13):**  hits after hits.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:14):**  And that's difficult to hang in there while you try to get from small success to bigger  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:21):**  successes.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:22):**  And you need not make so many mistakes as us.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:24):**  And you also need a bit of luck from time to time.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:27):**  Because if that buyer would have been there at that moment when it said it would be there,  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:31):**  that they would pay an organic premium and a premium for the quality of the product,  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:36):**  that it would have been amazing.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:37):**  That would have been closing the business deal and be the proof of a successful company.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:42):**  And that's then again delayed by two years.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:44):**  And afterwards to say, yeah, you should have gone for alternative buyers quicker.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:47):**  But they gave us also such a good impression and really committed that we could ask them  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:51):**  anything.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:52):**  And probably the people in that business that were talking to us were excited.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:55):**  So it's not even the persons in that business.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:18:58):**  I think it's a great bridge to the ingredient side of things like what you learn there and  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:01):**  how you're, and also the buyer side in the marketplace.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:04):**  Like, it's amazing if you can grow a lot of fields of rosemary in healthy soils, but then  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:09):**  what do you actually do with it?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:11):**  Like it needs to be not too big, not too small, this kind of ingredient, this kind of color,  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:15):**  this kind of weight, this kind of quality, etc, etc, etc.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:18):**  And for many farmers, that's simply too complicated, whatever they're growing.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:22):**  So have you seen not only in the Baviaansmelt, but also in the other landscapes you're working  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:26):**  in on that?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:28):**  How do you get it to a proper buyer for a proper price?  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:30):**  Like, what are the big lessons there?  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:32):**  Yeah, I think in the end, of course, it's also all about your quality, right?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:37):**  So you can have amazing soils, but you're not selling the soil.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:41):**  So it can be a fantastic regenerative landscape, but then you still need to get the specs of  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:47):**  your product right, especially if you want to get a premium price.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:51):**  And there we've seen that that just takes time, especially if you're entering a new  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:56):**  market, for instance, in the case with this rosemary.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:19:59):**  Right now, they've got a fantastic product.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:01):**  So the feedback that they're getting on the oil is really good.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:05):**  And then you see like, okay, so it takes actually a long time from establishing till when you  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:11):**  actually get demand from the buyers and your product is good enough, and then people come  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:15):**  back to you and they refer you to other buyers.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:18):**  But it takes four or five years, basically.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:20):**  Exactly.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:21):**  So it requires, I think, a lot more patience than we would have thought it would take.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:26):**  But I still believe that it's actually an interesting model for that area, like that  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:30):**  business could still work.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:32):**  Because especially now, they've got a good product, they've got the growing going, there  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:37):**  is a market, so this could work.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:40):**  Then the next challenge is actually what we've come across is like what Gijs already mentioned  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:44):**  previously is sort of the mismatch between the skill that you're producing and the skill  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:51):**  that the buyer wants.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:53):**  Like I just mentioned, like don't start with super big production because then you can  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:57):**  make too many mistakes.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:20:59):**  But now the challenge is then you get a buyer who says, okay, this is really nice oil, I  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:05):**  would love to buy a ton.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:08):**  And then they say, okay, no, but we don't have a ton, we've got 200 kg, you know.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:13):**  We can get you a ton, but they're going to be then in whatever two years time or something.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:18):**  And then the buyer says, okay, no, that's fine.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:19):**  And I'll go to another producer somewhere else.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:22):**  And so that cycle is almost a little bit chicken and egg because you need to have the product  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:27):**  to get the buyer because nobody's going to buy if you don't have like a sample, for example.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:32):**  But then once you have the buyer, you don't have enough of the product.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:35):**  So this is kind of a tricky loop.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:37):**  So with all your experience now in different landscapes, what could be a solution or what  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:42):**  is a solution you're working on or how do you fix a chicken and egg?  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:46):**  Well, firstly, I think if you're on a farm, you produce different qualities as well, especially  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:51):**  in the transition.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:53):**  So it is key, I think, that farmers that produce a better quality, they can access a market  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:21:59):**  to that.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:00):**  And there's also a commodification of products.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:02):**  So we pay for a minimum standard, but not for a higher standard.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:07):**  And at the same time, this wholesale industry in the middle is critical, plays a critical  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:11):**  role in capturing, processing all the mass products that are there.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:16):**  So we have to take a step somewhere in that wholesale arm as well, and especially seeing  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:22):**  if we can get a bit of upside of maybe 10 or 20 percent of the produce of some businesses  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:27):**  or farmers or farmers that maybe have produced smaller volumes, as Tecla explained, but at  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:32):**  a better quality, connect that to buyers interested in that better quality.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:37):**  And I think that's where a missing link is.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:41):**  And it's not saying that we can overcome that as an organization.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:44):**  This is big.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:45):**  This is a big infrastructure challenge that's holding back region agree in general.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:50):**  But I think we would like to contribute that and be a part of that transition, be a part  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:56):**  of that movement and play a role there as well.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:22:59):**  So I think Tecla, over to you.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:02):**  Yeah, what we see is maybe there's almost a mismatch or there are two groups that don't  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:06):**  find each other as easily, which could be a solution to this problem, partially maybe.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:12):**  So the one group is actually maybe smaller, medium sized brands with a very authentic  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:18):**  story and product.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:20):**  And that segment is actually growing rapidly.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:23):**  That's driving growth in consumer goods industries.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:27):**  So it's actually not an insignificant size of the total market.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:33):**  You have examples of brands you can disclose.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:35):**  You're talking to your brands that people know too.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:38):**  So they're not super big.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:39):**  They're definitely not tiny.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:41):**  And they have an appetite for good stories and hopefully good quality.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:44):**  Exactly.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:45):**  There's a lot of, for instance, brands here in South Africa that your listeners might  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:48):**  not know, but it's like Sunbird Tea and maybe like slightly bigger ones that they might  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:53):**  know.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:23:54):**  But those are already more established, but it's like Lush or Pukka Tea, things like that.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:00):**  But those I wouldn't really call small.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:03):**  I think the smaller ones are more localized actually.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:05):**  So they would be specific.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:06):**  They wouldn't have maybe expanded internationally yet.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:09):**  And they could, they are looking for players like yourself and for ingredients that you  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:14):**  can give them access to.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:16):**  So what they are often looking for is ingredients which are produced sustainably and with high  
**[0:24:23-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:23):**  ethical principles.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:25):**  And ideally a lot of them, I think, would like to show transparency to their customers  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:29):**  and where they get their ingredients from.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:32):**  But for a lot of these, especially smaller brands, it's difficult to get access to those  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:36):**  ingredients because they would either have to approach all the farmers individually and  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:40):**  then get the stuff.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:41):**  It's expensive, logistical nightmare.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:44):**  Takes a lot of time and effort.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:46):**  Or they have to go to like your traditional wholesalers, but then you lose the story and  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:53):**  you often don't even know where your product actually comes from.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:24:57):**  So we spoke to quite a lot of those small brands and they actually said to us, wouldn't  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:04):**  you be able to help us get access to those ingredients?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:07):**  The reason why we spoke to them initially was because we thought we were going to establish  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:10):**  your own brand.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:12):**  I remember those discussions.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:13):**  Yeah, as actually as a way to capture better value for the farmers.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:17):**  But then we figured there are actually so many brands.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:21):**  We might as well position ourselves like sort of one level lower and instead actually help  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:26):**  them get access to these ingredients because we are connected to the farmers.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:31):**  At the same time, the farmers, for them, it's really interesting to sell to those brands  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:37):**  because often they will get lower volumes, which we just spoke about, especially if you're  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:42):**  just transitioning to regenerative, that's super interesting.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:45):**  The quantity of quality you have might be not a ton, but a few hundred kilos here and  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:51):**  there.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:52):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:53):**  And it grows over time, hopefully, but you're not stabilized yet.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:55):**  You don't have a stable production of high quality.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:57):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:25:58):**  Plus these brands are often also a little bit less critical to the exact specifications  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:03):**  of their ingredients.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:04):**  So the more bigger, more established brands want to have exactly these like chemical specifications  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:10):**  because their product needs to be uniform all the time.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:14):**  Whereas the smaller ones can offer a lot more flexibility, which also provides great opportunities  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:20):**  for these producers.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:22):**  Plus they can actually pay a better price often because they will value the impact that's  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:27):**  been created.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:28):**  But it's sort of like what I just explained, there's an inefficiency in the system for  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:33):**  these two to come together.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:35):**  Because also for the farmers, it doesn't make sense to now go phone every small brand and  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:39):**  try to sell them like half a kilogram of oil.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:41):**  Hey, do you want to buy some XYZ?  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:44):**  So this is actually something which we are busy now with, which we're very excited about  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:49):**  because we're actually going to launch a online platform in May.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:54):**  We're going to do a pilot here in South Africa where we bring these two together.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:26:59):**  So where we offer ingredients from great producers that we know that grow regeneratively.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:05):**  So it's our own produce, like the operating companies that we established, but also other  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:10):**  companies that we found that meet our standards and then offer the brands an opportunity to  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:16):**  basically buy directly from those producers.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:18):**  So basically a wholesale ingredient, regenerative wholesale ingredients platform.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:23):**  Exactly.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:24):**  And that could really speed up the transition of a lot of them.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:27):**  And then do they sort of like the farmers, do they between brackets graduate from that?  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:32):**  Like at some point, if I am at that, like I'm standard, the hitting the high quality  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:36):**  mark, do I outgrow these brands?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:38):**  Some of them maybe do.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:39):**  And what happens then?  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:41):**  Yeah, hopefully.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:42):**  Cause like that would ultimately also be interesting for us.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:44):**  We also like apart from this platform, so this is like one distribution channel that  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:48):**  we're having.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:50):**  The other channel like which we use to generate sales is actually more direct sales.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:55):**  So for the larger buyers, the platform, we don't really see it as a method.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:27:59):**  It's more based on the connections that we have in the industry.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:03):**  So indeed, if they have like larger volumes and they can meet quality standards, then  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:07):**  we can actually also help facilitate those deals or they can find those deals themselves,  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:12):**  of course.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:13):**  So that's going to go live in May, specifically on South Africa.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:16):**  But obviously, I'm imagining you're planning beyond that for some ingredients that are  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:20):**  easily, let's say, easily shipped, transported and light.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:25):**  Very exciting.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:26):**  It's basically four or five years of experience coming together in a very specific solution  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:31):**  that could, at least in the transition piece that we were mentioning before, solve a lot  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:35):**  of things to get at least some of the higher quality stuff to some buyers for a good price.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:42):**  We're super excited about this.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:43):**  Also because it provides us with good opportunities to scale our experience and our model, I think,  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:50):**  because we will be able, we think, like you mentioned, the South African market for this  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:28:54):**  is relatively small, but it allows us to set up the platform actually with our own means  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:00):**  as well.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:01):**  We don't need any external investments yet.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:03):**  And then we can test it, see how it works and then bring it to other markets.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:09):**  And it's also a great way actually to get access to more producers and then provide  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:14):**  those producers because our vision is that we can then actually provide those producers  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:18):**  with support to transition towards like better regenerative agricultural practices.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:24):**  So some of them might be at the beginning of a journey and then we can help them to  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:29):**  sort of progress.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:30):**  And what kind of products, what kind of ingredients would be predominantly on there for the beginning?  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:35):**  Like what are the main ingredients coming off the landscapes, from the landscapes you're  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:39):**  working in or with the producers you're working with?  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:42):**  So we're starting with the segments in which we have experience from our own landscapes  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:46):**  indeed.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:47):**  So it's going to be essential oils and carrier oils.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:50):**  So seed oils, tea and herbs and spices initially.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:55):**  We might add some other segments later on, but we'll see.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:29:59):**  I think those are sufficient for now.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:01):**  And it's very interesting cross-pollination amongst those segments because those are the  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:05):**  ingredient segments.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:07):**  And then the customer segments that we're targeting are the cosmetics industry, ready  
**[0:30:11-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:11):**  to drink, botanical drinks, those kinds of things, tea, spices, but they actually use  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:19):**  ingredients from the different categories that I just mentioned.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:23):**  So in a tea, you can use spices, for instance.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:26):**  In a cosmetics formulation, you can use a tea.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:30):**  So yeah, it's like these segments, we also chose them because there are synergies amongst  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:35):**  them and because they are relatively high value and durable.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:40):**  So they're non-perishable, which makes our operations slightly more easy to handle, especially  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:45):**  given the fact that we're in like remote locations.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:49):**  So we don't need a cold chain or something like that.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:51):**  Yeah, which will change everything.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:53):**  And to shift gears a bit, because we have also discussed last time, you just started  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:58):**  to work, I think in Zambia.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:30:59):**  We discussed it briefly with smallholder farmers, very different setting, completely different  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:04):**  setting compared to the Batyans globe or the other landscapes you're working in South Africa.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:08):**  But what has, I mean, a lot has happened there, I know, but let me ask the question, what  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:12):**  has happened there?  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:13):**  I think specifically to Gijs, with the project there, you're still very involved, but it  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:17):**  has completely evolved.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:18):**  Yeah, it's been a very long trajectory there.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:22):**  But the starting point was a large training scheme operated by one of our partnering NGOs  
**[0:31:28-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:28):**  where they provided small support packages, seed and training to a lot of small farmers  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:35):**  in that area.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:37):**  Something we've seen many times.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:39):**  We've seen many times, and this was connected to what they call conservation agriculture,  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:43):**  like basic region agri, so rotations, different crops, compost, etc.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:50):**  And the first thing we've looked at, also, when we spoke, we had different models in  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:55):**  mind.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:31:56):**  But after the Batyans globe, we thought, okay, no, let's not make a radical transition.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:00):**  So the first step was to increase the package sizes to those farmers and see if we could  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:06):**  take off some of the extra produce again and sell that over at a better price.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:11):**  So we figured it out, the smallest peanut butter in Zambia, great, great to make.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:16):**  And actually, the smallest peanuts were more higher valued in Zambia, the bigger peanuts  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:21):**  were higher valued in the Netherlands, we had an amazing company that wanted to take  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:24):**  care of our logistics and reprocessing.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:28):**  So again, on paper, that makes sense.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:30):**  But we were, firstly, let's talk about our biggest mistake there is that when you increase  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:35):**  those packages to the small farmers, we saw huge difference between smallholder farmers.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:42):**  So that was one of our biggest insights there, I think.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:46):**  You mean differences in how they responded to the bigger package?  
**[0:32:49-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:49):**  Indeed, how they responded to that, how they take it on.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:51):**  So how they were able to translate that higher package in more production in a more efficient  
**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:57):**  production.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:32:58):**  So you've seen maybe 10% of the farmers were able to take on that bigger package, and really  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:03):**  translate that in higher production.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:05):**  I won't go into detail, we've written blogs about it.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:08):**  But it's complex to scale.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:10):**  Labor is scarce, and it's a labor intensive system.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:14):**  Many farmers were older farmers, and it makes a lot of sense to grow your own food.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:19):**  But going beyond that has some complexities.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:22):**  So basically, what we've seen there in Zambia, the biggest transition we've done after two  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:27):**  years of trials, and obviously, we lost 90% of all the crops to drought as well.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:32):**  So it's hard to measure exactly how bad we would have done in a normal year.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:37):**  But what we've seen now, what we're trying there now is to get what you see is a region  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:43):**  farm works, you know, the more integrated to this taking up business models.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:47):**  So we're getting more high variety farm, but we're going to invest 10 to $15,000 packages  
**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:54):**  in let's say, the top 5%.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:33:56):**  So you're really selecting for like the top percentage of the farmers, which is a huge  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:01):**  shift from let's give everybody a package.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:04):**  No, that's huge.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:05):**  And there's already a lot of support from NGOs from small packages to small farmers.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:10):**  And then there is a lot of investment going into bigger farms, bigger investment, bigger  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:14):**  projects.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:15):**  But in between, there's nothing.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:17):**  And the challenge is a lot of people want to see a million farm programs.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:22):**  And it's not really sexy to say, yeah, there's a million farmers, we think that million farmers  
**[0:34:26-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:26):**  are served well by some of the NGOs.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:28):**  And let me clear not everybody, but there is a lot going on in that space.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:33):**  And also a lot of good work.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:34):**  The thing is that the next step, and what we've tried to build in is that next step,  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:39):**  going with a lot of hurdles again, but bringing in that next step.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:43):**  And now we're at a stage to say, okay, we see talent, we see entrepreneurs, we see farmers.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:48):**  And we've read a great study, I think, NGO, it's called Pathways, several organizations  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:54):**  together.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:34:55):**  They've mapped the different roads these farmers can take on their path from being a subsistence  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:02):**  of very small farmer with all the challenges to a more resilient farmer, but also the other  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:06):**  ways into the economy they can go.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:09):**  Not all of these million farmers we see are farmers that can become a full on regenerative  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:14):**  farm, like we see on the perfect examples on TV.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:18):**  And I think, yeah, that was our insight.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:20):**  And I thought if you want to invest in small farmers, really invest, then you have to do  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:25):**  that.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:26):**  And even in a big example often mentioned in Kenya, Stweega, they source from small  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:30):**  farmers and they sell to street vendors.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:33):**  They've come to a similar conclusion, say, okay, for us, you know, we need to invest  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:37):**  more in some of the top farmers.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:39):**  And it's not always a well received message.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:42):**  From donors, I can imagine.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:44):**  And I definitely want to state that their work, the donors, what they are doing, it's  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:48):**  not saying that that is not effective.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:49):**  But to say just the step afterwards is often lacking.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:53):**  So it's to phrase that very carefully.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:56):**  But indeed, it's not sexy.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:35:57):**  And it's also difficult to say that we can invest a lot in you and not so much in another  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:01):**  farmer.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:02):**  But that's also the reality.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:03):**  Yeah, let's impact of it.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:04):**  I think it's a fascinating realization that obviously every investor has already come  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:09):**  to you because it's if you are active in an accelerator, if you're active, I mean, you  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:15):**  screen a lot of deals before you invest or a lot of entrepreneurs, you meet a lot of  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:18):**  teams, why Combinator?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:19):**  I don't know how many they screen before they select someone.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:22):**  And somehow if we want to invest in smallholder farmers, we don't do any screening, we're  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:26):**  just sort of basically spray and pray and hope that it will work out.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:30):**  And in this case, it is figuring out which ones actually want to be a farmer.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:34):**  First of all, you wrote a great blog post about that, I will definitely link that as  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:38):**  well, like who wants to be a commercial farmer and who sees his or her career and work in  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:43):**  that and many don't.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:45):**  And that's perfectly fine.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:46):**  But as an investor, you don't want to be backing the ones that actually don't want to do what  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:50):**  they're doing, and obviously, they will move to the city if they can, or they would start  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:54):**  doing something else if other economic opportunities open up.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:36:57):**  So backing the ones that want to be in our able is crucial, selecting them is not easy.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:01):**  But then so you're now saying we're investing, you use that word very specifically $15,000  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:06):**  worth of package in the farmers that want to do more.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:09):**  What does that exactly mean?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:10):**  What do you do?  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:11):**  How do you work with them?  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:12):**  So we are still doubting how it will exactly the partnership look like we're trialing now  
**[0:37:18-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:18):**  with 15 farmers.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:21):**  But first of all, the biggest challenges irrigation, those are the highest investments, especially  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:24):**  in the dry areas in Zambia, you have to if you want to do anything you need to have water.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:29):**  We believe a lot in local markets, Zambia center of Africa.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:32):**  So exporting wise doesn't make sense.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:34):**  But there's a huge regional markets cross border trades also in the informal markets,  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:39):**  shortages of a lot of crops during different times of year for crops, I have to say products,  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:44):**  vegetables, fruits.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:46):**  And that mixture provides actually a good market to absorb the variety of projects a  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:51):**  regenerative system brings.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:53):**  So yeah, it's partnering up with them.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:55):**  And then that will go slowly.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:37:56):**  So first of all, it's the problem with irrigation, if you do it in different locations, it's  
**[0:38:01-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:01):**  super expensive.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:02):**  So the bigger area you irrigate, the cheaper it is.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:05):**  So we try to bring some of the best together, we start obviously in a sector where there's  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:09):**  already a lot of good ones.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:10):**  So you know, you don't have to move people whatsoever.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:13):**  And we're gonna just try to build a perfect business with several of those business models  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:18):**  stacked on top.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:19):**  You know, what you've seen in other of your interviews, they mentioned it as well, you  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:22):**  know, region agree, it's also a couple of business models on top of each other to absorb  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:26):**  that diversity.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:28):**  And from there, selling to the into the regional markets and try to hit specific prices when  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:34):**  they are high.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:35):**  And when the shortages of the market then try to bring in your produce, that's a high  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:39):**  level of the business model, there's much more to it.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:42):**  But I think it also shows a bit of the transition we have made to, you know, you've started  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:48):**  as an impact company, so you first look at impact.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:50):**  And I think over time, have to make more and more commercial choices also linking, you  
**[0:38:56-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:56):**  know, we started in the most degraded area.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:38:58):**  So with our original model, setting up these companies for stretch, it's from scratch,  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:04):**  same thing happens, you know, we say, rather than doing it from scratch in the most degraded  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:09):**  area, as often say, yeah, you start a car dealer on an island where there's no roads,  
**[0:39:12-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:12):**  it's super difficult.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:13):**  But moving more into to finding other entrepreneurs in Africa that already taken some steps where  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:20):**  our support and our lessons are have some value.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:23):**  So our previous companies and the company still in portfolio like Zambia, and let's  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:27):**  say, grounded as it was, so it was grounded, where, you know, we build company from scratch  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:33):**  to support the transition of wider landscape.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:36):**  But for us as an agri company to succeed, we need also a lot more businesses in our  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:41):**  portfolio that are more viable can go faster.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:44):**  And I think we've learned to play this game in the toughest, the worst pitches around  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:49):**  the world.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:50):**  So this I think there might be some value in what we've learned and that we can also  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:54):**  play the game in the better pitch that we also will do a better job.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:39:58):**  So one of the examples there is an amazing Tanzanian spies entrepreneur together with  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:03):**  a Dutch spice trader.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:04):**  They joined forces, they set up a company in Tanzania, sourcing from small farmers,  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:09):**  I think in the first year, they got a half a million euro revenue, which is observed.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:14):**  But now they need to raise investment, they have been inspired by everything they've seen.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:19):**  That's another thing over the last couple of years, great work to hold a community because  
**[0:40:23-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:23):**  the movement that is being built is amazing.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:26):**  Even you know, a spice trader whole life in spices 60 years old has seen it as inspiring  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:31):**  to say, I want to set my company up or our company up in a way that is impacting these  
**[0:40:35-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:35):**  farmers in these mountain forests.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:38):**  How can we do that?  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:39):**  So yeah, and by accident, you find each other not by accident, we went through a whole pipeline  
**[0:40:44-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:44):**  process.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:45):**  But this is one that's gonna...  
**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:46):**  It feels a bit like by accident.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:48):**  You sometimes you force your accidents to happen so often.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:52):**  But you come across these two persons that are perfect match, but they are spice persons,  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:40:59):**  but never have written a business plan or secured external funds.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:04):**  Never worked with small farmers and see how they could be served, what packages for what  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:09):**  farmers are region every team in grounded can already help them with combating some  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:15):**  of the basic pest problems, which turn out to be sometimes just a timing of irrigation  
**[0:41:20-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:20):**  problem.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:22):**  So there's a lot of overlap.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:24):**  And the best thing is they like that we've made so many mistakes.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:28):**  I think that is what resonates between us and many other entrepreneurs.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:32):**  And I think we will be able to get more of these starting businesses to get them to an  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:36):**  investment ready stage with our package, with our support in grounded that we've built over  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:41):**  time.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:42):**  So that's, you know, even the traditional model of grounded is still there.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:46):**  But even that has changed over the last couple of years a lot.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:50):**  And then what would you be doing with this company in Tanzania?  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:54):**  Basically you're providing support, you help with the business plan, potentially help raising  
**[0:41:57-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:57):**  funds where you step in as well.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:41:59):**  How would that partnership look like?  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:01):**  Yeah, so this is like the full on model, or what we call optical model, where we try to  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:06):**  raise capital, preferably been the finance, blended also to improve the sourcing and do  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:12):**  some pilots with a different type of farmers.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:14):**  So how do you support your different again, there's a different type of suppliers, how  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:19):**  do you support each of them in the best way, and also investment capital, working capital,  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:23):**  better processing.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:25):**  The great thing about this is Tanzania is organic by default, so all the farmers organic  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:29):**  first farmers will be certified organic.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:32):**  And they have quite a good quality, but that quality is lost now in the processing.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:37):**  So and they make big steps short term.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:40):**  A lot of other suppliers in the world are struggling because you change the regulation,  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:45):**  so you can't use so much pesticide anymore, which is a big problem in spices, you dry  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:49):**  them, you know, only 20% of the volume is left.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:52):**  So you see any pesticide residue.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:53):**  So I know for crops, the EU sometimes have to pass them.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:42:58):**  Otherwise, we wouldn't even have those spices, but just because they can't source them somewhere  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:02):**  else.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:03):**  So Tanzania has a great opportunity in all these organic farmers to step in there.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:07):**  And it's our role to bring that all together and to support them telling them story, go  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:13):**  out to go out to the investor network so that they can focus on selling these spices focus  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:18):**  on improving production.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:19):**  And there's so much work that has to be done for this company, you know, both to scale  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:24):**  to grow but also to leverage its capacity to have such an amazing impact in Tanzania  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:29):**  and to nurture that organic farms that are down and try to, you know, it can go into  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:35):**  different directions, you can clear forest and put spices there, but you spices do very  
**[0:43:39-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:39):**  well on the canopy, they do very well agroforestry.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:42):**  So can we use this company to, again, transfer some of the maize fields into more of an agroforestry  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:48):**  spices?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:49):**  And this is not something that will happen, you know, the coming half a year, but if you  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:52):**  do it well, and you support your farmers, well, I think that over a period of five to  
**[0:43:57-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:43:57):**  10 years, Tanzania can have an amazing spice industry and leverage that industry so that  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:04):**  you create great mixed zones, if they call it in common land in some of those areas.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:09):**  Yeah, and I want to be conscious of your time as well.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:12):**  And I think there's a lot to discuss here and a lot to unpack.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:15):**  And I would definitely be checking in a bit earlier than four years after to see how the  
**[0:44:20-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:20):**  different landscapes are evolving.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:22):**  But to end with a number of questions I always like to ask to start, I mean, you could both  
**[0:44:26-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:26):**  look at that or one of you can answer and I really thought up to you.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:29):**  But what if you would be in charge of a $1 billion investment fund tomorrow morning?  
**[0:44:34-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:34):**  What would you prioritize?  
**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:36):**  Where would you dive into?  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:37):**  What would be your first investments?  
**[0:44:39-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:39):**  And what would be your framework basically of making those decisions?  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:42):**  Well, very biased and, you know, obviously a bit of what we see is need, but there's  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:47):**  a huge finance gap when it comes to Africa with small role as a means in general, whether  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:53):**  it's for small to large farmers or small agribusinesses.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:44:56):**  We see a lot of very small and a couple of very big and that's where finance need to  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:01):**  be leveraged for.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:03):**  And it's high risk, but I think a strong segment of medium sized companies is critical.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:10):**  So that is a big one for me at least.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:13):**  And also a bit of personal passion.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:15):**  Maybe if I can add, I think maybe also like following onto our conversation, I think there's  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:20):**  a huge gap in the sort of maybe call it like midstream.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:23):**  So in the between the farmers and the brands, the infrastructure, the pipeline foods, but  
**[0:45:31-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:31):**  then built in Africa.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:34):**  So to have, you know, processing facilities, transport, storage, all of that, like to actually  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:40):**  get the produce from the producers to the markets.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:43):**  I think that's also a big gap.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:45):**  Otherwise I would just invest it actually in growing grounded.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:48):**  I think if we have 1 billion, we can become really big.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:52):**  So we can just invest it in all that we just spoke about.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:55):**  Don't go too big too fast.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:57):**  You learn about that.  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:58):**  No, I know.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:45:59):**  We would put something on the bank account, like we said, I think the previous time when  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:03):**  you asked it and then we would just go slowly.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:05):**  And I've asked that before, but what if you could change one thing because it has changed  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:09):**  actually your answer.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:10):**  You have a magic wand, you have a magic power.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:12):**  I would ask it to both of you.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:13):**  What would you overnight change tomorrow morning in the food and agricultural landscape sector?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:18):**  But of course you can do say something about renewable energy as well if you want to.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:23):**  What would you use your magic power for if you had one wish that you could change?  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:26):**  Yeah, I think for us something that we've realized, which would be amazing if it could  
**[0:46:31-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:31):**  be changed is if this may sign strain, but if not all the consumer products would taste  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:38):**  the same.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:39):**  So if you can actually sort of taste where it comes from, not only in wine, but also  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:45):**  in, I don't know, mayonnaise or well maybe that's well, okay.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:50):**  The X might actually taste different every time or in a soap that you use because this  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:46:55):**  will actually allow for maybe more diversity and quality coming from these landscapes instead  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:01):**  of everything having to be blended and further processed into products that can then taste  
**[0:47:07-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:07):**  uniform.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:08):**  The butter changes through the season, but that's only a few products probably have that  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:13):**  at the moment.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:14):**  I mean, wine is the prime example.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:16):**  Everything else has to taste the same unless you buy it almost straight from the source  
**[0:47:20-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:20):**  or very artisanal, but everything in the supermarket has to be always exactly the same.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:25):**  And in wine you celebrate the fact that it's different every time and you know where it  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:29):**  comes from, which is fantastic.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:31):**  I mean, they did that brilliantly.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:33):**  I think the wine industry like well done for them, but I think many more industries should  
**[0:47:37-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:37):**  actually be doing that because it allows for traceability, the story of the farm.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:43):**  Then you celebrate the diversity instead of being like, Oh no, this is actually wrong.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:48):**  Punishing it.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:50):**  And the seasons you celebrate are the years, the events that influence taste from year  
**[0:47:53-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:53):**  to year.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:54):**  So I think that's also a big one.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:47:56):**  Now the wholesale industry is trying to put it all on one heap, try to make the same product  
**[0:48:01-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:01):**  every year.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:02):**  Whereas in wine, we accept that the one year, your Barolo wine in maybe in Italy, you know,  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:10):**  this good years, bad years, the good years are more expensive.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:13):**  So you know, we can drink a Barolo, but maybe not out of that certain years, but that's  
**[0:48:19-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:19):**  also, you know, accepting a more natural vibe to it and accepting that natural change and  
**[0:48:26-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:26):**  also enjoying that difference.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:28):**  Yeah, that would be, I mean, we've talked about it before, but it would be, it comes  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:32):**  down to taste and it comes down to not blending probably too much and letting, letting a taste  
**[0:48:37-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:37):**  speak for itself sort of, but it's a, it seems to be starting like in chocolate and in coffee  
**[0:48:42-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:42):**  and in some bean to bar or like the single origin coffees, et cetera, seems to be starting  
**[0:48:48-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:48):**  in other places as well, or actually on its way already in certain very niche segments,  
**[0:48:53-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:53):**  but we need it also in tomatoes and we need it in Rosemary and we need it basically everywhere.  
**[0:48:58-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:58):**  Exactly.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:48:59):**  So final question, what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that  
**[0:49:03-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:03):**  others don't?  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:04):**  I mean, we have hit a few actually already.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:06):**  This question is definitely inspired by John Kemp, but I'm very curious about your answer.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:10):**  I would say, and it could also be an answer to your last question.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:14):**  It is difficult to get through the transition.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:17):**  It is super hard.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:18):**  And I think if we all keep on voicing, you know, the benefits, the end system is amazing.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:24):**  We believe in all the benefits it brings for nature, for people, but that transition is  
**[0:49:27-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:27):**  hard.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:28):**  And I think if we don't acknowledge the difficulties, the hurdles, if we, if everybody sees it as  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:34):**  that it's easy, maybe for some of them it feels easy, but I know for many of the farmers  
**[0:49:38-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:38):**  that actually have to do it to do their skill, then I think we have to acknowledge that and  
**[0:49:45-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:45):**  be open and transparent about it.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:47):**  Because if we not, we will lose a lot of farmers and we will lose a lot, in your case, very  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:53):**  important here, investors that might say, okay, I've tried two times.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:57):**  It doesn't deliver.  
**[0:49:58-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:58):**  I haven't seen the results.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:49:59):**  So I'm out, I've done it, a sealed deal.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:02):**  This doesn't work.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:03):**  And that's what I think we have to be careful for.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:06):**  You have to manage expectations.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:09):**  And I think we've been very privileged as grounded to have partners that were always  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:15):**  supporting us in our mistakes.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:16):**  So they encourage us to make mistakes and encourage us to be open about those mistakes.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:22):**  And that has allowed us to get through stages that I don't think are impossible to get  
**[0:50:29-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:29):**  through.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:30):**  If you see some of the mistakes we've made, it's just, and that has to do also with the  
**[0:50:33-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:33):**  type of support we have had from every organization involved.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:37):**  For example, like Commonlands, you know, never giving up on us.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:40):**  And even the more mistakes we made, the stronger they like to, it felt they were supporting  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:45):**  us, maybe because they felt we needed it.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:47):**  But that's, I think, something to be scared for your survival.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:51):**  And I think you want that for a lot of organizations, also for farmers to feel that support to get  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:56):**  through these hurdles.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:50:57):**  And yeah, if we can get to that and if everybody can do that, then I think we can deliver on  
**[0:51:02-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:02):**  the impact the region agrees, pays, promises.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:06):**  I also feel like the industry can benefit from a, because it's like new, it's also understandable  
**[0:51:11-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:11):**  that everybody who's in it is like trying to say like, this is fantastic.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:15):**  Everybody should do this, you know, please start with a hundred hectares.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:18):**  Yeah, go.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:20):**  And you would expect from, I think, a very new field that's also trying to sort of fight  
**[0:51:24-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:24):**  its way in, in a like a super well established and well oiled, very powerful system.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:33):**  But in order for us to now really take it to scale this movement, we need to make sure  
**[0:51:38-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:38):**  that together we learn and we don't get stuck in the saying, this is fantastic and only  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:44):**  showing photos of landscapes that went from brown to green, basically.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:50):**  We need to also show like maybe more the nuances and the things which are hard and thinking  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:51:55):**  about how we can overcome those because I think that's how we can really now take sort  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:00):**  of the next step in this field.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:01):**  Because I also believe it's a solution for many things, but it's not a solution that  
**[0:52:06-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:06):**  comes easily.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:08):**  You know, you need to work.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:10):**  I think it's a perfect end to this interview.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:13):**  Thank you so much for your time, for your openness and sharing.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:16):**  I will link below to the blog post you've written where there's a lot more info, a lot  
**[0:52:20-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:20):**  more lessons learned, a lot more mistakes made.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:24):**  And I'm looking forward to the next one to check in, to see the progress, to talk about  
**[0:52:28-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:28):**  the mistakes and to share a lot of your journey, basically.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:31):**  Thank you so much, Koon.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:32):**  And we promise to don't stop making mistakes so we have enough to share next time.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers-2#t=0:52:36):**  Exactly.

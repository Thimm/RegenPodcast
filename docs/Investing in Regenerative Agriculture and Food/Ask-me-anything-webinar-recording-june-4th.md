**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:04-0:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:00:04):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:00:11):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:00:16):**  And we're on. So welcome to the, I think we're at the third Ask Me Anything webinar on investing in regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:00:25):**  I see some new faces, I see some familiar faces, so for everyone, welcome and great that you're here.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:00:31):**  Please make sure you're muted when you're not talking, not asking your question.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:00:37):**  We had a number of people asking questions beforehand through email, so I will be going through them first.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:00:43):**  But first of all, I noticed the first time we did this, there were quite some questions on what is regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:00:49-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:00:49):**  how is it defined, etc. So I prepared a very brief presentation for anybody that's already deep in the space.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:00:56):**  Sorry to go through that again, this won't be new to you, but for anybody that's completely new, I think it helps to set the stage of where we are.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:01:03):**  So I will be sharing my screen for just a second, we'll take a few minutes and then we'll get straight into the questions you have shared before.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:01:11):**  Obviously there's a lot of space for people to ask questions. We had a few beforehand, but we have definitely space.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:01:18):**  So just very briefly, this is the Ask Me Anything webinar, as you know, we are on Thursday.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:01:26):**  For those who signed up through other channels, LinkedIn, etc., I'm Kung von Sayen, I'm the host of the podcast,  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:01:32):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, which we've been running since 2016.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:01:37):**  I've been very interested in region ag since 2011, and basically I've been trying to follow the space and figuring out how to put money to work,  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:01:46):**  which makes sense for soil, farmer, investor, and obviously ecosystem, meaning all of us.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:01:52):**  So we've done a lot of interviews, some longer, some shorter. We're releasing now, actually since the last Ask Me Anything webinar, we're releasing one a week at the moment.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:02:00):**  Why? Very simply, there are too many interesting stories to tell. There are too many people, which is great, it's a great problem to have,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:02:07):**  too many people building interesting things, fund managers, entrepreneurial farmers, investors, scientists,  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:02:13):**  and we see the uptake also in terms of listening numbers, and so we're trying to accommodate to that.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:02:19):**  There's just, there's too much to share at the moment, so that's, which is a great and amazing problem to have,  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:02:24):**  and thank you all for, definitely for listening in and sharing the podcast, we see that happening a lot.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:02:30):**  You can find it if you haven't subscribed yet on any of your favorite podcast apps, or apps, depending where you're listening,  
**[0:02:37-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:02:37):**  if you cannot find it, please let us know, but we are in most of the main ones, and you can see quite some summaries,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:02:45):**  tech summaries, etc. on our website, which is investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:02:50):**  So what is regenerative agriculture? Which is a question we obviously get asked a lot, so it's a system of farming principles,  
**[0:02:57-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:02:57):**  and we get into that in a second, and practices that increase biodiversity, enriches soils, improves watersheds, and enhances ecosystem services.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:03:06):**  This is just one of the many definitions, and we're not going to spend an hour on if this is the right one or not,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:03:11):**  but I think it gives a good summary of at least what we're talking about.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:03:16):**  So it's not a set of tools, it's not a recipe that you can apply to any type of land, but it's a set of principles.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:03:24):**  And just to, very briefly to show the difference, what is the difference between regenerative sustainable, between organic, etc.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:03:32):**  I think it comes down to the question, is it building soil or not? You can actually find organic farming operations that are very sustainable,  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:03:40):**  you can find organic farming operations that are quite extractive, and you can find them that are regenerative.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:03:45):**  So I would always like to ask the question, is it building soil or not?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:03:49):**  And I think most of agriculture in general at the moment is extractive, some of it is sustainable, and even smaller percentage of that is regenerative.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:03:57):**  So it's not a certification, or at least not yet, maybe we never get there, maybe we don't want to, separate discussion.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:04):**  But I think the central theme is, is it building soil or not?  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:08):**  And I think that's a question you can ask if you're investing in this space, it's a question you can ask if you're buying from farmers.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:14):**  That discussion around soil, I think is the central piece, and it shows why it goes beyond sustainable.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:21):**  Just very briefly on the principles of RE-GENAC, again here we can probably have six or seven in some cases,  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:26):**  but I see these four being used very often, which is covering the soil.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:31):**  Soil should never be, or at least the most possible, uncovered, it should always be growing something.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:37):**  I like to compare it to a solar entrepreneur, I think to see farmers as solar entrepreneurs,  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:43):**  meaning they try to convert as much sunlight as possible into something useful.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:47):**  And that could be sugars for the soil, it could be a crop for us, it could be a cover crop, etc.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:52):**  And that also shows that if a soil is bare and is basically naked for six months a year,  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:57):**  you're losing the sunlight for six months a year.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:04:59):**  So you see regenerative farmers really going into a lot of effort to make sure they have as much service as possible,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:05):**  as many leaves, as many different plants to cover the soil and to absorb that sunlight.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:10):**  That gets into the second point, complex rotations in place and time, no monocultures or very little.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:16):**  So basically on the same year growing multiple crops in the same field,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:20):**  and also year after year doing very complex rotations.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:23):**  Sometimes I've seen farmers doing 10, 15 years, very different crops in the, basically a year after year.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:31):**  That obviously requires a lot of planning and figuring out in terms of harvesting as well.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:35):**  Very limited tilling or no tilling and soil disturbance,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:39):**  which means the big trackers with the big tilling ploughing equipment you see are something probably that they will park the first second.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:48):**  So the first, usually David Montgomery, one of the writers in the space starts with,  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:51):**  please leave the plough or stop ploughing, which is of course a shock to most farmers  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:05:56):**  because we've been taught that ploughing is the basis of a lot of things or at least the basis of the season.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:01):**  Then the fourth, there's a lot of discussion around it,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:03):**  but you see a lot of advanced regenerative farmers integrating animals at some point in the rotation we discussed before.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:10):**  So there could be different types of animals, could be beef or livestock.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:13):**  It could be a lot of different ways, but you see at some point there's a role of animals to build soil.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:20):**  There are very few examples where that's not the case.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:23):**  Doesn't mean it's not there, but there seems to be a role of animals to build soil at least faster than without.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:31):**  And I think if you want to dive deeper there, obviously the podcast you can take, there are a lot of books.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:35):**  These ones I find very interesting, Growing a Revolution of David Montgomery, which I mentioned before, Kiss the Ground.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:41):**  Both the organization and the book, honestly, they do a lot of good work.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:44):**  Dirt to Soil, very personal story of a farmer, Gabe Brown on YouTube.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:48):**  Richard Perkins, definitely interesting.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:50):**  And there are many other channels.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:52):**  And also Judith Swartz actually wrote some great books on the topic.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:06:58):**  And with that, I think we did a good introduction to the topic.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:07:06):**  And I would like to start with the first questions, which actually came from Lenny.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:07:11):**  And I will copy them into the chat.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:07:13):**  And you can also expand on them a bit, Lenny, if you want to.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:07:19):**  Let me put them in the chat first.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:07:21):**  So the first one wasn't really a question, actually, it was more a statement.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:07:25):**  Can you type them, actually?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:07:43):**  Because somehow my copy.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:07:48):**  Do you have them at hand, Lenny, because somehow my copy paste is refusing to cooperate?  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:07:59):**  It was too much.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:02):**  Sorry.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:03):**  It was too much.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:05):**  So your first question was too long, but I can summarize it.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:08):**  So basically you were asking on the organic matter as a good KPI.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:11):**  But your main point, I think there is, but please, please elaborate on that.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:16):**  There's not really a clear consensus yet of how to measure it, where to measure it.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:24):**  And you were basically asking for a group of experts or academia and professional backgrounds  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:29):**  to come together and compare these different projects.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:32):**  Is that correct?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:33):**  Or you want to elaborate?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:34):**  Exactly.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:35):**  I mean, we always talk about organic matter content as a good KPI.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:40):**  But for me, it's really important to also analyze others or to have other KPIs to measure  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:48):**  the impact of generative agriculture.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:52):**  Do we have social and environmental impact to measure the farm, generative farm?  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:08:59):**  So I think it's really important to work together and try to find out others' KPIs to  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:04):**  measure the impact of different projects.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:08):**  And just to give a bit of background, Lenny works at 123, which I interviewed a month  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:13):**  and a half ago, maybe, Oliver, on large scale agroforestry projects, mostly in central and  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:19):**  middle and South America.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:21):**  So they are obviously, I mean, soil health is relevant, but social is just as everywhere  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:26):**  extremely relevant as well.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:28):**  Yeah, I don't, I mean, I wish I knew an easy answer for that.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:31):**  I think I hear soil health and, or soil organic matter as a good proxy for a lot of things,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:39):**  but definitely not the perfect answer.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:42):**  And in the impact investing space and just putting on my other hats there, it's extremely  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:47):**  difficult to measure anything social, obviously.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:50):**  And there's not an easy answer to how do you measure the positive impact beyond, OK, this  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:09:59):**  forest is growing or the soil is growing of this forest project.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:04):**  What is the positive impact in the larger community, the larger watershed it's in, the  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:07):**  larger interaction with the nearby city, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:10):**  And I think you're actually, your impact report is doing a very interesting try in that.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:18):**  And I know you're working very hard on that, but you're not satisfied with the results  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:22):**  so far.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:23):**  You want to do more.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:24):**  So I think it would be good to, if we've seen examples, I think that's the best thing for  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:30):**  the investors in the space and the people in the space, especially in agroforestry, if  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:33):**  you've seen examples of good impact measurement and metrics for maybe specifically agroforestry,  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:39):**  it would be great if you can put that in the chat or reach out to me after I can send them  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:42):**  to Lenny.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:43):**  I don't have an easy answer for that.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:46):**  On your second question, what about the 10% a year, which a lot of institutional investors  
**[0:10:51-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:51):**  return.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:51):**  We're talking about return here, financial return.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:53):**  A lot of institutional investors, and you have a very large institutional investor on  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:10:58):**  board are expecting.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:01):**  I think from what I've seen now, it's definitely possible to do good returns.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:05):**  And I'm saying good here with a reason in regenerative agriculture, but there is a debt  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:11):**  to pay as well in the sense that we've been extractive for so long that the more you take  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:16):**  out, obviously the earlier, the longer it takes for a system to recover or to become,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:22):**  let's say, very alive and for soil to become very alive or a forest.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:25):**  If you buy a very degraded forest project and it takes a while before that comes back  
**[0:11:30-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:30):**  to life.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:30):**  So I think it depends what you need.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:32):**  If you need liquidity and return fast, in some cases you can, but it probably hurts  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:38):**  the speed of your regeneration and it probably hurts the length as well.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:43):**  If you don't have to take returns for 10 years, obviously you have a lot more flexibility  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:47):**  to do.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:48):**  And I remember one of the quotes of Sally Cowen, who was an investor I had on podcast  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:54):**  or is an investor a long time ago.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:11:56):**  And actually she came back with Esther Park for the series with Transition Finance and  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:00):**  she said, I'm convinced we can do double digit returns in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:04):**  It's just that we've been using extractive agriculture for so long that we don't know  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:09):**  how deep the J curve is and we don't know how long it's going to be.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:12):**  So we have quite a big debt to pay in terms of soil organic matter, in terms of social  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:17):**  in terms of many, many other places in our land use.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:21):**  And so maybe in some projects it's possible to do an easy 10%, but I mean, you're taking  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:27):**  biomass out of a system because you have to pay for the returns, which means that it's  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:33):**  going to slow down something or maybe even hurt something on the long run.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:37):**  So it really depends on what we need.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:38):**  And I think there's a lot of education there needed to invest or we as a space should probably  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:45):**  do a lot of that.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:46):**  It takes time to restore a degraded landscape.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:50):**  And there are returns in biomass, in non-financial return.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:53):**  There are a lot of ways to do the accounting here obviously, and we should.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:12:59):**  But if somebody promised you a 20% return in regenerative agriculture, I would ask a  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:03):**  lot of questions about that because it means something is losing out, I think.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:07):**  And so it's an education piece we definitely need to do in terms of flexibility because  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:13):**  there could be bad years in terms of time and something that comes back in a lot of  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:18):**  discussions in the podcast.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:20):**  Time, time, time.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:21):**  This takes time.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:22):**  Things can move very quickly, but the best things happen over time.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:27):**  And then you had a final question.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:29):**  How do we go from small scale to large scale?  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:32):**  And do we lose something when we do that?  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:34):**  Basically the scale up.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:35):**  I think that's the summary.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:37):**  I think we're at exactly that point.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:39):**  We see amazing small scale examples in agroforestry.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:42):**  I mean, where you're at in grain operations, relatively big, but still small in many other  
**[0:13:47-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:47):**  places.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:48):**  How do we get that to 10, 20, 50 times the scale?  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:52):**  And I think it's more about repeatability than scalability.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:56):**  But are we losing something there?  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:57):**  Do we need new machinery?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:13:59):**  Are we losing the attention?  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:00):**  If somebody does a one hectare permaculture garden, obviously he or she has the attention  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:04):**  to almost see every single plant every day if they wanted to.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:07):**  If you do a 20 hectare, you start to lose that, but you have a lot more impact in terms  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:12):**  of water, in terms of climate, et cetera.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:13):**  So I think we're at exactly the attention.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:15):**  I don't know yet.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:16):**  My feeling is we lose something when we scale and repeat.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:21):**  But I haven't seen amazing data on that yet.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:24):**  I haven't seen centropic farming done on huge scale and to compare that to 10 smaller  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:29):**  projects.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:30):**  I don't know.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:31):**  I think permaculture is at that space where they're starting to think about scale.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:35):**  I think we're at a lot of relatively small scale examples.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:39):**  And we're now getting that phase of, OK, what does it mean to do this 10 times or 20 times  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:43):**  or 100 times or maybe 100,000 times?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:46):**  And that's going to be a discovery.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:49):**  So I don't know if the agroforestry space is maybe more developed because obviously  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:53):**  you're involved in very big ones, but still small compared to some of your other players  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:58):**  maybe.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:14:59):**  So do you feel like you're losing something when the scale happens?  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:04):**  Sorry to put you on the spot.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:05):**  Yeah, I mean, the agroforestry system are not so complex as the traditional ones from  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:12):**  the small farmers.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:13):**  But it's always a balance between complexity and large scale agroforestry systems.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:20):**  You have to find a balance between complexity and large scale.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:28):**  No, absolutely.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:30):**  And just to, OK, I see another question.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:32):**  I will go back to some of the questions we had before, but I will try to answer a few  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:35):**  in the chat now.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:38):**  Franciane, you're asking on the current restraints to that kind of design, which kind of designer  
**[0:15:43-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:43):**  you're referring to.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:45):**  You're on mute.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:46):**  Yeah, it was a comment on the question actually, like what's the question is how can we scale  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:54):**  up?  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:55):**  So I wonder what is the difficulty there?  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:15:59):**  In terms of agroforestry systems.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:02):**  Well, yeah.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:05):**  I think the difficulty, I don't know the difficulty at the moment in terms of scaling up.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:10):**  What's the what's your pain point?  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:13):**  I mean, is the limitation, is it real?  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:16):**  Do we know that or is it an assumption that it's going to be hard?  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:21):**  I mean, we have to find markets for different products.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:24):**  So if so, we have to find a market and it's always difficult to to sell different products  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:31):**  and I mean, for me, it's a lot about knowledge.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:34):**  We need to know a lot about each crop to be able to be resilient and to be profitable.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:41):**  So for me, it's a lot about knowledge and it's not it's difficult to to find markets  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:48):**  for different local products, local native trees in the agroforestry systems.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:16:55):**  Yeah, aside from the cacao and the main product or the cash crop in the system just between  
**[0:17:01-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:01):**  between markets there.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:01):**  Because that changes your question quite a bit already, I think.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:06):**  It makes the how I think it comes back to an interesting point that also keeps coming  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:12):**  back to how do you buy the whole rotation?  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:13):**  In this case, obviously, it's not a rotation.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:15):**  It's the whole system.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:16):**  But it's it's sort of the same.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:18):**  How do we not just focus on the one type of grain or the one in this case, the cacao and  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:23):**  the one and there are I mean, then Barbara writes about it and obviously does it in his  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:28):**  did it in this restaurant.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:30):**  So it's not close.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:30):**  But that's a strong question.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:33):**  Like, how do you buy the cover crops or how do you market the other ones?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:36):**  They're not fancy ones in a system to a scale or to a size that you can market.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:42):**  Obviously, it depends if you're selling directly to the end consumer or you have to go through  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:47):**  a very complex value chain like with cacao that ends up somewhere in a very complex chain.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:52):**  It ends up somewhere in a chocolate bar in in North America or somewhere else.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:17:57):**  But how do we buy the whole rotation or the whole and the crops that come out of a system  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:03):**  that are marketable?  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:04):**  Obviously, yeah, that's a very good question.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:09):**  I see a comment of phenomena.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:10):**  CSA's don't need a 10% return.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:12):**  Obviously, that's true of them.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:13):**  And at the moment you change the ownership structure and return becomes a different thing  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:18):**  because maybe the land doesn't need to exit or the system on top just needs to provide  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:24):**  the food in this case as a CSA.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:26):**  And you get a whole different discussion.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:28):**  In this case, it was specifically on a large institutional investors that start to become  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:33):**  more interested in this space but have obviously different requirements.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:36):**  And maybe they need to change.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:38):**  Probably they need to change partly and maybe the sector partly like the truth might be  
**[0:18:42-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:42):**  somewhere in the middle.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:44):**  From the end, we need more people in the land.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:46):**  Absolutely, I think, which is what we see in any advanced regenerative farm.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:53):**  There's more hands needed, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:18:56):**  And many of these systems, they are luckily better paid and sometimes well paid compared  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:02):**  to the current agriculture system.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:07):**  And I will just put in the next set of questions.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:12):**  And I will go back to the other ones.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:14):**  But I want to make sure we get to the ones that Tom actually sent.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:18):**  I don't know if Tom's on the line because I cannot see everybody.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:21):**  Let me just quickly screen.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:22):**  I don't think he is.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:24):**  He asked some very specific questions, which I don't know if anybody in the audience knows.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:29):**  But is anybody tracking the growth of regenerative agriculture globally?  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:33):**  Like how many hectares or acres on the management?  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:35):**  Is anybody measuring that in terms of maybe through satellite, et cetera?  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:40):**  Because he's involved with the project.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:41):**  He heads the EPIC Institute in the US.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:45):**  And they are involved.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:46):**  They're trying to figure out, can we see how big it is at the moment?  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:50):**  How big it could be?  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:52):**  Or what is the growth year over year?  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:54):**  What are we talking about?  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:55):**  We hear a lot of buzz.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:19:56):**  But at the end of the day, it's about hectares and acres that are changing.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:02):**  And I don't know.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:04):**  They are looking at some satellite solutions which are quite costly.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:06):**  And I suggested, I mean, there's obviously more data on the organic agriculture sector,  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:14):**  which is definitely not by all means regenerative.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:17):**  But at least it shows some steps in some directions.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:20):**  But also there's very little data, or at least for what I know.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:25):**  And he also asked, and you can see the second question, or the third question,  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:28):**  what are the countries best positioned or in poor position at the moment that are  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:33):**  basically growing or are having proper policies in place, et cetera?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:38):**  I don't know of anybody, maybe Stephanie actually, Stephanie Raizes on the call,  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:42):**  knows of anybody that is tracking the growth of this sector, which would be great.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:47):**  I mean, I think as a sector, we would all like to see like, okay, wow, Spain is really  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:51):**  doing amazing things because they grew the hectares on the management.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:20:55):**  We have some ideas of no-till, but as we all know, that's nearly not enough.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:00):**  Stephanie is tracking it.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:01):**  It's a long answer.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:02):**  Okay.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:03):**  Maybe you can share it and I can share it in the follow-up.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:06):**  And we put it on the website where we host the...  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:09):**  Where we host it.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:10):**  Perfect.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:10):**  I will get in touch with you, Stephanie.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:12):**  And so that's Tom.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:14):**  Those were Tom's questions.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:15):**  I would just make sure we go back and I don't miss anyone.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:22):**  Indigenous land, Karen, that mirrored the scale.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:27):**  What do you mean by mirror in this case?  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:29):**  Sorry, it was just a comment in terms of that scale up.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:35):**  In some landscapes, where you've had a long history of Indigenous peoples on the management  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:43):**  systems, they're, depending upon the system, they're working within a regenerative capacity  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:50):**  over the last few years.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:51):**  Well, several years they've gone into more intensification and therefore you can...  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:21:59):**  That's as near to scale up, I think, on the regenerative that we might have that will  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:05):**  give us the level of insight.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:07):**  And I think it also goes back, I don't know, to the kind of monitoring is very interesting.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:13):**  It's very diverse.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:15):**  But it's also quite difficult to differentiate from satellite imagery, unless you're looking  
**[0:22:22-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:22):**  at LIDAR and high resolution stuff, to be able to differentiate kind of regenerative  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:29):**  agriculture and kind of, you know, your agroforestry system to your secondary forest, to your kind  
**[0:22:36-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:36):**  of semi-federal, you know, the kind of, you know, the kind of, you know, the kind of,  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:44):**  semi-Indigenous kind of traditional land use system.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:50):**  So, and as long as you're kind of incorporating all of that complexity into it, it makes it  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:56):**  very hard to know what your starting point was.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:22:59):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:00):**  I mean, what is, what was the starting point?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:04):**  What is time zero when we start to discover more and more?  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:08):**  We've been managed, we as humanity have been managing a lot of landscapes for way longer  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:12):**  than we thought, and we don't know what wild, and we're probably part of the wild part anyway,  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:18):**  we don't know what wild would look like, does look like, we don't have a comparison to,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:23):**  I don't know, the origin of the, yeah, T0 is very difficult.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:27):**  Plus we have no, I mean, we don't have an easy way to distinguish this is regenerative  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:33):**  or not, like you said.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:34):**  I mean, it's easy to track no-till probably from space because you can see it's barren  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:37):**  or not.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:38):**  But yeah, it gets way more complex.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:40):**  But I'm going to follow up with Stephanie to see what they are tracking and how they're  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:43):**  tracking it.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:44):**  Thank you for that.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:46):**  And just want to make sure I don't skip any other.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:52):**  Your book, yeah, I would definitely share Rosalie, I would definitely share the book  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:56):**  recommendations and the link.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:23:57):**  And I will, after this webinar, we put the recording online and basically I will go through  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:04):**  all the comments and make sure they're all there.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:06):**  Plus some extra interviews, et cetera, that link or that we have discussed or that might  
**[0:24:11-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:11):**  make sense.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:12):**  Strip cropping, Wilhelmina, which is actually a good point because we have another question  
**[0:24:16-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:16):**  about that.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:18):**  One second, Diego, because you're typing and I'm going to first put another question of  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:23):**  somebody that shared, actually Tim, that shared the question before.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:29):**  How do you look at strip cropping for arable farms?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:31):**  The yield biodiversity impacts are positive.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:33):**  What is stopping implementation at scale?  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:38):**  I don't know.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:39):**  I think that's the first.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:40):**  I haven't looked deep into strip cropping that, I mean, I think it comes back to the  
**[0:24:47-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:47):**  same question.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:47):**  Why is regenerative agriculture in general not scaling everywhere so fast?  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:52):**  Because you see in many cases very successful farmers doing it doesn't mean it's easy and  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:57):**  their neighbors not.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:24:58):**  Like it always baffles me why on the left side of the fence line, it's all green and  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:03):**  on the right it's not.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:04):**  I think it's a very complex question.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:07):**  There's a lot of peer pressure.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:08):**  We all have created a system, an agriculture system that's definitely not regenerative  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:13):**  and extractive.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:15):**  And for most farmers, they are, I wouldn't say stuck, but they're in a system that doesn't  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:21):**  get them to the regenerative part at all.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:23):**  And I don't think we can blame it on them.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:24):**  I think we can blame it on all of us that have played our part in that either by buying  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:28):**  the crop insurance, the subsidies, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:32):**  But that's why I'm very interested in the transition finance.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:34):**  Like how do we get farmers?  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:36):**  And it's not necessarily about the money, about the capital, but it's also about the  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:40):**  support, the peer support.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:41):**  People need to see, because farmers have 40 harvest usually in their lifetime.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:47):**  And why would they gamble two or three or four, maybe even five?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:50):**  That's a lot to gamble, especially with the margins that we have at the moment.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:55):**  So that's why the peer support is so crucial.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:25:57):**  The expert support, independent agronomic advice, which is something soil capital is  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:02):**  working on a lot.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:03):**  Like how do you make sure that the advisor that comes on the farm is not selling the  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:07):**  same chemicals?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:08):**  Because obviously then the advisor will sell you more of the same chemicals, which is logical.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:12):**  That's his or her incentive.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:13):**  But the best advisors you can get at the moment are Syngenta.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:16):**  Why?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:17):**  Because they're for free and they're the best take by Syngenta.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:19):**  So there's a lot to unpack there.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:22):**  And it's not just, okay, it's more profitable.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:24):**  Why is not everybody changing?  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:26):**  And I think, I don't know all the details obviously on strip cropping, but I think it  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:31):**  has to do with like, it needs a 360 approach.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:33):**  It needs to, a farmer needs support from peers.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:36):**  A farmer needs support from independent experts.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:38):**  A farmer needs access to markets.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:40):**  We need all of us willing to buy produce during the transition, after the transition, and  
**[0:26:45-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:45):**  have a guarantee for that.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:48):**  They need access to carbon markets, biodiversity markets, water markets.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:51):**  We've talked about that before.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:53):**  And then access to capital.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:26:55):**  But I think it's the third in access to experts and peer support, access to markets is probably  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:02):**  more important than access to capital.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:05):**  And that if we get those systems in place, well, we can help a lot more farmers that  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:10):**  want to go through the transition and really partner with them.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:13):**  I think that's key there as well.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:16):**  And I think in the strip cropping, that is the same as many other management changes,  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:21):**  because that's at the end what we're doing.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:24):**  Where does automation fit in transition towards regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:28):**  Really good question.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:29):**  I think there's a huge role for a lot of the tech we see, a lot of the fancy tech, the  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:33):**  robots, the drones, the self-driving tractors, et cetera, but always with an angle of how  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:39):**  does it build soil or how does it enable farmers to build soil?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:42):**  And I would urge any investor in the space to always ask that question to any fancy ag  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:48):**  tech company that you see, because you'll be surprised by the answer.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:51):**  There are definitely interesting companies out there, but very few are really connected  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:57):**  to the farming reality.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:27:58):**  Actually, they're very interesting companies out there because farmers started to build  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:01):**  things, because most farmers are very, let's say, very close to an inventor and they figure  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:07):**  out a lot of direct seeders, harvesters, et cetera, because they need things and the big  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:12):**  companies are building them.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:13):**  So I would actually go as close to the farmer as possible and see what's the real need there.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:18):**  I think there's going to be not only a lot more hands needed on the farm, like we said  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:23):**  before, but also a lot of interesting approaches of technology that we just haven't figured  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:28):**  out yet, both in agroforestry, actually, there's going to be a lot of development in  
**[0:28:32-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:32):**  Centropic.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:32):**  Maybe that answers some of the scale questions, probably not all, as always, technology is  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:36):**  a tool, just like finance.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:39):**  So that's going to be, it's going to be very interesting to see, but always with the  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:44):**  question, does it enable the farmer to build soil faster?  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:48):**  And I think if yes, very interesting.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:50):**  If not, I personally wouldn't be so interested in it.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:55):**  The labor shortages due to Corona, I hear very mixed stories there.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:28:59):**  I think that the large monoculture farms, I mean, admittedly now in the Netherlands,  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:04):**  the issues are there.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:05):**  I think in the UK as well, many European countries are facing the labor shortages.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:10):**  If you look at the regenerative mixed farms, in many cases they have around, like they  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:15):**  have a year round work, so they have that very, and they have a different relationship  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:19):**  with their labor.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:20):**  So that's a different issue if you have, let's say just a huge tomato operation and you need  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:25):**  to harvest the tomatoes in those four or five weeks or whatever the time is, you're going  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:30):**  to have a lot of issues this year.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:31):**  So there's going to be a lot of tension, I think this summer around labor shortages,  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:36):**  pushing people or asking people more hands to come back to the farm, but it's also the  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:40):**  type of work that we obviously didn't want to do anymore.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:43):**  And that's why we have labor shortages.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:44):**  And that's why we try to get illegal immigrants to do it under horrible circumstances.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:49):**  So I think this summer we're going to see at least in Europe, a lot of hopefully attention  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:52):**  for that.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:53):**  And hopefully also the attention for the other side.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:29:55):**  Like if you have a regenerative mixed farm, the labor part is very different or should  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:01):**  be very different and should be much more around the clock the whole year and not five,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:06):**  six weeks of basically, I mean, you can say it's slavery, tomato picking.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:11):**  And I think we're going to see a lot of scandal articles, et cetera.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:15):**  We saw that last year, but this year the spotlight is just going to be a lot stronger and a lot  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:19):**  of approaches to try to get people that lost their job due to Corona to obviously help  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:24):**  out.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:25):**  And there's going to be tension there as well because we're not used to very, very hard  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:29):**  physical labor.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:30):**  Which disease in large monoculture, very obviously chemical intensive.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:34):**  So it's not at all a fun place obviously to work.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:39):**  And we're going to see that for the first time because it's going to be in the news  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:42):**  and it's going to be in a lot of places that normal people like in the supermarkets, et  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:46):**  cetera.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:47):**  So I think it's a huge thing, especially, I don't know the US situation that well, but  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:51):**  I imagine it's not very different.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:53):**  And yeah, the fragility of the food system became very apparent.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:30:58):**  And it's not done yet.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:00):**  It will be over summer as a lot of crops need to be harvest.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:03):**  The desire for shortened supply chains.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:07):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:07):**  I see that exploding everywhere.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:09):**  Anybody that's selling directly to consumers will probably have witnessed that with I have  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:14):**  heard stories of thousand people on the waiting list.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:16):**  A boom that we've never seen in the shorter supply chain.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:22):**  At the same time, obviously people that sell or sold directly to restaurants and anything  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:26):**  hotels, et cetera, that market disappeared overnight.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:29):**  So it creates enormous tension for those farmers and for the others, it creates a boom basically.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:36):**  And for the processors as well, the small scale butchers in the US are already sold  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:41):**  out until the end of the year.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:42):**  And the large scales are all closing down because of Corona.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:45):**  So there's this huge divide suddenly between the markets and it creates a situation we've  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:51):**  never seen basically before.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:52):**  But for people that are selling, I say, real food to real people, this is a moment where  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:31:58):**  they do three year growth plan in three weeks and probably faster.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:03):**  And how much of that is going to stay?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:05):**  I don't know.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:06):**  But I've heard stories of people saying 10, 20% of this is already more than enough to  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:10):**  sell out for a while.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:11):**  And so it's creating a lot of opportunities and tension.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:16):**  I think that's the main one there.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:20):**  Martin is asking a question.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:22):**  I'm doing a project now for Avebe, which is a large potato factory, I think, in the Netherlands.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:27):**  Have you seen any regenerative potatoes farmers?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:30):**  And yes.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:31):**  And if yes, how do they farm regeneratively?  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:33):**  And the first part to the question is yes.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:36):**  And there's one in the Netherlands called Jeroen Klomp, which I will put in the show  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:41):**  notes after how they farm exactly regeneratively.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:44):**  I mean, there's a tension there between tillage and potatoes.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:47):**  Because you have to plant them underneath the soil.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:50):**  How they do it exactly, I would refer to them to explain their system.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:55):**  I hear, I think you came, where is Martin?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:32:59):**  Or not.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:00):**  Somebody unmuted.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:02):**  But anyway, so I will put that in the show notes.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:04):**  So there's also there, even with the harder crops, because you have to somehow disturb  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:08):**  the soil at least a bit.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:09):**  And there's definitely work being done on onions and tomatoes, on potatoes and potatoes.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:15):**  On potatoes and more.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:22):**  A question, Francine is asking, when we talked about two years ago, maybe it's even more,  
**[0:33:28-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:28):**  actually.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:29):**  Are investors interested in research?  
**[0:33:31-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:31):**  The practical, of course.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:32):**  And which is also a kind of investment.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:34):**  You're absolutely right.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:37):**  I think the short answer is yes.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:41):**  But it really depends how you ask.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:42):**  I just released an interview with John Lundchen, who is, or used to be one of the main scientists  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:50):**  of the USDA in the US.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:52):**  Left there because of a lot of discussion around chemicals and insects that he wanted  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:55):**  to publish and they didn't.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:56):**  And set up his own farm.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:33:59):**  And a research facility.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:00):**  And he said, I'm surprised how many private individuals are supporting our research while  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:06):**  we run a commercial farm as well.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:08):**  So he said every academic in the field of agriculture first has to become a farmer.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:13):**  And then we can talk about academia.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:15):**  And he is, I don't know exactly where he gets his funding from, but there are a number of  
**[0:34:21-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:21):**  foundations supporting their private individuals.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:23):**  And he was surprised how, I wouldn't say easy, but how he could get a number of his research  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:30):**  pieces, which are mostly focused on the profitability, the connection profitability and regenag.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:34):**  And how to get that funded.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:36):**  And these are multimillion dollar projects.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:38):**  They're not huge, but they are not small.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:41):**  And he has got funded for quite a few.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:45):**  Both by public programs, but also by private individuals.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:48):**  So there is some, at least in the US, very specific, obviously, but there's some interest,  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:53):**  especially from the foundation part or the investors that are taking a full portfolio  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:34:59):**  approach and are also including their grants in their approach.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:02):**  And one research piece on profitability in regenag in elements can change an element  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:10):**  industry in California enormously.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:12):**  And maybe that research piece costs one and a half million.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:15):**  That's a lot of impact you can have with a relatively small amount, obviously relative  
**[0:35:20-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:20):**  for depending on your size of your wallet.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:23):**  So there is some interest, but it really depends how you structure it and how you ask.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:28):**  And obviously to whom and which connections.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:30):**  And he's obviously well connected in the US, but he sounded surprised how he could actually  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:37):**  fund some of the research that he used to be doing with public money in the USDA.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:41):**  And I was doing on a commercial, his own commercial farm.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:48):**  Rosalie is asking, do I know any countries in Europe that give subsidies to regenerative  
**[0:35:53-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:53):**  farming and or for a sting?  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:55):**  I don't know.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:35:56):**  I deliberately chose to not go too much in policy and subsidies so far because it's very  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:06):**  context and country specific, which means that a lot of the listeners cannot relate  
**[0:36:10-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:10):**  to it.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:10):**  So I haven't been following it a lot.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:12):**  I know the EU is working on the farm to fork strategy and a biodiversity strategy, but  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:17):**  I don't know the details of it.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:18):**  So I will definitely put them in the show notes as well.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:21):**  I don't know specific countries that are actively supporting, let's say regenerative.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:27):**  I know some regions are supporting organic, but actively on soil.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:32):**  I think maybe Switzerland is doing something, but I don't know if that's there.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:39):**  And I see a response from Francian.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:41):**  Thank you to Lenny.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:44):**  We need a lot more pilots.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:45):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:46):**  I think there's an interesting spillover effect.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:49):**  She's actually not.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:50):**  I'll answer that when she's back.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:51):**  And the contact info.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:54):**  Yes, I will send that to you.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:55):**  You mean, I think of John Lundgren.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:56):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:36:57):**  I interviewed him and I will put both the interview, the website of the foundation and  
**[0:37:02-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:02):**  the website of the farm.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:03):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:04):**  Very nice guy as well.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:05):**  And interesting that he says by far the most interesting things happening now are happening  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:10):**  on forward thinking, very regenerative farms and farmers actually way more advanced than  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:17):**  all the university stuff I saw as a researcher.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:20):**  So it's actually, we need as researchers, obviously get out of the university, get out  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:24):**  of our pilot farms because they're not representing the reality.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:28):**  And they're doing things, these farmers are doing things that we didn't believe, we don't  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:31):**  believe that are possible in academia, which is very interesting.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:34):**  So the movement is so advanced that the farmers are way more advanced than the academia and  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:38):**  academia is trying to catch up.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:39):**  And obviously it's very difficult because this type of research is very, very difficult  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:44):**  because of very complex holistic systems.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:46):**  So I really enjoyed that discussion because he was, yeah, he left part of academia for  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:50):**  that because he couldn't research the pieces he wanted to research and research the farmers.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:37:55):**  So they basically did a big piece on grain, which is one of the only studies I could find  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:00):**  on profitability and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:03):**  And what they did is they found the most regenerative ones and compared them to their neighbors.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:07):**  Very simple, but nobody had done that before.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:09):**  And they now did the same or are doing the same in elements and in rangelands, so in  
**[0:38:13-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:13):**  livestock.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:13):**  But I will put them in the, so in a minute, just to answer to, it's not really a question,  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:20):**  but we need a lot more pilots to show farmers the benefits of region egg.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:23):**  I think absolutely true.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:25):**  You see this very nice spillover effect.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:27):**  There's actually a study in the US on organic farming.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:30):**  When one organic farm starts in a community, you can see a number of years later that there  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:35):**  are multiple around.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:36):**  Like you usually see this spillover, this oil, basically it's spreading.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:40):**  And that's because we need to see as humans that it works with the neighbor.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:44):**  We need to see that he or she doesn't fail, it doesn't go bankrupt, et cetera.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:48):**  And I think every other pilot, and you see that I had a discussion with the Perennial  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:53):**  Fund, who is setting up a transition finance facility for farmers, and they take that into  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:57):**  account.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:38:58):**  So the farmers they pick are, they try to pick the ones that are good communicators  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:03):**  as well, that are well connected in their area and their neighborhood.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:06):**  They don't pick the super gurus, which are the ones that are the ones that are the ones  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:10):**  that are the super gurus, which sometimes are not the best communicators in the space.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:14):**  And maybe in their community, they seem to be the weirdos.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:18):**  So they try to pick just the group behind that, that are well connected.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:22):**  Because if they are successful, they know it will spread through the community.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:25):**  So there's something very deliberate about where to put your energy in a community.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:30):**  And it really makes a difference depending on which farm goes first, basically, which  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:36):**  and how he or she is communicating about it.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:42):**  Jono Proudfoot is asking, thank you, by the way, for showing up, Jono.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:46):**  I was on Jono's live Facebook, I think it was two, three days ago.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:51):**  It feels like pages, but it was Tuesday.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:53):**  We had a very nice discussion on region egg, also partly in South Africa.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:39:57):**  Are there any stamps or, bless you, are there any stamps or certifications available for  
**[0:40:05-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:05):**  regenerative?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:06):**  For at the moment, no.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:09):**  I think there are two parts to that answer.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:10):**  One is that Patagonia, Dr. Bronner's and Rodeo in the US are working on the regenerative  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:15):**  organic certification.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:18):**  We can spend another hour on that if that's a good idea or not.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:21):**  But I'm very happy they're doing it, basically providing a plus on top of organic.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:25):**  So you have to be certified organic.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:27):**  And they go a few steps beyond that in terms of looking at social and regenerative, so  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:32):**  literally soil building.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:34):**  They're testing it now, piloting it around the world, not in Europe at the moment.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:38):**  And the first products are coming out with that label.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:40):**  So the short answer is actually yes, there are a few products.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:43):**  If that's the answer to everything, I don't know.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:47):**  There's the, let's say the jury is still out.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:50):**  On sort of a second route to that question is that they're actually in terms of livestock,  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:57):**  and we've discussed that actually in the interview.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:40:59):**  There are some organizations taking a slightly different route to certification.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:04):**  They're not looking at the soil.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:05):**  They're not looking at if the farmer is regenerative because of the principles.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:10):**  In this case, I'm going to interview next week the founders of Standard Soil, which  
**[0:41:15-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:15):**  already win the prize for the best name ever.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:17):**  But they released a beef brand where they looked at birds.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:23):**  Why?  
**[0:41:23-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:23):**  Because a lot more people care about birds than care about soil at the moment.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:26):**  And they found a very interesting correlation between ranchers that are very bird friendly,  
**[0:41:31-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:31):**  so that a huge diversity of birds and ranchers that were and are regenerative.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:36):**  And so they basically connected with a huge bird association in the US that already was  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:41):**  certifying farmers to be bird friendly.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:44):**  And basically they picked the most regenerative farmers out of there and started selling that  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:47):**  beef as a very, very high premium one.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:49):**  So they went around the question of how do we measure soil carbon?  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:52):**  And they basically saw and see birds as a proxy and as a literally bird in a coal mine,  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:41:58):**  obviously, because if there are no birds, the rancher cannot be regenerative.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:01):**  So that wasn't interesting.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:02):**  There's some people trying to go around that question.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:08):**  I hope that answers your...  
**[0:42:12-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:12):**  Oh, we went.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:14):**  We have the same, both in academia.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:16):**  Stephanie has some papers as well, which I will put in the show notes.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:23):**  Who has experience in the need for crop rotation?  
**[0:42:28-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:28):**  I think crop rotation is absolutely crucial or let's say complexity.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:34):**  Lenny was already mentioned that before as well.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:36):**  Complexity is very difficult to manage, obviously, but very crucial to soil.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:42):**  Biodiversity doesn't make it easier to harvest.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:45):**  I mean, if you're planting two or three types of grain, they're not ready at the same time.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:50):**  So you need completely different harvest equipment, but that also brings the inventor  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:42:56):**  basically in farmers that I know.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:00):**  The rotation, I mean, I think you're asking for trouble if you're planting the same crop  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:03):**  every year on the same piece of land, because you make it very, very easy for anything to  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:08):**  basically have a free dinner there.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:11):**  Can you list the trials that are going on in the show notes?  
**[0:43:14-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:14):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:14):**  I will do that.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:17):**  Can I break in on that?  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:18):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:20):**  Because I have seen some studies that show that if you leave out the crop rotation, you  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:30):**  have better results for the crop, for crops.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:33):**  Results in profitability or in yield?  
**[0:43:36-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:36):**  Probability and health, because the crop has to make a relationship with the soil, and  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:46):**  that needs some time.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:47):**  So if you rotate your crops every year, you miss out of that experience of the soil and  
**[0:43:56-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:56):**  plant interaction.  
**[0:43:58-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:58):**  And I've seen some studies.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:43:59):**  It's about wheat that was kept for four years on the same field.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:07):**  And next to it, there was another field with crop rotation in four years.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:11):**  And the wheat in the non-rotated was a lot better than on the other side.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:24):**  And I know someone who has his potatoes already for some 10 years on the same field.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:33):**  And it's very profitable.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:35):**  So maybe that's an idea to look at.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:40):**  No, absolutely.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:41):**  I think, first of all, there's a lot to discover.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:44):**  I don't know many examples of long rotations, of long non-rotations.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:50):**  But that doesn't mean it's not possible or not in a context specific or a site specific.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:54):**  It would be great if you can share the papers on that.  
**[0:44:57-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:57):**  So I can put them in the show notes.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:44:59):**  You can also email me on that.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:00):**  You don't have to put it in the show notes.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:05):**  That would be great.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:07):**  And then, let's see.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:10):**  I would definitely put that.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:12):**  I see Lenny responding to Francione.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:14):**  And then, actually, it's a very specific question from Daniel, who asked,  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:21):**  I don't know if anybody knows that.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:23):**  I'm looking for specific funds to invest in Massachusetts in the US.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:27):**  I thought it was the best place to ask it because we have a lot of people on the call,  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:29):**  especially in managed grazing of cattle.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:32):**  So if anybody knows anything about that, think about it.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:34):**  But definitely let me know.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:36):**  Just ping me an email.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:38):**  And I can get it in the show notes and send it to him as well.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:41):**  With that, I reached the end of the questions that were shared before.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:45:46):**  So I'm very happy to open it up for anybody that either wants to type or unmute themselves to ask something.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:04):**  And if not, oh.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:08):**  Ah, yeah, sorry, Diego.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:09):**  You're absolutely right.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:10):**  You were typing before, and then I was coming back to that.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:12):**  Let me see.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:14):**  Ah, there we are.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:16):**  What do you think about the efficient use of agrochemical recommended by the USDA,  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:22):**  not having the certification,  
**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:26):**  how to know what the acceptable uses of fossil-based inputs?  
**[0:46:31-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:31):**  That's a very difficult question.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:32):**  I think, I mean, what the acceptable use is, I think that's a social question we need to ask society in general.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:39):**  I think what I see from the most advanced farmers I know is that they're going either,  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:45):**  let's say, on a journey to zero, definitely not overnight, because obviously here it hurts your yields.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:51):**  Obviously, it really depends on the crop, where you are, et cetera.  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:46:54):**  But if you have been using a lot of fossil-based inputs for a long time, you're going to have to use them.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:00):**  Using a lot of fossil-based inputs for a long time, you go cold turkey, you might be into some shocks.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:07):**  I see a lot of people at the end wanting to phase out everything for different reasons.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:12):**  I mean, we see more and more research coming out in terms of the health impact,  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:16):**  and that obviously the input companies are claiming that's not there.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:20):**  But actually, we see a lot of research coming out now,  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:23):**  and don't be surprised over the next years to see a lot more of that, that it's not as safe as they claim.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:28):**  What's the optimal use? I don't know. It depends again on the place.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:34):**  I see, discussing with Soil Capital, mostly Nicolas was on the webinar recently,  
**[0:47:39-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:39):**  or was on the podcast recently, most farmers, very conventional farmers overuse a lot,  
**[0:47:45-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:45):**  and they are seeing mostly 30 plus percent, meaning that if you follow your non-independent  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:53):**  agronomic advisor, who's probably selling this stuff, you're probably overusing your cocktail anyway,  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:47:58):**  even if you're completely not interested in regenerative agricultural soil, etc.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:03):**  So there's a lot of space already there to reduce a lot if you optimize for your location, etc.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:10):**  Then you go to the John Lundgrens of this world where they say,  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:15):**  whatever the input companies have been selling, it's absolute nonsense.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:18):**  You can do without, etc., etc. The grain trials they did, the farmers that use insecticides  
**[0:48:26-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:26):**  had 10 times more pests in their fields than the non ones. So you see very different,  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:31):**  again, we're in a phase where we see a lot of claims that most of them sound too good to be  
**[0:48:36-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:36):**  true. Maybe some are, maybe some are not. But you see a lot of different ways, I think,  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:42):**  all of these farmers are pushing for a very input light model. Some cases you might need some inputs  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:47):**  for a while, but they are all in the transition that maybe in 10 or 15 years, a lot of the,  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:52):**  at least the chemical fossil fuel based inputs are no longer necessary. And then it depends on  
**[0:48:57-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:48:57):**  the consumer how fast they can go. Like if we want, as consumers, to go really fast, farmers  
**[0:49:02-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:02):**  can go really fast. If we can't, and we don't want to pay or invest or spend money on that,  
**[0:49:07-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:07):**  then we're pushing them to just do it on the margins they have, which means the transition  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:13):**  goes slower. So acceptable, it really depends. I think there's a lot of push for chemical  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:19):**  free products, which I don't think is going to go away, especially in the health crisis we're in  
**[0:49:24-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:24):**  now. I mean, there's going to be a lot more attention for whatever we're spraying. And we,  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:28):**  I say we, because we are all responsible for that. It's not something we pushed on farmers.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:33):**  It's not something we asked for, but it's something that's part of the system we created.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:37):**  So I don't know how efficient you can get and how much of the, even the efficient use of chemicals  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:44):**  is still hurting the soil life, which is something you're trying to rebuild as an regenerative  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:48):**  farmer. Probably in the transition, it can still play a role, but I would be very interested to  
**[0:49:54-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:49:54):**  see, okay, what is your long-term five, 10, 15 year plan and how can you get off very expensive  
**[0:50:00-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:50:00):**  inputs? Let's not forget most of the profit margin differences with a lot of these farmers come  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:50:04):**  partly from selling directly and partly from the inputs are very expensive and coming from  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:50:10):**  very far, very resource intensive as well, as you pointed out with your fossil fuel based ones.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:50:15):**  Was my position on the whole system CO2 balance, carbon sequestration in origin and carbon emission  
**[0:50:25-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:50:25):**  like crops and meat traveling from South Africa, South America to Asia? That's a very good question.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:50:30):**  I think the shipping around the world, I mean, traveling depends how you travel, obviously,  
**[0:50:36-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:50:36):**  and how intense that is. Flying crops around the world seems to be, I mean,  
**[0:50:42-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:50:42):**  not very possible at the moment, but makes something very, very, very energy intensive.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:50:49):**  And I think it comes back to the input question as well, like how much input was necessary to get  
**[0:50:53-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:50:53):**  that calorie on your plate and how much of that simply wasn't, like how much can we spend on that?  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:00):**  And probably there's going to be a lot of pressure from a lot of sectors to greatly reduce the amount  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:06):**  of emissions and input they use and thus the emissions. And for the most part, it's not  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:11):**  going to be a lot of energy, but it's going to be a lot of energy, and thus the emissions and food  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:16):**  and agriculture, shipping avocados around the world, because we want that. There's going to be  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:22):**  a lot of discussion around that. I think there's obviously a lot of potential for carbon  
**[0:51:26-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:26):**  sequestration. We're not there yet in terms of measurement in many cases, but the potential  
**[0:51:32-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:32):**  is there. But I think the potential is maybe even bigger in water storage or maybe even bigger in  
**[0:51:36-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:36):**  the stories, a lot bigger than carbon. But it's easy to, it's easy to communicate, easy to measure,  
**[0:51:42-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:42):**  easy to, it should be easy to measure. It's not. But the question is that if South America can  
**[0:51:48-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:48):**  stay the big production hub of soy meat, et cetera, I think has to do with a lot of different  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:51:56):**  factors. There's a very interesting report came out of, I'm thinking Planet Tracker.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:02):**  I interviewed Mark and Matt, and they looked very simply at Argentina and Brazil. Can they actually,  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:08):**  they need a lot of dollars to serve their loans they have with the IMF and others.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:12):**  They mostly paid through that through soy. The soy industry is, the soil underneath the soy  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:18):**  industry is suffering a lot. So where's the breaking point where, if that industry collapses,  
**[0:52:23-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:23):**  can Brazil still pay for its foreign debt? Things like that. I think you need to look at the  
**[0:52:27-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:27):**  holistic picture here, apart from the fact, the question, do we want to translate that  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:31):**  we want to transport meat from South America, very intensive meat or non-intensive meat to Asia or  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:38):**  not? And obviously there's a discussion on diet change there as well. Like how much animal protein  
**[0:52:44-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:44):**  can we actually sustain if we would farm regeneratively everywhere? Which is, I don't  
**[0:52:47-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:47):**  think a study anybody has done yet. We've done it. There's a study on Europe, actually, what kind of  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:54):**  diet change is needed plus a switch to regenerative agriculture by a French Institute, which is very  
**[0:52:59-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:52:59):**  interesting. And I will really try to remember to put that in the show notes. So that it's not an  
**[0:53:05-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:53:05):**  easy answer and I don't have a clear answer. I'm just going down because I see six new messages and  
**[0:53:12-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:53:12):**  we have four minutes. So that's going to be interesting. Andrew, thank you for sharing some.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:53:19):**  I will make sure to send that to Daniel. Trudy, what's your understanding of the potential of  
**[0:53:25-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:53:25):**  region ag for mitigating climate change? If you have to believe some of the headlines, it's  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:53:30):**  going to change everything overnight, which I always find very hard to believe.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:53:34):**  My recent answer to that question is, I think, whether we like it or not, it has to be part of  
**[0:53:42-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:53:42):**  it. Even if tomorrow we would stop releasing all carbon because we switched to renewable  
**[0:53:48-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:53:48):**  energy and we did a lot of other things, we still have an endless amount of ecosystems to restore,  
**[0:53:53-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:53:53):**  an endless amount of hectares and lands that are, as somebody of the Savory Institute said in the  
**[0:53:59-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:53:59):**  Nordics, underperforming landscapes or underperforming ecosystems, which I think is a  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:54:04):**  very nice term. So even if you don't believe in climate change, I don't think it's a belief. Even  
**[0:54:08-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:54:08):**  if you don't do it for that, if you don't do it for the nutrient density, et cetera, I don't think  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:54:14):**  we can escape the fact that agriculture has to fundamentally change and land use and forestry,  
**[0:54:20-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:54:20):**  and we'll have to grow a lot more life, biomass, food, oils and fibers in a much more regenerative  
**[0:54:29-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:54:29):**  way because we're literally running out of soil and we're seriously destabilizing the global  
**[0:54:35-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:54:35):**  climate because of land use change. And so if we like it or not, it's part of a much bigger  
**[0:54:40-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:54:40):**  picture than just the carbon discussion, I think. So I'm not too worried about that. Even if climate  
**[0:54:47-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:54:47):**  change would go away tomorrow, we invent the best fusion reactor ever invented, we still had to  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:54:54):**  restore 2 billion acres of degraded land. We still had to figure out a way to feed ourselves  
**[0:54:59-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:54:59):**  nutritionally, which we're not at the moment. So I think that's the potential is enormous,  
**[0:55:04-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:04):**  but I wouldn't only hinge it on that because if that happens, if we go into a period of global  
**[0:55:09-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:09):**  cooling, suddenly for whatever reason, we would lose our only argument we have for this, which  
**[0:55:13-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:13):**  I don't think is a very strong basis to build a global movement on. And what are good ways to make  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:22):**  region ag more common mainstream, how to attract more farmers and to make conventional farms?  
**[0:55:28-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:28):**  I think to the transition here, I talked about it briefly, and I think the, not to do a teaser,  
**[0:55:35-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:35):**  but there's a great interview coming up with the Perennial Fund where we talk about that.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:39):**  I think to make it mainstream, nutrient density is going to be very important,  
**[0:55:42-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:42):**  measuring nutrient density and showing that the connection, healthy soil, healthy produce,  
**[0:55:47-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:47):**  healthy gut system, and healthy people, which is not there yet, but coming and very interesting,  
**[0:55:53-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:53):**  scary, and revolutionary at the same time. So that part of it, more movies like The Biggest  
**[0:55:59-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:55:59):**  Little Farm, more farmers in general that are in their context doing this. I think that's the,  
**[0:56:05-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:56:05):**  because then we can see touch, you can see it locally, you know, it's not something that is  
**[0:56:09-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:56:09):**  done a thousand miles away, but actually done in your neighborhood. And for consumers to ask a lot  
**[0:56:14-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:56:14):**  more questions, is your farmer in your local farmer's market that you really think is amazing,  
**[0:56:18-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:56:18):**  is he or she actually building soil? And can you actually verify and can you show and can you see  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:56:23):**  that, et cetera. Just to be mindful of time, I see people logging off. Thank you so much for joining.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:56:29):**  I will answer a few more questions in the next couple of minutes, but if you have to run and  
**[0:56:34-0:56:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:56:34):**  jump off, thank you so much for sharing, asking questions, but I will stay on for a few more minutes  
**[0:56:39-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:56:39):**  to go through the last questions. Thank you. Will is asking, does using natural mind fertilizers  
**[0:56:50-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:56:50):**  such as rock and potassium chloride violate the spirit of Regen egg? I don't know. I really,  
**[0:56:56-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:56:56):**  I've known the terms, but I'm not a farmer and I would defer these questions to the experts.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:57:04):**  What do you think the demand for trade finance focused on the most ethical regenerative products,  
**[0:57:08-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:57:08):**  potentially emissions offsets included will, another Will is asking. Can you,  
**[0:57:16-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:57:16):**  I see you're still on, can you elaborate a bit on that Will?  
**[0:57:18-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:57:18):**  Hi, sorry. I've got a four year old behind me watching an airflix. So if you get some strange  
**[0:57:26-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:57:26):**  interference, that'll be her. I've just been talking to some people. I have a finance background  
**[0:57:32-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:57:32):**  and I'm focusing my attention on building a FinTech that enables transition finance at scale.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:57:39):**  I had some contact with some people recently. I'm trying to help with their trade finance  
**[0:57:44-0:57:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:57:44):**  proposition. And I said to them, well, why not make it very ESG, which was the term I used for  
**[0:57:51-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:57:51):**  them, but impact focused and enable those producers that are doing the best have much  
**[0:57:57-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:57:57):**  more efficient working capital. You can bring in investors who want to invest their cash  
**[0:58:03-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:58:03):**  safely, but in good causes. So instead of sitting in a money market fund, they put it in a something  
**[0:58:09-0:58:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:58:09):**  with much more meaning. And I think that's a really good question. I think that's a really  
**[0:58:14-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:58:14):**  good question, but I think that's a really good question. And I think that's a really good question.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:58:18):**  But there is also the issue of why can't the market actually have a great product produced  
**[0:58:26-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:58:26):**  in an appropriate country? Someone from IKEA was saying on a different call earlier today,  
**[0:58:32-0:58:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:58:32):**  but then you've got the emissions to bring it to where you are. So it is net, the best way to do it.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:58:37):**  The question is, do we think there's an interesting product there to go to the groups that are  
**[0:58:47-0:58:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:58:47):**  focused on regenerative organic, for example, in the US and say, how can we help bring cheaper,  
**[0:58:55-0:58:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:58:55):**  more farmer friendly finance to those sectors?  
**[0:58:59-0:59:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:58:59):**  I don't know the answer to that question.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:00):**  I'm about to try and help them find it.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:03):**  I wanted to put that to the group.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:04):**  I know there's some really smart, knowledgeable people on your calls, including yourself.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:08):**  I just wanted to put it out there.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:11):**  I think any farmer focused finance in terms of transition, transition finance is something  
**[0:59:20-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:20):**  where we need more of.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:22):**  There's very little appropriate finance available for farmers that want to transition, both  
**[0:59:28-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:28):**  in the global south and global north.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:30):**  We're just starting to figure out that that's a thing and we need to focus on that more.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:36):**  So I think the short answer is yes, but obviously farmer focused, the flex is not putting more  
**[0:59:42-0:59:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:42):**  depth on the farmers.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:44):**  But I think in terms of crops that are being shipped over the world, we can say a lot of  
**[0:59:50-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:50):**  things about seasonality and regionality, but we're going to drink coffee and eat chocolate  
**[0:59:54-1:00:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=0:59:54):**  for a while and many other crops, I'm just naming two that get shipped a lot.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:00):**  And there are huge opportunities there for and huge necessities if you look at their  
**[1:00:04-1:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:04):**  value chain and if you look at the coming climate stress for those crops over the next  
**[1:00:08-1:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:08):**  10, 15 years, there's an endless amount needed to diversify to make the systems more complex  
**[1:00:16-1:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:16):**  and more resilient.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:17):**  So I think the first things that come to mind are actually Lenny of 123, who's on the call,  
**[1:00:25-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:25):**  but also root capital and the Starbucks's of this world, obviously, and anybody that  
**[1:00:30-1:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:30):**  has been, let's say buying commodities in a slightly more ethical way that starts to  
**[1:00:39-1:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:39):**  pay attention to soil could be potentially interested in that if trade finance and I  
**[1:00:44-1:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:44):**  don't know the background in that is a big issue there.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:48):**  I know for many cooperatives, it is because they're waiting for money, currencies, et  
**[1:00:53-1:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:53):**  cetera, et cetera.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:00:54):**  So that can point more of that money towards regenerating soil, I think is and then obviously  
**[1:01:00-1:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:00):**  the transport in the most sustainable way possible, but I don't think we're going to  
**[1:01:03-1:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:03):**  escape the fact that we're going to keep drinking coffee for a while and tea by the way.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:08):**  I would say, yeah, that large commodity buyers that are looking around the Nestle's, Ferrero,  
**[1:01:15-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:15):**  et cetera, of this world could potentially be interested in how far their connection  
**[1:01:21-1:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:21):**  is to the ground.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:22):**  And you'd be surprised how many in between steps there are at the moment in many of these  
**[1:01:25-1:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:25):**  supply chains.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:26):**  They're very, very long.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:27):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:28):**  With a very, with one or two powerful connections in the middle here.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:34):**  Thank you.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:35):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:36):**  So it's not an easy feat.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:37):**  We have an interview coming up actually in a few weeks.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:40):**  I recorded it yesterday on large commodity supply chains and the work on the ground there.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:45):**  So there might be interesting, I'm doing teasers constantly of interviews coming up.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:49):**  Sorry for that.  
**[1:01:50-1:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:50):**  They're actually quite exciting.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:54):**  Question for the group, Lenny, and then we're really going to wrap up.  
**[1:01:55-1:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:01:55):**  Do you have any recommendations of good methodologies of accessing the environmental and social  
**[1:02:00-1:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:00):**  impact?  
**[1:02:01-1:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:01):**  I will share, I might've already done that with you, but I will definitely put it in  
**[1:02:05-1:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:05):**  the show notes.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:06):**  Some of the work we're doing at Tonic, which is one of the other hats I wear, where yeah,  
**[1:02:13-1:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:13):**  more than, let's say more than soil organic matter.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:16):**  So I think there should be, there could be some interesting reading material there.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:20):**  And then I think we reached the end of the questions.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:23):**  So I want to thank everybody that stayed on for another five minutes so much.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:27):**  I will be obviously releasing this recording and as many of the show notes as I can possibly  
**[1:02:32-1:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:32):**  imagine.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:33):**  Plus probably I miss some things, but definitely email me when I do.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:37):**  And thank you so much and see you at the next one.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:43):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:02:48-1:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:48):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:02:52-1:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:52):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:02:56):**  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  
**[1:03:00-1:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:00):**  audio asking the question, how to put money to work in regenerating soils.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:04):**  And I've been following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016, we  
**[1:03:09-1:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:09):**  thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:11):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:03:14-1:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:14):**  How have we built our decision-making framework, what to focus on with the podcast?  
**[1:03:18-1:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:18):**  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[1:03:23-1:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:23):**  What is happening in the space?  
**[1:03:24-1:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:24):**  What should you read?  
**[1:03:25-1:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:25):**  What should you listen?  
**[1:03:27-1:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:27):**  What should you watch?  
**[1:03:28-1:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:28):**  How to approach this space for whom is this course?  
**[1:03:32-1:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:32):**  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[1:03:36-1:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:36):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing  
**[1:03:41-1:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:41):**  platform builders, act tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  
**[1:03:46-1:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:46):**  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:49):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[1:03:53-1:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:53):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[1:03:58-1:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:03:58):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital banks, insurance companies,  
**[1:04:03-1:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:03):**  et cetera.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:04):**  Is this course free?  
**[1:04:05-1:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:05):**  No.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:06):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:08):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[1:04:12-1:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:12):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[1:04:17-1:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:17):**  different means.  
**[1:04:18-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:18):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:04:23-1:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:23):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:26):**  Thank you.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:27):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:04:28-1:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:28):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:35):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:36):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:04:41-1:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:41):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:04:47-1:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:47):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:04:52-1:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:52):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:04:53-1:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:53):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:04:58-1:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:04:58):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:05:02):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:05:07):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:05:08-1:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:05:08):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:05:10):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:05:12):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:05:16):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:05:18):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-6-4-2020/#t=1:05:23):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

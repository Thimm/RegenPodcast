**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:14):**  What does regenerative investing look like?  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:16):**  We talk a lot on this podcast about where to put money to work in soil regeneration,  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:21):**  soil measuring technology, food as medicine companies, compost companies, virtual fencing,  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:25):**  etc.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:26):**  But we rarely talk about the how.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:28):**  How do we put money to work using regenerative principles in service of life and the companies  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:34):**  instead of extracting as much value out of the companies in the shortest amount of time?  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:39):**  Today we have an interview with the team that doesn't want to become the largest fund in  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:43):**  regeneration but the most radical one.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:50):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:54):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:00:55):**  Where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:01:00):**  how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:01:06):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:01:09):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:01:12):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:01:15):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:01:20):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:24-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:01:24):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:01:55):**  Welcome to another episode today with Thomas Hagenhaun, manager and partner of Planetary,  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:01:59):**  an evergreen investment vehicle based in Denmark.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:02):**  Welcome, Thomas.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:03):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:04):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:05):**  And I'm laughing because I'm for sure I butchered your surname, which I practiced in the prequel  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:09):**  and I was okay at it.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:10):**  And now it didn't, it didn't come out.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:11):**  Anyway, I'm sorry for that.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:12):**  But so thank you so much for taking the time this morning to share with us, to talk with  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:17):**  us about your journey into evergreen, I think with some investors, some bells are starting  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:22):**  to ring, but with evergreen investments, and what regenerative investments look like in  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:27):**  the space.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:28):**  But to start with a personal question, we always love to ask, how did you end up because  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:32):**  I don't think you have a farming background as in you manage the farm or you were deep  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:36):**  in the soil?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:37):**  Like how did you end up spending quite a bit of time focusing on companies that are looking  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:43):**  after soil or indirectly building soil?  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:45):**  Like how did so become such a focus in your life?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:48):**  Yeah, I don't think I would have predicted I would end up here.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:54):**  Based on my history, it's much more growing up in a city and, and sitting behind a computer  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:58):**  for many years.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:02:59):**  And I've been part of a Danish tech company that went well.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:03):**  But I think the first thing that really got me in this direction was Jonathan Serpent  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:07):**  Foer's Eating Animal in 2009, 2010.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:11):**  And I really just like his like his fiction.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:13):**  So I also read Eating Animals, and I didn't really know what was waiting in it.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:20):**  I don't even think I knew it was nonfiction.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:23):**  But it really struck me very hard about how alienated we were in terms of the animals  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:29):**  we're eating.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:30):**  So, so after that, I've been much more conscious about the food production system.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:34):**  But I didn't really do anything about it professionally other than eating whalers meat.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:40):**  Then I was part of a company that had an IPO in 2018 in Denmark, and I stopped after that  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:47):**  to do something else.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:49):**  And I didn't really know what to do.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:51):**  So I went back to university to teach a class on entrepreneurship.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:03:55):**  And I told the students they could work on whatever problem they felt was important.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:00):**  And I didn't really have any expectations about what what they would work on.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:05):**  I thought maybe something about a Shopify shop or something for the Friday Bar, but  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:11):**  but all of them chose a development goal and most of them within climate or biodiversity.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:18):**  So so it was like a very clear eureka moment to me that the smartest young people up here,  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:25):**  if you gave them the chance to work on a problem, they chose something about the climate crisis  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:30):**  of biodiversity crisis.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:33):**  And I knew enough about the early stage investors up here to know that they were not necessarily  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:38):**  concerned about that, that sustainability to them was a cost and something to be, you  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:44):**  know, avoided if we could and not the driver of the business.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:50):**  So I started myself investing in in some green startups up here that some of them focusing  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:04:56):**  on food, others were more tech tech place.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:00):**  And then we then I met into the founders of the Danish organic mailbox company, Orested  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:06):**  and and we did some shout out to the other Thomas for introducing us.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:11):**  Yes.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:12):**  Yes.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:13):**  And and and what I know about soil today is mostly from him and his mindset and his much,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:20):**  much smarter than I am within soil.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:22):**  And it's it's been a great privilege to learn from him.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:26):**  And he's sort of a cheat sheet in terms of of of learning all this.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:32):**  So the first thing we did was that they had made some community gardens outside their  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:36):**  office and we wanted to try to to spin it out and put it into a company and have many  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:41):**  more community gardens.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:43):**  So so that was my plunge into to learning a little bit of farming and how to to grow  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:50):**  not really at scale.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:51):**  It's very small scale, a few acres, but still, you know, seeing how much many practicalities  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:05:57):**  and how difficult and how much of a craft it is to grow anything organically or biodynamically,  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:04):**  let alone regenerative.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:06):**  And so we did that for some years and then and it's still running and going fine.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:12):**  And then we talked about that, that I was also running my investments on the side.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:17):**  And Thomas also wanted to to pay it forward and invest in a new generation of companies.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:23):**  So we decided to set up planetary as a as a small fund.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:27):**  And it's it's it's it's by no means the biggest fund.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:32):**  It's only something like six million euros to begin with.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:37):**  But but we set it up to support the next generation of companies.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:41):**  And and it's not only soil and food.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:45):**  It's we're trying to be regenerative and more in the sort of John Fullerton sense with where  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:51):**  it's broader regenerative economics.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:54):**  But a lot of it comes down to to soil and food, obviously.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:06:58):**  Yeah, of course, with Thomas, the other Thomas on as a co-founder as well, or as an inspirator,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:05):**  you're going to end up on food and soil very quickly.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:08):**  And to take a step back to to that university moment, like when you've got all those proposals  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:14):**  or those those business plans or whatever the students end up writing back, like, was  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:18):**  that a moment you thought, oh, this is possible?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:22):**  Or was it like, oh, they're very idealistic?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:25):**  They would work on this.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:26):**  But like, have you been exposed at that moment already to two examples of companies that  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:31):**  were doing these kind of things?  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:33):**  So you your your entrepreneur mind and your investor mind said, OK, wow, actually, they  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:37):**  they want to work on this.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:38):**  And I see it as a path.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:39):**  Or did you see it as, oh, these are very idealistic.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:42):**  This is never going to work because investors and entrepreneurs and the world is not ready  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:47):**  for this.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:48):**  Or have you been exposed at that point?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:50):**  Were you already exposed to two examples?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:52):**  So you could see like, wow, actually, people want to work on this stuff.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:55):**  And it could it could like this could turn into companies.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:07:59):**  Or were you skeptical?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:01):**  No, I think both all of all of the above here, because they are idealistic.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:07):**  And you need to be that still.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:09):**  I think it's often you sort of a derogative to someone who's an entrepreneur and want  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:15):**  to do something good.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:16):**  But without the ideals, I don't think it really matters that you're not doing the right thing.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:20):**  I had seen some companies starting to get traction.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:23):**  It's probably a stretch to call them regenerative because it's such a high bar.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:28):**  And what we are doing today is where it's our North Star.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:32):**  But not all of our investments are meeting that very high bar yet.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:37):**  I think we and it's a ballad that's moving to us.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:40):**  But but even back then, I could see that that some of them could think about business models  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:46):**  that could actually support the visions.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:47):**  And if you can do that, then then great.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:51):**  The other thing you're saying is, are the people ready for it to get mainstream and  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:08:55):**  know and most things we're doing right now, you know, the market and consumers of governments  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:00):**  are not ready for it.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:02):**  But but we have to trust that the people who can envision a future that's actually better  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:09):**  and that people will be ready for it at some point.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:12):**  And you said we're a small fund, only six million.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:15):**  I think many first time funds would quote unquote kill for that to get started.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:19):**  But of course, it's like what?  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:23):**  What is different at the fund?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:24):**  Of course, we're going to talk about a few of the portfolio companies and the future.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:27):**  But I think there's a very fundamental piece that we need to to unpack.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:31):**  And I mentioned in the intro already that the evergreen structure side, like why did  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:35):**  you decide to not only innovate on which companies you invest in, which put a very, very high  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:41):**  bar in terms of North Star regeneration, and not just in soil, but on community and everything.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:46):**  But also, let's let's make our life a bit more difficult and also innovate on the the  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:50):**  fund structure side of things.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:52):**  Why was that necessary?  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:53):**  Why is that necessary?  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:54):**  And then let's unpack.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:09:55):**  Well, it is actually not making my life a little bit more a little bit harder, much  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:02):**  harder to innovate on the fund structure.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:05):**  But but I went around and asked a lot of the green entrepreneurs up here.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:09):**  I also wrote a book about green entrepreneurship.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:12):**  So I talked to the most progressive founders I could find.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:16):**  And a lot of them, if not all of them, they said that they didn't really like taking investors  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:21):**  with seven or 10 plus two years time horizon because they knew they would be sold and they  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:28):**  wouldn't really be in control about who would own them.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:30):**  And they really, really feared about the impacts and and all the work they put into this would  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:36):**  just go away if they were sold to a bad industrial player or something like that.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:41):**  So just to hear because there's there's one sentence in your deck as well.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:45):**  That's really interesting.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:46):**  But you're saying that the most interesting founders from your perspective, the most interesting  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:50):**  companies were very reluctant or even not interested at all to take, quote unquote, mainstream  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:10:55):**  capital, because which means they didn't take it in many cases means they were growing less  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:00):**  than they could or they didn't take they didn't use the tool finance as they could, because  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:05):**  they didn't want to be sold at seven years or five years to somebody that weren't in  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:10):**  control.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:11):**  That's that's an issue like that's a or an opportunity, obviously, for Europe.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:14):**  But that means that there's a whole class of of of companies that are not using the  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:20):**  tool of finance because they don't want to be exposed to the risks of it.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:24):**  Exactly.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:25):**  And and to me, that's both a problem and different an opportunity.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:30):**  And and and that's the first problem we wanted to solve was to be a service to those founders  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:36):**  who actually did have a long term thinking and for them to to be able to to be truly  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:42):**  long term thinking, they need a partner and a fund that also has long term thinking.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:48):**  It's like in the simple math that if we have if you invest in short term thinking, you  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:52):**  can't belong to thinking it doesn't really add up.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:55):**  So.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:11:56):**  So we decided to do that and we're never going to compromise on that.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:00):**  And that's the first thing we are promising founders that we're never going to fund and  
**[0:12:04-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:04):**  and our time horizon that's that's crossing generations and not not years or a decade or  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:12):**  two.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:13):**  And and many people also LPs and institutional investors, they really dislike this because  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:18):**  they're not used to it and and they don't really see an easy way out.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:22):**  And it is more complicated.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:23):**  But but, you know, we are working on structures to ensure that people can can get their money  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:28):**  out at some point, including myself, if if we need that one day.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:34):**  But it is it is a tricky thing, but it's also a necessary thing.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:38):**  I've also seen in the tech industry how bad a short term venture fund can or how much  
**[0:12:44-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:44):**  it can really mess up that that we see so much pressure on founders that are not getting  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:52):**  anxiety is just out of burnout because there is a pressure no one can or very few people  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:56):**  can live under.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:12:58):**  We can see how many of the how many of the sort of problems that are externalized because  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:03):**  it doesn't really fit in the time in a short time horizon, especially in Silicon Valley.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:08):**  I think that that the generation of companies were created there the last 20 years is not  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:13):**  necessarily those who want the next 20 years.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:17):**  So you're making a case there that there's there's there's no space, let's say, for a  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:21):**  holistic view if you're squeezed to perform towards an IPO or exit in four years, for  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:28):**  five years, whatever, like the next series you need to raise.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:32):**  And that treadmill leaves out a lot of things that say plus it's very unhealthy for the  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:37):**  founder.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:38):**  So there is the need for this.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:39):**  But I would say I would say the founder side of things probably is very interested.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:44):**  I mean, there's that quote in your in your deck, like one of the companies you invested  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:48):**  in turned down all investors until now, like they probably got a lot of people knocking.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:53):**  And until now, they always kept it or closed or just listen for a second.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:55):**  No, we're not interested.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:57):**  And so now they're interested in you.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:13:59):**  And then the question comes, okay, if there's not going to be an exit, and what will the  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:02):**  returns look like for investors?  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:04):**  Like how do investors get, get some return or returns?  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:08):**  Or how do you structure that?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:09):**  I know there's some other vehicles like Trilos, Hasen and Evergreen Fund, Aquaspark on on  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:14):**  sustainable aquaculture, I used to work there has one, but there are not many that kind.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:18):**  So you probably have to explain this many times, like how does how does returns work  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:21):**  if we're not going to do crazy IPOs in four or five years?  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:26):**  Yeah, so so one thing we actually trying and it sounds crazy in the venture world, but  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:31):**  it's to have to create and help create a profitable companies.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:36):**  So wow, like profit profit.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:38):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, simple profit.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:40):**  And then we'll also get a return every year instead of having a big big exit.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:44):**  So that's one thing we're aiming for.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:47):**  And we're not saying we'll never sell a company, it will happen because it will be right for  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:50):**  the founders or, or there'll be another fund or another owner that will be even better  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:55):**  than we can be for them.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:14:57):**  So so it's not that we will we are against selling but but we will not take the initiative  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:02):**  to make that transaction.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:04):**  If the founders feel like like they they need to get out and we can find another fund or  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:09):**  investor or industrial buyer that will be the right steward of this idea.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:14):**  That's great.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:15):**  Then the perfect bridge, perfect bridge.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:16):**  What do you think of steward ownership?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:18):**  Like what's the movement in Germany, especially we had Armin on the podcast, we will link  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:22):**  it below, we absolutely need to recheck in with them the whole purpose driven and getting  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:28):**  that into basically making companies own themselves.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:32):**  What is how far is that away from you?  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:34):**  How close is it?  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:35):**  Are you cousins, brothers, what's the or sisters like?  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:38):**  What's the thinking on the steward ownership side?  
**[0:15:40-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:40):**  Yeah, so with one of our investments, the only other owner is actually a fund sort of  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:48):**  a non-profit fund that their only role is to own that company.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:53):**  But they didn't really have any capital.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:55):**  So they needed someone to come in along with them.  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:58):**  And that's us.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:15:59):**  So in that way, we are cooperating and we see ourselves as a great partner to that.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:07):**  There are some instruments we are looking at that can maybe take us a bit more in that  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:13):**  direction, but it's back to the sort of inventing on the fun side that if we also introduce  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:20):**  that then getting LPs is even harder for us.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:24):**  You're going to be stuck with 6 million.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:28):**  Don't innovate too many things, which seems to already happen.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:32):**  So on the LP side, like how are people responding to this?  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:35):**  You said it's difficult for them, obviously, because they're used to control and used to  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:39):**  exit and liquidity in different ways.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:41):**  Or I would say even liquidity on paper, like, oh, there's going to be exits, which very  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:44):**  often never materialize.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:46):**  But in their mind, especially institutional players, obviously, they have the rule books  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:49):**  that they need to follow.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:50):**  How have been those conversations and has there been some shift?  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:16:56):**  Like, are you seeing yourself going to 50 or 100 million?  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:00):**  Are you going to be at 20?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:02):**  Like what's the feeling or at six?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:04):**  Like what's the feeling with potential investors, LPs in the structure, in the vehicle or the  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:10):**  portfolio?  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:11):**  Yeah, I think a lot is happening here on the sort of high net worth individuals.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:16):**  We see a big shift right now.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:17):**  A lot of or increasing number of people with money, they're really longing to invest where  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:23):**  their values are.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:25):**  And some of it needs to be sort of in liquid stocks.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:29):**  And I guess the best you can do there is a good ESG screened portfolio.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:35):**  But you know, no one really gets out of the bed in the morning and look at that ESG screened  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:39):**  index fund and really get excited about that or really feel that they're making a difference.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:46):**  So we and other funds like some of them you mentioned before, like Aqua Spark, I think  
**[0:17:53-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:17:53):**  we're much better at making the transition and the impact tangible, telling the stories  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:00):**  and actually letting them be part of what we do.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:03):**  So some of our LPs are also taking the board seats.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:06):**  So we spend some time with them saying that how do we wish to contribute to the boards?  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:12):**  What do we expect them to do?  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:14):**  What do we expect our board members to do?  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:16):**  So we see it as a means of empowered participation.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:18):**  So our LPs can actually contribute in multiple ways to the portfolio companies we're doing.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:25):**  And that's very important for us and also comes out of regenerative economics is empowered  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:31):**  participation.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:33):**  So we're working very hard to make sure that everyone around us, they actually get involved  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:39):**  as much as they can and want to be.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:43):**  And what's the goal?  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:44):**  Yeah, their goal there with like, do you want to keep this small or what's your longer term?  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:51):**  Like in X years, I would like to be at 50 or 100.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:55):**  Like when does it also make sense economically to run the fund?  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:18:58):**  Because of course, there are fixed costs on these things.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:01):**  And I was here at a number of 50 million.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:04):**  I always hear five zero, but I don't know.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:06):**  Maybe in this case, it's slightly different.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:07):**  Like what do you feel like?  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:08):**  Okay, where we be nice to reach level X at some point?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:12):**  Yeah, I think maybe something like 25 million euros would be a nice place for us to be.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:18):**  So we really think about our own impact a lot.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:21):**  And it's not necessarily about being the largest fund that will give us the last impact.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:26):**  But it is being able to be more radical than the other ones.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:30):**  And a year ago, we were merely, I would say, focused on sustainability.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:38):**  Now we're setting the bar to be regenerative.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:40):**  And we'll probably move that bar once other investors are also moving.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:45):**  So we see our role as sort of increasing the spectrum about how can you invest and how  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:52):**  close can you get to philanthropy without being it and still being a for profit fund.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:19:58):**  And if we get too big or take too many LPs that don't truly believe that, then it will  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:03):**  be impossible for us to have that role.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:05):**  So we'd rather have less money, but from LPs who actually really want to support and push  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:11):**  us to be more radical in a good way.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:16):**  And the other question you had about institutional investors, a year and a half ago, no one would  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:21):**  touch us because of the Evergreen Fund.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:23):**  Some of them are getting back now and saying, oh, okay, maybe that's not really a blocker.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:28):**  If you like everything else, then let's look at that.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:32):**  So I think there is a shift there.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:36):**  And some of the American VCs like, I think, is it Sequoia?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:40):**  Sequoia, Sequoia set up an Evergreen.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:44):**  And that really helped shifting the narrative and they're not really doing it in terms of  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:48):**  regeneration or caring about...  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:50):**  No, they see the returns are there in the long run, I think.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:20:55):**  The Evergreen structure, like summer returns take 15 years.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:00):**  And why would you force yourself to exit before if you're purely profit driven, purely money  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:05):**  driven, but also purely impact driven.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:07):**  I think it makes a lot of sense for many things.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:10):**  I mean, just looking at soil or agriculture or looking at agroforestry, it takes years  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:15):**  to build up a system.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:16):**  Why would you want to get out of year eight if it just starts to get interesting?  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:20):**  And I think that some people started to realize like, maybe this structure is actually limiting  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:25):**  us in terms of impact and returns because we have to get out too early.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:30):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:31):**  And especially when it comes to sustainability and regeneration that so much depends on governments  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:38):**  and new policy.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:40):**  And who knows when that will come?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:42):**  Carbon taxes will be very good for our portfolio, for example.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:46):**  And when they come.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:50):**  You need to be around.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:51):**  And maybe this is a bet to wait and be there long enough.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:21:56):**  And of course, that's why you focus on profitable companies that when the tides change and tides  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:01):**  turn, I think is the word, and the legislation comes in, which I mean, on food will come  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:06):**  at some point, a lot of these things will switch and then you need to be around.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:11):**  It shouldn't be like maybe it changes at year 11 and you just exited everything, which is  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:16):**  just from any perspective, not very helpful.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:19):**  And especially not for the companies and for you as well.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:23):**  And I don't think it's too hard to predict sort of the direction we're heading and what  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:28):**  will be necessarily, what will not.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:30):**  It's the timing and when the crisis will come.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:33):**  So right now we're facing a huge grain crisis, which means so we invested in a company called  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:39):**  a grain, which up cycles spent grains from for brewery.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:44):**  And they look a lot better when grain is a scarcity because you've sort of taken input  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:49):**  from nothing and turn it into flour.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:52):**  And we knew that direction would come at some point because we will see more unstable food  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:58):**  production in the future.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:22:59):**  But we don't really know when exactly it will happen.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:03):**  But we know it's directionally right.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:05):**  But we want to be there long enough for also to see the upside.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:10):**  Yeah, which is, I'm always, I don't want to quote Nassim Taleb too much, but the antifragility  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:19):**  of a portfolio, like be ready for these kinds of shocks or profit from shocks.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:24):**  And in this case, a grain price shock, I think the same with wild farmed that, I mean, if  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:30):**  you farm without inputs or mostly without inputs, and if you, then the rest of the bread  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:36):**  sector, I mean, they do a very interesting grain in grown in permanent pasture.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:43):**  So without any chemical fertilizer, etc.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:45):**  So suddenly prices of bread are rising and your your bread isn't rising.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:48):**  So you're almost getting to the same level, while the quality obviously is a completely  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:51):**  different product.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:52):**  So suddenly, it doesn't create a status quo, but it definitely shocks the rest of the sector  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:56):**  and not you.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:23:57):**  And that makes it, I wouldn't say fair, but much more interesting to look at.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:02):**  And this is not going to be the last time that that happens.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:04):**  So in terms of like, deal flow, like how I mean, the LP side, I understand is definitely  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:10):**  needs a lot of education and time to get that going.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:13):**  But how is the deal flow side?  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:16):**  Until now, have you been surprised, excited, disappointed?  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:20):**  What has been the deal flow side of things in terms of is there way more than you could  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:24):**  do?  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:25):**  What's the status on the deal flow side?  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:28):**  Yes, definitely more than we can do.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:30):**  So that's also the main reason for getting more, raising more money that we actually  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:34):**  have a deal flow that we want to support.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:38):**  So right now, we can only handle maybe sort of pursuing two, three, four investments at  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:43):**  the same time, and not all of them will go through, but we're still relatively small.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:49):**  So we get much more in than we can handle.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:52):**  And some of it we just reject early because we don't really feel we have the domain knowledge  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:58):**  yet.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:24:59):**  We're much better in food and agriculture than we are in energy, for example.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:03):**  So that's not really focused right now.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:06):**  And it might never be, but it also matters, but others might be better equipped than us  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:13):**  for that.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:14):**  But we are getting in a lot and our portfolio companies are speaking quite nicely of us,  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:21):**  which also helps others get there.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:25):**  And we are getting very fast at sort of stages in the industry, at least here in Denmark,  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:32):**  where if you really meaning sustainability and regeneration, then you go to planetary.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:39):**  So we get those first.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:42):**  And yeah, so it's a good deal flow.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:45):**  And we're mostly focusing on Scandinavia right now because it's easier for us.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:52):**  But we want to increase over time.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:55):**  Which means the rest of Europe, like as a continent, is that interesting?  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:25:59):**  Germany, like what would you see as?  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:02):**  Yeah, Scandinavia is big enough for for for 25 million.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:09):**  We want to support the founders that are that was radical, but also be in Germany as well  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:14):**  or other parts of Europe, but will probably stay to Europe.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:18):**  We have a broader mandate because we feel that that that we're still very early and  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:26):**  this is very complex.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:28):**  And we don't want to make too many fixed decision too early because we're also born to like  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:34):**  like all living systems adapt and learn over time.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:37):**  And I feel it's silly that you make all the most important decisions earliest when you  
**[0:26:42-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:42):**  have the least information, right?  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:44):**  And the least experience.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:46):**  So that's why we're also really trying to actually give ourselves some degrees of freedom  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:50):**  to to change these things, things over time.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:54):**  And because you mentioned it's a nice bridge, actually, you mentioned in your deck, we are  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:26:58):**  in service of life.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:00):**  Which sounds amazing.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:01):**  But can you elaborate a bit on that?  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:03):**  Like, what does it mean to you?  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:05):**  Because I've heard that multiple times coming back, but not necessarily in a financial,  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:10):**  like, let's say fundraising deck from a fund, I've heard it from farmers that are deep in  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:15):**  this movement, like, and it's it's this humbleness that that really is interesting, I think,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:19):**  and then the relationship with nature and being part of nature and in service of life.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:23):**  But what do you mean by that when when you put it in a fundraising deck?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:27):**  And then I would love to know, like the reaction from people when you present this in a meeting.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:31):**  But first, what do you mean by being in service of life?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:35):**  So right now, we see the economy as something that's sort of transcending life.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:40):**  It's something even more fundamental than life, something that's that's on a very special  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:45):**  level in our society that that we care so much about our economy and GDP and, and, and  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:51):**  sort of life is in service of our economy that we need our we need to take care of our  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:55):**  economy first, and then the rest will follow.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:27:57):**  And we don't think that's the right way to look at it.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:01):**  So we want our finance and our investments to be in service of life, not the other way  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:07):**  around.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:08):**  So so so we use money as to support the life and health ecosystems and not try to monetize  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:17):**  them or be extractive of those, but but vice versa.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:22):**  And I don't know if it's still very vague way to put this, but but that's sort of our  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:28):**  thinking on this.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:31):**  And when you I mean, it obviously depends on on the audience, but let's say we're in  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:39):**  a theater full full of full of investors, but let's let's say it's a it's an institutional  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:45):**  one and you you present your your picture fund to present it.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:48):**  Like, do you get questions on that?  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:50):**  Like what does that mean?  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:51):**  Or have you like these institutional investors now call back?  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:54):**  Like, do they have like, oh, this is this sounds really hippie?  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:58):**  Or do they resonate with that?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:28:59):**  Like what's the what's been the response?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:01):**  Have there been surprises in when you go to that level?  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:04):**  Because this is deep.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:05):**  This is deep regeneration, John Fullerton, regenerative economy stuff that resonates  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:10):**  with some but maybe not with all.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:12):**  And do you get interesting questions on that?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:15):**  Well, I am I see a lot of dead eyes, I think and some for really light off.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:22):**  So let's say that that between five or 15%, they really get this and they really, really  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:29):**  like what I when I say it and I can't really predict who it will be.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:34):**  Because they they really have sort of a deep longing inside like, oh, someone finally expressed  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:40):**  what I've been thinking.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:42):**  But then there are all the or some of the the suits who who don't trust me because if  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:48):**  I don't get up in the morning to to make the most money back to investors, how can they  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:54):**  trust me?  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:55):**  You know, and that's sort of the opposite of, you know, being in service to life, then  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:29:59):**  we are in service to economy.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:01):**  And the only thing that matters is the returns we're generating.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:04):**  But but and that's sort of what we need to flip that we need to generate a return.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:09):**  And but it's not the most important thing.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:11):**  It's not why we're doing this.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:14):**  It's a means to an end and not the other way around.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:16):**  But but but we do get a lot of pushback on that because people think it's too heavy and  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:21):**  thereby the thing that we don't really understand finance or understand anything really.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:27):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:28):**  And I don't really the same.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:29):**  Sorry, go ahead.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:30):**  No, no, it's just it can be a hard place to be because at some point, you know, when enough  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:36):**  people say that, you know, I can feel insecure about this stuff because, like, OK, they're  
**[0:30:41-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:41):**  really getting upset about this.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:43):**  But but, you know, that's how it is when you come in with a new paradigm, I guess.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:47):**  But and and, you know, I do understand finance.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:49):**  So it's not that that I'm stupid.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:51):**  Right.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:52):**  But the companies are doing very well.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:54):**  Like the proof of the pudding is in the eating and like the investments you've made.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:30:59):**  A number of interesting investments with your own money.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:01):**  That's that's I think people underestimate how much skin in the game is is is changing  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:07):**  perspective.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:08):**  So it's also like I'm doing it this way or we are doing it this way.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:11):**  It's been successful.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:12):**  Companies are doing really well.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:13):**  Like either join us or don't.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:15):**  But it's not that you don't have to prove anything.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:18):**  It will know exactly how do you come on board?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:20):**  You don't.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:21):**  And that's fine.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:22):**  Like there's there's there are other LPs.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:23):**  But I am imagining other potential piece.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:26):**  I'm imagining it gets tiring at some point.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:28):**  And what do you do when you start doubting?  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:29):**  Because you just mentioned in the pre-interview, actually, that you're you made the deck less  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:34):**  VC and more radical.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:36):**  Like is that an expression of that doubt?  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:38):**  Because I don't think if you were doubting too much, you would make it almost a deck  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:42):**  looking like a traditional VC and then a few things like, OK, it's evergreen, etc.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:46):**  I remember I'm asking because I remember 12 years ago now seeing the first deck of SLM  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:51):**  partners and Tony Lovell and not mentioning soil carbon in there.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:54):**  And I asked Tony, why?  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:55):**  Why did you do that?  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:56):**  And he said, I want to be taken seriously actually by a Danish pension fund.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:31:59):**  It's a small world.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:00):**  But and the world has changed, I hope, a lot.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:03):**  Like this is an asset to to be mentioning that we're building soil.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:07):**  And at that time, it was a crazy hippie thing to even talk about soil, apparently.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:11):**  Like what was that?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:12):**  Why why did you want to make the deck more radical and step away from the traditional  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:17):**  VC deck with with a small regenerative source on top?  
**[0:32:22-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:22):**  It actually started after I talked to a family office advisor who really hated what we did.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:29):**  Like you just talk trash for 30 minutes.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:32):**  You barely listen.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:35):**  And they had so many ideas about how bad this was.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:39):**  And I was actually I talked to some some of the of the people and you who are even more  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:48):**  radical than or at least as radical as I am.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:51):**  And they sort of picked me up and gave me the confidence that there are enough people  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:55):**  out there just to go for it.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:32:58):**  Because trying to do both, it won't work.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:00):**  You'll get stuck with the with those advisors too much.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:05):**  So just, you know, meet them with love.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:07):**  But but don't try to convince them and then then find the people who actually really want  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:12):**  to do this and then go as far as we can in that direction.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:16):**  So we could only do that after we talked to some people who actually wanted to become  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:21):**  LPs in the sort of most radical world of them.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:25):**  And and that's been such a big help.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:27):**  And I think it shows also how much the ecosystem and making these introductions and connections,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:34):**  it really matters.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:35):**  And you're doing that a lot.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:37):**  Other good people are doing that.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:39):**  And that's really what's, you know, carrying us forward and giving us the audacity to do  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:45):**  this.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:46):**  Yeah, I think it's an interesting point.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:49):**  It's better to go more radical and extreme because you don't get stuck in the middle.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:33:54):**  Like you don't get mistaken for another sustainability or SDG fund or a climate fund that put a few  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:03):**  put also a pillar of agriculture like under there, but they're not really doing anything  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:07):**  and are still going for for the same extreme returns or extreme speed mostly.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:13):**  And just be very clear what you're not and what you are.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:16):**  But yeah, of course, you need confidence to do that.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:18):**  So luckily you had the ecosystem around you to support you to take that step.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:24):**  And it's going to be very interesting, I think, to see who comes out of the woodworks that  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:28):**  is interested in this and is able to make investments.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:30):**  Of course, I mean, there are many radical people, unfortunately, without the portfolios  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:34):**  or wallets to do this kind of investments.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:36):**  But let's hope there are enough to to kick start this and show what's what's possible  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:42):**  when when investments are done differently.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:44):**  And I think you're lucky in a sense that there are some other evergreen structures out there.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:48):**  Sequoia became very like last year, but also, of course, we mentioned Aqua Spark and Tredos  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:53):**  Bank has a fund or Tredos Investment Management.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:56):**  And so you're not the first.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:57):**  At least you can point to others like, look, they're still alive.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:34:59):**  They're still alive.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:00):**  They're doing more than fine.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:02):**  And so there are many investors that invested have seen these documents before that understand,  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:07):**  OK, there's going to be a lockup period and there will be liquidity, but it's not instant  
**[0:35:12-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:12):**  and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:14):**  So and what would you tell?  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:16):**  Like, let's go back to that theater now.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:18):**  Let's let's remove all the institutional ones, except the ones that really understand.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:22):**  So 10 percent stays.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:23):**  But the rest is filled with investors that are deeply interested in soil, deeply interested  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:26):**  in in regeneration and are wondering about, OK, how do I start regenerative investments?  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:32):**  Apart from, of course, is not investment advice, but getting in touch if you're interested,  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:35):**  if you're in Europe, et cetera.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:36):**  But if you're what do you want them to think about or do after they leave that theater?  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:43):**  What should be if we're on stage and we should give them some advice to, OK, if you want  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:47):**  to know more about regenerative investments, you want to start questioning how to put the  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:50):**  money to work, not necessarily where, but where is, of course, also a question.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:53):**  But let's we say convince you about food and great.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:35:56):**  Now let's let's say something about how what would be a good first step for somebody that's  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:01):**  interested in different ways of investing?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:04):**  I think the first step is to understand what returns meet for them, means for them, because  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:10):**  economic returns is one thing they're looking for, but it's maybe not it's certainly not  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:15):**  the only one and it might not be the most important one.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:18):**  But but what is it?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:19):**  Is it the natural resources?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:20):**  Is it a cultural capital?  
**[0:36:23-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:23):**  Is it social capital?  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:25):**  What is most important for them to to sort of to to generate and help generate and give  
**[0:36:31-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:31):**  back?  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:32):**  And once you sort of start seeing that and also trying to understand the connections  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:36):**  between them and that's still something that's emerging in my head, how how social capital  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:42):**  and natural capital are really related in many ways.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:45):**  And we thought we would be mostly about climate and biodiversity, but you can't really disconnect  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:50):**  it to to or you can't.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:54):**  But it's it's not right to do it, I think, to sort of climate justice or poverty.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:36:59):**  You know, it all gets gets related at some point.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:02):**  But but you need some focus points about what's important to you.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:08):**  That's the one thing.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:09):**  And the other one is maybe a bit more vague, but it is to to sort of try to get get rid  
**[0:37:13-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:13):**  of reductionism and understand that this is very, very complex, that that that that somebody's  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:20):**  pitching me one trick that we can do or one solution that fixes everything in Fudanac.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:26):**  I shouldn't believe him or her like that.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:27):**  That's what you're saying.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:28):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:33):**  And and try to sort of understand that or just acknowledge that that this will be sort  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:39):**  of a moving target for you, that some of the early and early investments you'll do will  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:44):**  will maybe be too simplistic or you won't be too proud of them 10 years from now because  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:50):**  you either because more founders will create something more interesting or also because  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:57):**  you are your knowledge wasn't deep enough at that point.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:37:59):**  But that's OK.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:00):**  You know, it's about getting getting started and getting to talk to people and understand  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:03):**  the complexity and the businesses in it.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:10):**  And I know, you know, it's not the typical, you know, two, three, four, five investment  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:14):**  advice, which are really specific because I don't really believe it.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:16):**  I believe you can.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:17):**  I think get started is a good one as well.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:19):**  I don't I mean, if you like what you said, know that the first few might not be perfect,  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:26):**  don't quote, then then you're maybe more comfortable to do them and learn from them.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:30):**  And as you said, like nobody knows everything at the beginning.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:33):**  Probably we know very little.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:35):**  And so as you're on that journey, make sure their feedback looks, make sure you keep an  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:39):**  open mind, make sure.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:42):**  But yeah, don't.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:43):**  I see that with many investors in general.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:45):**  When they start on their impact journey, they wait for the perfect one to come along, which  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:49):**  obviously never does and can take them three years to make a first investment.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:52):**  And like you just lost three years of learning.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:54):**  If you made a few investments, smaller ones that I mean, depending on the returns, the  
**[0:38:59-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:38:59):**  risks, the capital you have available, but learn from doing and risk it all, obviously.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:05):**  And make sure you have these feedback loops, have the community around you to support you  
**[0:39:10-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:10):**  as well.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:11):**  And know that the first few when you look back in 10 years might not be the most the  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:17):**  ones you're most proud of.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:18):**  But who knows?  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:19):**  Maybe they will.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:21):**  And I might be going out of a limp here.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:23):**  But one thing that has sort of been been a big thing in my head recently is that that  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:29):**  I think what it really means to to invest regeneratively or trying to is very subjective  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:36):**  because it is very, very complex.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:39):**  When you get rid of the reductionism, then there are so many different parameters and  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:44):**  it's so interdependent that at least my head can't really, you know, get it all right.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:50):**  And I think other people, it's the same problem to them.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:53):**  So so people I really respect and I know they come from the same places I do and they want  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:58):**  the same thing.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:39:59):**  We get to radical different conclusions on different investment opportunities.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:03):**  Is this good or bad?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:06):**  And it really depends on how you weigh sort of efficiency versus maybe animal welfare.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:12):**  Or there are different criteria and you can't get them all.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:15):**  But you're still all going in the right direction.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:18):**  And I think we have to acknowledge that and not point too many fingers about, oh, but  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:22):**  they invested in that.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:23):**  And because we are all trying and, you know, no one is investing in coal or fossil fuels  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:28):**  or like no one is doing anything obviously bad.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:32):**  But but there are different different sort of ideas about what an ideal future looks  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:38):**  like and and the investments will follow from them.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:41):**  And there's not one right or wrong way to do this.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:45):**  And if you think there is, then you will never make any investments.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:48):**  Yeah, probably it's good that there are different views or visions on the future because it  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:54):**  would be a bit odd if we all have the same same vision, the vision about that.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:57):**  I would start to get worried.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:40:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:01):**  And just just an example that that I talk to to one I respect a lot who invested in  
**[0:41:06-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:06):**  some fish farming, which is a very efficient way to sort of create a protein for human  
**[0:41:14-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:14):**  consumption.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:15):**  You know, you can take the waste and put it into into the soil and for the nutrition.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:21):**  So you can almost create a closed loop in it.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:24):**  But but I come from a place that and that's also back to the respecting life that that  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:30):**  I really prefer plant proteins that and I don't think we should make animals sort of  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:35):**  a means to our ends.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:38):**  So I wouldn't make that investment.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:39):**  I get why he's doing it.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:40):**  But but to me, it's not sort of it's not my path.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:43):**  What regenerative looks like.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:44):**  But it's not that I'm making any claims about my past is the right one.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:49):**  Yeah, I think it's like with many, like, especially on animal protein.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:55):**  I mean, we've had many conversations here on the podcast.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:41:57):**  Like, I would always ask the question, what's the the the service of the animal in that  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:04):**  case is to make fertilizer is to make like what's the role of the animal in regenerating  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:09):**  a landscape, which could be a seascape as well.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:11):**  And I think it gets very, very exciting if it's just between quotes and quotes.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:15):**  And we still have to do that.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:16):**  But create more efficient protein.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:18):**  I think there's you're going to be fighting things and it's going to be difficult to I  
**[0:42:23-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:23):**  mean, close the loop is very tricky because there's a lot of feed that needs to go in.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:26):**  Which type of animal are you growing?  
**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:28):**  How do you interact?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:29):**  What is the complexity?  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:31):**  What is the diversity?  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:32):**  I mean, is it indoor?  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:33):**  I mean, there's there's some but I think that if the goal is to regenerate a bay somewhere,  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:39):**  suddenly I think bivalves and oysters and mussels make a lot of sense maybe together  
**[0:42:42-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:42):**  with certain fish.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:44):**  And so what's the how do we use quote unquote, the tool of animals to regenerate and not  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:50):**  just make it a bit cleaner?  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:52):**  I think it's an online question that we hardly ever ask.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:55):**  And they are amazing at doing things that we can't like ducks yesterday in interview  
**[0:42:59-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:42:59):**  I said geese, but ducks are amazing at grazing and create very interesting protein both in  
**[0:43:04-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:04):**  the eggs and the meat.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:06):**  And it shows that I'm really not a regenerative farmer, obviously.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:10):**  And ruminants are doing something we can't turning grass into something but of course,  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:14):**  that can be done extremely extractive and extremely regenerative if you do it well,  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:19):**  but it really I mean, it's us that need to make that choice.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:22):**  And unfortunately, many, many times we didn't make that choice on let's say the right side,  
**[0:43:27-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:27):**  or at least the non creating life side, I think in service of life, you make different  
**[0:43:32-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:32):**  choices with these kind of investments.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:34):**  And it's not easy, but at least the direction is clear.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:36):**  And I think we see more and more people that Okay, what's the direction of life or creating  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:42):**  something that's slightly cleaner, slightly less pollutant, slightly more this and like,  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:47):**  yeah, I don't think that's we don't have time for that.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:49):**  We need to do it, but I'm not getting excited about it.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:52):**  No, me too.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:53):**  And we see a lot of those with tailpipe solutions, you know, a better tailpipe for for a diesel  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:43:58):**  car, right?  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:00):**  And it's, you know, it's better than not having it, but it's also Yeah, someone who invented  
**[0:44:04-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:04):**  a machine to soak out methane from from cows, but it only works indoor.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:12):**  So like, it's only the worst, the worst kind of animal production, you can facilitate with  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:17):**  that.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:18):**  And then, yeah, so we really, we, I know, you've talked about this in previous episodes  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:23):**  as well about, you know, how much do you trust tech and how much you don't trust it.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:28):**  And I come from the tech industry.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:31):**  And to me, that's the tech solutions are often an expression of a reductionistic understanding  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:36):**  of what needs to be done.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:39):**  So it's not that we are against tech, but but we're not the ones who just invest in  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:43):**  an app and hoping for that to solve everything.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:46):**  We really like that it has a connection to the physical world.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:50):**  And to flip the question, then what what is tech that you're getting excited about?  
**[0:44:54-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:54):**  Or have you seen tech that you get excited about?  
**[0:44:56-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:56):**  We can talk a bit about a few of the portfolio companies, obviously, as well.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:44:59):**  But like in terms of tech, do you see tech out there that you're either invested in or  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:04):**  not invested in?  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:05):**  But in general, you're getting interested in or excited about when, of course, with  
**[0:45:09-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:09):**  your tech background, but also with your deeper generation focus now?  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:16):**  Because I really like plant based proteins, I think fermentation is a technology that's  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:20):**  that's, that's under use.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:23):**  Would you call it a technology?  
**[0:45:24-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:24):**  I mean, it's more approachable.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:26):**  That's sort of, you know, for to some a paper, a piece of paper as a technology, like it's  
**[0:45:30-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:30):**  a sort of definition is all an investment fund.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:32):**  I mean, if you take the if you take the Greek definition of technology, where of course,  
**[0:45:36-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:36):**  I don't remember where it comes from.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:37):**  But I think even a vehicle like an evergreen structure is a technology.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:42):**  And looking at your current portfolio, I mean, I want to be conscious of your time as well.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:47):**  And I've somebody question, but just to describe a few, like, how's the diversity, first of  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:50):**  all, because that's, of course, a company, a question people would ask.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:55):**  And like, what are you mentioned the grain company?  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:45:58):**  What are some others you you always like to bring up when people ask, Okay, this sounds  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:01):**  all nice.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:02):**  But how does it get concrete?  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:03):**  Like, what did you invest in already until now?  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:06):**  And what kind of cool things are you are you backing?  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:10):**  Are you part of?  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:11):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:12):**  Be a partner of a service.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:13):**  Yeah, that's what we're trying to do.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:14):**  Sorry, my language is still very feisty.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:16):**  Oh, mine is too, but I'm at least we're trying here to do it the right way.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:25):**  We invested in a company called Beyond Coffee, which is growing mushroom on spent coffee  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:30):**  grounds.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:31):**  And I think they have a very holistic way of circular way of producing.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:38):**  So they take coffee grounds and grow the mushrooms and that and then they take take the mycelium  
**[0:46:46-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:46):**  resin and create some very good compost out of it.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:48):**  So they I think they are doing all steps right, which we're very impressed about.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:54):**  And you know, it's it's not really technology heavy to to create mushrooms.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:46:59):**  So so what we also really like is is business model innovation.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:03):**  And they created some mini farm.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:05):**  So they they they grow the mushrooms at their farm, which is all local only serve 20 25  
**[0:47:15-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:15):**  kilometers radius.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:16):**  Then they create another farm after that.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:18):**  And then they put them in some mushroom fridges and canteen so they can grow there and people  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:23):**  can see how much room is growing and how beautiful it is and hopefully get inspired to eat more  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:29):**  plant based.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:30):**  So can we get to a discussion like is a mushroom plant or not?  
**[0:47:34-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:34):**  Like it's sort of another kingdom, but it's for sure one of the most stunning things coming  
**[0:47:39-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:39):**  out of nature.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:40):**  Like if you see mycelium grow through those coffee bags and through those.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:44):**  And it's a day or two like an explosion of life coming out of those.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:47):**  It's really magical.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:48):**  If you haven't done it at home, find a local producer.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:51):**  And because this is yeah, we drink the coffee, we throw away I think 99.5% of the coffee  
**[0:47:58-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:58):**  grounds, the rest is your coffee.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:47:59):**  And it's still it's a very good soil management.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:01):**  But you can first grow oyster mushrooms or mushrooms in general and then use as a soil  
**[0:48:05-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:05):**  management and something you can easily do at home with children, etc.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:08):**  So go and do it if you didn't do it yet.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:11):**  Sorry.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:13):**  And another investment we just made is called Biomix.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:16):**  It's some researchers from a Danish university.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:20):**  So they created a small bio trap.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:22):**  So they go out in the soil and they catch the good bacteria there and then they go home  
**[0:48:28-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:28):**  to the bioreactor and they feed it some organic inputs and then they actually scale it and  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:35):**  they can take out a lot of the bad fungicide in it.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:41):**  So it's good enough for organic farming and it's a way to use bio fertilizer from pretty  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:49):**  local inputs.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:50):**  I think it's a really interesting business model.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:53):**  It's still rather early there, but I'm really excited about the potential, at least from  
**[0:48:59-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:48:59):**  the lab studies, from how much it can actually improve yield in organic farming.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:08):**  And so basically you're investing both very early and slightly later stage or is it mostly  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:14):**  early or what are you normally comfortable with?  
**[0:49:17-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:18):**  And so mostly early if we use that.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:19):**  But we also invested in a company called Aurian, which has been leading biodynamic grain produce  
**[0:49:27-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:27):**  here in Denmark.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:29):**  And I'm almost 40 and Aurian is older than I am.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:33):**  But you know, they never raised a dollar.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:35):**  So you know, what stage is that really?  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:37):**  It's their first round, but still they're very experienced.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:41):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:44):**  And that's the company that has stewardship ownership mostly besides us.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:52):**  And they couldn't really move on because they needed funding and they didn't really have  
**[0:49:56-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:56):**  access to that.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:49:57):**  And they got a lot of offers from other funds and they rejected them because they didn't  
**[0:50:02-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:02):**  really believe they would care about their values and keep it as the founders intended  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:08):**  in terms of being biodynamic.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:12):**  And they're really interested because they buy most of the biodynamic grains in Denmark,  
**[0:50:17-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:17):**  but they also set up production for legumes, which we need a lot more of up here.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:25):**  So if a startup had come just on the legume side and saying that we're ready to process  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:32):**  this, then we would be all ears.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:35):**  Then this company came around and much older, but still all the right values.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:41):**  Then I think it's a great fit.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:42):**  So probably better even because they are in business.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:47):**  They have set up their value webs, their Mercedes and they are selling.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:52):**  They know, I mean, the chances, the risks are so much lower if you're around for more  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:50:57):**  than 40 years that you're around for another 10 is pretty likely compared to a startup  
**[0:51:01-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:01):**  that could disappear tomorrow, literally.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:05):**  So it's also good to balance risk, I think in a portfolio.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:09):**  And I know that that's usually not how it works because then you have pure VC, which  
**[0:51:14-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:14):**  is very high risk.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:15):**  And then you have some later stage funds, which are less risky.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:21):**  But we still we have a hard time finding those who really believe this enough for us and  
**[0:51:29-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:29):**  we also have a right idea that we are maybe a little bit stage agnostic.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:34):**  We want meaningful ownership, but we could get that in this case.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:39):**  So we don't want to be too locked in by saying that we only pre-seed the seed owner series  
**[0:51:45-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:45):**  at a stage.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:46):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:47):**  And to switch it a bit in terms of, I mean, you're saying 25 million would be a nice amount.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:53):**  We want to stay as radical as possible.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:51:55):**  Let's say crazy life event, you're suddenly in charge of a billion dollar or a billion  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:00):**  euro fund and it can be as radical as you want it to be.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:04):**  So you have all the possibility to choose the longest time horizon possible, liquidity  
**[0:52:10-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:10):**  is up to you, et cetera.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:11):**  It has to be investments.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:12):**  What would you focus it on?  
**[0:52:14-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:14):**  What would be your priority sectors?  
**[0:52:17-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:17):**  Could be in food and ag, obviously it could be anywhere else.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:19):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:21):**  Would it all be in legumes in Denmark?  
**[0:52:22-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:22):**  What would you, or in special tech that we don't know yet to bring complexity to farms,  
**[0:52:29-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:29):**  what would you focus on if you had that access to that kind of portfolio?  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:37):**  I think I would split it in two buckets.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:42):**  One I wouldn't really expect to make any profit from, that would be facilitating a conversion  
**[0:52:49-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:49):**  of land to regeneration or restoring ecosystems.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:54):**  And the other half I would invest in companies that would sort of create services for those  
**[0:52:59-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:52:59):**  working to convert the land.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:03):**  And obviously those companies could also sell to other regenerative farmers.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:07):**  So I think being able to create a large local ecosystem where people would get the right  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:13):**  people who actually want to convert the land and maybe also be small hole farmers, whatever,  
**[0:53:18-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:18):**  there are many things we can do in terms of creating more regenerative agriculture and  
**[0:53:25-0:53:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:25):**  restoring ecosystems.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:26):**  But then creating all the companies around that who can create those services.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:32):**  And some will be more tech than others.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:35):**  But I think that would be really interesting to try to create that local ecosystem and  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:39):**  make sure that the entrepreneurs, they have access to the farmers and they really understand  
**[0:53:44-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:44):**  what they need.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:46):**  And when you say services, could it be food companies as well that buy from these, that  
**[0:53:51-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:51):**  buy food rotations, for instance, that would be an amazing service for many, many farmers  
**[0:53:55-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:55):**  and not just one cash crop and mean services in the broadest sense of the word?  
**[0:53:59-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:53:59):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:00):**  So it could be food companies, it could be robots for weeding or whatever the farmers  
**[0:54:07-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:07):**  would say they needed in order to be able to do that job probably and protect the soil  
**[0:54:14-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:14):**  and the biodiversity.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:16):**  And I think if you could get the right people together here and make sure that there were  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:20):**  enough money to sort of support conversion of land while giving the opportunity to smart  
**[0:54:25-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:25):**  people to innovate around that, I think that would be really, really powerful way to spend  
**[0:54:30-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:30):**  a billion euros or whatever we have here.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:33):**  And you would focus it mostly or predominantly say here in Denmark where you're like in your  
**[0:54:38-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:38):**  local context.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:39):**  Do you see that potential there mostly or would you would here be somewhere else?  
**[0:54:44-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:44):**  So I think Denmark is a very bad case because we sort of grow up all our land.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:51):**  So I think we have a lot of work to do up here that can be used other places in Europe.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:54:55):**  But I think there is a sense in choosing a place and creating a community there.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:01):**  So it could be in Denmark, it could also be Germany or other places.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:06):**  It doesn't really matter too much where it is.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:09):**  But I think it's all it's about creating the solutions that also work locally.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:13):**  And then let's see where can where else can this be applied?  
**[0:55:16-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:16):**  Because I think one thing we're also starting to learn that that the last 40, 50 years in  
**[0:55:23-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:23):**  large scale globalization, we have seen the same solutions applied everywhere.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:27):**  And that might not be the right thing going forward.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:30):**  We need more, more local solutions.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:33):**  And some of them can scale globally.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:35):**  Some of them needs to be adapted.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:36):**  Some of them shouldn't be scaled.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:38):**  And that's OK.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:39):**  But but I think keeping it to one place would be good.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:45):**  And then we can copy that model about spending a billion dollars to other places as well  
**[0:55:50-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:50):**  and see what's right in that ecosystem.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:53):**  And we take your fund away.  
**[0:55:56-0:55:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:56):**  I mean, people know this question is coming.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:55:57):**  But if you had a magic wand and you could only you could change one thing, one thing  
**[0:56:01-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:01):**  only in I would say in the regeneration space could be on the investment side, could be  
**[0:56:07-0:56:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:07):**  global consciousness, could be better taste.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:10):**  It could be all land should be steward owned.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:13):**  It could be anything.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:14):**  And what would you change overnight?  
**[0:56:18-0:56:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:18):**  I think I would really like to to make humans not like meat anymore, to turn everyone into  
**[0:56:25-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:25):**  a vegetarian or vegan.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:29):**  In my end and in my mind, that would help solve a lot of problems of all this extraction  
**[0:56:36-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:36):**  we're doing this world.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:37):**  So so if we could could sort of free ourselves from industrial meat production, then we could  
**[0:56:43-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:43):**  free up so much land because we don't need all the the feed going into those animals.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:48):**  And we could could end so much suffering and and hopefully also be a bit less alienated  
**[0:56:54-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:56:54):**  to our food, because I think industrial farming is only it only works when we're alienated  
**[0:57:00-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:00):**  from from how it's done.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:02):**  So I think that that would would help us in many different ways.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:07):**  And do you think that would be because I have this conversation often, that would be enough.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:12):**  I'm afraid that if we stop eating meat overnight, that the law that I think partly it doesn't  
**[0:57:19-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:19):**  exist because we like to meet, I think it exists because there's very, very cheap input  
**[0:57:23-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:23):**  available from grain and soy, etc.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:26):**  And I'm sort of afraid and they already do so to a certain extent, find their way in  
**[0:57:29-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:29):**  other things like glucose for corn syrup or ethanol or some other destruction, which obviously  
**[0:57:35-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:35):**  saves the animals.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:36):**  So that's great.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:37):**  But like, would that I don't know if taking away the CAFO operations, which should end  
**[0:57:41-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:41):**  tomorrow, would also end the system of destruction of all the you say it could free up a lot  
**[0:57:47-0:57:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:47):**  of land, which it could and that's always the eco modernist approach, but it also could  
**[0:57:51-0:57:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:51):**  not like it also would be maybe they find another way to burn that stuff.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:57:55):**  And let's say the landscape doesn't change, except, of course, that there's a lot less  
**[0:58:00-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:00):**  animal suffering.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:02):**  But you could argue there's a lot more because we keep dosing those fields in chemicals and  
**[0:58:07-0:58:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:07):**  plowing and killing an amount of life and wildlife on those fields that is that is enormous.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:12):**  Like, would that would that be the entry point?  
**[0:58:15-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:15):**  Because I see from a lot of plant based protein sites that it's not grown at all regeneratively.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:22):**  And we're sort of hiding that like where the ingredients come from.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:26):**  I told you, you could only do one thing.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:27):**  So I'm making the question way more complex, obviously, now and opening a can of worms,  
**[0:58:31-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:31):**  but I'm afraid that it's that it's too reductions are too simplistic.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:35):**  But maybe that's the way I asked the question.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:37):**  I don't know if it would fix it.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:38):**  And we just find another way to to create an enormous amount of extractive ingredients  
**[0:58:44-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:44):**  to to go somewhere else to go to salmon.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:46):**  And of course, that we won't do animals anymore.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:47):**  But like, we'll find another way to to squeeze the system in the wrong way.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:52):**  Are you scared about that?  
**[0:58:53-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:53):**  Like pushing plant based, like singular plant based on in that way?  
**[0:58:58-0:58:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:58):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:58:59):**  And I think it's a totally valid point you're raising here.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:03):**  And and, you know, when we only have one, one solution, it does get reductionistic.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:09):**  And I think most most solutions, stop asking this question.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:13):**  No, no, but but you know, it will only work maybe if there is a good CO2 tax or you know,  
**[0:59:18-0:59:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:18):**  you limit how many fields you can grow, you know, set some radio about how much can be  
**[0:59:23-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:23):**  found and how much cannot.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:25):**  But but yeah, so that would be an entry point.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:29):**  But no, of course, it wouldn't be enough.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:31):**  Just like a CO2 tax is a very efficient, efficient way to sort of reduce carbon.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:36):**  But you know, it doesn't really work in isolation.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:39):**  And none of these solutions do.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:41):**  And that's the problem about all these crisis that that it is.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:45):**  So that's a question I wanted to ask actually on slide eight in your deck, you might be  
**[0:59:48-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:48):**  changing this.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:49):**  So when people see it, it's different.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:50):**  But there is a carbon tunnel vision slide, which I've seen a lot on LinkedIn, etc.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=0:59:55):**  But so basically, what is your point that you're trying to make with with the carbon?  
**[1:00:00-1:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:00):**  That our singular focus on carbon is maybe also reductionistic?  
**[1:00:03-1:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:03):**  Like how how does it go down with with investors?  
**[1:00:06-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:06):**  Like when you put that slide on, which is quite early in the day?  
**[1:00:09-1:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:09):**  Yeah, no, they get surprised because, you know, to them, the crisis we're facing right  
**[1:00:14-1:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:14):**  now is a carbon crisis.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:16):**  And that is one of the crisis and probably not the largest one, to be honest.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:21):**  So so and you know, if you get a report for your portfolio, you know, it will be about  
**[1:00:27-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:27):**  carbon intensity and it will only focus on carbon.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:30):**  There is nothing else right now and no other metrics in terms of sustainability.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:35):**  And and to me, that that's that's a really big problem.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:41):**  But it's also a very big opportunity.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:42):**  I saw some statistic about how much money went into eco venture money, which funding  
**[1:00:48-1:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:48):**  went into ecosystem restoration versus electric vehicles.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:52):**  And you know, it's it's yeah, no, it's nothing.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:00:54):**  You know, you can barely see the ecosystem, ecosystem restoration funding on that chart  
**[1:01:00-1:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:00):**  compared to just electric vehicles.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:02):**  And then, you know, you get to carbon capture and storage and P.T.X. and other stuff on  
**[1:01:06-1:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:06):**  top of that.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:07):**  So so to us, it's such a great investment opportunity to invest in regeneration and  
**[1:01:13-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:13):**  sustainability outside the carbon space.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:17):**  And that much more funding will go there in the coming years.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:23):**  So being there early, you know, not too early.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:25):**  We need to keep the companies alive until other realize that we also have other problems  
**[1:01:32-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:32):**  is much more attractive right now, because we can see how much funding and how crazy  
**[1:01:36-1:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:36):**  the valuation valuations are for some of the electric vehicle companies, for example.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:41):**  Now, absolutely.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:42):**  And I think on the warming side, like water vapor and biodiversity and really vegetating  
**[1:01:48-1:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:48):**  the earth is if you're really worried about global warming, that's where you should focus  
**[1:01:52-1:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:52):**  on and people are coming around and there's much more attention now for and for evaporation,  
**[1:01:56-1:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:56):**  et cetera.  
**[1:01:57-1:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:57):**  But it's carbon is a very small part.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:01:59):**  It's a big problem, but a very small part of a much bigger problem we have and we're  
**[1:02:02-1:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:02:02):**  facing and people are coming around to that.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:02:04):**  But if you're early enough and you can stay around, that's the place where you would like  
**[1:02:09-1:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:02:09):**  to be.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:02:10):**  I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:02:11):**  I know you have to go relatively soon.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:02:13):**  I opened a can of worms, two can of worms, probably at the end of the conversation, which  
**[1:02:17-1:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:02:17):**  means we need to check in again.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:02:18):**  We mean we need to sit down and unpack many of these and other investments you've been

**[1:03:36-1:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:03:36):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:03:37-1:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:03:37):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:03:42-1:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:03:42):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:03:46-1:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:03:46):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[1:04:14-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:04:14):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,

**[1:04:29-1:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:04:29):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:04:31):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:04:34-1:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:04:34):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:04:39-1:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:04:39):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.

**[1:04:45-1:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:04:45):**  No.  
**[1:04:46-1:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:04:46):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:04:48):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[1:04:53-1:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:04:53):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:04:58):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:05:03-1:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:03):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:06):**  Thank you.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:07):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:05:08-1:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:08):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:05:14-1:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:14):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:16):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:05:21-1:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:21):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:05:27-1:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:27):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:05:31-1:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:31):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:05:33-1:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:33):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:05:38-1:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:38):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:42):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:46):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:05:47-1:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:47):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:05:49-1:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:49):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:05:52-1:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:52):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:05:56-1:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:56):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:05:58-1:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:05:58):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/thomas-hogenhaven#t=1:06:03):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:14):**  What is the role of the largest commodity buyers and brands in the world like Nestle  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:18):**  and Ferrero in the regenerative transition?  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:20):**  How can they be part of decommodifying their supply chain from an extractive to a regenerative  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:25):**  one?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:26):**  How can we take our attention to the top-down and bottom approach being very, very humble  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:31):**  and how large brands need a much more holistic view of quality?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:35):**  And why do you maybe need to work on small and very deep regenerative projects that seem  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:40):**  to be impossible to scale?  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:44):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:48-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:48):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:49):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:54):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:00:59):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:04):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:06):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:10):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:12):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:17):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:21):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:25):**  our work.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:26):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:28):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q and A webinars with former  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:33):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:46):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:47):**  Welcome to another episode today with Bastien Sachet.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:50):**  He's CEO of the earthworm foundation since 2016.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:54):**  The earthworm foundation exists for much longer and we'll go into that, but is a nonprofit  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:01:58):**  organization that built on values and driven by the desire to positively impact the relationship  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:02):**  between people and nature.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:04):**  They work with some of the largest agricultural commodity buyers in the world to cultivate  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:08):**  more life in their value chains.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:09):**  And we're also going to get into what that means.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:11):**  They're focusing on deforestation, agriculture, chocolate, coffee, hazelnuts, and much, much  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:16):**  more.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:17):**  Welcome Bastien.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:18):**  Hi Koen.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:19):**  So let's start with a question.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:20):**  How did you end up in soil agriculture, deforestation, land use, and what brought you there?  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:26):**  Well personally I'm an agronomist and I've grown up in the countryside.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:30):**  So of course these are things I've always been close to, but it's only as I went into  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:35):**  my professional career that I started to do different things.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:38):**  And I ended up at some stage after various steps having this vision in Argentina on the  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:44):**  soy field where I see the soil going up in dust and on GM crops and cans of Roundup on  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:50):**  the side.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:51):**  And I'm thinking, that's not what I want to do.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:53):**  We can change that.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:54):**  And then I found this organization, which at the time was called the Forest Trust, which  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:02:58):**  had the objective to make forest well-managed.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:01):**  And I thought, wow, that's great because it combines the business side.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:05):**  We can have products coming out of the forest, wood, et cetera, and keeping them as they  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:10):**  should be healthy.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:12):**  So I started to work with the TFT in 2006.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:15):**  And then we started to work on really two key ecosystems, forests and soils, because  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:20):**  they are the main habitats for life.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:23):**  I like to say they are kind of the belly of the earth.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:25):**  They are where life starts.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:27):**  And what we eat, what we wear, what we burn, what we use to live basically comes from there.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:33):**  So for us, it's really what needs to be the focus.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:35):**  Now, completely, I think for, hopefully for anybody listening to this podcast.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:39):**  If not, there's some great books you should reach out to me.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:42):**  I will let you know some great farms to visit.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:44):**  But then, I mean, the organization was mostly, when you joined, mostly focused on forests,  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:49):**  obviously forest growth in soil, but how did that gradual or quick transition happen to  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:55):**  much more focused on commodities, agriculture?  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:03:58):**  You're also working in grain at the moment.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:00):**  How did that come back to the soy discovery you had when you were in that field?  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:04):**  So we've always been leveraging the power of businesses and their supply chains to create  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:09):**  change at the origin of those supply chains.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:12):**  And at the time, the supply chains were really the timber and wood supply chains linked to  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:17):**  garden furniture because that's where the focus was and the realization that all this  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:21):**  production was driving deforestation, especially in Asia.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:25):**  And we proved and we learned how to use the purchase and the procurement of companies  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:30):**  in the downstream to really leverage change in the upstream.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:34):**  And we saw it was possible.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:35):**  So we thought, okay, that's a great thing.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:37):**  And in 2007, the Stern reports come showing how important forests are for climate.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:43):**  And personally, I was sitting in a four-wheel drive visiting one of our projects in Indonesia  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:48):**  in Kalimantan, and I see all these logging trucks and bulldozers being lined up just  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:53):**  nearby the forest.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:54):**  And I say, how was that?  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:56):**  Oh, and the forest manager says, we just sold half of the forest and it's going to become  
**[0:04:59-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:04:59):**  a palm plantation.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:00):**  And I'm like, oh, no.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:02):**  So we've done all that in vain.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:04):**  And maybe we need to focus on other supply chains.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:07):**  And our model could work with palm, with cocoa, with all these commodities that drive change.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:13):**  And so we went into these commodities and we started to work on tackling deforestation  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:17):**  through agricultural commodities.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:20):**  And of course, when you dig deeper, you get to the farmer and the smallholders and how  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:24):**  they manage the land because the way they manage their land is going to impact the forest.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:29):**  And then quickly you come to the source and the essence of everything is what do you get  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:33):**  from your soil?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:34):**  How do you interact with your soils and your agriculture?  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:36):**  And we realized that all of this is one whole thing.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:40):**  It's a holistic approach.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:41):**  In the same way we were seeing human beings, people, workers being exploited, we think,  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:46):**  you know, we're not an environmental organization and we will leave the social to other people.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:51):**  We take this holistic approach that is about human is part of nature, soils, forest, and  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:05:56):**  people, rural communities and workers while they are really our focus.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:00):**  And that's how we really embrace the whole thing.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:03):**  And that's what we work on at the moment.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:05):**  And it's a great bridge to unpack a bit how you're working, because I think it sounds  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:10):**  amazing.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:11):**  We're working on the big commodities that cause deforestation.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:14):**  If we like it or not, palm oil, many others, I mean, chocolate in an industrial way, coffee.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:18):**  I mean, there's so much stress on the forest that if you only focus on the forest, you're  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:23):**  just not going to win the battle.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:24):**  Even though it started with garden furniture, which I still remember the teak discussions  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:29):**  a long time ago, which started a lot of awareness actually, but we thought only wood.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:33):**  And of course there are many products.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:35):**  So can you describe in a way how you then work with a large commodity player, a large  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:40):**  commodity buyer, a large brand, obviously you don't have to name them, but what is a  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:44):**  good example of how a process like that starts?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:47):**  How do you get them to really care and really do something?  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:51):**  There is two aspects.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:52):**  I think there is an aspect where you engage with people, individuals in those companies.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:06:57):**  So often we say we've got member companies, but often we work with individuals.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:01):**  And when you see those individuals switch from companies to companies, you see that  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:04):**  they're, they ignite an approach and a process in their own companies.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:09):**  And then there is a real, the practicality of what we do.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:11):**  Do they follow them as well?  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:13):**  Like if they move to another company, that old company, hopefully say is a client and  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:17):**  then a new one as well.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:18):**  Is that...  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:19):**  Often it happens.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:20):**  And it's quite interesting because you can see the impact spreading a bit in this way.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:24):**  And then as I said, there's a practicality of what we do.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:27):**  We believe that sustainability is nothing else than managing environmental and social  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:33):**  quality.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:34):**  And what companies know how to do is to give you quality products.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:37):**  If you drink a kind of Coke to take a very well-known product, you know you're not going  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:42):**  to get sick.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:43):**  Companies have put all the processes in place so that they check everything before it gets  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:47):**  to your mouth and to your body.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:50):**  And we're thinking, well, today, what consumers are asking for is really a more holistic view  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:54):**  of quality.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:07:56):**  Environmental and social quality are important, but it means companies need to shift their  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:00):**  thinking and extend the walls of their factories if you want, which traditionally were the  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:05):**  limits of what they look at, to the whole supply chain starting at the farmer's plot.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:10):**  So it makes companies think a bit differently about that.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:14):**  And then it's just a normal process of taking interest, being quite humble, not coming with  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:19):**  norms and don't do this and don't do that, which has been a lot of the punitive ecology  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:24):**  approach, I would say in the past.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:26):**  They need to come with an open mind to say, how do we create something that benefits everyone?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:31):**  One thing we have to remind is that supply chains today, commodity supply chains, they  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:35):**  are inherently extractive.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:38):**  So they are built and the business model is built on extracting natural capital, extracting  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:44):**  human capital.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:46):**  This is why you still have trade labor and cocoa.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:48):**  This is why you have people working for very low and decent salaries in palmer plantations  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:53):**  sometimes.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:54):**  This is why we are tapping into forest all the time to get fertility.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:08:59):**  And it's not like there are no ways to do differently.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:01):**  It's just the way it's been because of opacity, because of not really looking after where  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:06):**  or asking the question, where does it come from?  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:09):**  So if you want, in a way, what we ask companies is ask yourself the questions, how do I relate  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:15):**  to people in nature?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:17):**  Where does it come from?  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:18):**  How has it been made?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:20):**  All these simple questions, everyone can ask them.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:23):**  And if you start asking those questions, then you open the opportunity to change.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:27):**  And that's what we do with companies, going in the field, asking, discussing with the  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:31):**  suppliers, but not in a way where everything comes with, you should not do this, stop that,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:36):**  put a norm, verify that.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:38):**  No, first understand, ask questions, two, engage, three, build trust.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:43):**  And then together with everyone in the supply chains, figure out how everyone can be winning  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:48):**  out of that.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:49):**  And then economically as well, mainly, you know, how a farmer can make better business,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:53):**  how a supplier can thrive and how a brand can be successful as well with its consumers  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:58):**  by taking such an approach.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:09:59):**  So I would say more on ecology of solutions.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:01):**  So you, let's say a company calls you up and says, we've heard about you, Boston and Earthworm.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:07):**  It's a fascinating, we probably have a problem or we get a lot of questions about our supply  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:11):**  chain, et cetera.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:13):**  What do you do first?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:14):**  What's your first step in engaging with them, which is the first step, but how do you engage  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:17):**  with them?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:18):**  Do you meet the people?  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:19):**  Is that the people on the top?  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:21):**  Is that the people buying the cocoa?  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:23):**  Is that a first, let's say discovery contract with them?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:27):**  Because you probably want to ask a lot of questions, but you also don't want to lose  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:30):**  the potential of having a client.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:31):**  So how would they hire you for a period and allow you to ask a lot of probably difficult  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:36):**  questions, but humble?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:38):**  Is that how it works?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:39):**  I would say we're a bit like, you know, when you go to the doctors, you got this first  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:42):**  appointment.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:43):**  You're not a consultant, right?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:44):**  I'm not at all.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:45):**  How would you describe yourself?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:46):**  I like the work, you know, a doctor is not a consultant.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:49):**  He does consult, okay, but he's not a consultant.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:52):**  So I would really compare the process that we implement to the ones that doctors implement.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:10:59):**  It's kind of a healing process.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:01):**  So the company comes and says, look, I want to change.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:04):**  Either it's because an NGO campaign, a consumer pressure, the CEO's decision, or just some  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:09):**  individuals within the company thinking, hey, why don't we try something different?  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:13):**  So we sit down, we listen, and we understand what is the magnitude of their problem, how  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:20):**  deeply they want to change.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:22):**  And then we will try to together start a journey where we're going to go quickly on the ground  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:27):**  and assess, engage suppliers.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:29):**  We will check whether they've got something in writing about what they want in terms of  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:34):**  environmental and social quality.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:36):**  If they don't, we will start by writing that together, because we believe that turning  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:41):**  the intention into words and then putting those words into action is what we do.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:47):**  So if there are no words, we'll put the words on the paper.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:50):**  Recently Ferrero is working on its hazelnut charter.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:53):**  Okay, what is responsible hazelnut?  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:11:56):**  Just as background, Ferrero is the maker of Nutella and a lot of other products with hazelnut  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:00):**  in it, just for the people that don't know the company behind it.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:03):**  Exactly.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:04):**  So that's one example.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:05):**  We did that with Nestle and Palmoil.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:07):**  We worked with Wilmar in the same way.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:09):**  So we tried to put words.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:11):**  With these words, we will then engage the suppliers and the suppliers will tell us,  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:15):**  well, this is where we're at.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:17):**  This is what we think.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:18):**  And we'll deploy the teams on the ground to figure out, to test, to visit some suppliers,  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:22):**  et cetera.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:23):**  Then we'll prioritize.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:24):**  We'll say, okay, where should we focus first?  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:26):**  What are the biggest challenges that this supply chain faces?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:29):**  And it varies from country to country.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:31):**  So Palmoil in Malaysia, it's mostly a social issue.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:34):**  In Indonesia, we'll talk about deforestation and expansion.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:37):**  And so we really try to build a plan of transformation.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:41):**  What becomes really interesting is that we will ask systematically to know where the  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:47):**  raw materials come from.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:49):**  This is a big hurdle.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:50):**  Often people say, oh, traceability is not so important.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:52):**  I said, yes, you need to know where things come from because we cannot change what we  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:57):**  cannot see.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:12:59):**  And then we talk to the traders, we talk to the commodity suppliers who have for years  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:05):**  thrived on opacity.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:07):**  They are the kings of making one ton of Palmoil equivalent everywhere in the world.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:13):**  And what we say is you source from different landscapes, from different terroir, and you  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:18):**  have to recognize first that these exist.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:22):**  And that is done by highlighting the information of where it comes from.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:25):**  I remember on the, I talk about Palmoil because it's a commodity we worked a lot on.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:30):**  When we started, the buyer of Nestle told us, look, it will be very difficult to get  
**[0:13:35-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:35):**  traceability.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:36):**  It's almost impossible.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:37):**  It gets traded so many times, et cetera.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:39):**  I mean, 10 years later, most of the industry have traceability to all the mills, the 2,500  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:45):**  mills on the planet and now progressively towards plantation.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:49):**  It's possible.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:50):**  And then after that, we'll engage on the ground and that becomes really interesting because  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:54):**  then we will pool the influence of different brands in a given landscape.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:13:59):**  You take a landscape in Indonesia or in Africa, you got all sorts of raw materials coming  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:03):**  out of it.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:04):**  So we enter with one raw material, let's say rubber, and then you'll see the produce cocoa,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:08):**  the produce flavor and fragrances, palm, food.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:11):**  And then we'll start working together with the government, with the different companies  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:15):**  that source from there and the farmers to figure out, okay, what's the path towards  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:20):**  regeneration?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:21):**  And that's, I think what also companies appreciated that they're doing the work in their supply  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:27):**  chain, but eventually at landscape level, they connect with others.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:30):**  And is it difficult to get in that buy-in, like you said, sometimes it's people within  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:36):**  the company, let's say at a medium or senior level, but you need to buy in from the top  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:41):**  and you target specifically the top, as I know.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:45):**  How do you get the real senior management that probably has never visited a palm or  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:49):**  implantation or how do you get them to support it?  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:53):**  I wouldn't say excited, but to see the potential of Regen Ag, to see the potential of a Fagor  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:14:58):**  factory, to get them out of their office, basically, maybe literally.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:02):**  What's your strategy there?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:03):**  You just said it.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:04):**  We try to get them to the field.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:06):**  The best ever engagement I've noticed is to take a CEO to the field, get him to touch  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:12):**  the soil, get him to meet people, get him to reconnect with the reality he's connected  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:16):**  to and that he has long forgotten about because his worries are in meeting rooms, his days  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:22):**  are in meetings and calls and dealing with problems that are more linked to the downstream  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:27):**  part of their work, to the branding, to the supermarket, the retailers, etc., his clients,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:33):**  but he rarely focuses on the suppliers.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:35):**  We take the opportunity together with the staff of the very company we work with to  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:39):**  say, hey, let's organize a little trip.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:41):**  Let's go and see by ourselves.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:43):**  I seize any opportunity I can to do that.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:46):**  I remember once with the CEO of Nestle France, he says, look, regenerative agriculture is  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:50):**  really interesting.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:51):**  Then I said, let's go and have a look.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:54):**  We got Professor Boivin, who is a researcher on soils in Geneva, to organize a little visit  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:15:59):**  with us at a farmer's who are doing regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:04):**  I remember that day when we came and it was really cold, the wind blowing and I'm like,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:10):**  oh my goodness, am I not killing my relationship with the guy by bringing him?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:14):**  Or the guy itself.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:15):**  Yes, or the guy itself.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:18):**  We had this lovely moment where the farmer had prepared a little foldable table and he  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:23):**  had some warm coffee.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:25):**  For some reason, I didn't even ask him, you know, he had prepared a pot of Nescafe, you  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:29):**  know, hot water and Nescafe.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:30):**  And he says, which is a nice touch for Nestle CEO of France.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:34):**  Very nice touch.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:35):**  It's funny.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:36):**  And he had bought some croissants from the local bakery and he said, look, I'm going  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:40):**  to show you what I'm doing.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:42):**  And he was not at all impressed.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:43):**  He was just being himself and very frank in even asking challenging questions to the CEO.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:49):**  But we had this very human connection.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:51):**  We all got some earth in our hands and started to touch the mud and try to understand.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:16:57):**  And I know that from this point, you know, the CEO really said, look, that makes total  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:02):**  sense.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:03):**  I had a feeling this was important, but that just reminds me how really important it is  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:06):**  for me.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:07):**  And I think that these are the kinds of moments where it's not the only thing, you know, there  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:11):**  are many things that make people change, but reconnecting to nature, feeling that you're  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:16):**  doing something important for the world.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:19):**  I think all of these are things that are buried into our human nature.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:24):**  And then when they have the opportunity to come out, I think it's important.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:27):**  It was the same for me when I had this wake up call early on.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:30):**  So I know that this process is a multiple impressionist touches that comes from conversations,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:37):**  the investor saying you need to do that and yourself walking through an exploratory journey  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:41):**  and reconnecting to nature.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:43):**  I think many listeners can connect to that.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:46):**  And I mean, it's actually in your mission statement of the connection between people  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:50):**  and nature.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:51):**  And probably it's one of the core challenges we have.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:55):**  We are so disconnected and thus we don't know where in our personal life and obviously in  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:17:59):**  our business life, we have no idea where the palm oil comes from or where our food in general  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:03):**  comes from.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:04):**  Plus we're mostly in meetings and offices, et cetera.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:07):**  And we're now starting to see the terrible price we pay for that, but to get people out  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:12):**  in the field, it's not easy.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:13):**  But once it happens, I have seen it a few times as well, it really gets people like  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:17):**  everything they thought about agriculture or red, et cetera, even if they didn't pay  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:21):**  too much attention, turned out to be way more complex and way more interesting and way more  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:25):**  opportunities than they could ever imagine.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:26):**  And in first, obviously that's the same.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:29):**  So you get the CEO on board, but then you go very, very deep.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:32):**  Like you go deep into one landscape.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:34):**  It's not that you try to change the whole palm oil sector at once.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:38):**  You decide to go very deep into even different produce in the same landscape.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:44):**  That's very deliberate.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:45):**  Can you explain why that is?  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:47):**  Yes.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:48):**  What we believe is that if you take a supply chain of a Nestle, a Ferrero, a Maas, these  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:54):**  large companies, it just connects to pretty much everywhere in the world.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:18:58):**  I remember when we started looking at Nestle's pop and paper supply chain for the packaging  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:02):**  and we contemplated 3000 suppliers and this has just the converters and behind the converters,  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:08):**  you have the meals and behind the meals, you have the forest owners and you're like, oh  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:11):**  my goodness, this is just too complex.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:13):**  We'll never get to the end of it.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:15):**  So what we do is to look at, okay, where does it hurt?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:20):**  Where are the supply chains connected?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:22):**  Hurt for the company?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:25):**  For nature and people.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:26):**  So where are the companies connected?  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:27):**  So it's important for me as a company that region, because it's where I source and I  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:32):**  need that sourcing.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:33):**  Let's say the south system of the US, for example, is a basin where a lot of the pop  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:37):**  and paper from the world comes out.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:39):**  There is no single company, large company that cannot source from there for its pop  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:43):**  and paper supply.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:44):**  It's impossible.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:45):**  You are unnecessarily connected there.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:47):**  So you're saying pulp and paper, meaning the ingredients basically to make the packaging.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:53):**  And it's made from pulp.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:54):**  So every company in the world that makes packaging at some point sources part of that from that  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:19:59):**  region, like you're touched by it.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:01):**  Inevitably because a lot of the pulp that is produced in the world is coming from those  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:04):**  areas.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:05):**  So in Brazil, the commoditization of supply chains have located the supply of cocoa in  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:10):**  Ivory Coast, Indonesia Palm.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:13):**  It's very concentrated.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:14):**  So basically supply chains are what they are.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:17):**  We're not judging of whether it's good or bad.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:19):**  We're pushing for more resilience, more diversification, but still you see these pockets of impact  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:25):**  that exist on ecosystems.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:27):**  So we've got forest and we've got a lot of people sourcing from there.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:30):**  And then we look at what's critical.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:32):**  What are endangered ecosystems?  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:35):**  Things that really need to be preserved because they matter for nature.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:38):**  And then we will work at the heart of that and we will focus.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:42):**  So rather than doing assessments and visits everywhere, we will focus there and we'll  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:48):**  say, look, let's try to find a solution.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:49):**  So where it hurts the most in, let's say it is watershed where the most I'm just making  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:54):**  up an example, the most chemical leaching of this paper production or the most soil  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:20:59):**  erosion or like where it hurts the most within this area where most in this case of the pulp  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:04):**  and paper comes from.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:05):**  That's where you want to be.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:07):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:08):**  So for example, we engaged in Indonesia where we know there's population planted on peat  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:14):**  and there are social conflicts.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:15):**  We know this is a place that you need to look at with a lot of care.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:18):**  And if we can find solutions there or if we can find solution in the Southeast of the  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:22):**  US, these solutions can be replicated at scale.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:25):**  And there what we will do is we will innovate together with the various partners in the  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:30):**  landscapes to say, for example, how do we measure the forest health knowing that you  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:35):**  got people coming in taking biomass?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:37):**  Are they taking wood for pulp, wood for cellulose, wood for viscose, wood for packaging?  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:44):**  So you've got all these uses and people are not equipped today to have indicators to know  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:49):**  how we manage this forest.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:50):**  So we will work together with them.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:51):**  We'll bring in scientists.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:52):**  We say, hey, how do we keep the finger on the pulse of that forest?  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:56):**  We'll bring technology and we'll go deep.  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:58):**  We'll try.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:21:59):**  We'll try, we'll fail.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:00):**  And eventually we come up with a methodology or a solution that we deliberately want to  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:05):**  remain open source.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:07):**  And then we said, okay, you can use it.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:09):**  I give you a great example, which I'm very proud of, which we did in on forest products.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:14):**  In 2004, we started to work with a timber company in Congo, which had 1.2 million hectares  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:20):**  of management of concessions pristine forest.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:23):**  Not small.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:26):**  Quite a lot.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:27):**  And we had a couple of the Congo basin with the elephants, the gorillas, everything you  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:30):**  can imagine that is pristine about our forest, emblematic animals.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:35):**  And they had a big challenge because they wanted to get this FSC certification, but  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:40):**  they could not because they were pygmy population, indigenous population in the middle who use  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:47):**  the timbers and you need to get their consent and the free prior and informed consent concept  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:52):**  and impossible to get.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:53):**  And we thought, oh.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:55):**  And everyone, the industry was saying, yeah, FSC is bad.  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:58):**  It's impossible for Africa.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:22:59):**  It's not suited for Africa, et cetera.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:01):**  And we thought, how can we unlock that problem?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:04):**  So we worked with this company.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:05):**  We brought scientists from the university college of London.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:08):**  We brought technology company.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:10):**  We started to work and say, how can we get the consent from people who are not literate  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:15):**  semi nomadic and who are not organized in a traditional society?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:19):**  They are little groups of people.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:20):**  There is no boss.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:22):**  So we thought, okay.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:23):**  No, they are organized in a traditional society, but not ours.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:26):**  They were maybe the traditional one.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:28):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:29):**  Not in a traditional way as we think it, as you say.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:32):**  So we worked with them and we found a way where the communities could actually map on  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:36):**  a GPS by themselves, all the trees that are important to them in the forest and say to  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:41):**  the company, don't touch these trees because they are ours.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:45):**  And we need them.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:46):**  Trees for prayer, trees where they eat the caterpillars and everything.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:49):**  And it happened.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:50):**  So we mapped all the trees, the fishing areas, the sacred areas, and you had a new layer  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:23:55):**  of the forest that was the layers of the pygmies coming on top of all the other environmental  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:00):**  and social layers that existed already.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:02):**  It's completely ignored any of these layers.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:04):**  I mean, completely ignored their layer of it.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:07):**  Completely.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:08):**  And the company said, okay, we are committed to manage things in the best possible way.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:11):**  So we'll do that.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:12):**  And we will give up on harvesting those logs, those trees, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:18):**  And it happened.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:19):**  The company got FSC certified.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:20):**  And then what happened is you had a wave of companies who committed to do that in the  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:25):**  Congo Basin.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:26):**  Up to 6 million hectares, I think, got certified.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:29):**  We didn't do it.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:30):**  We just shared the methodology and we created a center for social excellence to train young  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:34):**  experts.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:35):**  So suddenly scale happened because there was a practical solution to a given problem that  
**[0:24:41-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:41):**  created value for everyone.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:43):**  And I think to do this, funnily enough, everyone says, yeah, you need to go to scale.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:48):**  And they think scale first.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:50):**  I think we need to have faith that scale comes when you create something useful, which means  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:24:56):**  letting go of the desire to power and manage everything, control everything, power everything.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:02):**  You need to let go and trust the fact that complex systems will self reorganize.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:07):**  And it's a bit like what happens in nature.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:09):**  Nature comes up with something and then the world reorganizes.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:12):**  It's chaotic.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:13):**  I don't know if you know the theory of chaos in physics, but I very much believe in that  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:17):**  because that's how chain reactions happen.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:20):**  And so all we have to do, focus on trying to solve the problem in a practical way and  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:26):**  work with people to find what creates value for everyone and then share it.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:30):**  Share it with communication, scale it with finance, scale it with technology.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:35):**  There's plenty of tools to scale.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:37):**  Our role is to incubate and make that new solution emerge.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:41):**  And I really believe that that way we can really tackle things at scale without ourselves  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:46):**  becoming big and powerful, et cetera.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:50):**  And we very much see that working in practice.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:52):**  Wow.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:53):**  There's a lot to unpack, but let's start with a devil's advocate question.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:57):**  That sounds amazing.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:25:58):**  Let's say I'm Nestle or I'm a big commodity buyer in general.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:01):**  I'm imagining it's quite difficult for me as a senior manager there to accept this fluid  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:07):**  chaotic process, because I would love to have a project with you.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:10):**  I'm hiring you and there needs to be an outcome ready.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:13):**  And at the same time in that question, actually the company, even if it's one company working  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:17):**  in a much bigger base and the company pays for that process, even though their impact  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:22):**  might be on the whole base and on many other companies that also getting FSC.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:26):**  So there's sort of agreeing to that open source, this chaoticness process that maybe nothing  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:32):**  comes out or maybe something completely different than they imagined or they called you for  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:36):**  like, we need a solution, but we actually already have an idea, but maybe in your work,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:40):**  you find something completely different.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:42):**  How do you deal with very rigid potential clients that are not made for the chaos yet?  
**[0:26:47-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:47):**  Sometimes we don't even deal with them.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:49):**  They don't want to work with us.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:50):**  So I give you again, the metaphor of the doctor for disease or illnesses that are well known.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:26:56):**  There are treatments that are well known and some doctors who are just, you know, even  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:00):**  eyes closed, they said, okay, these guys got a flu, flu, aspirin plus this plus that go  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:06):**  away.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:07):**  And these are the traditional consultants who will churn out a lot of that.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:10):**  And their, their model is to just do as many of that as possible.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:14):**  And then you've got the complicated illnesses, the complex disease, the things that, you  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:20):**  know, it doesn't yet exist, the treatment for deforestation, human exploitation, how  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:25):**  do you change the climate impact of your supply chain, all these things,  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:28):**  Commodifying, huge commodity,  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:32):**  All these things.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:33):**  And then companies, I think it requires doses of humility from the side of companies and  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:37):**  also from our side to say, well, we don't know if we can heal, but what we can do is  
**[0:27:44-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:44):**  to have a go at it.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:46):**  What's our plan is, and this is what we tell companies that we intend to do it this way,  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:50):**  but we constantly review and adapt.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:52):**  So the challenge is this very adaptive and agile nature that we need to keep alongside  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:27:58):**  with key principles that, okay, we will find a solution.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:02):**  We will be open to be surprised by what the reality tells us.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:05):**  So it's a very much agile trial and error process, but guided by the constant desire  
**[0:28:10-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:10):**  to have an impact.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:11):**  And we measure results.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:13):**  We measure results so that we can see is it working or not.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:16):**  How do you measure or what do you measure normally?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:18):**  I mean, it depends obviously, but what are like key metrics that usually come back?  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:22):**  So we try to objectivize nature.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:26):**  So we'll try to measure the deforestation, right?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:28):**  How, how?  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:30):**  Okay.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:31):**  Deforestation, right?  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:32):**  Biomass, forest.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:33):**  I'll take, I'll take proxies for the health of those ecosystems.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:37):**  So soils, soil health, which is based on structure, carbon, et cetera.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:41):**  So we try to measure that.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:43):**  Farmer prosperity, farmer resilience.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:45):**  These are two important things.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:47):**  And then forest health, which is a good proximity, forest density or forest cover.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:51):**  And these are not complicated things to manage and they're good proxies also for the climate  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:56):**  impacts.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:57):**  They are not complicated things to measure.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:28:58):**  Probably they're difficult to manage.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:01):**  So once you know what impact is happening, you try different things to see whether, you  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:05):**  know, the system will change or re-adapt.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:08):**  Just like a farmer tries and say, I'll try that cover crop.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:10):**  I didn't work this year.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:11):**  The yield was not so good.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:13):**  Why?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:14):**  And you constantly try to play with the system to try to adjust.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:17):**  So yes, for big corporates, especially industrial ones who are used to fully control the environment  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:23):**  before they land, they want to know where they start.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:25):**  These five years project, in five years, where will I be?  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:28):**  I can give you an indication of the direction, but I don't give you a guarantee that this  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:31):**  is exactly where you'll be.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:33):**  Magellan, when he started to think, I believe we can go to the Pacific.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:37):**  There is a Pacific Ocean.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:39):**  I believe there is a world without deforestation.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:42):**  But how do we get there?  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:43):**  When is it along the coast of Argentina and he's trying Marda Plata, da da da, and he  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:47):**  doesn't get there.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:48):**  His founders in Spain and in Portugal are like, come on, what is he doing?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:52):**  But somehow they're facing and trusting there must be something and we will find.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:29:57):**  So they were so far away that they couldn't really control him as well.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:00):**  I mean, the communication lines were very, very long.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:03):**  So you had months and months of freedom before the letters arrived.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:07):**  That helps.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:08):**  Unfortunately, the companies keep asking every month where we are on the project, but we  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:12):**  don't have that freedom.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:13):**  But yes, in a way there is trust.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:16):**  There is mutual trust.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:17):**  So we need to deliver progress.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:19):**  But on the other hand, there is a mutual trust and humility from companies saying, we can't  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:23):**  do everything by ourselves.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:24):**  We need others.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:25):**  We need collective action.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:26):**  And here is a path that seems to make sense to us.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:30):**  You know, they trust their gut.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:31):**  They're like, hmm, sounds good.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:33):**  And there is really a typology of company that works with us.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:37):**  These companies that are able to do that and the companies that are not able to let go.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:41):**  And they're like, no, we need to control everything.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:43):**  We need to know the metrics.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:45):**  And these companies, they will try to fall back on more traditional approaches.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:48):**  They will try to seek big coalitions that predefine everything.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:52):**  Logically, it can make sense, but in practice it doesn't work.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:30:56):**  Yeah, you mentioned in a pre-interview, like as soon as you get to the big consortium,  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:01):**  big groups, scale becomes political very quickly and thus everything stops or moves in an incredibly  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:08):**  slow pace.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:09):**  And that's one of the reasons you chose to go deep and really deep into and not choose  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:14):**  to have every buyer of every palm oil or every buyer of every pulp combined into tackling  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:20):**  these issues.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:21):**  Yes.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:22):**  It's a different theory of change than the one that has been predominant for the last  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:25):**  20 years, which was to say, let's agree on what sustainability is.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:30):**  Let's agree on what regeneration is, which nobody knows.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:34):**  And then you often you've got a group of people who try to hijack the discussion and say,  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:38):**  this is what it's going to be.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:40):**  And they try to use their political power to impose a certain vision.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:44):**  It is doomed to fail.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:45):**  Why?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:46):**  Because when you put people together, inevitably it becomes political unless you have nature  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:50):**  in the middle or a map or something to discuss concretely.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:53):**  But if it's just to align, it becomes political.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:31:56):**  Two, to stay relevant, they will need to have everyone on board.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:00):**  To have everyone on board, you need to dilute your values and you need to adopt the lowest  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:04):**  common denominator.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:05):**  So it will lose ambition.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:07):**  And third, last but not least, if you don't work with the farmers, if you don't work with  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:12):**  the communities on the ground, with the people who are managing the land, you're missing  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:16):**  the main actors.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:18):**  And so if all the corporates and governments sit down together and say, this is what it's  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:22):**  going to be, it is inevitably profiting them first.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:26):**  It's not co-design, therefore it will never go to scale.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:29):**  Therefore it's going to have to be pushed onto people and therefore it will never work.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:33):**  Extractive.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:34):**  Extractive.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:35):**  It has to be extractive.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:36):**  Top down and it doesn't work.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:37):**  So we prefer this bottom up approach, supporting by a kind top down approach, bottom up, rooted  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:44):**  in practice, rooted in concrete, producing solutions that create value and that by themselves  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:49):**  they can scale.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:50):**  And just to give an indication, and actually we get to the name then, because we started  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:55):**  and it was called the Forest Trust.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:32:57):**  You took over in 2016, you decided to change the name.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:00):**  Can you give a bit of an indication, first of all, why, and also what's the size of the  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:05):**  organization just to give an indication that it's not three people in a room somewhere,  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:10):**  it's actually quite sizable.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:11):**  And then we get to why earth work.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:13):**  So the founder, Scott Poynton, he's a great guy who started the organization.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:17):**  When was that?  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:18):**  It was in 1999.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:20):**  He's got a blog and I encourage you to have a look at it.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:23):**  When he started the organization, he was very inspired by earthworms.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:27):**  And it's been something that we've always had within the organization.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:31):**  And when he stepped down and I stepped in, this idea of being named earthworm was not  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:36):**  new.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:37):**  This is something we wanted to do.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:38):**  And so I decided, let's go for it.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:40):**  And it was a bit of a shock initially because it's not like we're going to be called the  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:44):**  eagle or the bull or something quite powerful.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:48):**  Earthworm is a bit dirty.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:50):**  It's not the animal you necessarily identify to.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:52):**  You don't want to touch.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:53):**  I do, but some people think, oh, yeah, it's a bit weird, but actually it's one of the  
**[0:33:58-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:33:58):**  most powerful animals, one of the most powerful, relevant in the universe.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:02):**  And I'm glad you're saying that because that's the way we see it as well for us.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:06):**  An earthworm is, it's the best symbol of circularity.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:09):**  It recycles constantly.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:11):**  It connects the world between the surface and the depths.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:15):**  We talk to NGOs, we talk to communities.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:16):**  We talk to big multinationals.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:18):**  We try to connect these people to create something fertile.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:22):**  And the earthworm does that.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:23):**  It connects the organic and the mineral and eventually produces humus, which is something  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:28):**  that nests life, that hosts life.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:31):**  So we like that.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:32):**  And we also like the idea of working at the roots of supply chains where it's needed and  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:36):**  getting our boots on the ground and our hands dirty with mud.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:40):**  Okay.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:41):**  It doesn't have hands nor feet, but you see the metaphor.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:44):**  And that's how we thought that we need to become who we are.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:47):**  We had not had the opportunity to do that before, but then it made total sense to become  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:52):**  who we wanted to be.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:53):**  Also because you are more and more into agriculture and I mean, obviously very deep into forest,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:34:59):**  but not only anymore.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:00):**  Yes.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:01):**  Can you describe a bit of your work, let's say on row cropping or nonforest commodities  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:06):**  at the moment?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:07):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:08):**  And so it made sense to say, you know, earthworm, you find them in the forest, you find them  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:10):**  in agricultural fields and you find them in companies.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:14):**  All the people we work with, they are earthworms within their companies.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:17):**  One day there was a lady from the bank.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:19):**  She said, you know, I'm the earthworm here.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:21):**  I'm the earthworm in this bank.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:23):**  And I like the image because it's that this relentless cultivation of life, whatever happens,  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:29):**  whatever is dumped on the soil, you know, problems, et cetera, the person keeps going  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:34):**  and trying to cultivate something healthy and fertile.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:37):**  And I really like that.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:38):**  Maybe just to answer your question, the organization today is about 230 people around the world.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:44):**  We are in 16 offices, but 80% of the staff is really on the ground, close to supplier,  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:49):**  farmers, forest, and working actively in landscapes.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:53):**  And what kind of clients, I mean, you mentioned a few, what are the biggest commodities or  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:35:57):**  biggest crops you work in or the biggest landscape, whatever you want to define it.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:01):**  Somebody asks you about your clients.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:02):**  What do you answer?  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:03):**  We work with a lot of brands and some of their suppliers.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:07):**  Among the biggest brands will be Nestle, Ferraro, Mars, Racket Bank, Kaiser, Pizet, Carson's  
**[0:36:13-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:13):**  brands who are relying on natural materials, be there, Poppin paper, rubber, palm, cocoa,  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:20):**  soy, cereals, things that will go really in their products and be important for them.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:25):**  And then we'll engage their suppliers and some of the suppliers like, oh, I like this  
**[0:36:28-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:28):**  approach.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:29):**  I want to apply it not just for that client, but for everyone.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:32):**  And that's what we do.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:33):**  Sometimes we engage with investors as well, who are more and more starting to think, you  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:37):**  know, I'm invested in all these companies, how are they doing?  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:40):**  How can I get them to embark on an approach that is transformative?  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:43):**  And so we'll work with them.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:45):**  How many clients do you have in Togo?  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:47):**  We work with about 120 companies.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:49):**  The smallest one probably is a charcoal producer in the east of France and the biggest one  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:54):**  will be Nestle outside.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:55):**  Wow.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:56):**  The full value chain.  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:58):**  That's very interesting.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:36:59):**  And in terms of outside, I mean, you mentioned cereals and grains.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:02):**  Have you seen that grow like the agriculture and not necessarily the agroforestry piece?  
**[0:37:07-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:07):**  Is that something that has been moving?  
**[0:37:09-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:09):**  You mean the, how companies are priced?  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:11):**  Yeah, no, row cropping as well.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:12):**  I mean, obviously Nestle buys everything, but you've started, I think working with them  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:17):**  mostly on the forestry products or the plantation products.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:20):**  How has been your shift or not your broader focus now on agriculture?  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:25):**  What I'd say, look, is that a lot of companies have engaged on their raw material purchase  
**[0:37:31-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:31):**  through risk management.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:33):**  So the 2000s, the year 2000s, you know, we're marked by, oh shit, we need to find out.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:39):**  Where'd that come from?  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:40):**  And we need to clear that risk.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:42):**  We don't want a problem.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:43):**  We don't want a reputational issue.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:46):**  So the management would tell the people in the sourcing, do whatever it takes to solve  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:50):**  that problem.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:51):**  I don't want my name in the papers.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:52):**  That was the mandate initially.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:55):**  And you go only that far with that Monday because you just, you don't really engage  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:37:59):**  in regeneration.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:00):**  The bare minimum.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:03):**  You try to clear out the risk, but eventually it's not fully associated to the creation  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:06):**  of value.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:07):**  What's happening, I would say since a few years now is that you have another community  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:12):**  asking companies to change.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:14):**  Before it was the NGOs.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:16):**  Now it's the NGOs plus the consumers plus the investors.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:21):**  Consumers and investors are much more important to your bottom line if you're a company,  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:24):**  to your survival, economic survival than NGOs.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:28):**  So it's creating different things.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:30):**  The leaders that are put at the head of companies, they need to have sustainability in mind.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:35):**  Let's take the new CEO of Airbus.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:37):**  He had, and one of his key things, Guillaume-Fourie is, you know, how do we shift aviation?  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:42):**  Right.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:43):**  Big challenge.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:44):**  But that's also why probably as a CEO, he can't dismiss the topic.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:48):**  He's being asked by investors to deal with that.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:51):**  Mark Schneider, the CEO of Nestle is the same.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:54):**  He has to put sustainability and take it in account as part of one of his key objectives.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:38:59):**  One.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:00):**  Two.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:01):**  He's asking, do I want to buy a fake story about this chocolate bar or can you tell me  
**[0:39:06-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:06):**  the real story?  
**[0:39:07-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:07):**  Because otherwise I'm going to shift to another brand.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:10):**  I'm going to shift to the local cereal, Bean to Bar, who can tell whose story is the very  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:14):**  story of how it's been made by home, etc.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:17):**  But if I buy it from you, I get something a bit fake and I don't know really where it  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:21):**  comes from and people are telling me it's bad.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:24):**  So I'm going to probably shift.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:26):**  So there is an inherent need to shift that is being put back to the businesses by consumers  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:31):**  and investors.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:33):**  And then it makes businesses think, hey, I really need to embrace that differently.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:37):**  So what the change is marked by much more proactivity from companies to say, I want  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:45):**  to know where it comes from.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:46):**  I want it to be good.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:47):**  I want it to be good for planet, for people.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:49):**  Please help me.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:50):**  So it's not about why should I do it?  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:52):**  It's about how can I do it?  
**[0:39:53-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:53):**  And what's fascinating is we see a big appetite despite the current recession to keep that  
**[0:39:59-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:39:59):**  journey going.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:00):**  We were expecting that people would completely drop their investment in these aspects because  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:04):**  it was kind of CSR stuff.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:06):**  It's not.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:07):**  It's like we want to accelerate.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:09):**  The climate crisis is still there.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:10):**  COVID is linked to that.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:11):**  We'll have other episodes like that.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:13):**  So we need to change.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:14):**  And of course, some companies are suffering, but we can see the intentions are still there.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:18):**  No, that's very interesting.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:20):**  To shift gears a bit, I mean, you mentioned already investors a few times and you have  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:24):**  an interesting overview of the sector, obviously, as you are deep into the supply chains and  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:28):**  you know the brands.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:29):**  And so it's a question I like to ask if you tomorrow morning, you wake up and you're the  
**[0:40:34-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:34):**  head of an investment fund of a $1 billion investment fund.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:37):**  Let's put a nice amount in that.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:39):**  How would you put that to work?  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:40):**  Obviously, we're not giving investment advice here, but I'm very curious on your view of  
**[0:40:45-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:45):**  where you think a fund like that.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:47):**  That's investment, they're not grants, but they could be very long term investments.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:51):**  What would you do?  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:52):**  What I observe today is that there has been a lot of investment going to the downstream.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:40:58):**  So the downstream of the supply chain for me is the part that is closest to the consumer  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:02):**  and the upstream is closest to the farmer.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:05):**  If you look at how many brands and how much investment is put into the downstream to optimize  
**[0:41:13-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:13):**  the route of the yogurt pot between the industry and the retailer, how do we make sure the  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:19):**  packaging is lighter, that the cardboard box is this and that and everything is optimized  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:24):**  to the maximum.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:25):**  And then a lot of investment and business models are being developed there.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:29):**  It's also where people are in the cities.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:31):**  So they look at what they've got around them and they start developing ideas and pitching  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:35):**  to people who have money, who are in the cities, these kind of same things.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:39):**  The same bubble.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:41):**  The same bubble.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:42):**  And they start to suck very quickly because they're like, well, you know, that's not really  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:44):**  changing the world a little bit, but you know.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:46):**  Most of the impact is not downstream.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:48):**  It's upstream.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:49):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:50):**  The impact on forest, on people, on climate is upstream.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:53):**  And this realization is accompanied by the fact that when you look at what's happening  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:41:58):**  between the farmer and his first client, the co-op or the guy who buys his raw materials,  
**[0:42:03-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:03):**  there is very little innovation.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:05):**  I would say near to nothing.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:07):**  It's like a dessert.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:08):**  So if you put a little bit of money there to sprout new ideas, to incubate new ideas  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:14):**  or to stimulate new ideas, there is entrepreneurship.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:17):**  You look at Africa, for example, there's lots of entrepreneurs there, but they are not revealed.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:21):**  They're not supported.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:22):**  So you don't have a deal flow of investment coming out of that.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:26):**  But that's where investment could make a lot of difference.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:29):**  I give you an example.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:31):**  We're in the pinemold supply chain of Nestle.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:33):**  We have companies in Ivory Coast who supply pinemold.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:37):**  So the farmers harvest the palm, they put it on the side of the road, and then the meal  
**[0:42:40-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:40):**  comes and collects them.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:42):**  As part of a diagnostic, we talked to the meal and the meal says, oh, you know what?  
**[0:42:45-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:45):**  These guys are useless.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:47):**  Whenever we come to pick up the fruit with the trucks, the fruits are rotten.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:51):**  And when we go to the meal, we can process them, the quality goes down, et cetera.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:55):**  Palmol, you need to process it within 24 hours.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:42:58):**  And then on the side, we talked to the farmers and the farmers said, oh, these meals are  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:01):**  really useless.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:02):**  You know, they always come up late.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:06):**  So we said, OK, let's coordinate.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:07):**  So we take a piece of paper, we put it in the village, and we said the truck will be  
**[0:43:11-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:11):**  there on Tuesday.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:12):**  And the truck is there on Tuesday.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:14):**  And then the fruits are picked up.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:15):**  So farmers get more money, the meal gets more money, everyone's winning.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:19):**  And a lot more production because you reduce waste.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:22):**  I mean, this is dead simple.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:25):**  We then talk to people to say, look, why don't you invest a bit of time to make that digital?  
**[0:43:30-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:30):**  Everyone's got a smartphone, you just can coordinate this kind of stuff.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:33):**  And then we put it into the hands of local entrepreneurs and they're developing this  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:36):**  kind of stuff.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:37):**  So I'm thinking this is just giving a little bit of attention to a problem which is present  
**[0:43:43-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:43):**  all across Africa, touches all the smallholders, and could drastically reduce the waste, drastically  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:49):**  reduce the need for expanding a new plantation, drastically increase farmers income.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:43:54):**  So to respond to your question, let's take some of that billion and put it to identify  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:00):**  opportunities.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:02):**  Identify opportunities at the very roots of the supply chain in between the farmer.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:07):**  But you're meaning one step after the farmer.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:10):**  That is the sweet spot you're talking about.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:12):**  Yes.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:13):**  All the fertilizer chemical companies, they have a lot of thinking around how do we make  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:17):**  the farmer more efficient?  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:18):**  There's a lot of business around data and technology.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:19):**  How do we get the data from the farmer?  
**[0:44:21-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:22):**  Okay.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:23):**  That's all right.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:24):**  And I think it's probably too much thinking going in there.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:26):**  I would really focus on that first step on the collaboration and all the opportunities  
**[0:44:31-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:31):**  around the value chain connection, supply chain connection that exists between the farmer  
**[0:44:35-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:35):**  and his first client.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:36):**  There is a lot there.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:37):**  The first chain, basically the first piece.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:39):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:40):**  That would be a first thing.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:42):**  And then I would really use the money.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:44):**  And this is my second point to ignite, to start, to seed fund, to try and fail, because  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:51):**  I believe the funds, the big funds are there.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:54):**  The other billions are there to scale up.  
**[0:44:56-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:56):**  I'm not worried about that.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:44:57):**  Now, I'm asking this question literally because I made a prediction.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:00):**  I don't know if it was pre-COVID, but this year we as a sector, but probably maybe me  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:06):**  even would get calls from people saying, okay, I'm ready to put serious amount of money to  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:11):**  work.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:12):**  So where do I go?  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:13):**  And I'm not giving investment advice, but I'm also thinking, are we as a sector ready  
**[0:45:18-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:18):**  to absorb that?  
**[0:45:19-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:19):**  So I have no doubt that the money is coming or maybe even already there and knocking on  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:22):**  some of our doors of people that we've interviewed or other people in this space, and they're  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:27):**  going to be nine zeros and maybe even more.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:29):**  The question is, do we have the infrastructure?  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:32):**  Do we have the tissue to put that to work?  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:35):**  Well before I answer that question, I would say, my view is where do you focus?  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:39):**  So you focus at the roots of the supply chain and you focus on the risky stuff, taking risks  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:44):**  and because the scale up thing and will come from others.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:47):**  Okay.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:48):**  Or you split your thing into one thing that is less risky and one thing that is more risky.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:52):**  But you can take a portfolio approach.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:54):**  Yeah, you could.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:56):**  You're in charge, you can do whatever you want.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:57):**  Exactly.  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:58):**  So I take a portfolio approach.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:45:59):**  I put something on things that are already scaling up.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:01):**  So I'm almost sure I'm going to get a return.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:03):**  And then I'm taking the other half on risky things really at the roots of supply chain,  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:08):**  Indonesia, Africa.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:10):**  And then I try to work with a coalition of actors, which is backed by the offtake of  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:16):**  big companies.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:17):**  So a Nestle can say, yeah, I'm going to continue to buy that palm oil, but if you can make  
**[0:46:21-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:21):**  it better, I will continue to buy it.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:23):**  I can commit that I'll stay and stick with this supplier because if he makes a fault  
**[0:46:27-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:27):**  to change, I'll stick to that.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:28):**  And that's the first point for an investor is to have a strong offtaker.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:32):**  So within those supply chain, not somewhere else, within those supply chain, I will work  
**[0:46:37-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:37):**  with that.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:38):**  I will connect with any organization that helps in stimulating entrepreneurship.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:42):**  We've got a great organization called Seedstars around here.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:45):**  They do incubation work in Africa, in developing countries, mostly on entrepreneurship and  
**[0:46:50-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:50):**  tech.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:51):**  Let's take these guys to the countryside and rural areas.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:53):**  I'll connect with universities and young people.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:46:57):**  Otherwise they keep coming up with better yogurt roots for stuff.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:00):**  No, they need to come up with stuff for farmers.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:03):**  And connect with local organization, people who have boots on the ground.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:07):**  We'd be happy to participate to this kind of stuff and identify, okay, here, there is  
**[0:47:11-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:11):**  an opportunity.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:12):**  Here, there is an opportunity.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:13):**  Lots of organization locally are in touch with farmers.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:16):**  They are in touch with those opportunities, but they can't come and tell you, this is  
**[0:47:20-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:20):**  a company that you can fund because often the investors are like, oh, it's too risky.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:24):**  I need to have my return, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:26):**  So it's about creating a fertile environment within supply chains, at the roots of supply  
**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:32):**  chain to take some risks, try things out.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:35):**  And you can be sure because it's so desertic in terms of funding there that if you put  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:40):**  a little bit of investment with this entrepreneurial spirit in connection with the purchase from  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:45):**  brands, you will succeed.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:47):**  As I said with the example on palm oil in Ivory Coast, there's so much to do.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:51):**  There's so much to do.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:52):**  So the value is there.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:53):**  You almost have to pick it from the trees, but you need to get organized to have a basket.  
**[0:47:57-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:57):**  A low hanging fruit, literally.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:47:59):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:00):**  So you would pick Indonesia, palm oil and Africa.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:02):**  What would you do in Africa?  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:03):**  I mean, where does it hurt the most, do you think?  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:05):**  No, I'd put Indonesia as a whole, not just palm oil, but I would pick region.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:09):**  In Indonesia, Africa are places where that's, you could have a huge impact on ecosystems  
**[0:48:16-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:16):**  and on people by looking at that.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:18):**  I give you another example because to me it's so impressive.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:22):**  We worked a bit with Givaudan in flavors and fragrance supply chains and, you know, Vetiver  
**[0:48:27-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:27):**  and Patrick.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:28):**  Sorry, for anybody, who are they?  
**[0:48:30-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:30):**  What do they do?  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:31):**  So Givaudan is one of the leading brands that supplies all the flavors and fragrances that  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:36):**  you will use in products, in food, et cetera.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:39):**  So they have hundreds of raw materials from, you know, orange peel to turpentines to patchouli  
**[0:48:46-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:46):**  and Vetiver and all these things that you will use.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:50):**  They do it chemically, but they also have a big division on naturals.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:53):**  And the appetite from the market is, okay, can we have natural products?  
**[0:48:57-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:57):**  So the natural flavors are important.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:48:59):**  So they go all around the world and they source those raw materials.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:03):**  And we realized that in Indonesia, they source Vetiver and patchouli and we studied the process.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:08):**  They are a grass and a little tree, a little bush, and that, you know, you can harvest  
**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:14):**  their flowers, fruits, roots, and then you can process them into flavor.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:18):**  So you have to distill.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:20):**  So you heat the water, you process it, and then you will collect the essential oil, which  
**[0:49:24-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:24):**  is a real small fraction of it.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:26):**  So what you need to do on the agricultural side, a lot of things have already been done.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:31):**  But then when you look at the transformation in distillation process, lots of very artisanal  
**[0:49:36-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:36):**  distillers burn a lot of wood to heat up the water, boil it, collect the essential oil,  
**[0:49:43-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:43):**  and then they have to cool it down.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:44):**  So they take the water from the river, they heat the water from the river, which has huge  
**[0:49:47-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:47):**  impacts, and then they cool it down.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:50):**  We sent one student for three months to look at the process and like, look, we could really  
**[0:49:54-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:54):**  recover the heat from that system.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:49:57):**  So you don't have to use so much wood, which is coming from illegal areas and sometimes,  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:01):**  and you could really transform the process.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:03):**  So we sat down with Givaudan to say, okay, and this is a discussion that is ongoing,  
**[0:50:07-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:07):**  how can we create a more efficient distillation and create models that are practically working  
**[0:50:13-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:13):**  for the communities who distill?  
**[0:50:15-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:15):**  It's not a huge investment, but could be backed up by Givaudan to scale.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:19):**  And this has been, you know, these kind of ideas that are, as you said, low hanging fruits,  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:24):**  just have to study a bit, take interest in what's happening, and then you see opportunities  
**[0:50:27-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:27):**  to drive change at scale.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:28):**  Yeah, I remember I interviewed Paul Chatterton of WWF or of the Sustainable Finance or the  
**[0:50:35-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:35):**  Landscape Finance Lab.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:37):**  And one of, they were working in the supply chain of H&M, I think, one of the main negative  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:41):**  impacts was actually the dyeing industries or the coloring industry and was one of the  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:46):**  main reasons of deforestation in, I think, Bangladesh, in one of the, I'm getting the  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:51):**  country wrong, because they needed the boilers, they needed the hot water.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:54):**  So they figured, and many of them could be greatly replaced by solar, etc.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:50:58):**  Just that nobody looked at what was the reason of deforestation.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:02):**  It wasn't the wood.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:03):**  Yeah, it was the wood to burn, the water to boil for the coloring of the, and that was  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:07):**  a huge, or is still, they're working on it, a huge negative impact on the supply chain  
**[0:51:12-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:12):**  of H&M, which probably they never even knew.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:15):**  And because nobody went there and asked the questions before.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:18):**  But the landscape was being deforested because they were coloring the clothing.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:21):**  And the solution is not to say, hey, guys, don't do this.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:24):**  No, because you just look at how much they pay.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:27):**  The little entrepreneurs, they still, they pay 25, 30, up to 40% of their cost is fuel  
**[0:51:33-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:33):**  cost.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:34):**  Fuel cost to be able to power the machine.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:37):**  If you tell them, look, you want to reduce your fuel cost, but you need to go through  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:40):**  a phase where your risk is going to be backed by some investment, and maybe some projects,  
**[0:51:45-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:45):**  subsidy assistance, etc.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:46):**  That will work.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:47):**  It's not complicated.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:48):**  Transition finance.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:50):**  So with the 1 billion, we could do a lot.  
**[0:51:52-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:51:52):**  It's I think one of the most unsexy, sexy thing is flexible, fair, well-structured working  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:01):**  capital, which probably is going to change the world in many, many ways.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:05):**  But it's something that we greatly overlook in transition from farmers and transition  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:08):**  for companies.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:09):**  Like there is a way to transition.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:12):**  We know there are more efficient ways, but of course there might be some years where  
**[0:52:15-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:15):**  you can take a hit or your yields go down or your production goes down or et cetera,  
**[0:52:19-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:19):**  et cetera.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:20):**  But if you structure that well, you can go through it.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:23):**  And that's why I think finance is so interesting because you can help companies, farmers, consumers  
**[0:52:28-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:28):**  go through that transition and you can finance that.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:31):**  Partly blended, partly investor.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:33):**  I mean, whatever situation, I don't say everything has to be a financial investment obviously,  
**[0:52:38-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:38):**  but money can play a very interesting transition role there.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:41):**  I would indeed really look at not doing it alone.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:45):**  So I would involve brands as off takers.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:48):**  I would work in the supply chain and I would definitely go for blended finance because  
**[0:52:53-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:53):**  some of the things that will be achieved are for common good.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:52:57):**  So there are a lot of public finance that is coming in as a grantee, as a support.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:02):**  And then I would go for subsidies and grants to compliment some of the things that need  
**[0:53:06-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:06):**  to be done that could be done through a subsidy or grant so that it doesn't affect the yield  
**[0:53:11-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:11):**  or the return of the investment.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:12):**  So I would really try to do this collectively.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:15):**  We've been talking with BNP Paribas.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:17):**  There's a guy there, Pierre Rousseau, who's doing an amazing job in starting these kinds  
**[0:53:21-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:21):**  of projects.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:22):**  So this is the approach that we often like to take.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:26):**  And that's what we would do if we had 1 billion of investment.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:29):**  It's very interesting.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:30):**  I recorded or we recorded last week with the Perennial Fund, who has been a few times on  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:34):**  the show actually, and will be out soon, hopefully.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:37):**  And their strategy of financing the transition of farmers in the US has been on three pillars.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:43):**  One is access to peer support, that you need others that are on the same journey or that  
**[0:53:47-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:47):**  are a few steps ahead.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:49):**  You need to see, touch, feel as a farmer, but also as an entrepreneur that this is possible,  
**[0:53:52-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:52):**  that is not crazy.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:54):**  Access to independent advice, like you need someone that's not paid by an input company  
**[0:53:58-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:53:58):**  to tell you how to apply, how to do, you need good agronomic in case of a farmer advice.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:04):**  Access to markets, both the off-take agreements during the transition and after, in the case  
**[0:54:09-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:09):**  of organic, in the case of regenerative organic, you need a company that says, I'm going to  
**[0:54:13-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:13):**  buy it.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:14):**  I'm committing to off-taking, off-take for the common good, maybe carbon, maybe water,  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:20):**  maybe biodiversity.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:21):**  That depends where you are, what is possible.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:23):**  And then the third, but only the third, not the first two, because the first two are access  
**[0:54:26-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:26):**  to support and access to markets is capital.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:29):**  Could be flexible, blended, a mix of everything, but it's not, I mean, without those, it needs  
**[0:54:34-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:34):**  to be the three of them because without the market, none of the entrepreneurs are going  
**[0:54:37-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:37):**  to move.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:38):**  And of course they don't even know it's possible, let alone, obviously they're not going to  
**[0:54:42-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:42):**  move.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:43):**  So you need that, these three puzzle pieces for a successful, I think, transition in general.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:46):**  And they really nailed that in terms of, of agriculture piece.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:50):**  And I'm very excited to share the podcast.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:52):**  We'll be out when you're listening to this probably.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:54):**  So go and go and find it.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:55):**  But they are, it's very interesting that transition finance piece, it's not necessarily only about  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:54:59):**  the finance.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:00):**  It needs the other pieces because otherwise we're just throwing money at something and  
**[0:55:03-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:03):**  putting more depth on the books of entrepreneurs and farmers, which honestly don't really need  
**[0:55:07-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:07):**  it.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:08):**  It's going to be funny how much something as unsexy as working capital is going to change  
**[0:55:14-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:14):**  things.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:15):**  That's a, so I think it's a transition capital is going to be a big driver.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:19):**  Yes.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:21):**  So we took away, we talked about the fund.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:22):**  You're no longer in charge of that fund, unfortunately, but you have a magic power to change one thing  
**[0:55:28-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:28):**  overnight in the agricultural, but definitely let's say the land use industry.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:32):**  What would you use your magic wand for?  
**[0:55:35-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:35):**  You can change one thing overnight.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:36):**  What would that be?  
**[0:55:37-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:37):**  It would give a connection to nature and to life sciences and some kind of basic education  
**[0:55:44-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:44):**  about how nature works to every business person in the world.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:48):**  That would make every CEO of a company aware of what are the nature's processes and how  
**[0:55:54-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:54):**  they as a human being are connected and relying on nature.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:55:59):**  That awareness, if it could be instantly put in them in the hearts, in the minds and in  
**[0:56:03-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:03):**  their guts.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:04):**  You can, you have the power, Ross.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:06):**  It would be, I think, a life changing because somehow it would facilitate and accelerate  
**[0:56:12-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:12):**  the alignment and the decision making because it comes from the gut.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:17):**  You know, when someone makes a decision, it comes from the gut as much as from the heart  
**[0:56:22-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:22):**  and the minds.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:23):**  But I would put them connected to that so that they are quicker in making decisions.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:27):**  They are quicker in taking risks, in embracing the unknown and having this faith that nature  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:33):**  can do it and that solutions will emerge, etc., etc.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:37):**  Not trying to control everything, but releasing a bit of control and trusting.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:40):**  I think it's a really good answer.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:43):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't believe to be  
**[0:56:47-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:47):**  true?  
**[0:56:48-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:48):**  And I definitely stole, slash borrowed this question from John Kemp, who you often ask  
**[0:56:53-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:53):**  is about agriculture in general.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:54):**  So what do you believe to be true that you see others actually not really believe?  
**[0:56:59-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:56:59):**  Well, what I believe is that nature does it for you.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:02):**  And because it does it for you, it costs less.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:06):**  And therefore it's beneficial economically.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:09):**  Often people think that regenerative agriculture is another layer of a punitive ecology approach.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:16):**  You know, it's going to be a series of don't dos, and therefore they're going to be costs  
**[0:57:20-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:20):**  and you're going to produce less, etc.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:23):**  Because it's, you know, how normative and punitive ecology has been imposed or proposed  
**[0:57:28-0:57:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:28):**  to farmers in the past.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:30):**  The thing is, as soon as you do it, you realize that the earthworms, they do plow for you.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:36):**  And when they do that, actually, you don't need to go out with your tractor and your  
**[0:57:39-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:39):**  plow and spend time, money, petrol to do that.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:44):**  But to be able to realize that this little earthworm is going to plow that field for  
**[0:57:49-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:49):**  you.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:50):**  If you just give him some feed, which means planting some seeds.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:54):**  This is a paradigm shift.  
**[0:57:56-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:56):**  We don't think like that.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:57:57):**  So we as humans, we believe and we had to do that.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:01):**  We had to dominate nature in a way to survive.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:05):**  We had, I was reading Lewis and Clark, they were killing bears every day to survive and  
**[0:58:11-0:58:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:11):**  to eat.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:12):**  So they had to fight against nature.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:14):**  We know in a new era where we recognize nature is fragile, but also incredibly powerful.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:20):**  So we can work with her to unlock that power.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:24):**  And that will make us realize that actually we don't have to do everything ourselves.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:28):**  Nature does it for us.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:29):**  And we have to trust that.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:30):**  It's just a bit like the planting of trees.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:33):**  You know, instead of conserving forest and let nature plant trees, we want to all go  
**[0:58:37-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:37):**  out and plant lots of trees.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:39):**  That's good.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:40):**  But just realize that nature does it faster, better and cheaper than us.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:44):**  I think it's a perfect way to end this conversation.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:47):**  Thank you Bastien for your time, for your openness.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:51):**  And I don't think it's the last time we talk.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:54):**  I hope it's not the last time we talk.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:58:56):**  I think we learned a lot on commodities, on large companies, on what is possible on the  
**[0:59:00-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=0:59:00):**  ground and how to make change.

**[1:00:06-1:00:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:00:06):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:00:10-1:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:00:10):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:00:14):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:00:16-1:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:00:16):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:00:20-1:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:00:20):**  to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:00:25-1:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:00:25):**  these podcasts since 2016.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:00:27):**  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[1:01:24-1:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:01:24):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:01:26):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:01:30):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[1:01:35-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:01:35):**  different means.

**[1:01:45-1:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:01:45):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:01:46-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:01:46):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[1:01:53-1:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:01:53):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:01:55-1:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:01:55):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:02:00-1:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:00):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:02:05-1:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:05):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:02:10-1:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:10):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:11):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:02:16-1:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:16):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:20):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:25):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:02:26-1:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:26):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:28):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:30):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:34):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:36):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/23/bastien-sachet#t=1:02:41):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

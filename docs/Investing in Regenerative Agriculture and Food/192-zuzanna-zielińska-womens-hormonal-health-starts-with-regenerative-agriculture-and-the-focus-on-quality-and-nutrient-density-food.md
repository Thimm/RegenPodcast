### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 08 Nov 2022 17:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:00):**  Healthy soils lead to healthy produce, lead to healthy gut system and lead to healthy people.  
**[0:00:04-0:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:04):**  The 60 pages of references on the book of Anne Bickley and David R Montgomery clearly show this connection.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:11):**  If you want to know more, we interviewed them before and I will put a link below.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:14):**  So how can we use this fact to build scalable companies and reach the people that are currently not being reached?  
**[0:00:21-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:21):**  Our guests today decided to focus on women's hormonal health and specifically polycystic ovary syndrome, PCOS,  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:29):**  which is the most common endocrine, which is hormonal disorder for women of reproductive age.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:35):**  About 20% of women suffer from this.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:37):**  Why? Because all the toxicity in our current food system masses with our hormones  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:42):**  and this can be managed by lifestyle changes and more importantly, diets.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:49):**  What are the connections between healthy farming practices, healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy gut and healthy people?  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:56):**  Welcome to a special series where we go deep into the relationship between regenerative agriculture practices  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:01):**  that build soil health and the nutritional quality of the food we end up eating.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:06):**  We unpack the current state of science, the role of investments, businesses, nonprofits, entrepreneurs and more.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:11):**  This series is supported by the 18 Foundation, who support food and land projects that are ecologically,  
**[0:01:17-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:17):**  economically and socially conscious.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:19):**  They contribute to a wider movement that envisions a future where real food is produced by enlightened agriculture  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:25):**  and access to it is equal.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:27):**  The 18 Foundation are looking to make more investments and grants in the space of bio-nutrients.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:32):**  You can find more here, 18foundation.org or get in touch directly info at 18foundation.org  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:40):**  or check the information in the show notes below.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:50):**  Welcome to another episode today with the founder of Harvest Care, Susanna,  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:54):**  which we go deep into nutrient density, potentially my favorite subject of this podcast.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:59):**  So I'm very, very happy to have Susanna here.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:02):**  Welcome and thank you so much for joining us.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:04):**  Thank you so much for being here.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:07):**  So we met, I will put the link below, obviously with the interview we did with Bart through Fresh Ventures,  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:13):**  but I would love to, which is a venture studio based in Rotterdam focused on regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:19):**  I would love to know a bit more about how, like your story, how did you end up focusing on soil  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:24):**  and then focusing on the health side of humans and that connection to healthy soil?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:28):**  Like what's the meandering river into that or what's the story into that?  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:33):**  Yeah, so I was very, very lucky because I have studied global health nutrition in Denmark.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:41):**  And then our first semester we had half a year dedicated for agriculture.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:47):**  And I remember sitting in that class and being...  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:51):**  I don't think that's normal just for anybody that I don't think many of these studies take,  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:57):**  okay, let's start at the basis, let's start at soil.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:59):**  I think that's, you were lucky or did you pick that one specifically for that or you just...  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:03):**  No, no, it was just the design of the program.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:06):**  And, you know, I remember sitting in the class and being taught about no till agriculture.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:11):**  And back then, like, it didn't make any sense.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:13):**  I was like, what the heck is happening?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:16):**  And then we even would go to like 30 kilometers from where my university was.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:21):**  We had one of the only, I think, organic farming school in whole Europe.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:25):**  So we'd also have a tour out there.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:28):**  And yeah, as you said, like, I'm super lucky.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:33):**  I think, like, I would assume that it's one of the only universities in Europe that actually  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:38):**  taught about the food production in quite a bit.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:41):**  And I think from then on, something clicked, like, something really clicked very deep in  
**[0:03:50-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:50):**  me.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:52):**  I think I never really resonate with the approach to dieting as, you know, something that you  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:59):**  use to restrict your calories and something that you do to have your summer body.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:05):**  And I think there is so much toxicity coming from all sorts of industries that benefit  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:11):**  on people, yeah, on making people feel uncomfortable in what they eat and how they look.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:19):**  And I think that was it.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:21):**  That was for me, like, a completely different look and a completely different approach to  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:26):**  our food and what food means to us and to our ecosystem.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:29):**  And I think from then on, it was just like a continuous path towards soil and agriculture.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:37):**  But you didn't become a farmer.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:39):**  Like, you decided to, or did you try that?  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:41):**  Like, what's the, did you go, what was the obvious next step after that study for you?  
**[0:04:46-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:47):**  So, yeah, that was one of the first semesters.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:51):**  I still had, like, many semesters to come because I actually just graduated my bachelor  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:55):**  like half a year ago.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:57):**  So everything is quite fresh.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:58):**  And yeah, so I was, we had the chance to go on an internship and I, back then I was working  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:07):**  in a coffee shop.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:08):**  So it was kind of natural flow for me to work with a certain ingredient and to really wanting  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:14):**  to discover of, you know, what is the whole life cycle of the certain ingredients I wanted  
**[0:05:18-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:18):**  to.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:18):**  I was planning to go on a coffee farm to Guatemala to discover the difference between organic  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:26):**  and conventional coffee production.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:29):**  Then Corona happened.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:31):**  So that, of course, grounded me in Denmark.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:35):**  So I was very, I was gifted with the time to just, you know, have to freeze my time  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:41):**  and do something with it.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:43):**  So I started to volunteer in an urban community farm, which also worked as a care farm.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:50):**  So they managed to get finances for people with mental challenges to employ them as gardeners,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:58):**  as food producers to heal through reconnecting nature.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:05):**  And this is where, yeah, where the first step of taking, learning something in class and  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:10):**  then going to, you know, visiting farming school and then starting ideating about it  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:13):**  and then putting my hands into action.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:16):**  And I think that was definitely one of the most impactful months of my life where I wasn't  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:23):**  just being taught about something periodically, but actually I put my hands dirty.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:29):**  And this is also where the, especially the love to soil started because I was like really  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:36):**  ideating how can I help them the most in this small half and a hectare farm.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:42):**  And it really came to digging deeper into composting and seeing how I can utilize the  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:50):**  organic materials from the city that are abandoned as, for example, coffee waste, which I could  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:57):**  bring from, you know, after my shift, I would put it in my backpack and I would buy the  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:01):**  coffee waste to a compost that we have built and really trying to enrich the soil quality  
**[0:07:08-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:08):**  there.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:08):**  And this is how it started.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:11):**  I think many people underestimate the power of gardening or farming at like in with those  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:18):**  intentions or those practices.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:20):**  I don't think anybody would argue, let's have a, let's say a care farm on a large extractive  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:28):**  GMO fed soil.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:29):**  Like nobody would go there to get healed.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:31):**  Like that's not another approach, but somehow it really naturally fits, which is, I just  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:35):**  realized it now, which it really is an interesting way.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:37):**  Like you would go to farms like this to get a good, you know, a good, you know, a good  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:41):**  way to get healed, not only because you're doing physical work and there's the structure  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:45):**  and all of that, but also because there is something with working with your hands in  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:49):**  the soil, of course, healthy soil that, that apparently seems to be healing.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:53):**  Did you like, what, what was the biggest, I mean, you said it clicked with you.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:57):**  Was there a specific moment or was there some, like something you saw like, okay, there's,  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:01):**  there's more than just, okay, this is nice because we're working outside.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:04):**  You could also do woodworking, but this is different.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:06):**  This is, there's something different about working with soil and working with food.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:09):**  What, do you remember when it clicked for you?  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:13):**  I actually visited this urban farm already a few times before and just each time, like  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:19):**  just tapping, you know, there'll be a pavement and stepping out of the concrete into the  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:24):**  soil, like already would have such a transformational effect on, on, on, on, on my body and my spirit.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:30):**  But, I think that the society that we live in and, and, you know, the prevalent consumerism  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:37):**  capitalists really make us feel so inadequate and so like feeling of lack all the time.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:43):**  And being there with, with people with, you know, with, with schizophrenia and depression  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:48):**  and all kinds of people that I would never imagine and being so grateful and honored  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:53):**  that I can, I can be around people that, that leave completely different stories than I  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:59):**  and still would, you know, would have developed a deep bond over, over planting sunflowers.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:05):**  And I would, I would just be able to see how other people interact with nature of some,  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:11):**  you know, singing to the plants that they were harvesting, that they believe in, you know,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:16):**  little fairies that are taking care of, of, of the wellbeing of the plants, which now I think  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:22):**  about soil microbiome and the soil food web. They are the fairies.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:28):**  Of course. They see things we don't see,  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:30):**  doesn't mean they're not there. Exactly. And I mean, maybe we can see them as well.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:34):**  If we take microscope, but they just feel they are there, you know? So I think, I think for the  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:39):**  first time in my life, I felt that I so deeply belong without having to prove anything. So rather  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:46):**  than, you know, it was not that me, I was helping the garden and the people that the garden was  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:51):**  hitting me and I felt firsthand experience of what it means to feel welcome. And yeah.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:59):**  Very interesting. There's, I think the documentary out there to where we belong,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:03):**  something like that on farming as well. I'll put a link below it's streamable, I think for  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:10):**  $10 or something, you can get it. Anyway, it's a very interesting sentence you've mentioned,  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:13):**  but then you could have stayed there. You could have worked in your shifts in the coffee place.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:18):**  You could have biked with the coffee leftover. I'm not going to call it waste because it's not  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:23):**  with the coffee opportunity to, to this farm and you interned there and you were a volunteer there.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:29):**  And that would be a very fulfilling path, but you chose to take a different route.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:37):**  Yeah. So I think the coffee, the coffee like really awakened me. And I know that  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:45):**  this coffee awakes us every morning, but for me, it was much more on like a spiritual level that  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:51):**  the coffee awakened me to start reading. How much did you take?  
**[0:10:53-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:53):**  Yeah, exactly. Basically I understood that the coffee is like a systemic problem. So I visit  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:02):**  every single coffee shop in my city, which was around 35 places. And I asked, what do you do  
**[0:11:07-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:07):**  with your coffee? And beside one lady that was using it in her own garden, everybody else was  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:15):**  just throwing it away. And of course, this is not just coffee that is such an abandoned organic  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:21):**  material in the city that we could be utilizing to make topsoil. And I think something that really  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:29):**  also encouraged me to do the topsoil is that the FAO conclusions that we have 60 years of  
**[0:11:36-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:36):**  harvest left, but it was released a few years ago. So now we have 55 years of harvest left.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:44):**  And I was like, how is it possible that we are all not just making a topsoil? We're arguing if  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:50):**  we should go on keto diet or vegan diet or paleo diet, but at the same time, we have 50 years to  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:56):**  make a crucial problem. None of these diets matters if we don't have topsoil.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:01):**  Maybe you go to an algae diet, you're sort of escaping that, but still.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:08):**  So I asked everybody what they are doing and nobody was doing really anything. And then they  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:12):**  started to teach other community gardens of how they can build compost and how they can connect  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:17):**  with the local entrepreneurs to take their bio ways. But I quickly realized that just running it  
**[0:12:23-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:23):**  on my own, just as a volunteer, it was a systemic problem, basically. So systemic problem is a  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:31):**  systemic solution. So then I thought, okay, well, nobody really cares what I'm doing in my free time.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:36):**  But if I say that I will turn it to a product, or if I'm basically just want to step into the  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:40):**  market, suddenly you gain so much momentum and traction and people start listening and inviting  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:47):**  you places. So I said, okay, let me try to figure out what can you do with coffee ways  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:53):**  besides composting. Even I still believe that composting is the greatest way to deal with it.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:58):**  And I reached out to people. I just reached out on Facebook, like, hey, I want to deal with this  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:03):**  problem that somebody wants to join me. And I was very lucky because I got three people joining,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:09):**  then two people from my activist group also joined. And this is how we form Connecting  
**[0:13:14-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:14):**  Grunge. Connecting Grunge is a startup which works on upcycling coffee waste into food products.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:23):**  And right now there's a lot of upcycling happening and coffee is a very diverse material that you can  
**[0:13:30-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:30):**  use to various applications from biomaterials like bioplastic to cosmetics to pharmaceuticals.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:39):**  But I think being a nutritionist and always putting the importance of us first and foremost  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:45):**  feeding ourselves rather than putting something on our skin or having a shoe made of coffee grass,  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:50):**  like it's great. But if you can eat it, eat it. And we figure out that it's very simple to  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:59):**  upcycle it. All you need to do is have a drier coffee waste, mill it to the right particle and  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:05):**  you can use it. You can use this flower. So it's naturally gluten free. It's really high in fiber.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:11):**  It has 60 to 70% of fiber. It has some of the minerals.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:16):**  Basically, we're talking about the leftover. So you make your espresso, you make your French  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:19):**  press, and then you always have this sort of cake left, which is I think 96, 97% of the coffee bean.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:26):**  There's a very small percentage in your coffee, which is great. That's the whole industry. And  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:30):**  the rest is, but you say you can simply grind it and it becomes flour, which is very interesting.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:36):**  Yeah. And then the crisis part of it is that once you extract the caffeine content that you extract  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:42):**  to your cup of coffee, it's almost nothing. You extract 200 milligrams of caffeine in your espresso  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:49):**  cup. And then we run the test through a lab and in the leftovers of coffee grounds, you have around  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:56):**  600 milligrams of caffeine. Can you imagine? We are only extracting one fourth of all of the  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:03):**  caffeine that is available from this resource that travels from Latin America and Africa.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:07):**  And it was so much work, so much energy. And then we have 25 seconds for this, you know,  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:14):**  tiny cup and that's it. That's it. And when you say we can eat it as flour,  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:20):**  what makes you say then you still believe that compost is better as the composting is? Is it  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:25):**  better or is it equally? Why would you say that if there's the option to eat it?  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:31):**  Yeah. So, I mean, first and foremost, I question if we have a healthy diet and we follow the,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:37):**  you know, the lifestyle medicine approach where we take care of our, you know, nutrition and  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:42):**  physical activity and sleep, and we have the contact with other humans and stress management,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:48):**  like, will we really need a coffee to wake up? I think if we're, you're the coffee to wake up,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:52):**  you know, there's few problems before that, that you should look at rather than just going for  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:58):**  easy quick. Good point.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:59):**  It's a solution. So, yeah. So, as the person that just had a coffee just before this interview,  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:05):**  that's me. I'm not a shamer, like coffee is delicious. I'm also having it from time to time  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:11):**  as a treat. So basically my problem is that, so when I started looking into the, you know,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:17):**  the whole supply chain of coffee, like I always wanted to create a startup with a thought of  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:22):**  bringing new economical strengths from the farmers because we now with that of the climate change,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:27):**  especially the farmers who cultivate Arabica will most likely in 25 years to 30 years,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:33):**  most of the land will be unusable because Arabica needs very specific conditions.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:40):**  So we need to drastically rethink how much we use of our coffee. We are like, we are  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:45):**  drinking as it would be water as it would be something that, you know, you're just like,  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:48):**  yeah, I just go to my garden and I pick up my coffee beans. Like I didn't see, well,  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:52):**  actually in Italy now with the climate change, you're able to grow a coffee very south of Italy,  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:58):**  but still like I don't see coffee bushes just like abundant in Holland where I am.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:03):**  And you're treating it as it would be abundant. And so right now I'm not in the startup anymore.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:09):**  I decided to exit it because I came in and I embarked on this new adventure and I really  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:14):**  wanted to commit to a general culture. And I knew that this is my path and I was keep on pushing my  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:20):**  team like, Hey guys, but like, let's remember the farmers, remember the culture. And that was just  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:25):**  not fitting the whole solution. So, because it's so far like that the coffee farmers are on the  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:30):**  other side. And in this case, you're providing a solution for the quote unquote waste. And of  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:36):**  course it doesn't impact, it impacts a full energy side, life cycle assessment, et cetera,  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:40):**  but doesn't impact the farmer whatsoever. And so it makes it made a lot of sense, but not easy to,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:45):**  to, because you sort of also become part of that startup. Like your identity is part of that,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:51):**  like, and then having to not having wanting to exit that and take that road to either left or  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:56):**  right, whatever the cut is, is not a, is not an easy step. And then, Ooh, I mean, then you came  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:00):**  to fresh, you came to Rotterdam, like that's quite a drastic, a drastic cut. It was a really drastic  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:06):**  cut. And when I was, when I was here during the program, I was still with that, with my startup.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:13):**  And, and, and as you said, it became a huge part of identity. You become obsessed, right. And it's  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:19):**  just so deep. You want to fix this problem and you, you know, you, the knowing more,  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:24):**  they would know you want them the more, the more, you know, the more you want to get engaged. But  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:28):**  I just felt that because we are dealing with upcycling on the upstream, the more  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:35):**  I could, the closer we were getting to go on the market, the less my motivation was there,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:42):**  because the more I understood that we'll have to still deal with, with, you know, the current  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:48):**  food supply chain, which is maybe upcycling this coffee waste, and then trying to sell it to a B2B  
**[0:18:53-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:53):**  product that can, you know, use it to, yeah, have a sustainable ingredient. And it's just like,  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:01):**  I think I'm a bit too extreme into what has to happen to be able to go on those compromises.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:06):**  And I just, I just, yeah, it just was too difficult for me.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:10):**  So how did you find Fresh?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:14):**  Well, they actually reached out to my, my best friend, Marco Nardini,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:18):**  which is a regenerative agronomist. And he loves your podcast.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:25):**  I don't think we ever met, but I see you on LinkedIn.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:27):**  Yeah. And then they reach out to him because they have been really wide reach and he is,  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:34):**  yeah, he's really engaged with what he was doing in the economy. So,  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:37):**  so it wasn't for him at this moment. And he thought, Oh, maybe this is something for you.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:42):**  And I look at it and I was like, Oh, maybe, you know, back then I was still writing my  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:45):**  bachelor. So it was, I was still in a different mindset, but I thought, okay, you know what, like,  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:52):**  let me try. And I was just applying. And it's so interesting that most of those things in my life  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:57):**  that really have a huge impact, they are the ones that I put the least effort in a sense,  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:02):**  you know, because I was just like, yeah, whatever.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:04):**  There's a lesson there.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:06):**  There is a lesson there for sure. Like the more, yeah. And so I just, so I just did.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:12):**  Perfect. And then like, what was that? Because we've talked to Bart, but it was beforehand,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:17):**  actually, before the program started, I will link it below, but what was the experience like? I  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:21):**  mean, I was a bit involved, but obviously not inside, inside. What was that process of going  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:27):**  through a venture studio, first the online bit, which I remember then it was very intense offline  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:32):**  in person. And then you came out basically joining the studio with, with a company like,  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:37):**  let's we'll go there at the end, but like, how was that process for you? It sounds very intense.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:41):**  It was extremely intense. And also extremely, like it was the most growth period time of my life that  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:52):**  I think set me off on this path, but not only me, I mean, what's so beautiful about the Fresh Studio  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:58):**  is that they believe that you first invest in people and then this investment will pay back  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:04):**  in creating a solution with a real impact. So they invited 35 people with all different,  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:11):**  you know, paths of life. I mean, I don't think there was two people in the room that would have  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:16):**  the same background. And they just throw us to a huge room and say, okay, 12 weeks, try to figure  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:23):**  something out. So of course there was so much, you know, like we get to know each other through  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:29):**  online program, but it's such a different dynamic. And then you go and you're like,  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:33):**  oh, you actually way taller or, you know, like, I didn't expect you have this kind of.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:37):**  Yeah, it was a very intense online piece. I think on a lot of the knowledge, I mean,  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:41):**  you knew already, but like going deep in food and ag, and then you moved offline in person and still  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:47):**  visited a lot of farms, a lot of food companies and things like that. And then really started  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:51):**  working on solution paths and at some point, okay, what kind of companies or solutions could grow out  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:57):**  of this? How was that switch from offline to online? What happened there? Because it was still  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:02):**  also in COVID times. It was interesting, but like you got into this pressure cooker and knew, okay,  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:06):**  for 12 weeks, we're going to be here thinking, building, iterating, being uncomfortable.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:12):**  Like what was that? Like, did it fly? Was it very long? What was the, your feeling over in that in  
**[0:22:18-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:18):**  person piece? I think like, you know, if you would ask each of the members, like for sure, everybody  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:26):**  would have a different story to that. Right. And then because for some, it was coming from abroad  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:31):**  to Rotterdam. So it was also like a life changing event for some that they're actually that, or they  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:36):**  live here. And I think like the online program was a really great start for all of us to get the kind  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:42):**  of basic knowledge. What basic, well, it was not really basic, but you know, knowledge from the  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:48):**  terrestrial system and landless system and some of the people actually have not been within the  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:53):**  food system. So for some, it was quite a repetition. For others, it was all new, but I think it was very  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:59):**  important to get this vocabulary so we can also communicate and understand each other of what we  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:05):**  are talking about. But I think like everybody was super excited to just be finally together. And of  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:11):**  course, after a very long time of COVID and a lot of people being in isolation, but like just ideating  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:18):**  via Zoom. And even if you use like all of that wonderful technology as mirror or whatever, like,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:23):**  it's never the same as feeling each other and being in the room and, you know, feeling the  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:28):**  vibrancy and the energy of each other and just like the passion and the motivation. So, I mean,  
**[0:23:34-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:34):**  for me personally, the program was quite emotional roller coaster as well. I mean, I'm so deeply,  
**[0:23:42-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:42):**  you know, very passionate, but also very scared of where we are. And I'm really feeling that there's,  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:49):**  you know, now we are behind the steering wheel of this society, all of us that are alive on this  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:54):**  planet. And there's a huge responsibility for us to do something. So of course, like there is so  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:58):**  much desire to understand the problem and do something about it. So it was really like from  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:03):**  week to week, it was like so many emotions happening. And the way the program was designed  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:08):**  is that you first committed to like digging into that problem for six weeks. And then the  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:15):**  next six weeks you were slowly supposed to be transitioned from a problem to a solution. So  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:21):**  we kind of divided each other into learning groups and me and another wonderful woman decided to  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:27):**  look at the nutrient density, which is your favorite topic and our favorite topic as well.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:32):**  So that was really wonderful to find another person that is also with the same mindset,  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:38):**  because the problems that people were working on were so diverse, you know, from fixing the  
**[0:24:44-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:44):**  holistic raising problem to farmer transition to creating products from regenerative outputs to  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:55):**  nutrient density. It was really like we covered all of the supply chain and all of the problems  
**[0:25:00-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:00):**  and solutions that you could think of. And then how did that deep dive into the problem side,  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:08):**  which you knew obviously, how did that then transition into harvest care? Was it a very  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:13):**  natural one? Was it very uncomfortable? How did that process over in this case 12 weeks or six  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:19):**  weeks deep in the problem and then slowly transitioning to solution side? How did that  
**[0:25:25-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:25):**  happen? It wasn't definitely not a linear process. And I think nothing in the planet is linear, nor  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:35):**  hormonal cycles, nor the lunar cycle, nor the season cycle, nor the season cycle. So I think  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:40):**  we present for most like the biggest learning for me was to get away from thinking that any of this  
**[0:25:44-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:44):**  process will be linear and just accepting the constant flow. So the current problem with the  
**[0:25:57-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:57):**  food system is that we are continuing to produce food as it would be so in 1950 and as would still  
**[0:26:06-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:06):**  be scarce in countries. I think some people say that the food system is broken. I think that the  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:13):**  food system runs just as it was designed, which is producing the most calories with the calories  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:20):**  that are the easiest to process, the easiest to transport, store with no environmental,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:25):**  no human considerations, and also even economical considerations. Because in 1985,  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:33):**  the Common Agriculture Policy, which was implemented by the European economical community,  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:39):**  was taking up 70% of the whole budget. So this system was never designed to really serve  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:45):**  anybody besides creating huge abundance of calories. Which it did, which it's doing.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:52):**  It was just continuing doing, totally. So you're saying the system is not broken. It works  
**[0:26:57-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:57):**  perfectly the way we, the global we, designed it. But now it's time to redesign because we have  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:05):**  solved for the hunger side of things. For most cases, obviously there are huge distribution  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:09):**  issues, but in most cases we don't go to bed hungry, but we go to bed not, like male nutrition  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:15):**  or not fed. And that's a design question, or that's an incentive question, or that's a  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:22):**  conditioned question of this food system. And so what to do?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:27):**  Exactly, exactly. As you said, our current problem is the nutritional insecurity. People have often  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:35):**  the access of calories, but they're missing essential nutrients as vitamins, minerals,  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:41):**  fatty acids, bi-active compounds, and so on, that are only present in our whole foods. And whole  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:46):**  foods by design should be harvested and consumed in a very short time, so they also have the highest  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:52):**  nutrient density. So most of the people right now in the Western Europe are dying from  
**[0:27:58-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:58):**  lysate diseases, which is from diabetes to cancers to strokes to heart disease. And those diseases  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:07):**  are taking 86% of all of the deaths in Europe. 86, let's just think that in people listening.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:14):**  86, that's an eight and then a six, which means almost all basically. We have 14% left for our  
**[0:28:20-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:20):**  leftovers, but that's insane. And those numbers, they are not only human suffering behind,  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:31):**  which I think for me at least is the most painful. But also that they are a huge burden of our  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:38):**  economies. They take 25% of the total healthcare spending in Europe and they are just being  
**[0:28:45-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:45):**  expected to be on the rise, but they also create a huge loss of human power and human capital  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:53):**  because of these disabilities. And I think at least for me, we really need people healthy  
**[0:28:58-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:58):**  and ready because we have real environmental challenges to fix. And we need to be people on  
**[0:29:06-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:06):**  the point with their health. Both mentally and physically, we have a lot to do and we're not in  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:13):**  great shape. I think that's a conclusion there. We're not ready at all for this ecological  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:18):**  transition because yeah, we're not being fed or we're not feeding ourselves with the right kind  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:24):**  of nutrients, right kind of foods to even mentally have that be able to go through this and physically,  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:30):**  let alone, I mean, we need to plant a lot of trees and we need to do a lot of work physically. And  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:35):**  yes, they're going to be augmented. We're going to have technology helping us for many things, but  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:40):**  let's not kid ourselves. This is not a laptop revolution. This is very, very different. So  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:44):**  we need to get in shape. Exactly. And it's very difficult to get in shape when the food we  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:52):**  consume, even if we consume whole foods, which we know it's really not the case for majority  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:58):**  of the population simply also because the organic or whole foods are so expensive and they are  
**[0:30:03-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:03):**  inaccessible for most of the society. But still within the conventional agricultural practices, we are  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:11):**  lowering the nutrient density, right? So the studies in the US show that on average, the nutritional  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:16):**  value we lost is around 38%. And those are big numbers and those are numbers from essential  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:23):**  nutrients, which are needed for healthy functioning of our body. And then beyond that, just to finish  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:30):**  it off with all the food is not only what this food is missing, but also what is present in our  
**[0:30:35-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:35):**  food that we don't want those molecules to be present. And there was an annual report published  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:43):**  by the European Food Safety Authority in 2020, showing that at least half of the fruits and  
**[0:30:48-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:48):**  vegetables in Europe consist of a pesticide residue. And out of this half, at least one-third  
**[0:30:56-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:56):**  consists of a cocktail of up to 15 residues. And we have no idea what is happening in our body once.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:04):**  So many chemicals that should not supposed to be there are running from our bloodstream. And  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:10):**  so now I'm going to the transition because you asked me like, what was the transition?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:14):**  Yeah, because this is very depressing. This sounds so big. Like, okay, we can see the problem.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:20):**  And now it's like, okay, what's the entry point? Because that of course, you are forced in a  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:27):**  venture studio to start thinking about venture. Like what's the, we can be an activist on this  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:31):**  side. We can do amazing scientific work, but that's not the role. I mean, you are an activist,  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:35):**  but that's the role you chose, the role as an entrepreneur. So what's the entry point?  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:39):**  Yeah, exactly. So the entry point became an endocrine system for me.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:44):**  So endocrine system is...  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:45):**  Explain.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:46):**  Yes, let me explain. So the endocrine system is specifically threatened by all of the  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:54):**  pesticides residue as I just mentioned, because in those pesticides residue, there's something  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:58):**  called endocrine-disruptive chemicals. And those are chemicals which mimic or disrupts our hormones  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:05):**  in our body and they send like confusing messages and cause all kinds of dysfunctions.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:11):**  So what is the endocrine system? Just very, very for everybody that English isn't their first  
**[0:32:16-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:16):**  language. This is our hormonal system. Yes. So on the women's side, we're also men.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:25):**  I mean, everybody has an endocrine system. Everybody is basically governed by our  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:30):**  ecosystem. I mean, we are governed by our biology and I think too often we are forgetting that we  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:35):**  are part of the nature. So both men and women have, you know, endocrine systems.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:39):**  And we're getting like, we're being threatened or it's being exposed to so many toxins that  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:46):**  our hormones, which are completely governing our emotions, our health, et cetera, are getting  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:51):**  either confused or actually very badly, let's say, sending signals you don't want in your body.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:58):**  Exactly. And as you said, they discover so much. They cover our mental health,  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:04):**  our reproductive health, our metabolism, our energy level, our microbiota, basically,  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:09):**  whatever you think of us being performing, endocrine has an influence.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:14):**  So our operating system is being hacked, basically. That's the, and not in a good way.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:19):**  Not in a good way. And you were the one that you helped me also like go into this direction,  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:25):**  because you have during the fresh program, you send me the white paper released by insurance  
**[0:33:30-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:30):**  company saying that due to the low grade accumulation of toxicity, exposure in our food,  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:39):**  but not only in our cosmetics and plastic products, we have a huge infertility challenges.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:45):**  And they're predicting that with the current decline in sperm activity, with next 35 years,  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:52):**  only 15 to 20% of the capas will be able to conceive naturally. Right. So in next 30 years,  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:58):**  basically our biology, just let us have that sink in for a second. People that's,  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:03):**  I will put a paper below it's written by Jeremy Grant, very famous investor on the institutional  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:09):**  side, founder of GMO, which is funny because it's his name. It has nothing to do with GMO.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:15):**  And they are a supporter of the podcast as well through their foundation. And he has been  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:21):**  hammering down this like the toxicity is a real, real threat. We don't know exactly where it comes  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:27):**  from. No, we know where it comes from. We don't know exactly what it does or how it works. We know  
**[0:34:30-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:30):**  what it does because we see the outcome. And he said a famous sentence somewhere in that white  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:37):**  paper that he published or actually in his normal, like his normal, let's say, investors,  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:43):**  investor newsletter, where he was talking about, sperm count and toxicity, which I already find  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:48):**  hilarious that in like pension funds, et cetera, to get this white paper, they read it because it  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:52):**  is Jeremy Grant and they talk about sperm count, which is not the normal thing they discuss in  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:57):**  these boardrooms. But anyways, at the famous sentence, if you want to become, if you're  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:00):**  planning to, to have children over the next years and both men and women, and we'll come back to  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:06):**  this piece, which is you just mentioned, have to eat. I have to avoid all toxicity possible,  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:11):**  which means eating organic, preferably beyond, but that's maybe too much to ask at the moment  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:15):**  where we get there. Like this toxicity is so threatening to us. Like we're, we're not  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:21):**  reproducing at the level we need for our pension system for all the work we need to do for like  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:26):**  couples are going through hell to, to get pregnant naturally. And you say that's just going down  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:33):**  further and which means very expensive programs, a lot of, a lot of pain, a lot of suffering or not  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:40):**  getting pregnant in a natural way, which sort of seems to be, should be a right for anybody if you  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:45):**  want that. But apparently we're losing that ability, which is very scary. So you thought,  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:50):**  okay, this is the entry point for where there is so much pain and where there is so much  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:56):**  possibility as well. Exactly. And just to, just to summarize this endocrine, I think what I, what I  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:02):**  spend a lot of time reflecting and I'm really fascinated about is that endocrine disruption  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:07):**  and climate change have a common origin, which is the fossil fuel consumption and production,  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:13):**  because many of the pesticides include all kinds of chemicals as ethylene and propylene and methane,  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:18):**  which we have access thanks to the petroleum. So I think it's, it's like nature showing us  
**[0:36:23-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:23):**  middle finger, right. In your face. You said you could burn this stuff. Could you like with that?  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:31):**  So we're running ourselves into the ground basically, literally like this is where,  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:35):**  where, I mean, you just have to look at the numbers. It's, it's really, really scary.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:39):**  So what on the let's, let's show the path to solution. Like is this  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:45):**  quote unquote, easily fixable? Like, are there examples studies? Like if you stop exposing  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:50):**  yourself as a couple, like what, what's that connection to, I mean, there's a very easy outcome,  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:54):**  do you get pregnant naturally or not? Like it's, it's sort of, that's, that's a, quite an easy test.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:59):**  Like what has been going on in that world? Have people been doing research, their experiments,  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:05):**  exposing people to let's say beyond organic or organic whole foods, et cetera?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:10):**  Yeah. So I didn't look like my, my, I took the focus of endocrine, but not specifically on  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:17):**  fertility, but on woman endocrine system and look specific. I was focusing on polycystic  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:22):**  ovarian syndrome, which is the most prevalent endocrine disease among women. It's up to 20%  
**[0:37:28-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:28):**  of us that are suffering from it. And the way it happens is basically your, your, your follicle cell  
**[0:37:35-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:35):**  cannot mature. So instead of being released from your ovaries, it's transformed to cysts.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:42):**  And then with time you accumulate more and more cysts and then they, they stop or like they're,  
**[0:37:46-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:46):**  they hugely impact your hormone cycle. And there's a ton of research out there and a ton  
**[0:37:53-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:53):**  of examples how you can manage this disease with lifestyle, which is, which includes healthy diet,  
**[0:38:01-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:01):**  physical activity, preferably like hormonal yoga. So you also adapt your physical activity  
**[0:38:09-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:09):**  to your predisposition from your mood and also stress management because elevated stress hormones  
**[0:38:17-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:17):**  can also negatively influence this disease. And women are managing to heal themselves. I mean,  
**[0:38:24-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:24):**  it's not a disease that you can just go on a treatment and then get better and then just quit.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:32):**  That's not how it works. You just have to transform your life. And I think that's one of the challenge  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:36):**  of in general, it's just like, well, one of the challenge of using food as medicine is that we  
**[0:38:42-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:42):**  are so used to being like very passive when it comes to our health. Our health and body literacy  
**[0:38:51-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:51):**  and also food literacy are extremely low. And here we are talking about transforming your lifestyle.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:59):**  So I think the reason why I love regenerative culture, because indeed, like it's so easy to  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:03):**  get caught up with all of the problems and how difficult the challenges are and complex. And the  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:09):**  more you understand them, the more you want to dig in. But the approach of regenerative culture,  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:14):**  which have the solutions of how to heal the food system always puts me back to like, okay,  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:19):**  like focus on what can we do right now. And there's few benefits from regenerative culture  
**[0:39:25-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:25):**  in particular for using food as medicine and endocrine health. First is that if regenerative  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:33):**  culture is produced organically, then of course it won't have the endocrine disruptive chemicals,  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:38):**  which is very important. But additionally, and I don't want to go too much into it because you had  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:43):**  that core of the nutrient density before me here in David Montgomery and Anna Bigelow, which explained  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:49):**  beautifully and I don't want to even try to repeat anything. I will link it below, but I think it's  
**[0:39:53-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:53):**  interesting. Like what does it add now? As we said, women are able to heal themselves with the  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:59):**  right type of yoga, meditation, stress release, eating well. They are okay. Like what does it  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:05):**  add now to go beyond and say, no, we're actually going to use regenerative practices to create  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:11):**  quote unquote, to grow food as medicine. Like what do you see there as the opportunity? Why  
**[0:40:15-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:15):**  do you think that's an interesting path? So we need to heal ourselves and we need to heal  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:22):**  the planet at the same time. And regenerative agriculture allows us to do it because we know  
**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:26):**  that if we will not disturb the soil, we will plant the cover crops, we will have intensive  
**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:32):**  crop protections, we will have the positive effect on the soil microbiome. The positive effect on  
**[0:40:38-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:38):**  soil microbiome will lead to higher nutrient density, which will allow us to access foods that  
**[0:40:45-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:45):**  will heal us faster while healing the soil of Europe or the world or whatever. So this is why,  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:53):**  and now I will go to the Harvest Care, which is like the venture that came out from the fresh.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:00):**  The idea behind Harvest Care is to build an organization of a digital food pharmacy  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:05):**  that supports women and the crying disorders using meditative food, blended care approach  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:10):**  and community building. And then in later phase, I hope to also include food regenerative food  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:16):**  provisioning to help them to restore their hunger balance at the same time regenerative  
**[0:41:21-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:21):**  the soil in Europe. And I know that there's lots to unpack there, but is it okay if I would just  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:28):**  take the time to please go? Yeah, please unpack. I'm unpacking that. Well then let's start from  
**[0:41:34-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:34):**  the meditative food. Basically, meditative food is a diet that is prescribed for a specific disease,  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:42):**  for a specific person. And I think what's super important for me as a health professional is that  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:47):**  I see a lot of reductionist approach to looking at the diet. People may be filling out the  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:52):**  questionnaire and saying like, okay, well, if you want to lose weight, you should be eating this.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:57):**  But it's completely out of context. It doesn't take into account any kind of behavioral psychology,  
**[0:42:03-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:03):**  how we work, what is the process behind forming a new habit. And I just don't believe that any kind  
**[0:42:11-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:11):**  of software without the human touch will be able to facilitate this. So instead of creating just  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:19):**  easily scalable solution, what I really want to do is scale up the accessibility to help  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:23):**  professionals which use food as medicine. Because of the challenge, and this challenge comes from  
**[0:42:28-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:28):**  my personal experience, that as nutritionist, I am not really part of the Western conventional  
**[0:42:37-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:37):**  medicine and the healthcare. So I think first and foremost, creating a place where we can really  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:46):**  scale the accessibility and the easiness of accessing people who can help you with diet is  
**[0:42:52-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:52):**  crucial and important. The reason why those diets should be super personalized is to not only help  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:03):**  the people understand of what they should be eating, but also guide them through all of the  
**[0:43:08-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:08):**  process of gaining new knowledge, gaining new skills, changing how they relate to their self,  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:15):**  how they relate to their body, to their food. And this I really believe is a people-in-people  
**[0:43:20-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:20):**  approach. So that would be definitely one of the part of the solution. Then I decided to focus on  
**[0:43:27-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:27):**  woman hormonal health. First and foremost, because I can and I think it's amazing.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:36):**  Our cycles are really overlooked in the society. We live in a very linear society which  
**[0:43:41-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:41):**  disregards all of the biological silos, including those running within our bodies. And I also,  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:48):**  I strongly believe that I'm committing to harvest care for many, many years ahead of me. So I think  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:54):**  having at least at the beginning, a very strong personal motivation to do it is also really  
**[0:43:59-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:59):**  important. And then I mentioned blended care. So once I stopped heavily digging into agriculture  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:07):**  and the healthcare connection, I started looking at actually what is the best approach to form a  
**[0:44:14-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:14):**  new health enhancing behaviors and what is the science behind there. And then this blended  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:23):**  care really emerged as something that is the future of the healthcare. So the blended care  
**[0:44:28-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:28):**  takes one-on-one person visit, which can either be online or offline with a health professional.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:35):**  So in a harvest care example, it will be dietician or nutritionist. And then they use technology to  
**[0:44:41-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:41):**  help you to nudge you to perform this. To actually do it. Yeah. To implement it, to not forget,  
**[0:44:50-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:50):**  to build that habit change, which is so difficult. That's not like it's like changing habits is  
**[0:44:57-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:57):**  insanely complicated and, but extremely important. So you do that mix of in-person either video or  
**[0:45:05-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:05):**  in-person and then implementing that new habit of, or the new habits basically in trying to  
**[0:45:14-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:14):**  deal with that syndrome. Exactly. And I think the human element is really there to,  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:22):**  there are studies showing that if there is a health professional involved, like people motivation to  
**[0:45:27-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:27):**  adhere to it, to a forming of a new behavior is higher, but then why not use technology,  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:34):**  which can help you on the moments that we cannot be together. And we are very lucky because we are  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:38):**  rocketed in Rotterdam where there is the Erasmus Medical Center that is really pioneering the  
**[0:45:43-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:43):**  blended care approach. And we are even looking at the possibility of testing our blended care  
**[0:45:50-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:50):**  solutions to strengthen the validity behind it. And then another element that I really want to  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:58):**  work with is a community aspect. And I know that nowadays a lot of companies are throwing  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:03):**  communities, just I think to put a bit of a human perspective for the businesses.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:07):**  But the reason why I believe, I strongly believe is that you need to build communities around  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:12):**  your new behavior. It's as you're transforming your life, you know, and you need people around.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:17):**  We've learned that in addiction, like AA meetings are successful for many years because there's  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:22):**  community. And we have many, many examples of accountability showing up, being with other  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:28):**  people, going through similar things or a bit ahead or a bit behind. I mean, that's what we do.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:33):**  And that's how we function. We are social animals. And with your new experiences,  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:40):**  you shift your priorities and you want to have people in your life where you'll be able to  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:45):**  resonate and maintain those new, you know, you have new skill. Like suddenly fermenting became  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:51):**  a super important part of your diet. Like you want people around you, which also want to ferment,  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:55):**  then you want to have Friday fermentation days, you know, and we need to be able to ask questions  
**[0:47:01-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:01):**  like, is this bubble normal or should it be smelling differently? Yeah, exactly. And it's just  
**[0:47:07-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:07):**  yeah. So super important. And one of the way we want to test this is that we are going to hold  
**[0:47:16-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:16):**  workshop about endocrine health for women with PCOS, the positive governance syndrome on the farm.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:22):**  And we want to see if them being exposed and like, you know, experiencing like what does health means  
**[0:47:31-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:31):**  and where does health begins if it will have, you know, increasing their willingness to implement  
**[0:47:37-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:37):**  those changes. Very interesting. Let's just repeat once the syndrome slowly. So everybody who's  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:42):**  writing can Google it as well. I put a link below definitely. But if you're currently thinking,  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:47):**  I just didn't catch it because it was too fast. Like what's the syndrome, but slowly.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:52):**  It's called polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS. Okay. PCOS. So you can definitely find more. I'll  
**[0:47:58-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:58):**  put a link below. And so where are you now? It's very early in the journey of the company. I had to  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:05):**  convince you to come on because you said it's early. I don't know yet. I said, yes, but I would  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:09):**  love to talk to you now and then talk to you again in a year, in two years and just keep following  
**[0:48:12-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:12):**  this because that's what we do. So what's the current, we're talking the end of August, 2022,  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:18):**  we're at the end of summer in the Northern hemisphere, obviously. What would you say the  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:24):**  current status is or what do you, how would you describe Harvest Care as of this moment?  
**[0:48:32-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:32):**  You really had to convince me because I wasn't there. You have so many amazing participants that  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:36):**  have done so much. And then I come here with my dreams and hopes, but sometimes I will treat it  
**[0:48:41-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:41):**  as a manifestation into the world. But so currently we are, so we have a community of two and a half  
**[0:48:49-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:49):**  thousand people that are going to hold you accountable. You'll be good. I'm good. So we,  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:56):**  we, I mean, what was super cool with Fresh is that they are really helping me to, because I'm not a  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:02):**  person that, you know, if I would have to create a business as usual, I would never be doing it,  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:06):**  but they are really encouraging me to saying like, don't worry, we'll find a business model that will  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:11):**  serve the purpose and the mission that you want to accomplish. And something that is  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:16):**  crucially important for me, and this is long-term, is to also see how can I work with insurance  
**[0:49:21-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:21):**  companies? Because I just, I can so easily see how regeneration and nutrient density can be easily  
**[0:49:28-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:28):**  used as another lookship. So that's like, imagine that, you know, I test your microbiota and then I  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:32):**  say, okay, and now I will design a perfect nutrient density diet for, you know, to diversify your  
**[0:49:38-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:38):**  microbes. And I just, I could not look into a mirror if I would go this path. For me, what's  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:44):**  really important is to see how can we serve those who are not served. And there is such a strong  
**[0:49:50-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:50):**  economical, economical proofs and reasoning behind, you know, showing that prevention is  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:57):**  cheaper than intervention. And in the US, especially they have, and you also have the  
**[0:50:02-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:02):**  founder of serious community where they manage to subsidize healthy food and teach kids how to  
**[0:50:09-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:09):**  cook medically tailored diets. And so it's something super important, but of course this  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:15):**  is long-term and you first need to prove your value or like the value of the model that you  
**[0:50:18-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:18):**  design. So this is what we are doing right now. We want to take those elements that we found both  
**[0:50:24-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:24):**  from like NGO awards and business awards and put them into our pack, our model and see what works  
**[0:50:32-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:32):**  for dozens. So as I said, like the first phase is to invite women with PCOS on their own farm  
**[0:50:42-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:42):**  experiences, workshop, but also cooking workshop with educational beds, sharing community creation,  
**[0:50:49-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:49):**  basically what harvest care you want to do, but just on a tiny, tiny scale and see how are we  
**[0:50:54-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:54):**  being able to deliver this value. Another track, which is super important for me is to also spread  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:01):**  the knowledge about general agriculture to other nutritionists. So we also want to invite  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:05):**  nutritionists and dietitianists on the farm to spread the information about the benefits of the  
**[0:51:10-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:10):**  healthy soil for healthy humans. And then in phase two, it will be building a software of a digital  
**[0:51:18-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:18):**  food pharmacy, which will connect and facilitate the relationship between people with diseases that  
**[0:51:24-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:24):**  can be treated and managed through food as medicine. And I like to think about the behavior  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:32):**  change a bit of like learning a new language. So I would love this software be a place where you  
**[0:51:37-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:37):**  don't only meet your dietician, but also the dietician or nutritionist can prescribe you like  
**[0:51:42-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:42):**  a homework as watch this video of how to manage your glucose level while using indigenous grains,  
**[0:51:51-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:51):**  which are now cultivated by the regenerative local farmers. And then step three would be to  
**[0:52:00-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:00):**  integrate this applications or this food prescriptions with vertical supply chain of  
**[0:52:07-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:07):**  regenerative food. My spirit is very collaborative and I know that the solution will require  
**[0:52:15-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:15):**  involvement of many people and I don't want to necessarily create a supply, you know,  
**[0:52:20-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:20):**  regenerative supply chains. There are already amazing people working on it. It's all a question  
**[0:52:23-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:23):**  like how can we match and mix together? And then once hopefully we'll manage to prove that the  
**[0:52:30-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:30):**  harvester is helping people, is helping farmers, then we'll have enough of evidence to go to  
**[0:52:36-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:36):**  insurance companies and say, Hey, look, this will save you money and save people lives and will  
**[0:52:42-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:42):**  transform people lives. So please help people to access food, which should be our basic human right  
**[0:52:51-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:51):**  for those who cannot do it right now. So your strategy is really to prove this at a scale and  
**[0:52:58-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:58):**  at a scalable way, let's say, and then go to the insurance companies to make sure it gets,  
**[0:53:05-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:05):**  it becomes accessible also for those who cannot afford it on their own or don't even know it exists  
**[0:53:10-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:10):**  or would never be exposed to it. If we don't act now, it might take 10, 20 years or whatever before  
**[0:53:16-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:16):**  this knowledge is out there. And so what would you tell me? You're diving deep into this space of,  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:23):**  of nutrient density and the quality of food and the connection to reach an ag. And I think  
**[0:53:28-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:28):**  investors are listening or people are listening. Like, what would you tell them after you're  
**[0:53:32-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:32):**  emerging out of this, basically now a year later, eight or nine months later without giving  
**[0:53:38-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:38):**  investment advice, obviously, but what would you tell investors to, to look into or to dig deeper  
**[0:53:44-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:44):**  into in this, this quality piece of this quality space or the nutrient density space where,  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:49):**  where to look, where to, to dig deeper, where to ask more questions.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:55):**  Yeah, I'm just a humble nutritionist now. So I'm like, I'm not sure if I am capable of  
**[0:53:59-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:59):**  being a startup founder, but my perspective is very much like human and ecosystem wellbeing.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:54:07):**  But definitely development of machinery that we can measure the nutrient density. And we know that  
**[0:54:16-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:54:16):**  the bio nutrient association is already doing it, but having this as a, you know, investing more  
**[0:54:23-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:54:23):**  money into this area where basically every consumer could be equipped with this kind of  
**[0:54:29-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:54:29):**  little tool, that would be amazing. But also what kind of scares me a bit, maybe it's like how much  
**[0:54:35-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:54:35):**  investment goes to this alternative protein. And now we know that like actually this alternative  
**[0:54:42-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:54:42):**  meat production can influence our genome and it's quite tricky. So I would, if we really want to  
**[0:54:48-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:54:48):**  change people's health and want to act fast, we need to invest much more money in humans,  
**[0:54:54-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:54:54):**  just as harvest, as just as fresh date with us. Like we need to start running programs where we  
**[0:55:02-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:02):**  increase people's food awareness, food literacy, health awareness. So, so rather of like maybe  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:11):**  investing so much money in like single product, which maybe is a great tool to gain money, like  
**[0:55:17-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:17):**  no health comes from a single product. Just as health in ecosystem comes from diversity,  
**[0:55:22-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:22):**  it's the same as our health comes from the diversity. So investing in paradigm shift  
**[0:55:27-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:27):**  and the mindset shift, I think, at least from my perspective, it's crucial.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:32):**  So what would you do? I mean, this is a natural bridge to the 1 billion euro question. We love to  
**[0:55:38-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:38):**  ask if you're in charge of a billion euros, what would you, with a very long time horizon,  
**[0:55:44-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:44):**  but it definitely should be put to work with the idea it comes back. What would you focus on?  
**[0:55:48-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:48):**  So I strongly believe that there is way to high accumulation of human capital in cities,  
**[0:55:58-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:58):**  and that we need to start going away from centralized location and spreading this  
**[0:56:03-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:56:03):**  human capital. So I would start investing in creating hubs, like social, food,  
**[0:56:11-0:56:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:56:11):**  knowledge hubs around regenerated farms, where they create the possibility of young people,  
**[0:56:20-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:56:20):**  of young families, but also older generation to come in and start leading a drastically different  
**[0:56:26-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:56:26):**  life. Life based on community, life based on localization. And with this kind of capital,  
**[0:56:34-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:56:34):**  I think, like looking at the city, really the design cities in a way that they don't  
**[0:56:40-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:56:40):**  benefit any of our physiological needs and they don't respect our physiological cycles. So  
**[0:56:47-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:56:47):**  reshaping how we live and making regenerative farms as like the central hub of life and  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:56:55):**  creation of an ecosystem, human ecosystem. This is how I would spend this 1 billion.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:01):**  Fascinating. And probably, I mean, this would go a very long way. I mean, you don't need  
**[0:57:06-0:57:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:06):**  100 million per farm. Like you need way, way less and you can, it's a very interesting,  
**[0:57:12-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:12):**  a whole different rabbit hole to go into the urban and rural divide and the future of that,  
**[0:57:17-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:17):**  which sort of seems to be crumbling now with COVID, with remote working for many people as  
**[0:57:23-0:57:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:23):**  possible, with the city has its advantages, but also lost a lot of the shiny stuff we used to see.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:30):**  So let's see what's, I think it's going to be a very defining moment now that many people,  
**[0:57:35-0:57:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:35):**  not everyone or most people actually know, but a big chunk of people could practically work from  
**[0:57:40-0:57:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:40):**  anywhere and maybe they do. And maybe they, hopefully they choose interesting places to be,  
**[0:57:46-0:57:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:46):**  which in my case, obviously are our regenerative farms and they will bring an energy. They will  
**[0:57:51-0:57:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:51):**  bring some finance as well. They will bring questions, but also interesting answers to  
**[0:57:55-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:55):**  these places that often have been depopulated over the last decades or last few hundred years  
**[0:58:01-0:58:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:01):**  while we all move to the big shiny city. So that's a very interesting, we're going to see  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:06):**  how that plays out. And if you could change one thing overnight in the food and agriculture  
**[0:58:11-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:11):**  system, what would that be if you had a magic wand? So with my magic wand, I would  
**[0:58:20-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:20):**  design the food system in a way that always prioritize human health throughout all of the,  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:29):**  all of the processes from the production to harvesting, to storage, to processing,  
**[0:58:35-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:35):**  because if we would really focus on what is needed for our health, we would get rid of most  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:42):**  of our problems. We would get rid of monocultures, we would get rid of agrochemicals, we would get  
**[0:58:47-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:47):**  rid of junk food and would just have completely different experience on this planet as humans.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:57):**  And also would allow for nature to have a different experience with us being on this planet  
**[0:59:02-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:59:02):**  with her.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:59:05):**  I think it's a perfect way to end this conversation. I couldn't agree more. And I want  
**[0:59:10-0:59:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:59:10):**  to thank you so much for coming on. It wasn't easy. I mean, I know you wanted to be further  
**[0:59:15-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:59:15):**  along, but I think it's really good to check in now and follow this over time as we love to do  
**[0:59:20-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:59:20):**  in this podcast. And I want to thank you so much for the work you do and for coming here and share

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:14):**  Finally, after three years at check-in with Bert Glover of Impact Ag Partners in Australia,  who over the last years for investors has put over 600 million to work on farms using  regenerative practices and implementing regenerative practices, they managed to sell some of the  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:29):**  world's first soil carbon credits to Microsoft and are launching an Australian-focused fund.  So why, with all these achievements and all this work to do in Australia, did he decide  to also start operations in North America?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:42):**  What does he see happening with the soil carbon markets and where will the market of biodiversity  credits go to?  And I'm talking about geese in this interview, which obviously have to be ducks.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:51):**  I'm very, very sorry.  So ducks, not geese.  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:04):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:19):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:29):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:41):**  To make it easy for fans to support our work, we launched our membership community and so  many of you have joined us as a member.  Thank you.

**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:13):**  We interviewed him twice in 2019.  And that feels like a long time ago, which it is.  I mean, it's three years, actually to the day three years.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:22):**  We released the first interview.  And there's so much to catch up on.  There's so much work that has been done on the ground at different continents, actually.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:30):**  So I'm very, very much looking forward to catching up to talk about the different technologies  we discussed last interview, because I will put it in the links below as well.  We did a full interview just on tech with a lot of virtual fencing, actually, which  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:43):**  since then we've unpacked more and more.  And so put all those links below.  But first of all, welcome back, Bert.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:48):**  Thanks, Cohen.  Thanks for having me.  It's great to be back.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:51):**  What's happened in three years?  I mean, we do check in every now and then.  It's not that we didn't talk for three years, but we didn't talk on air.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:57):**  We didn't record it.  So I'm very much looking forward.  Let's do a very brief intro into Impact Act Partners for the people that didn't listen  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:05):**  to the other interviews.  We obviously go and listen to them, not now.  I mean, stay here with us.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:10):**  But in a few sentences, what is Impact Act Partners?  And then we're going to unpack a bit what has happened or what has changed in the last  three years.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:18):**  Well, lots changed, Cohen.  I mean, there's been a lot happening with pandemics and geopolitical issues.  And again, it comes back to why we believe agriculture has got such an important role  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:37):**  globally.  In terms of climate change, there's so many pressures on food systems and the environment.  We think agriculture is a great solution and can take a leading role in tackling climate  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:52):**  change by building resilience towards its impacts and through decarbonizing the atmosphere  and our economies.  And so with some of the global challenges that we're facing as a society, we believe  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:07):**  agriculture can play a major role in a lot of those and really impact our partners.  You just don't believe that, actually.  Yeah.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:15):**  I've been working on that, I think, for 10 years plus now.  I think a lot of people on this podcast believe that the agriculture is a big part of the  solution.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:23):**  But going from belief until putting hundreds of millions to work, because that's what you've  done, there's quite a step in between.  So where would you describe Impact Act Partners now as we're talking, what is it, May 2022?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:35):**  Depending on when you listen to this, obviously.  Let's say spring in the Northern Hemisphere, 2022, where does Impact Act Partners stand?  So we currently manage over $600M of assets under management across Australia.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:50):**  And we've now, as you alluded to, expanded into the US.  There's 500,000 acres under management and it's a lot broader than what it was 3-years  ago, Cohen.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:03):**  We've got permanent tree nut crops.  We've got wheat, barley cropping in Western Australia.  We've got ranch in the US.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:13):**  We've got carbon projects, renewable projects, biodiversity projects.  We've done green finance deals.  We've sold soil carbon.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:25):**  A lot's happened in 3-years.  And if you think about what was in that last podcast around, I think I probably spoke to  you about environmental finance and I spoke to you about monetizing soil carbon.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:37):**  We've probably done the very first of some of those for us as a firm and some of those  were first in the world.  So we're really proud of what we've done.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:48):**  We've got a lot of work to do.  We haven't got all the answers.  We're trying really hard.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:57):**  We're scaling up.  We've got a fantastic team of 10 people here in Australia, plus on the ground staff that  manage our farms who are all amazing and a team of three or four in the US.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:12):**  So trying to demonstrate what we do globally, Cohen, we believe some of the things we've  learned and practiced here in Australia can have global impact and we feel like we're  getting really prepared to try and help demonstrate the role that agriculture can play in terms  
**[0:06:32-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:32):**  of food security, landscape management, addressing climate change and how we manage grasslands  and bringing more financial returns as well back to the farm gate so that farmers can  reinvest in their farms, reinvest in their assets.  
**[0:06:51-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:51):**  And this helps fund things like carbon projects, like development, like improved biodiversity,  improvement in waterways.  So we're excited.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:05):**  As you can tell, we're scaling up.  And yeah, I mean, where do you want to start?  Let's start with how did that happen?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:16):**  Because how did the move, let's say, or the growth to another continent happen?  Because Australia is very big, as many people know.  There's a lot of work to be done there.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:26):**  You could have stayed there, not stayed there.  You could have worked there for many more decades before you were, quote unquote, done  or the regeneration is complete, which it never is.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:36):**  But you decided to make your life a bit more complicated, be in different time zones with  different teams on the ground in different continents.  How did that happen?  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:45):**  And why did you decided to become also active in North America?  Good question.  There's three main reasons, but I think the word you used that resonates with me the most  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:59):**  is why.  And the reason why, it goes back to our fundamental core values as a business and what we believe  in and really what we want to achieve.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:11):**  And for us, if we can help be a thought leader around how agriculture can play a major role  in decarbonising the atmosphere, producing nutrient dense food and demonstrating how  livestock have a critical role to play in landscapes and the role that external capital  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:35):**  can play in catalysing that change.  I felt like by going to North America and potentially going a bit broader globally,  just maybe we can take some of our learnings and share those.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:51):**  Maybe we can share some of our successes and also share some of the things that haven't  worked so well.  We're quite transparent.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:00):**  We're very data centric, so we can show our performance with data.  But we talk about creating a ripple effect through societies and through industries and  hopefully have an impact on some governments about how we think we can approach the production  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:16):**  of food and fibre different.  And I felt like we had to get a footprint in the US.  So going back to your question, one reason.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:25):**  So where do you start then?  Like how do you how do you start that?  Like feeling like you should have and it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:32):**  I mean, things get more real if you can see and touch them as long as they're for many  people far away in Australia.  We can always say, yeah, but it works there because there's a government that supports  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:42):**  something or they have different climate or soil and all of those things are not true  and true at the same time.  So to show it somewhere else, like look, we can replicate somewhere else as well is very,  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:51):**  very, very strong.  But then the step to do it and start managing large farms, because these are hundreds of  thousands of acres, this is not let's start a market garden somewhere, which is also not  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:03):**  easy.  But this is this is definitely on the scale of not easiness quite high.  Like, where do you start then going from what would be nice to start something in North America  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:11):**  to actually buying your first property, start managing land, hiring people?  Like, what was the first step there?  I think the first step was getting investor confidence and investor confidence came off  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:22):**  the back of the fact that we generated primarily soil carbon off assets here in Australia.  We had the data to back it up.  We did the deal with Microsoft selling the soil carbon credits.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:36):**  And I think, you know, the pandemic changed a lot about investor perception around how  we grow food in relation to nature.  Really?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:47):**  What's the biggest advantage?  Like, what do you another advantage?  What's the biggest surprise?  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:51):**  Or how do you see that that the pandemic has changed that is that you get more phone calls,  you get better and more interesting phone calls, you, you get more deeper conversations  about the role of land and livestock?  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:04):**  Or what do you see when you say it has changed?  How does that manifest itself?  I think that what the pandemic was, what the impact was that the pandemic slowed everyone  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:14):**  down.  And that is people that live in cities, you know, and, and let's think about the capital  flows that come to impact ag, you know, investors sitting at home, thinking about where their  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:29):**  food comes from.  Thinking about if things get worse, do I have a vegetable garden?  Where do I source my food from?  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:36):**  How's it got here into my house?  And in some cases, yeah.  And in some cases, you know, people were, people were locked up because there was lockdowns  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:46):**  in different parts of parts of the world.  So you know, they didn't have their freedoms.  They had their food, they had their family, and it was a humbling experience for many  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:54):**  people.  And I think what, what happened was that we started to think about, you know, how did  the disease around, you know, COVID happen, you know, you know, humanity getting closer  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:10):**  to nature.  And then you, investors thinking about, well, you know, how does food production interact  with nature?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:18):**  And what, what is the outcomes of that for nature?  And how are we going to interact with nature moving forward?  And on top of that, you got this whole climate change discussion and then COP26 happened  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:31):**  as well.  And so I think it seems like there's been a little bit of a reset.  And even I've seen traveling since borders have opened up both in the, you know, US and  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:45):**  here in Australia.  So you got investors that got interested and more comfortable in these kinds of investments,  and you took them basically to say, okay, let's focus on getting a foothold in North  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:00):**  America.  And currently, what are you managing there?  Like in terms of, is it equal to size or what you're managing in Australia?  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:07):**  Is it smaller?  Is it bigger?  Like what is the, or everything is bigger in the US, so it must be bigger.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:13):**  Like what's the current ratio, let's say Australia versus US for you.  So the US, it's probably, you know, 40 or 50% of, you know, what we're doing here in  some regard.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:31):**  I mean, from an area point of view, it's a large amount of area, you know, 300,000 acres  in America.  So that's quite a footprint.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:41):**  But in terms of the business and intensity, it's nowhere near as intense as some of the  Australian businesses, and it's primarily a large cattle ranch.  So you know, it's not diversified and, you know, it's not row crop.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:55):**  It's primarily beef production in a semi-arid environment, which has cold winters.  So that creates some different thinking that's going to be required for us, especially with  our focus on natural capital and soil carbon sequestration.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:12):**  So you know, it's going to be a good challenge for us.  We're already making some good headway, but it's really exciting.  And I'm hoping that we can take a lot of our learnings.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:26):**  Some of our specialist team have already been there.  We've got some great plans.  We've got some new pilots.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:32):**  We're already starting to roll out there, working with universities.  So you know, it's a good move.  It's a substantial move for us.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:44):**  It's large enough for it to be efficient and effective.  And you know, it could be a great launching pad for us, but also a great demonstrator  of how we can go about things to address climate change and food production.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:01):**  So it's exciting for us.  What are the differences you see now in ranching?  Let's say a farm or ranch you bought in Australia and the one you now bought or you're managing  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:15):**  for your investors in the US.  What does the implementation look like?  What are you going to do there?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:21):**  Is it very different from what you're used to in Australia or is it relatively simple?  Like, look, we have the guidebook, the recipe book.  We perfected it over the last years.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:30):**  Of course, it's a different regulatory environment, et cetera.  But we know step one to ten really, really like intensity goes up or we do different  grazing systems.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:40):**  We need to get in front.  Like, what does it look like on the ground?  Try to describe it as visually as possible, because I think it's difficult to understand  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:47):**  the sheer size and then what livestock there can do or what role it could play, which what  you obviously have shown in Australia.  Yeah, so I guess the first thing to say is that the core principles that we stand by,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:03):**  the practices we implement, our tactics, they're all very transferable.  So we stick to those.  We've got the playbook.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:12):**  We've got the processes and the systems.  We can roll this out pretty much everywhere.  It's just we're in different climates in the US, different landscapes, different culture,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:26):**  as you said, different regulatory environment, a lot more complex, Cohen.  So environmental groups, dealing with wildlife, just different.  And I think for us, dealing with different climates, so dealing with winter, dealing  
**[0:16:47-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:47):**  with snowpack, dealing with elevation, we're learning, but we're transferring the same  principles and the same practices.  It's just in a different environment, different climate, more stakeholders that are involved  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:06):**  and have an opinion and have a say.  So it's exciting and we're really up for it.  I'm really excited about what we could do there.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:17):**  And I think too, for us, being so close to so many consumers in the US is really exciting  for us.  So one of the things that, one of the parts of the puzzle that we feel a little bit as  
**[0:17:33-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:33):**  pioneers in this space that we haven't cracked, we feel like we've got enough background and  evidence now around soil carbon, biodiversity credits, renewables on farm, premiumization  of carbon credits, these sorts of things, we feel like we've got some knowledge and  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:54):**  some experience and expertise.  And we've demonstrated that.  What we probably haven't done enough of yet due to the kind of the demographics and the  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:06):**  markets in Australia is that we haven't quite premiumized enough of the food and the fiber  that we produced.  So that's always been an ambition of ours to try and attract a premium for food that's  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:23):**  produced in an environmentally and socially conscious way.  And so we feel like the fact that we're all of a sudden in a country that has so many  more, 10 times more the consumers and wealthier consumers most probably in some key cities,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:44):**  that's exciting for us because if we can bring those premiums back to the farm gate, you  remember on our first podcast, that was my kind of golden wish.  If I could bring more, better returns back to the farmers so they could reinvest in their  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:00):**  assets that to me, that's gold.  And are you planning or thinking, are you going to set up your own brand, which of course  in the US is very competitive market, let's say, are you going to partner with some of  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:13):**  the ones?  Like, well, how do you see that happening or playing out over the next years to make  sure that those premiums, that hard earned premiums are flowing back to the farm and  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:24):**  not get lost in the commoditization of many of those markets, which you might be more  prone to in Australia where a lot of this is going to export because it's a relatively  small local market.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:36):**  And then of course, setting up supply webs and lines that are premiumized is very, very  difficult.  Now you're in a market that is relatively close, quote unquote, but it feels a lot closer.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:48):**  What do you see there?  What's your role there?  Is it going to be, which directions do you see it taking?  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:54):**  Is it this big enough to set up your own brands?  Are you going to do onsite slaughtering and processing?  What do you feel there are next steps you want to explore?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:03):**  Obviously, imagining you haven't figured out the whole piece here yet.  That's right.  Haven't figured all the piece out, all the pieces of the puzzle out yet.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:14):**  But I mean, I can share with you what we are thinking about.  And what we are thinking about is we think we've got a great story to tell.  We feel like we have some elements that could make up a really great brand around carbon  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:31):**  neutrality and product origination.  And I feel like due to the size of the market and our target market that we will most probably  start, and we have started, to have discussions around partnerships with people with existing  
**[0:20:50-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:50):**  brands, but they want that next level of brand awareness or taking a new product to brand  that says something about carbon neutrality, environmental services, single origin, premium  product.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:07):**  So we've started those conversations.  And we're thinking about our production systems so that we can feed into that supply chain.  And so it's very early.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:20):**  And in my experience, you might remember we spoke about a vertically integrated business  we had in Australia around grass fed beef.  So in my experience, we need a really robust, here's this word resilient again, resilient  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:36):**  supply chain that can deliver the quality and quantity that you need to support a brand.  So we will focus on the supply side probably considerably in the next one to two years,  but we've already started the discussions around partnerships and what the product needs  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:56):**  to be to create brands with those partners.  So yeah, that's kind of our strategy so far, but we're only six months into the journey.  And let's start to unpack a bit of the carbon side of things and the natural capital.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:14):**  First carbon, I mean, you were instrumental in the deal with Microsoft and we had actually  Christian of Regen Network, I will link the interview below as well.  So how did that happen?  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:25):**  Probably the first soil carbon credit sold internationally or sold even in generally  to a very high profile buyer, obviously.  How did that happen?  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:36):**  And then what happened since then?  Or how do you see that?  And we talked about biodiversity credits as well.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:40):**  Like let's start to unpack the natural capital side a bit, but let's start with the carbon  deal, the soil carbon deal that happened I think a year and a half ago maybe or a year  ago.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:51):**  I don't remember the exact details.  Yeah, February, I think it was February 21.  So yeah, a bit over 12 months.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:00):**  So I guess going back to the thought, and I think I explained last time about we are  quite a data centric business and we have had since about 2010 consistent soil data  taken in the same GPS location across some ranches using the same lab to test our soil  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:24):**  all of this time and off the back of this data set and actually after meeting Christian  in San Francisco actually where I think I saw you in 2019.  So we were on a, at that point in time, we were actually on a bit of a mission to find  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:41):**  the best technology to measure soil carbon, the best markets that we wanted to partner  with to sell soil carbon and who we thought the leaders were in this emerging space.  And spending time with Christian and we went and met four or five other parties whilst  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:58):**  were there a colleague of mine, the head of our natural capital division.  Off the back of that and with the data we had, we felt like we knew the amount of carbon  we'd kind of sequestered.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:14):**  We knew the trend line from our ranches and so off the back of that and with satellite  data to verify what had also happened, we were able to sell what you call vintage carbon.  So it was carbon that was generated between 2017 and 2020.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:31):**  So it was three years of carbon.  We call it vintage carbon.  So it wasn't carbon that we were going to sequester in the future.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:38):**  It's carbon that we already had sequestered.  And so that's what we worked with Christian and Toby and my team worked with Christian's  team to help validate that and we had some third parties audit that as well and Microsoft  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:54):**  had their own DD team on this.  So it was the relationship with Christian and the Regen network and then those guys  approached Microsoft.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:04):**  When Microsoft, you may have seen they put out expressions of interest.  They chose our product.  You might be aware that Microsoft have a commitment to offset emissions back to 1972 and they  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:19):**  wanted a terrestrial based carbon credit solution to go in their bucket of offsets for that  cohort and it just so happened that we were about the only one that had a chunk of carbon  of three assets that we managed here in Australia.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:36):**  So that was great.  We didn't sell all the credits.  We sold a percentage and yeah, the deal was done and it was great.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:45):**  So I think your question was what's next or what's the future?  Yeah, what happened?  Because I'm imagining the phone started ringing since the press releases went out and what  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:56):**  has happened since then?  Let's start on the carbon side first and then we go to the rest of the natural capital stack.  Yeah, so the phone did ring and it was large global emitters that are in the oil and gas  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:09):**  sector trading houses that wanted to trade carbon, institutional banks, investors.  We had people saying, we're flying up in the morning, we want to talk to you about some  credits and we're saying, don't fly anywhere, don't leave home.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:25):**  We've got no more to sell you just right now.  So since then, we have, so that was a private market deal that we did with Microsoft.  Since then, we have continued to generate under the same protocol, carbon.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:45):**  So we can credit again under the same method with Regen Network and we most probably will  either this year or next.  So that's what we've been doing with carbon under that private protocol.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:59):**  We've also registered under the Australian government method as well.  We've got, I think, three projects registered under that as well.  So we've taken on that.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:11):**  We've been involved in supporting the government in helping iron out some of their initial  issues around permanence and crown cover and what we call carbon stacking.  So they're making legislative changes to enable more farmers to participate in the Australian  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:30):**  government regulated soil carbon method because there was just a few too many barriers to  entry and one being cost to participate, primarily the cost of the soil testing.  So we've registered more projects and continue to sequester carbon and then we will start  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:51):**  crediting when we think it's financially feasible to credit on those new projects.  And just to mention that basically there is a regulated market in Australia on soil carbon,  so a below ground.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:08):**  How has that been going in terms of, has it been interesting in terms of pricing for you?  Like this comes out of the Australian government's pockets or because it doesn't get sold to  Microsoft, et cetera.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:17):**  This is a public project basically to incentivize farmers.  Has it been interesting so far?  Have you sold anything?  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:24):**  Has it been important for the returns or has it been mostly also helping to build this  example as well, just as you mentioned before, because I think it's the only one globally  where there is a regulated market for soil carbon that is public and not voluntary like  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:40):**  you see in many other places.  Yeah, so it is public and we haven't sold anything in that market as yet.  And you're right, it is the government has been the market as well and they have created  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:56):**  an auction and they've had a reverse auction and they've also been the regulator.  So just recently they've said that they don't feel like they can be the market and the regulator,  which is from a conflict and governance point of view, it's the right thing.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:11):**  So that has had an impact on the Australian government, what we call ACCU market, Australian  Carbon Credit Unit market.  It's had an impact on that.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:21):**  It's primarily saying we're now letting the market go private and that has had an impact  on price.  The price has come off.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:29):**  I think that's probably a short term change in price.  I'm sure it will sort of get momentum back to where it was and maybe even excel.  But that's where we're at.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:46):**  We're getting a lot better in Australia with the government around what we call stacking.  So not only can you on one farm or one piece of land, not only can you have a soil carbon  project, you can now also have a veg carbon project.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:02):**  And we're hoping that when this is finally legislated, you'll be able to also have your,  if you want to do a cattle herd methodology or a Savannah burning methodology, you could,  so in theory, you may be able to have one, two, maybe three different carbon projects  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:19):**  on the one parcel of land.  And that's when the returns get somewhat interesting.  Let's talk about the returns first and then about the carbon potential, what you've been  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:30):**  seeing.  Has this been also the deal with Microsoft, which I don't think the price was released,  but has it been significantly interesting or has it been so far like for the returns  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:41):**  on like on a range level because you're managing this obviously for investors.  I don't think any of your models or investing models are based purely on the carbon side  or selling off credits.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:51):**  It's based on production.  It's based on margins.  It's based on markets and premium markets, as you mentioned now.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:58):**  How important has this natural capital selling been and where does it go?  Like, is this going to be an interesting profit driver for land owners at some point or is  it already the case maybe?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:10):**  Well, under some methods, so we have a method in the Australian government system here called  HIR, it's human-induced revegetation, and primarily it's to stop farmers clearing land  of woody vegetation.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:27):**  And under that method, the carbon market has pretty much now underpinned that whole business  model.  You know, there is funds and investors that are buying assets in Australia purely to put  
**[0:31:42-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:42):**  into a HIR project and the returns are purely from the carbon and those returns are very,  you know, respected in the market.  We haven't, we've bought some of those assets for investors, but it's not really our bread  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:00):**  and butter in terms of where we want to see impact.  We think soil carbon is where we can have the most impact and is best for climate.  And if we're going to be nature positive, we think in the soil carbon markets is the  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:14):**  place to go.  And so back when we did the soil carbon deal, we're seeing annual cash yield, you know,  upticks of say 40 basis points and in some, of some farms up to 100 basis points.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:27):**  So on an annual cash yield basis.  And that's at a price that's, you know, in the, in the teens, let's call it.  We're now talking about prices that are in the mid to high twenties.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:39):**  So maybe, you know, you start getting 50, 60 basis points on an annual basis just from  one carbon project, a soil carbon project.  So it's starting to be more significant depending where you are.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:54):**  And if the price continues to rise you know, if we follow Europe as an example, I think  we're at a hundred per, yeah, a hundred euros, I think.  I think you're a hundred euros.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:07):**  So that becomes substantial.  And don't forget the, one of the key core drivers here is to improve soil health.  So whilst you, you might be monetizing excess carbon once you've offsetted your emissions,  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:22):**  but your asset base is becoming more resilient at the same time.  You're storing more water, your soil is healthier, your plants should be healthier and you should  be producing healthier food.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:34):**  So it's, it's becoming significant.  It's still complexed.  You need specialists to help you with it.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:45):**  We're building out our team, doing more in this space, but it's exciting for farmers  that are doing the right thing.  Is there one of the reasons you're also wanting to be closer to consumers in this case, actually  
**[0:33:58-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:58):**  consumers of carbon, soil carbon credits and other credits like being in the US, putting  you closer to the Microsoft of this world?  Is that, was that a strategic move also there to see, okay, can we get closer to a voluntary  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:14):**  market where the market is potentially willing to pay?  I mean, we have the stripes of this world that are doing a lot of experimental work  and paying significant prices per ton.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:23):**  I put the interview with Jim Mann, I think on enhanced rock weathering and biochar, they  are at 50 or 100 and 200 per ton.  Like, was that the reason to go to the US as well and be closer to that market, not  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:36):**  just the market of the produce and the products you produce?  Yeah, for sure.  So we're always challenging ourselves around, can we solve someone's problem?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:46):**  And I think for some large corporates in the private sector in the US, we can solve their  carbon challenges or more so their emissions problems.  And I feel like there is an opportunity for a firm like us to partner with some big corporations  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:06):**  and deliver ongoing carbon credits to offset some of their emissions.  And I think it may underpin and or enable us to raise capital off long term commitments  with some of those partners in the US.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:22):**  So we'll be talking to more of those partners around solving some of their problems through  a nature based solution and being nature positive.  So I hope I answered your question, but the answer is yes.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:37):**  Absolutely.  And then to switch a bit to the carbon potential from all the different crops you mentioned,  the different soil types, etc. and all the measurements you do, where do you see the  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:49):**  largest carbon potential?  Because of course, if you go and talk to Microsoft or to others, and they would say, okay, what  do we need to do?  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:56):**  Of course, we need to produce the food.  But what what systems do we need to put in place, depending where you are, that see that  is that the silvopasture that we see in drawdown?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:04):**  Is it regenerative grazing?  Like, what have you seen in the field with doing all these measurements that really is  is there something that stands out?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:12):**  And what is the potential there?  Like, is it is it worth the hype we're having now basically on carbon?  Or is there a bit more nuanced message that comes out of the field?  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:23):**  I think if in our experience, I mean, and others will have other experiences, but in  our experience, what excites me the most is, you know, I think the planet has some is covered  something like 50% grasslands or 60% grasslands or savanna, right?  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:40):**  So there's all these plants out there that if only we could stimulate them with livestock  more, we could sequester more carbon.  So for me, it's a no brainer.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:49):**  And that's why we're so passionate about the role that livestock play in ecosystems is  that we think that they're the key to taking a low value product as in savanna grass, a  lignin, high quality, high, high content lignin product and convert it into nutrient dense  
**[0:37:07-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:07):**  protein being beef, whilst at the same time, asking these plants to function and work and  draw down carbon and sink that excess carbon exudate into soil.  For us, that's, that's where the real opportunity is.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:24):**  We also, so that's kind of at a macro level.  And that's where we've got experience and that's where we've got, you know, track records,  so to speak.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:35):**  What we are looking at at the moment is we like some of the permanent tree crops.  And so in Australia, as an example, we have, we're testing out macadamias because they're  a native tree.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:49):**  They do on a per hectare basis or per acre basis sequester and store in their biomass  a large amount of carbon as well.  So there is some specific plant species that we like to focus on from a carbon point of  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:04):**  view.  But, you know, again, all of these models are going to stack up financially for investors  and we have to demonstrate good financial returns.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:14):**  So in that sort of lens, we we're open to other opportunities because we are looking  to diversify and, and I guess manage our carbon risk, our generation risk as well.  And do you see a role, I mean, this sounds like different properties, but a role of integration  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:31):**  there as well between the going towards a more silver pasture system, like an integration  of trees in agriculture and livestock operations?  Have you done that or do you see it or is that too complex still to do that on the scales  
**[0:38:47-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:47):**  you operate?  I think so when it comes to the integration for us, I look at the...  Does it help the tree to grow better, faster, like if the grass around is managed by animals,  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:01):**  like is there, I mean, there's, there's a lot of research obviously on that, mostly  on smaller scale.  I'm getting for sure emails now, but like, what, what do you see that from like putting  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:09):**  your financial glasses on?  Is that something you, you would like to do and see potential in?  Yeah, we see potential in it.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:16):**  We'd like to do it.  We think it stacks up from an environmental point of view and I think from an efficiency  point of view, it just, to us it makes sense.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:24):**  So in these intensive tree crops, I think the, I think the integration for me of choice  is birds and we haven't quite worked out.  I didn't expect that sound like, okay, birds.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:38):**  So you mean as in poultry and I think I was like, what is he going to say?  Birds, I mean, some birds coming in, like what are you planning there, Bert?  Yeah.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:46):**  It's, it's, it's poultry.  It might be, yeah, it might be chickens for meat or eggs or may or turkeys or something  along those lines.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:57):**  But I think, you know, large, large animals or even, even pigs and sheep, my team are  telling me it's getting more and more complex to have them in the system.  Could be wrong, but just with the way we harvest and the things we do in those intensive tree  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:15):**  environments I think birds may be the, maybe they go there.  And so we're interested in exploring that.  So yeah, I think financially it'll make some sense because what we mainly find if wherever  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:29):**  we bring in an animal to, to, into an existing system and use them as a tool, it makes us  more efficient.  It brings down our cost and it produces a cleaner product.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:41):**  So we're all for that.  I've heard very interesting things on geese actually, because I think it's the only one  that fully can be fully raised on pasture.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:51):**  It doesn't need outside, doesn't need grain, et cetera, like many poultry need.  And shout out to, I think it's one of the only organic geese egg producers in the UK  that reached out recently.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:02):**  Anyway, I learned a lot on the video they shared.  So thank you for, I hope they're listening to this one as well, but there's, there's  very interesting roles for, for animals in, on the farm.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:12):**  And then let's tackle a big one.  What do you say when people say, of course the livestock can, or not of course, let's  say livestock can store X amount of carbon.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:21):**  What about the methane?  What is your natural response?  You must get this question all the time.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:26):**  We let's say, especially ruminants get a very bad rep, especially the cow even worse.  What do you say when people bring up the methane elephant in the room, let's say.  Yeah, it's a good one.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:40):**  And it's an interesting one because I guess, and that's a little bit why we have focused  on sequestration as opposed to emissions up until now.  Now I say that living in Australia, if I was in Europe, I would be saying something different  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:55):**  because I think it's, it's my understanding that the focus is a lot more on emissions  as opposed to sequestration.  But that's my personal view that I don't have a lot of data to back that up.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:06):**  So to answer your question, I think for us, we like to think that we can sequester more  than what we're, what we're emitting and we do that.  You'll be in net positive.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:16):**  Yeah.  And you do that through life cycle assessment and we wouldn't have carbon credits to sell  if we didn't do that.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:23):**  And if we couldn't, if we didn't produce more than we emitted.  I think there's definitely an interesting piece of industry work and experimentation  to come out of what we're doing around asparagus and seaweed in the beef sector.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:43):**  We're actually, not only is it happening in Australia, but we're actually doing something  with UC Davis out of California on the ranches we have in the US around feeding seaweed in  a grass fed system.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:57):**  So not just in a, in a feed yard, we're doing that as well, but we're doing one in a, in  a grass fed system as well to see what the emissions is in that environment.  And can we raise cattle in a grass fed system with, with asparagus and what's the emissions  
**[0:43:14-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:14):**  reduction in that environment.  And you know, so I think that's a real solution.  How do you measure that?  
**[0:43:20-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:20):**  I guess I've seen, I think most of the research on methane has been done historically in,  in closed environments, so the CAFO operations.  Like I've seen very little outside or grassland ones because I think it's very tricky to do.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:37):**  And that sort of leads to, to potential question of if all of this data is based on, on grain  fat and, and soy fat cows, it might be that the methane is a lot lower if it's, it's a  diverse grass fed system.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:52):**  But we'll never know as we don't do that actual burping research.  And that like, could all this research on the methane and all of these bars where the  cow is of course the worst thing of the climate we ever did be based on, of the standard of  
**[0:44:06-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:06):**  the industry, which is CAFO.  But that might put the regenerative ranching ones in the wrong corner.  Like they're, they're being accused of something that might not be even be happening because  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:18):**  the cows are much healthier.  They're not burping so much.  There's not a lot of methane being produced.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:22):**  I think some research of Ross Konzer showed that there's a significant reduction if cows  are healthy and cows are in a good grassland situation, cows are much healthier and you  lose about 80% of that methane emission, which is a lot in that.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:36):**  So is that, I feel that we're not really comparing apples and apples there.  Have you seen that as well?  Like what's the discussion there to like in the deeper weeds as soon as you start wanting  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:47):**  to sell these craters because people will ask those questions.  Yes.  And that's exactly why we want to do this.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:53):**  You know, there's two reasons why we really want to do this research with UC Davis.  One is we want to see if the product works in, in the feedlot environment.  And we do want to compare it to the grassland natural grazing system.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:09):**  So they'll both run side by side.  Both trials will have controls and, and those animals within the trial.  So that will be great.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:20):**  The other thing is that if you take a step back, Cohen, majority of livestock still spend  a large majority of their time in grasslands.  So if we don't solve the emissions problem for livestock whilst they're on grasslands,  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:34):**  then we're not really solving the emissions that come out of let's face it, agriculture.  The majority of them, you know, livestock are a big contributor to agriculture's emissions.  So if it's true that there's a large number of livestock out in grasslands globally, then  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:49):**  we have to have a solution to reduce the methane in that environment.  So if we, if these trials are successful and you, you asked, how do you measure them?  Well, we have this thing called a, a green feeder where when they put, when an animal  
**[0:46:06-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:06):**  puts their head in and, and into a feeder, the feeder has a reader for an RFID tag and  it determines whether the animal is in the trial or part of the control group.  And when it puts its head in, then the feeder either drops some feed that the animal likes.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:27):**  So you know, it's obviously high in energy and or salt.  And if it's part of the trial group, it also gets asparagopsis.  But if it's, if it's, if it's not, if it's not, it doesn't.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:40):**  The other thing that does is whilst it's in there, it measures the hydrogen, methane,  and also the CO2 of the animal while it's in there feeding.  So that's how we get the numbers.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:52):**  And that data is pushed up in the cloud and it can be seen in real time, all of those  emissions out of that animal.  So that's really interesting.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:03):**  And that's how we're going to see.  And how do you do that in the field?  Like how do you do that?  
**[0:47:06-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:06):**  If the cow like bends down to start nibbling on the grass and gets that interaction going  with, with the roots and the soil carbon, it's being released, et cetera, et cetera,  et cetera.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:17):**  Like how do you measure it there?  Like how do we, because this is an inside environment, I understand because there we  have the sensors, but out on the field when the cow is actually self-selecting whatever  
**[0:47:27-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:27):**  here she wants to eat, how do we then add the seaweed to that and how do we make it  a fair comparison?  So I don't know the answer.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:36):**  I'm just wondering, like, how do we do that?  So just to be clear, and so I may not have explained that correctly, these feeders are  going to be out in the pasture.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:46):**  So the animals are going to be eating grass, but they've also got access to the feeder.  So I think it's the first time this kind of trial has been done in that environment.  And that's what we're really interested in to seeing the outcomes of that.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:02):**  Super interesting.  No, it's very interesting.  The whole methane discussion, because I've yet to meet someone who's deep into, I mean,  
**[0:48:09-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:09):**  obviously because they're biased, but into livestock and into the potential that is really  worried about the methane part.  And it seems mostly people that are not connected to agriculture are very worried about it or,  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:19):**  and I see now finally a bit more attention for the methane coming off.  I mean, the flaring, et cetera, but also the methane coming off of, let's say, the fertilizer  used in the chemical fertilizers.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:31):**  Like there's a lot of methane that's not connected to livestock and which might be a lot easier  to solve.  But anyway, on closing the methane part, so you're going to do some very fundamental research.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:42):**  Research that has never been done before.  Do you see then taking it to the next levels, let's say, or the natural capital stack, what  has been happening in water and biodiversity?  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:55):**  What you've seen like the other big, maybe even bigger topics.  Like if we run a carbon is a nice side benefit from increasing biodiversity and water storage.  What have you seen there?  
**[0:49:06-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:06):**  Has the market been waking up?  Do we see proper management?  Have you sold something or do you see interest coming to, because it seems like biodiversity  
**[0:49:13-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:13):**  is getting a bit more buzz at least.  But have you seen that too?  Yeah, I think there's a little bit more buzz there.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:22):**  I don't think the markets have really matured greatly.  I think measuring biodiversity has still become somewhat of a challenge.  We have actually sold some credits off one of our farms in Australia to a large utility  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:41):**  company that needed to buy some offsets.  Those offsets, those biodiversity offsets were relatively high value because on one  of our farms, just based on our management, our large rotational grazing, as you know,  
**[0:49:58-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:58):**  supports biodiversity and regeneration of plants.  It just so happened that we regenerated a native grass species that was historically  native to the area and had been missing from the environment for years and years.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:11):**  But under our management, this native grass came back and it increased the value of the  biodiversity credit.  So I think there is small pockets of biodiversity credits being sold.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:24):**  Valuing it, I think has still got some work to do.  I mean, we've been offered off one farm here in Australia.  The farm might be say 20,000 acres.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:37):**  We've been offered something like $40 million for the biodiversity credits off that farm  that have been generated.  It's one thing to have the credits and the value on them.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:50):**  It's another thing to take them to the market.  So whether you get paid for that biodiversity value is still yet to be seen in full.  We've seen it in and we've been paid for in isolated cases.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:03):**  But for big chunks of biodiversity credits, we haven't done a big deal with that yet.  And not to say that that won't happen, but I'm interested to see if the market does meet  us where it is in theory valued at.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:25):**  And do you see it as almost more important than carbon?  Do you see this equal?  Or could it be because this whole carbon focus, like very single minded focus on carbon seems  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:35):**  a bit off.  If you look at a landscape, you look at a farm, if you look at it holistically, like  what is yours?  
**[0:51:44-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:44):**  Or because it seems easier to measure, which maybe it isn't even, but the carbon piece  have been hyped so much in a sense, we have to fight carbon and climate change.  So we have to, carbon is the enemy, etc, etc.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:55):**  What do you like, what is missing on the framing almost of biodiversity to get it to the same  level of attention?  Because we lost 60-70% of insect cover, we lost, I don't know how many plants, most of  
**[0:52:06-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:06):**  them not even named.  That seems to be almost the real crisis we're not really willing to face.  Well, it's really interesting, isn't it?  
**[0:52:17-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:17):**  Because there's been all this, as you say, hype about carbon, and it's linked to climate  change and global warming.  It just so happens that the big industries, the big companies globally, governments have  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:32):**  realized that they're going to have to reduce emissions so that by carbon offsets, that  creates a market and to your point, all the hype.  But it's a really good question you ask, what about biodiversity?  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:45):**  And as you say, we have lost a lot.  It's so important in our systems, right?  It's so important in our landscapes, the role it plays.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:56):**  And it's so important if you're in the business of producing food.  Because that one grass type that you mentioned could be fundamental for the health of that  cow and the grazing system that was there.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:09):**  I mean, there are so many things we don't know in terms of interactions and more diverse  and more complex, unfortunately, I mean, for your team, but more complex and more diverse  in many cases is more resilient, like you mentioned at the beginning.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:21):**  We might uncover things and interactions that we had no clue about.  And we only can find out if they're still there.  And there might be some seeds hidden somewhere.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:30):**  But until the right management practice is applied, they won't come up because they need  certain things that we maybe the elder still remember, but we don't.  That's so true.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:39):**  And, you know, the key in our business, in our extensive agricultural production systems,  in our suite of assets, plants are just the key for us.  Like without a diverse set of plants in our systems, we don't have soil health.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:57):**  Without these biodiverse, healthy plants, we don't have healthy animals.  I mean, we can't produce, you know, healthy crops without our plants and soils being 100%  healthy.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:10):**  So we need all this stuff.  We need biodiversity in our systems.  And so, you know, we talk about it all the time, you know, in our team, you know, plants  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:20):**  are the key to this.  And so I don't have all the answers around biodiversity.  I just know that we've got to measure it, manage it and try and enhance it.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:33):**  And so we, you know, we're working on this.  Measuring it is not easy, but you've got to start somewhere.  We work with a lot of third parties and ecologists to help us get this done, but it's so important.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:46):**  And I think everyone's got a role to play in improving biodiversity.  And yeah, we will be hopefully paying a bit more attention on the podcast as well on this.  And then I know you have some exciting news of that's why you're in a motel in Sydney  
**[0:55:04-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:04):**  to actually focus.  Not only, I mean, it doesn't mean like this, a lot of this conversation was on North America,  but it doesn't mean that you're no longer working in Australia, actually doing some  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:13):**  very exciting work on a domestic fund in Australia.  Can you share a bit more about it?  I think it's early, but what triggered that instead of going from managed accounts for  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:25):**  investors and mostly outside investors that want to invest in Australia to raising the  money upfront, building a fund and then deploying it, what triggered that transition?  Because it's a big transition as a team as well.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:37):**  Yeah, so I guess the first thing to say is it's just offering another, for us offering  another product because through separate managed accounts that attracts a certain investor  profile.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:52):**  But what it also does is it excludes other investors from the asset class and from our  management and the outcomes that come from our management and those returns, both financial  and environmental returns.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:05):**  So we wanted to open up a product to a larger segment of the market so that more investors  could invest with us.  Just from an efficiency and a return profile point of view, in Australian dollars, we couldn't  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:22):**  really take in capital under say $10 million in a separate managed account.  So what this is doing is...  That reduces the market a bit.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:30):**  It does.  So therefore by offering this new product to the market, which is a natural capital  and real asset fund, it will just open it up to more and more investors and investors  
**[0:56:46-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:46):**  that want to have some exposure to the asset class but probably haven't had the capacity  to go on their own in a separate managed account.  So this fund will focus, as I said, on real assets in agriculture.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:00):**  We've got some future ambitions to bring in other things such as venture capital around  ag tech and climate tech and also...  You talked about that before.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:12):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And emissions reduction and even some financing options.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:17):**  I think we spoke about green finance and environmental finance.  So that's in say years two, three, whatever, but first and foremost, real assets and carbon.  And within that portfolio, there will be very succinct strategies there and some tactics  
**[0:57:34-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:34):**  in investing in real assets that operate livestock and carbon and others that do cropping livestock  and carbon and then permanent tree crops and timber.  So three real pillars to the real asset initiative to start with.  
**[0:57:53-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:53):**  And that's all about managing risk, driving financial returns and I guess giving us some  levers and tools to pull that will reduce our costs but hopefully result in better outcomes  and good carbon returns along the way, along with biodiversity and good financial returns.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:16):**  So that's the plan.  And what are your targets?  When would you like to...  
**[0:58:22-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:22):**  What terms of size are you considering and when are you thinking of first close or something  like that?  So yeah, I think first close would be in the next three to six months.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:37):**  I mean, that's yet to really be defined.  And the first close, we would like to have a hundred million dollars raised by the end  of this calendar year here in Australia.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:48):**  The longer term plan is to have $500 million under management in this fund.  And that would again bring in probably the venture capital and the finance piece.  In the short term though, we'll try and...  
**[0:59:03-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:03):**  First bite would be a $50 million investment to get out and get that deployed, start getting  action on the ground, start baselining for carbon, getting the right people on the ground,  getting the strategy deployed.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:17):**  So that's step one.  I think it's a perfect end of this check-in.  I want to thank you so much for your time this morning.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:28):**  Let's make sure it's not going to be another three years before we check in again.  And to be able to follow...  And thank you for sharing and allowing us as the podcast to follow your journey as it  
**[0:59:40-0:59:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:40):**  evolves and as it comes to fruition.  Thank you so much for the work you do and for coming on here to talk about it.  Thanks, Cohen.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:48):**  And thank you as well.  I mean, you're building fantastic awareness in this space.  So just with the numbers you get on your downloads and your podcasts, you should be proud of that.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:58):**  And we'll support you, pardon the pun, until the cows come home.  So hope we get to see you soon.  And thanks very much.

**[1:00:37-1:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:00:37):**  That really helps.  Thanks again and see you next time.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:00:54-1:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:00:54):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:01:04-1:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:01:04):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:01:18):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[1:01:25-1:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:01:25):**  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[1:01:31-1:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:01:31):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[1:01:35-1:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:01:35):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:01:41):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  
**[1:01:56-1:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:01:56):**  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:02:06-1:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:06):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  No.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:13):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:25):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:34):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:43):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:02:58-1:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:58):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:03:09):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:03:16):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:03:25):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

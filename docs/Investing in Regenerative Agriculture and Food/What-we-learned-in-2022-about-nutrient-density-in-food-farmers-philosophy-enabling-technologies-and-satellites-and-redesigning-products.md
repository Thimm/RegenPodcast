### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2022-12-27)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:00:14):**  Wow, what a year it has been.  Just when you thought things couldn't get any crazier, pandemics and stuff, we find  ourselves in a war in Europe.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:00:22):**  Crazy energy and food prices and extremely high inflation rates in general.  In an ideal world, farms applying regenerative practices are more resilient.  But as we saw with the story of Josh, the founder of Park Karak, farms can get into  
**[0:00:36-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:00:36):**  trouble very quickly when input prices spike, in this case organic grain from Ukraine to  feed the ducks.  It seems like Josh and his partner Abigail will make it through the winter though and  
**[0:00:46-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:00:46):**  are building hard on their more resilient future, which will include climate neutral  and even positive eggs.  The most important story, healthy soils equal healthy food equal healthy people is arguably  
**[0:00:58-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:00:58):**  the most important story we shared in 2022.  We kicked off the new nutrient density and food series, unpacking this crucial piece  of the puzzle supported by the A-Team Foundation, who is looking to make investments and donations  
**[0:01:11-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:01:11):**  in this space.  We interviewed Anne Bickley and David R. Montgomery, who are not only co-author of the study soil  health and nutrient density, preliminary comparison of regenerative and conventional farming,  
**[0:01:24-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:01:24):**  but also wrote the book What Your Food Ate.  If you haven't read it, please do it as soon as possible and give it to somebody interested  in health.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:01:32):**  The interviews with Fred Provenza and Susanna really showed how strong this connection is.  We look forward to continue this series in 2023.  Request, if you have people we should interview that are building companies into food from  
**[0:01:45-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:01:45):**  healthy soil as medicine space, please let us know.  You can find the link to get in touch and the contact page on our website.  Farmers philosophy series and video.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:01:56):**  There's so much more we can learn from the key decision makers of our time, farmers,  than only soil health.  And this deserves time and space.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:02:03):**  Following the legends in the podcasting world, we couldn't stay behind.  And in November, we recorded our first video interview together with regenerative farmer  and pioneer Jeroen Klomp.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:02:12):**  We sat down, took time to go deep.  We covered a lot of ground while really enjoying the process.  Let us know in the comments what you think.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:02:19):**  And thank you so much, Gus, for Detox Story Travelers for experimenting with us.  Hopefully more video deep dives in this series will follow in 2023.  The video series is wonderful, but has much more complexity and cost than simply an audio  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:02:31):**  interview.  So we're currently looking for some funding to do more of them.  Contact us if you have ideas.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:02:37):**  Thank you.  Going deeper.  The video episode wasn't the only place where we went deeper.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:02:41):**  None other than Charles Eisenstein joined us for a deep conversation.  And with Thomas Hogan, have enough planetary impact ventures, we discussed regenerative  investing while Kista Grant, co-founder Lauren, joined us to talk about regenerative businesses.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:02:55):**  Sometimes it seems like regenerative practices are new, but if you dig deeper, you quickly  find that we stand on the shoulders of absolute and mostly indigenous giants.  Liz Carlisle shared her findings from her latest book, an absolutely amazing read and  
**[0:03:09-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:03:09):**  great gift.  And recently Wouter joined us on the show to talk about the root cause of all of our  issues, private land ownership.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:03:17):**  Maybe a nice thought for the holidays.  When you had a lucky career, your company took off.  Obviously you worked very hard and you had a liquidity event, which is just fancy talk  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:03:25):**  for a good financial exit.  What is enough and what do you do with the rest?  Friends of the show.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:03:33):**  So many people came back this year on the podcast to check in and share the updates  about their work from Southern Africa, Gijs Boers on researching more than a thousand  farms, Jonathan Lundgren on how rock dust can save us all with Jim Mann and Benedict  
**[0:03:46-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:03:46):**  came back to update us on how the transition is going on his 3000 hectare farm, one hour  of Berlin.  Well, Dan Miller of Seward came back to highlight the role of the crowd in financing, meat processing  
**[0:03:57-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:03:57):**  and other processing infrastructure.  Bert Glover discuss how Impact Ag Partners has invested over 600 million into regenerative  farms in the US and Australia and sold soil carbon credits to Microsoft.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:04:09):**  And of course, Sarah Shear of Eco agriculture partners came back to share about their landscape  scale regeneration work, 1000 landscapes for 1 billion people.  Absolute legends joining the show.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:04:21):**  Abby Rose, friend of the show, revealed her new project with Nicole Masters, where they  want every farmer to start observing their land much better and take better decisions.  Felipe Passini of Life and Centropy took us on a deep dive into the world of centropic  
**[0:04:33-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:04:33):**  agroforestry, why trees to lead to much more rain.  And when you're in doubt, you should always plant more trees.  I'm too lazy to farm against nature.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:04:42):**  I think this was the title of the year.  Matt Chatfield of the Cornwall Project and myself just had a blast ping ponging back  and forth about life, sheeps, building markets, margins and doing what his neighbors don't  
**[0:04:53-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:04:53):**  consider work, but definitely is observing sheep for a few hours a day.  I can't wait to sit next to him and record another episode.  We learned so much about the magical underground world from Tobi of Spahn.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:05:05):**  She really explained why mycelium and not us are really running the show.  Biodiversity it seems finally to be a growing theme as the interviews with Cameron of Pivotol  and Kath of Naturemetrics showed us.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:05:19):**  Magic enabling technologies.  Which technologies can really enable many more farmers to start a regenerative transition?  Virtual fencing seems one of them.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:05:28):**  Listen to the interview we had with Knut Benson, the CEO of No Fence.  Ish and Tom joined us and schooled us about the possibilities of remote sensing.  Wow, this really feels like almost magic.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:05:40):**  And also the company is actually roomy and agreed are using the power of remote sensing.  Investable, bankable, these buzz terms came back as well.  How do we make regenerative agriculture, the sector bankable and investable for institutional  
**[0:05:53-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:05:53):**  investors, the pension funds, the insurance companies, the big money, let's say.  In our conversations with Boris, we looked at how to make region farming projects bankable.  And while with Eric Archambault, we explored how to get large institutional investors writing  
**[0:06:06-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:06:06):**  100, 200, 500 million euro dollar tickets active in regeneration.  Redesigning products and CPG.  Emma Chow and Elliot Beebe explained why for large corporates is simply not enough purchasing  
**[0:06:19-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:06:19):**  one cash crop regeneratively between brackets, whatever that means.  It's just not good enough.  The real magic and impact happens when you redesign recipes and buy full rotations and  
**[0:06:29-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:06:29):**  form full landscapes as well, of course, as giving food a true price, as we discovered  in the conversation with Pietro of the Impact Institute.  Not only food, we actually covered some other topics as well.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:06:41):**  With Johannes of Koya, we entered a world of fashion to understand how you can design  and sell a regenerative shoe.  Anthony Corsaro made a very strong case for regenerative companies.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:06:52):**  Businesses in their farming expert third region enthusiast turned running Patagonia Provisions.  Paul Lightfoot did.  And Rafaella joined us from Brazil to talk about her snack brand, which is working towards  
**[0:07:04-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:07:04):**  regenerative sourcing.  And Erove made a very, very strong case for looking at the most fraudulent crop in the  Mediterranean, which are olives and olive oil, and how to sell olive like wine.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:07:15):**  So olive oil like wine in Switzerland and bring much more of this money to olive farmers.  Women, so many women are working in the space from Connie Bowen focusing on designing egg  tech to help farmers doing backbreaking work in the field to Jacqueline.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:07:30):**  We covered with her pumpkin organics, building a baby food brand while taking a closer look  at the baby food industry, which is pretty, pretty shocking.  Regenerative agriculture became key for the model and global activist, Arizona Muse, as  
**[0:07:42-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:07:42):**  well as the former CEO of Patagonia, Rose Macario.  And of course, Nicolette DeHaan joined us to talk why she became a rancher after being  a lawyer working with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:07:54):**  Big ideas, huge ambition and large questions.  Can we IPO natural assets?  Asked Douglas Eger on the podcast.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:08:02):**  And if he has how?  Niels Feigman joined us, an absolute legend in permaculture world.  If you don't know him, just Google his work in Saudi Arabia.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:08:09):**  And now he's working on turning worthless and mostly deserted coastlines into thriving  ecosystems.  Jervé Dubier joined us to drastically change the CUP, which is the Common Agriculture Program  
**[0:08:21-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:08:21):**  in Europe, which is 387 billion a year to really serve soil.  And we had a deep dive with Mariko into the wonderful and very shocking and interesting  world of LCAs, which is lifecycle assessment.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:08:35):**  She did the one on white oak pastures and showed us the potential, but also the extremely  deeply flawed and misused use of LCAs these days.  And our 200th episode is coming up.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:08:47):**  So tune in on January 3rd for a very, very special one.  As always, thank you so much to all the people who took the time to come on the show to answer  my Sometimes City questions.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:08:57):**  And thank you so much for listening, sharing, reaching out with ideas, questions, or simply  to say hello.  I hope you have an amazing holiday period if you're celebrating and I'm looking forward  
**[0:09:06-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:09:06):**  to see you in the new year.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:09:22-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:09:22):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:09:31-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:09:31):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:09:43-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:09:43):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:09:51):**  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:09:55):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:10:00):**  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:10:11):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:10:23-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:10:23):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:10:34):**  Is this course free?  No, this is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:10:42):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:10:53):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:10:58-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:10:58):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:11:11-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:11:11):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:11:23):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:11:36):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:11:42):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/27/what-we-learned-in-2022#t=0:11:53):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

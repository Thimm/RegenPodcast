**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:13):**  We know grazing aruminants can dramatically improve grasslands, which are the majority  of our agriculture lands, and store massive amounts of carbon.  There are great examples around the world from Cape Brown in the US to Kenya with Savory,  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:26):**  Australia, UK, etc.  But how do we get thousands of farmers to change their grazing practices in the next  couple of years?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:34):**  One-on-one training is just not going to scale fast enough, and even after training, most  farmers rightfully so won't risk these massive changes on their farm because they carry all  the risks.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:45):**  So how do we change this paradigm and how do we use the exploding soil carbon markets  and satellite tech to make this happen?  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:02):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities,  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:16):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:27):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  To make it easy for fans to support our work, we launched our membership community and so  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:38):**  many of you have joined us as a member.  Thank you.  If our work created value for you and if you have the means and only if you have the means,

**[0:01:55-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:55):**  Or find the link below.  Welcome to another episode today with Johannes Scheiber, the founder of Rumi, the satellite  grazing app.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:08):**  Financing land regeneration, Rumi works with farmers and companies to create the conditions  for a better future.  Welcome Johannes.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:15):**  Hi, nice to be on.  And yeah, so nice to have you.  The satellite grazing app already does two words together, satellite and grazing.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:23):**  We're going to unpack that for sure.  But I would love to first unpack a bit your background story.  How did you end up founding this company, first of all, working on this issue?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:34):**  And when did you get hooked on soil?  That's always my first question.  How did you get into this crazy rabbit hole that soil carbon can be and soil in general  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:44):**  can be?  Yeah, so we are three co-founders at Rumi.  And we met while working at Daimler on self-driving taxis.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:54):**  And very different sector.  And yeah, we had an office in Berlin.  And in late 2019, there were these massive protests from farmers in Berlin protesting  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:07):**  against the new legislations that are coming, which is, I guess, similar to what's happening  in the Netherlands right now.  So you've probably heard a lot about that also in the media recently.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:18):**  And so the three of us, turns out, we have some background in farming.  I grew up in a really small village where sheep, when I grew up, Patty, second co-founder,  they have beef cattle in their family.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:32):**  Daniel also small village where he grew up, farmers all around and in the family.  And to us, this really made a big impact.  And we just felt like we perhaps have been a little bit too far removed from where we  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:45):**  came from during our professional life.  So we just lived in big cities, only working there, working on problems for cities or solutions  for problems that exist only in cities.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:58):**  And then we have farmers who produce our food, who take care of the majority of our ecosystem.  And they are really having big problems and are in trouble.  And they don't really need self-driving taxis.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:11):**  No, exactly.  That's also something we thought, what are actually the applications for what we're building  here?  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:17):**  And is it really going to make this massive impact to justify us devoting our lives to  it?  And we decided that not, we need to do something different.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:27):**  But all three together as well.  Like, was that an interest?  Like, was that a sort of, I wouldn't say aha moment, but because it could be like one of  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:34):**  you said, okay, I'm not no longer going to work on self-driving taxis.  I'm going to leave and go on a journey to figure out farming.  But actually you decided as a group to do it.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:43):**  Yeah, so we were first, it was Danny and I and actually two others who thought, hey,  let's try this together.  Then two people left and it was just Danny and I, but Patti joined instead.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:55):**  But we all knew each other and been working on this, or like discussing this topic.  And we were just trying to figure out also by talking to farmers what the problems are.  And why are all farmers so dependent on these agricultural inputs?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:12):**  Like yeah.  How did you land on that?  Like how did you, because going from, okay, we need to do something about the issues farmers  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:21):**  and challenges farmers have going to do something actually like physically, like it's a big step.  Like you went on a learning journey.  You remember when that hit you, that the input side is both the challenge and the opportunity?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:34):**  I think it was just talking to a lot of farmers.  So we actually first we thought we're going to do something with organic wine producers  and using drones to help them apply fertilizer, like organic fertilizer.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:47):**  But then we thought, okay, the market is too small, drones are too difficult kind of thing.  And then just talking to farmers and the family, also to Benedict who's been on your show a  couple of times.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:59):**  And we just basically learned, yeah, just by talking to all kinds of farmers and understanding  how they see the world, but also just looking at statistics.  And that kind of made us understand that that's a problem and maybe where the problem comes  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:12):**  from.  If a farmer is dependent on these inputs, at the same time, the government is saying,  you need to stop using those inputs, then you have a massive conflict.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:22):**  But we also saw that there are some farmers who do things differently.  And first we thought, okay, we're going to help all kinds of farmers to move away from  these inputs and to help them detect basically when their crops are in bad health, when they  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:39):**  need water and all of these things.  And then we learned, okay, you can't actually irrigate arable land in Germany, most areas,  there's just no water close enough.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:47):**  So just learning, getting into a completely new industry and knowing nothing.  And then I guess at some point it made click that the ruminants, so that's why we also  call it Rumi, that they actually need to be at the heart of the solution.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:03):**  They're not the problem.  It's been said many times before this, it's not the cow, it's the how.  And we need to...  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:12):**  It's even a documentary and a book actually.  Definitely recommend it if you want to learn more about that.  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:19):**  I'll look into that.  But did you, like when did that click?  Because it's very easy, I think, just generalizing, like you're in a big city in Berlin, relatively  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:29):**  far away from farmers, and you're going to visit them, etc.  But it's potentially easy to go for a fast, easy solution, might be a bit naive, and to  start a vegan brand or to go for, okay, we have to cut out the animals because the animals  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:43):**  are the issue.  But to go beyond that and go to, I mean, of course, if you visit Benedict, you will get  a one on one on what's the role of animals.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:51):**  But that's still you need to be able to, you need to be open to absorbing that and then  working on that instead of saying, no, no, no, we have to cut out all animals.  Did you go into it with a certain idea of it's better to get rid of the animal piece?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:06):**  Or did you go into it?  Or do we have to find a way to make them part of the solution instead of part of the problem?  I think so one thing is that so I'm not a vegetarian or anything.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:15):**  Daniel actually is our third co-founder.  But I always felt like because I grew up in a village, animals are part of what you do,  and you can actually keep animals in a sustainable way.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:25):**  That was just my conviction that it must be possible.  And I think as so Patty, he is a designer, and he just does a lot of user interviews,  he's probably done like a million or so throughout his whole career.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:39):**  And just to keep digging and keep digging and keep asking questions.  That's really what he's really good at.  And I don't know, we probably had 100 farmer interviews within two months or so.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:51):**  That was in early 2021.  Just really, really focus on what the issue is.  And I think that's helped us just to the curiosity to understand first.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:01):**  And I guess that was really driven by Patty.  And I just keep asking these questions like we had like sometimes three, four hour interviews  with farmers, right?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:08):**  They love talking about this issue.  And they were kind of also excited to see like someone from completely outside of the  industries is showing so much interest.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:18):**  Sitting down and really asking questions, which is not I mean, I think many people come  up and come with their drones to help or get fertilizer and try to sell that or come with  their super technical solutions without ever taking the time to do 100 farmer interviews  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:33):**  of three hours and really digging, digging, digging, keep asking why, why, why.  And I mean, it's famously said, I think if you ask why three times, you get to a very  core of the issue.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:43):**  And in this case, you discovered the core of the issue for you is that the ruminant  side is not being, it's part of the problem instead of part of the solution and something  or many things are blocking farmers and ranchers or whatever, people that have ruminants to  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:59):**  almost say use them optimally use, of course, between brackets, but to unleash the power  of the ruminant.  So what did you discover as where the biggest barriers there for farmers to use that power  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:14):**  and to work in the ecosystem instead of fighting against it?  So one thing we found is in talking to a lot of German farmers that the wisdom currently  seems to be that it's the best thing to keep your animals inside.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:31):**  And if you want to have an organic label or what's called a Weidemich, so the milk that  gets produced from animals that are outside, they have pretty small requirements.  So it's like 12 hours a day for 160 days a year.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:49):**  But the wisdom-  The bare minimum.  Exactly.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:52):**  And what we found is also like support beef, cattle, it just for most farmers just seems  to be okay, we have some pasture where we can't really do anything else.  So we just put some cattle there, but it's completely irrelevant to our whole business.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:06):**  So that was kind of devastating for us as well to see.  And what we found is that in the UK, it's very different.  There's just like a different culture around grazing with beef, sheep and dairy cattle.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:20):**  You have longer grazing seasons, it seemed like to us and grazing is more part of the  farming culture as well.  And I think there we-  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:31):**  Could you say state more part?  I mean, I'm imagining 100 years ago was pretty much the same.  And so why did that not maybe change so much in the UK?  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:41):**  Or is that cultural connection to, I don't know, seeing animals in the land or you have  any idea, this is pure speculation.  Like why those two countries went so far apart?  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:51):**  That's interesting.  Because Netherlands and Germany are quite similar, right?  As one example, and there's a big difference.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:00):**  And you also see it like in Germany, you see a big difference between East and West, right?  So where you have much bigger farms in the East where the communists used to be.  I don't know, it could be a cultural thing, right?  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:13):**  So to try to optimize production and to make things more predictable, maybe that's a German  thing to do, I'm not sure.  The engineering mind.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:22):**  Yeah, exactly.  But then you find a very, let's say, open mind or much more interested group of farmers  in the UK.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:31):**  Like was that a sort of desperate move?  Like, okay, we keep knocking on doors in Germany and nobody opens the door.  They keep saying, okay, animals should be in.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:38):**  What are you telling me?  A grazing app?  I don't need a grazing app.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:41):**  I need a barn app.  And then you say, okay, let's try another country.  How did that come about?  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:47):**  Like, why the UK?  I think, I mean, maybe it's a bit opportunistic, but also from the hindsight, strategically,  it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:56):**  So subsidies, for example, they have changed a lot in the UK thanks to Brexit, right?  Like away from, okay, you own a piece of land, you're going to get some money.  You need to now show that you are, like the methods that you're using to treat your land  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:16):**  are actually sustainable before you get any subsidies.  And then there are different tiers for it.  In the UK, it's called the sustainable farming incentive, right?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:22):**  Which is the same kind of incentives that they want to have in the EU now as well, but  it's going to take some time.  But what we saw is, okay, so now these subsidies are gone.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:30):**  The basic payment scheme for farmers in the UK are gone.  So they need to change now, right?  And maybe that was also a catalyst, right?  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:38):**  So that there was more urgency for the farmers in the UK.  And we just, like, we had just much more open doors.  Maybe that's also a cultural thing that farmers were way more willing to talk to us in the  
**[0:13:50-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:50):**  UK.  So we just learned a lot more about UK farming than, you know, like, yeah.  And we just gathered, I guess, also more early adopters in the UK than we ever could have  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:02):**  maybe in Germany.  And so now what is Roomi as we currently speak?  I mean, obviously in the light of a startup, it changes constantly.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:13):**  We're now at the end of the summer in 2022.  And how would you describe Roomi at the moment to anybody that's completely new to the space?  Yeah, so I would say that on the one hand, we help farmers implement sustainable grazing.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:28):**  And on the other hand, we're going to create a proof for them that they have done so and  with which they can get financing to finance this basic transition towards sustainable  farming.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:39):**  Yeah.  So it's really the double piece.  Exactly.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:44):**  Implementing sustainable grazing or holistic grazing or better grazing.  We're going to unpack why that's so important.  But also that's been going on for quite a while, mainly through trainers, through sessions,  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:56):**  through a lot of, but a lot of one to one or one to a few.  And I think we can all agree that needs to go faster.  Like what's the role of technology there to unlock it?  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:05):**  But is it also possible?  And I think you're showing that to do that faster.  And it's not necessary to have somebody like as a coach, like on the ground to follow your  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:14):**  every step as a farmer to go through a process.  How are you unlocking that to go faster than it currently is?  Because it is spreading.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:22):**  People are changing their grazing practices.  It's just way too slow to have the impact we need to have.  So during the interviews, we found that a lot of farmers, they went to, for example,  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:32):**  to Gabe Brown's farm to learn, okay, what is he doing?  And how can I just do it on my farm?  Some even paid to do that by supermarket chains.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:40):**  And then they tried it themselves on their farm and couldn't make it happen.  Even after maybe they tried to get help from a consultant.  Unforeseen things, different soil types, different grass types can really have a massive impact  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:58):**  on your journey.  So we think that this kind of having a good consultant who understands basically the science  behind sustainable farming and how you can actually make it happen and then help you  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:12):**  implement it, that's very important.  So we found that in our first investor who is a grazing consultant in the UK, who basically  helped us also understand what is the actual mechanism behind it.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:27):**  And getting away from a text or let's call it a rule book or a gospel or whatever you  want to call it.  If you only do this, you'll be safe.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:41):**  Yeah.  So this is exactly what you need to do and it's going to work to, okay, so I understand  those are your exact characteristics on your farms.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:49):**  This is what you've been trying and it didn't work.  Which is what we want to do children to do as well.  Like it's not if you want them exactly to, okay, if you do this, this and this and this,  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:57):**  then this answer comes out of your mathematical model.  But if that answer doesn't come, it would be nice if you actually understand them all.  Like what are the mechanisms behind growing grass and growing healthy grass and keep like  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:08):**  optimal.  But without going through 10 years of education and study to understand that because we don't  have the time.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:17):**  Yeah, or trial and error.  So what did he see in that?  Like what did he see in that to join you?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:23):**  Because I could also see quote unquote as a threat because he probably has enough work  for the next 50 years.  Doesn't have to worry about that because these really good consultants are full until 2030  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:34):**  basically.  And yet there was an interest, okay, how can I leverage technology and how can I sort of  augmentate myself or repeat like sort of clone myself as a consultant and work with many  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:46):**  more people without working with way more people.  Yeah, but that's exactly the ambition.  So he felt like, okay, I want to scale myself faster.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:52):**  This has to happen faster, this process, the same urgency around climate change and farmers  in peril.  And he felt like, okay, I can actually scale myself through this application.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:04):**  So we're basically, so his name is James Daniel.  So in the beginning we were just joking, okay, we're going to build James Daniel as an app  essentially.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:12):**  And so at least the stuff that we-  He shows up at a hologram when you're in your land.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:19):**  Maybe not quite that far, but yes, like basically getting all this knowledge in and also just  him teaching us and then recording or giving webinars, recording different content that  we can also then share with farmers basically.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:36):**  And kind of systematically breaking down what works and why it works so that we can understand  it and we can fill it into the app.  And we can also expand it to farmers in a good way.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:52):**  And so how does that work?  And actually let's start with it.  Does it limit you now?  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:57):**  We have a lot of this, I don't know, James, but we have a lot of the gurus in this space  that are quite like, it has to be like that and not like that.  We need to, like, does it limit you working with one person sort of recreating him in  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:10):**  the app between brackets obviously, or are these relatively, let's say general rules  about grazing and like you can start implementing other philosophies about grazing in other  areas or like, how does it limit you?  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:23):**  Or actually it doesn't.  And it's a quite a, let's say he's not the guru that's going to be offended if you change  certain things about him in the app.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:31):**  So I don't think he would consider himself a guru.  I think he, so he has a bachelor in engineering.  So he's like more of a scientist as well, like from the way he approaches things.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:41):**  So that works for us so that we don't have to say, okay, you need to do mob grazing.  Otherwise you can't be part of the program or you need to do holistic grazing.  That's the thing.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:52):**  So we can actually just talk to farmers where they are now, figure out why are you where  you are?  Are you like, what is your willingness to change?  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:01):**  What is your, what is the possibility to change on your farm?  And then figure out how do we get from where you are today to something ideally zero input  farm and how fast can we achieve that?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:12):**  Right.  Because just to be clear, like many, many grazing operations, we, maybe if you're not  running a grazing operation, you don't know, but use an immense amount of inputs for like  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:23):**  to keep the grass, the monoculture grass growing.  Like just to give an idea to us listeners, if you work on a typical farm of one of your  farmers you work with, what would we see and how much input goes into that?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:36):**  Like how many cows are there?  How would we see the current situation before they go into any kind of transition?  I know they're all different, but just a general and try to make it visual because you're between  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:46):**  our ears.  Bring us on a journey.  So like, so the ideal farmer for us is the one who does everything in the worst possible  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:53):**  way, right?  Which I'll describe now.  So he is ideally set stock grazing, meaning he's not rotating animals at all between fields  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:02):**  or maybe only once or twice a year, right?  So for our climate here, that's very little.  Right.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:08):**  And that means there's a lot of compaction happening in the soil, right?  The animals are constantly on it.  More compaction means less water in the soil, right?  
**[0:21:16-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:16):**  It's like a sponge.  You can imagine if you compress a sponge, there's no water that can go in, right?  If the sponge is expanded, it can soak up a lot and it stays like available to the plants.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:28):**  Yeah.  And then you...  So this summer is an issue if you have compacted soil.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:33):**  I think everybody in Europe is suffering from drought and too much rain at the worst moments  and nothing is good.  So it's very...  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:40):**  And the grass, how does it look like?  Do you see a lot of...  Is it like a very nice...  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:46):**  From an outsider, does the grass look okay?  Or is it like with a lot of, let's say, uncovered ground and bare soil in between?  What's the worst situation?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:53):**  Yeah.  Exactly that, what you just described.  Like the grass is no longer green, right?  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:58):**  It's super dry.  Like we've seen actually pictures on a side note from farmers where leaves are falling  from the trees as if it's autumn already just because of this insane dryness.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:07):**  Yeah.  But yeah, exactly.  So if you do set stock grazing, you're basically going to have a lot of bare soil.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:12):**  All the grass is super dry.  You're not growing anything, right?  And your animals are going to try to eat the last stops of the completely dried grass,  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:22):**  right?  And that's even going to ruin your grass for years probably, right?  Or like for a long time, it's not going to recover on its own very easily.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:32):**  And then you're probably going to use a monoculture perennial ryegrass, meaning very relatively  shallow roots.  But if you give it enough nitrogen, it's going to grow quite fast, right?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:45):**  And that's why you use a lot of fertilizer to make this grass grow.  But if you have no water, obviously it's not going to grow anyway.  So that's why it's a problem.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:55):**  And then-  And fertilizer is very...  Nitrogen is very expensive.  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:58):**  Yes, that too.  That's another incentive actually for farmers right now to change, which is great.  Yeah.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:04):**  So we see farmers who use 50 to 100 kilos per hectare in nitrogen fertilizer, which  is a lot.  And then, yeah, so talk basically monoculture, set stock raisings or bad management and no  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:21):**  biodiversity, right?  Single grass.  And that's what we change, right?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:25):**  So we say, okay, based on your soil type.  And some willingness to change.  Yeah, that would be-  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:29):**  Because the farmer needs to at least have an image or an imagination of what could be  possible.  Maybe he's seen other farms, maybe he's been to Cape Brown, maybe he's tested something,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:39):**  but there must be...  I mean, they must pick up the phone and call you otherwise, or pick up the phone and download  the app.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:45):**  Yes.  But there must be some step because otherwise...  So let's say this farmer calls you.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:50):**  What happens then?  Yes.  So we would first try to understand, okay, how big is your farm?  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:57):**  How much grassland do you have?  How many animals do you have?  What is your stocking rate?  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:02):**  What type of grasses do you have?  All the characteristics I just described.  What has been your historic management?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:08):**  What are you planning to do?  How do your finances look like?  Everything needs to be taken into consideration in our viewpoint.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:14):**  A farmer who only has beef or only dairy cattle, he's really going to care a lot about where  the inputs come from, how expensive they are, and how productive they can be.  So he cannot look at those things in isolation.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:29):**  If you have the luxury, let's say, to have enough money to just play around with animals,  and to say, okay, this year I'm going to have 10, maybe next year I'm going to have 30,  depending on how I feel about it.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:41):**  But actually your main operation is somewhere completely different, then it doesn't matter  so much.  But if this is your only way of making income, then you need to look at the animals, the  
**[0:24:52-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:52):**  grass, and the business at the same time.  So I kind of lost my thread here.  And then what happens?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:04):**  So you get this full picture of the financial situation, the farm situation, and then you're  going to say, Google, what happens?  How do we come up with a transition plan?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:19):**  And then of course, the finance piece of it, but we get to the finance.  Okay, you use this amount every year, input is cost is at the moment.  How do we get you off this quote unquote drug as fast as possible?  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:29):**  But of course, it means changing the practices quite a bit.  What would you and but not making it too risky, because then as a farmer, I would say, No,  no, I'm not going to risk this because I've seen others that tried and failed, or maybe  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:40):**  I tried it myself and failed as well.  Like, how do I get over that?  Very, very rightfully so very scary bump of Okay, I'm gonna quite completely throw my  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:49):**  organization or my my my life around.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:53):**  So after we have all this data, we create a transition plan, right where we figure out  what can be done without jeopardizing operations.  How fast can it be done?  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:03):**  How many and then also how many carbon credits would that be?  Right?  And how much revenue could you get from that?  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:10):**  And what could they finance?  Right, so that we can say, this is your business case, you don't see but the owners is doing  a very nice movement of bringing back things.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:18):**  So finance is great, because it brings things backwards, basically, go forward to us now,  like you can get some finance now to put solar panels, exchange practices, and they pay over  a year over time.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:29):**  If you can get that finance, it moves to you, but he makes a very nice movement towards  himself.  Like, how do we bring this back in time that the potential benefits or the benefits that  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:37):**  come over time?  And that's this, that's the click there, you can finance these things.  So that's what you discovered.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:43):**  And that's what you're building through carbon, which mainly come I think, from the fertilizer,  reduce, reduce fertilizer and the soil carbon, I think those two are the ones that that work  together there.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:54):**  Or is it separate?  Or, or how let's say, how difficult is it to make that transition plan?  Is it very relatively standard?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:01):**  Or is it super, super, super specific, like on where people are like, do you need somebody  on site to really build on or have you figured out, okay, if you do these 10 things, if you  take these variables into account, you can get to a pretty, you can get to 80%, let's  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:16):**  say.  Yeah, yeah, that's what you said at the end now, basically, is like, so we did around  maybe 100 of those transition plans now, right.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:22):**  And we've seen a lot of different types of cases, edge cases, but also we can start grouping  farmers into different kind of groups, I guess, cohorts.  So now, like for 90% of the cases, we can be pretty quick at saying, okay, this is what's  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:40):**  possible.  Right.  So for example, let's say you have 100 hectares, right.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:45):**  And then the question is, okay, how do I get from monoculture ryegrass to completely perfect,  diverse, you know, grass swath with nitrogen, and everything in there, right.  So I don't need fertilizer anymore.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:59):**  Right.  So you can't just, if you want to have an operations, you can't do the whole thing at  once.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:04):**  It's not possible.  Right.  So you need to think about, okay, do I do 5%, 10%, or 15% of my grazing platform per  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:12):**  year?  What is, what can I actually sustain?  And that's what we can essentially just calculate, right, based on productivity and how the grass  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:21):**  has been managed before, right.  So if it was set stock grazing before and use this much fertilizer, then we can say,  okay, there's actually, you have whatever 30% room in improving your management practices  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:32):**  and grass utilization.  That means we can actually produce this much more food from forage, and that's available  to your animals.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:42):**  And that means we can reduce, for example, the total platform by 30% during a year without  risking any reduction in productivity.  Does these crazy droughts, like, model into that?  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:57):**  Like, do you take into consideration the crazy climate we currently live in?  Or how does that work?  Or everybody suffers, obviously.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:05):**  But maybe if you're in transition, you suffer more or less?  Like how have you seen that this year in 2022?  Yeah, so you might suffer more actually, which is really bad.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:15):**  And that's one of the reasons why some farmers give up.  Which is why, so what we want farmers to do is we want them to follow the plan as closely  as they can.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:26):**  But obviously, we want to have a conversation with them as well.  Okay, if you didn't follow the plan, what happened?  And we will be lenient when it's things like this drought, right.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:36):**  But we can see actually the farmer did reseed, as we said, he did reduce fertilizer.  He just couldn't do the rotations as planned because it was just too dry.  He had to graze not, he couldn't leave, let's say 15 centimeters of grass, he had to graze  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:52):**  down to five.  It just wasn't possible otherwise, as one example, right.  So and then at the end of the year, they will always get the payments for the carbon credits.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:03):**  And you say we can see, we get to the payments, everybody who's listening on the finance piece,  we get that.  But like, when does the, we say we can see, does it mean, is this the piece where the  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:11):**  satellite comes in?  How does that help you, because we haven't really covered it until now.  Like what is possible now with satellite and grass?  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:20):**  Like what, I don't think you can count the different grasses.  But I mean, I know you can count trees from space, but you can't really see what happens  underneath.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:26):**  Like how, why is this possible now?  And describe for people, I'll put a remote sensing episode we did with Is and Tom as  well in the show notes.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:37):**  But why is this possible now that it wasn't possible, let's say five or 10 years ago?  Yeah, so we're using two different types of satellite imagery.  One is multispectral, which is really good at detecting biomass above ground.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:54):**  And the variation of-  Which is great for you to figure out, yeah, grass, I can see, okay, is something changing?  And it gives you also some indication of moisture.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:05):**  So like, you can figure from it, you can figure out what is the dry part of the biomass, right?  Which is essentially what you need as a farmer to know, okay, how much can I feed my animals  every day?  
**[0:31:16-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:16):**  They typically know, okay, I need 2% of my animals body weight in dry matter every day.  So from that we get the variation, but the resolution is only 10 by 10 meters.  So that sounds a bit crazy, but on a massive grassland, it doesn't really matter so much.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:33):**  And we can do some machine learning trickery to increase the resolution a little bit.  We call super resolution for those who are interested.  And then we combine that with radar satellite imagery.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:48):**  So the problem with the multispectral data is that it's an optical sensor.  Whenever you have clouds or anything in between, it's going to be, it can't go see anything.  It never happens in the UK.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:58):**  No, there's almost no clouds in the UK.  So that's why we need the radar imagery, which can penetrate clouds.  And it's more accurate for seeing height differences.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:11):**  You still can't get to a centimeter resolution, but you can, for example, see, okay, I went  down from half a meter to 15.  Those drops you can see.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:20):**  You wouldn't be able to see the variation of the biomass.  I went down, meaning it's been grazed.  Literally that.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:28):**  Wow.  Yeah.  So we can see, has this field been grazed or not?  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:33):**  And the radar can work every day.  That's one that doesn't care about clouds, doesn't care about anything.  You have other types of interferences and it's not super easy data to work with.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:45):**  But if you combine it together with this multispectral imagery, and because we have a lot of measurement  data from farmers about grass heights historically and current as well, that we can basically,  we built this model just for this purpose, right?  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:01):**  To figure out how much grass you currently have.  And now we can do things like, we have an internal grass growth model based on temperature  and what we see on multispectral and so on.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:13):**  So cool.  Right?  And then if we-  
**[0:33:16-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:16):**  Internal grass growth model.  Yeah, we have an internal grass.  Of course, model.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:19):**  What do you model?  I model grass.  That's what we do.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:22):**  It's really important.  But it's the foundation of a big chunk of our life.  It's very interesting that we don't discuss that more often, or tree growth models.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:34):**  It's very interesting.  How do you turn sunlight into something quote unquote useful is everything we do.  That's the whole point.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:42):**  And yet we're laughing when you say a grass growth model because we don't discuss it very  often.  So it's something we should do way more.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:48):**  Yeah, I agree.  And what happens above ground gives you a good indication of what happens below.  So for example, with this growth model, we can say, okay, your grass should grow this  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:59):**  much every day currently.  But then suddenly we see that your grass grows way faster.  So that means we can actually say, you put fertilizer on there.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:08):**  And we know pretty much how much nitrogen it was as well.  So then we can say, okay, that impacted your soil negatively as well.  And it obviously created emissions from fertilizer itself, from the fuel you use in your tractor  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:20):**  to spray the fertilizer and so on.  So that's where the grazing management or the farm management data goes into a carbon  credit verification.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:33):**  Our view is if you want to do very high quality verification, you need to know about what  the farmer is doing at any point in time.  Because if you want to do it in a way that's scalable.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:46):**  We talked earlier about all the different emissions that go into these carbon credits.  So one is solar organic carbon, it's like 80, 90%.  But then it's the methane emissions from enteric fermentation, it's from the fertilizer, the  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:00):**  emissions from the manure, how you store it and for how long.  If you have an open slurry pit, these gases that go into the air, if you go to a village,  you know.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:11):**  But when it smells like that, that can't be healthy.  And it really isn't.  Whenever an animal-  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:15):**  So you take all of that into account and look at the net improvement.  Exactly.  You take into consideration, okay, we know that this farmer sprayed NPK X amount of time  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:26):**  with this amount.  So we know more or less what that is.  We know the diesel, we know how he or she stored the manure, if he or she had that,  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:34):**  we know the soil organic carbon part.  And then we do the calculation and we come out hopefully with a plus.  And that's able to, that we're able to sell that and finance with that.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:45):**  And then I make the movement again.  We finance the transition with that, which I think is very interesting because normally  we, but let's unpack that a bit.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:53):**  So and how, because many people say, I mean, we come back to the, it's the cow, not the  cow.  Like what do you see in those numbers from a very bad case, like the worst case you could  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:03):**  see, but still a farmer willing to change.  Like how meaningful are these, is the carbon potential there?  Like, do you see, are they significant enough to, to, of course, otherwise it wouldn't be  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:13):**  working with you, but are these significant enough to, but maybe the only work for the  savings of the fertilizer, which is also okay.  But are these significant enough to make people move?  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:22):**  Like what do you see there in terms of potential, let's say on that a hundred acre farm or an  average one you work with?  From a business perspective or from a carbon perspective?  
**[0:36:31-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:31):**  Yeah.  Just if, if now, if somebody has been using the worst practices and going through this  transition with you, like how much are we saving?  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:39):**  How much are we storing?  How much on average, more or less are you able to verify because you're able to check  if somebody put the carbon or the NPK there because you have the set.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:49):**  So like, let's say we're talking a dairy farmer in Europe, they might have something like  eight tons of CO2 equivalent in emissions per hectare per year.  Right.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:00):**  During the transition period, the kind of the, the increase in solid kind of carbon  is going to ramp up as you have more and more species on, on more and more of your grazing  platform, right.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:12):**  And you're going to be able to reduce your fertilizer emissions more and more as well  also gradually.  Right.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:17):**  So at the end of five.  So it's a double one.  Exactly.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:20):**  It stores and you reduce, which is great.  Yeah.  So at the five year point until 10 years after we started, that's where you're going to have  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:27):**  the biggest drawdown, right.  And the biggest reduction kind of, and so there we can be around zero, right.  So we're going from eight to zero based on what's possible with increasing solar organic  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:42):**  carbon and reduction fertilizer.  Then afterwards, it kind of depends on where your initial solar organic carbon was and  where you're basically going to find your equilibrium.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:54):**  And because like over time, you're going to reduce the amount of increase per hectare  per year.  Right.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:01):**  So, but even afterwards, you can find farms that can be carbon neutral for a decade or  two.  Right.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:08):**  And then maybe they will end up, if you take enteric fermentation into consideration at  around maybe two, three tons of CO2 equivalent per hectare per year.  Right.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:16):**  If you keep the stocking rate the same.  So animals per hectare, that's the assumption right now.  Right.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:22):**  If you were to reduce your animals, of course, then, you know, that's a completely different  story, which we think is.  Yeah.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:28):**  Or I mean, and the methane equivalent or the, that's a very big discussion if we should  include that or not and how methane works.  But if you look only at carbon, you're going to be carbon negative if you take the methane  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:42):**  out of the equation.  Yeah.  So if you take carbon, right, then we only take the fuel and the, yeah.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:49):**  And the increase in solar organic carbon into account.  Right.  So the fertilizers typically, you know, nitrous oxide and other stuff.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:56):**  Yeah.  And so when you sell these credits, is it mostly sell reduction ones because you reduce  so much the input side or you sell, is there a combination of, and does it make that complicated?  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:08):**  Yeah.  So it's a combination of removal and avoidance.  Right.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:12):**  Which does make it sometimes complicated for some buyers, but we're trying to also like  help shape that conversation because in our view, right, so the nature-based solutions,  what you call it in the carbon market, right, is the only thing that's available right now,  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:32):**  which we can scale, right?  There's a lot of technology that's still in the kind of its infancy and we need to scale  it up to get to something meaningful.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:41):**  But today we can make these changes right away.  Right.  And discussing, okay, should we have fewer animals or not?  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:47):**  It should be different, right?  Like there is, like if, let's say we were to reduce our livestock today, right?  That means like on some project area, let's say in the UK, we reduce all livestock by  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:00):**  50%, then okay, what's going to happen?  It's not like people will eat less meat all of a sudden.  It means someone else or some other country will actually pick that up and we'll just  
**[0:40:09-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:09):**  increase the number of animals.  So you have this kind of leakage problem, which means you actually probably want to  kind of maintain the livestock numbers.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:19):**  In some areas, it should probably be reduced, right?  So if your own land cannot maintain the number of animals that you have, you should probably  not have that many animals, but we need to figure out where do we displace it then?  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:29):**  The carrying capacity.  Yeah, exactly.  Where, how do we account for this kind of leakage problem and how do we make up for  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:36):**  the loss in proteins as well, right?  And how have you seen that from some of these farmers?  Because we've heard stories, people are like increasing the stocking rate and the carrying  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:45):**  capacity dramatically by changing their management while reducing or going to zero with input,  which is a very interesting, which suggests that you're taking more sunlight and transforming  it to something very, very useful, which is nutrient dense protein, et cetera.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:59):**  Like, have you seen that as well in the UK or is it mostly like say American stories  and other stories where we actually, what we could do on this piece of land is much  more than we could imagine until we tried and then we saw actually we could produce  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:10):**  way more grass and thus support way more animals than we thought before.  Yeah.  So we do also have this kind of understocked and overgrazed farms.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:19):**  Absolutely.  Like we see that a lot.  Which is just to get it in your head, like everyone is like understocked and overgrazed  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:28):**  is a crazy phenomenon.  I think the first time I heard somebody probably listening, Jan Giesbert said it, like most  farms are understocked and overgrazed.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:36):**  It sounds crazy.  But I think Gabe Brown has said it and some of the savory people obviously as well.  So which suggested we're damaging our farm and getting way less animal protein of it  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:47):**  than we could.  Plus having a lot of input and all the other externalities that we don't have.  So which is sort of the wicked, like why?  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:55):**  So they exist.  Many of them are understocked and overgrazed.  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:58):**  And so Mariko said that in a previous episode as well, right?  So like reducing inputs, that's the main thing.  I think she was saying it shouldn't just be CO2, but I think that's a different topic.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:11):**  So the chemical side as well.  I mean, that's a whole different one.  The chemical input side, but the whole input industry, we were completely addicted to the  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:21):**  trucks coming on our farm, dropping a lot of different things that sort of, and then  we're still understocked and overgrazed.  And so on the carbon piece, on this credit piece, you've been selling the first ones.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:32):**  How has it been going?  Like how difficult, quote unquote, is it to you to have this story?  It's not the cow, it's the how.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:39):**  Because I'm imagining many of these companies are buying from you, are in big cities, very  far removed from the farms itself, just like you were.  But maybe even further because they didn't grow up on a farm.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:49):**  Like how difficult is it to sell, quote unquote, the story of you actually should invest in  room and in transition if you want to have a meaningful dent in the next couple of years?  So one thing that's difficult is to explain how important the increase in solar and carbon  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:04):**  is because it's not something you can just see directly like a tree.  So that's kind of a difficulty for us.  What is easier for us is that actually the project sites where these companies can invest  
**[0:43:18-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:18):**  in essentially with their offsets, they are typically way closer to the headquarter than  a project that's maybe halfway around the world.  So that's actually a big plus.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:33):**  So imagine if you're a company and you want to attract new employees and you want to tell  the story that you are, or make it part of your brand that you care about sustainability.  But then you also want to tell them, you want to be able to show that what you're doing  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:50):**  is meaningful and that it's actually happening.  And what we are able to do because we talk or we are so close to farmers is we can actually  tell much or help do much better storytelling.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:03):**  And it's much more relatable to say, hey, I'm actually supporting this farmer that's  10 kilometers away from where I work rather than maybe there's going to be some trees  in Bolivia.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:15):**  No, it's very close.  And then so what is the, not the trick, but what's the mechanism here?  You calculate with the farmer, what is possible in five and 10 years.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:31):**  And then it's not that you promise him or her, okay, in 10 years, we're going to pay  you.  So no, let's bring that forward now.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:37):**  So you can actually make these transitions.  Like how difficult is that?  Because that means you sort of pre-financing these carbon gains that are carbon, like avoided  
**[0:44:45-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:45):**  emissions and stored emissions that didn't really happen.  Yeah, exactly.  So that we basically also pre-sell these credits.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:52):**  So that means even though we only verify the emission reductions after they have happened,  so we can still convince buyers of these carbon credits that we will make them happen.  And so that seems to work quite well because we can show that from our track rate of selling  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:11):**  credits.  We're selling them at twice the price of our closest competitor in the kind of livestock  space.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:18):**  And we haven't been having trouble, let's say, finding buyers, which is really great  because it means that there's people willing to invest into farmers to change their practices  voluntarily, which I think is fantastic.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:34):**  It just shows that maybe the kind of zeitgeist is changing that we want to get closer to  where the food comes from.  We actually want to support one another.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:49):**  And I think that's fantastic.  And the companies you sell to, are they typically in the food space?  Are they in media?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:56):**  Like what are, because you said you want to get closer.  Is that literally like they are in the food space?  They're interested because of that?  
**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:03):**  Or they are generally, let's say, very conscious companies that want to voluntarily obviously  offset or inset and actually offset if they're not in the food space.  Like what do you see as a typical, like why do they come to you?  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:15):**  Yeah.  So it's kind of geographical closeness.  That's what we see at least for carbon credits.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:22):**  And here we speak of the offset.  So location, location, location.  And it's story, story, story.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:28):**  You need to be able to tell a good story.  It's part of the marketing strategy.  It's oftentimes, of course they care what one thinks, but at the same time it's part  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:39):**  of the marketing and PR.  But that's on the offsetting side.  So like where anyone technically could buy these offsets anywhere on the planet, any  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:49):**  kind of company, any industry.  Even though we want to make sure that it's only companies who also can show either already  a track record or have some believable strategy for reducing their own emissions.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:02):**  But then you also have to the second kind of distribution channel, if you will, which  is within the food supply chain.  And there you typically speak of insetting, because it stays within the supply chain.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:13):**  These carbon credits stay in the supply chain.  And there we see equally good traction.  We are using the same type of pricing as for the voluntary carbon market.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:26):**  And companies want to reduce their own emissions.  Typically they have goals for, okay, I want to reduce my emissions by 50% by 2030.  And oftentimes a lot of these emissions come from how the raw materials are produced or  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:40):**  the inputs are produced.  And that then comes down to the farmers.  That means we need to reduce emissions for the farmers, but they don't know how.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:48):**  So that means they actually pay us to onboard farmers and help them go through the transition  plan.  And here again, it works with the financing.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:58):**  They will be interested in buying these raw materials in this case, animal protein, which  is much more traceable.  Of course, you have all the traceability and has a really, really good story coming back  
**[0:48:09-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:09):**  to the story.  And they can inset part of their emissions they get down the line.  And I would even say, so today you actually see a lot of dairy or beef companies in the  
**[0:48:20-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:20):**  supply chain who want to, and maybe already are paying for sustainable products, but they  don't actually know whether anything is happening with that money that they're paying, this  premium that they're paying.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:32):**  Maybe they paid one of these farmers to go to Gate Brown's farm and they never had nothing  to pay these trainings, which are great, but then if they don't follow up with a concrete  transition plan and all the work after and the verification, it's very, I mean, we all  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:46):**  know that we go to amazing courses, et cetera.  And then on Monday morning you show up again at work or in your farm and then yeah, to  implement it is very, very, you sort of give them a tool to follow through for at least  
**[0:48:57-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:57):**  a group that wants to and wants to potentially get premiums as well.  Because I think not only reducing drastically your input, of course, get paid for the transition,  which is great, but also if the supermarket chain or whoever can say, okay, but if you  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:09):**  reach this level, we have a certain premium ready for you, which drives the market.  Exactly.  And you see that happening already, like that those forces are starting to pull and push  
**[0:49:20-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:20):**  them.  Absolutely.  What we also see is that some companies, they try to also implement it by having pilot  
**[0:49:26-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:26):**  programs, right?  So with maybe a handful, sometimes 30 farmers, right?  But they're really asking themselves, how are we going to do this for thousands?  
**[0:49:36-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:36):**  Because if you want to reduce the overall emissions by 50%, it's not enough.  If you do it with 30 farmers, you need to do it with all of them.  So what would you say now in this space of a carbon hype and a lot of attention, droughts,  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:52):**  et cetera, what would you say?  I always ask this question in this, let's imagine we're in a theater, let's imagine  we do this in person soon and we have a lot of smart investors in the room, investing  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:02):**  their own money, investing other people's money, et cetera.  What would you, obviously without giving investment advice, but what would you tell them to do  once they leave?  
**[0:50:09-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:09):**  Like, okay, what would be the first step?  Is that doing long interviews with farmers, like you said, like going deep into the space  or what are spaces or places that you say, okay, they really deserve more attention and  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:20):**  more interest, more resources, more energy and potentially more money as well.  I think if you look at the carbon market, there's a lot of investments basically going  to downstream innovations like marketplaces, brokers, rating agencies, whatever, but there's  
**[0:50:36-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:36):**  very little on the supply side, right?  On the actual supply, like you're actually creating the credits that need to be then  sold, rated, whatever.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:46):**  So I think investing and figuring out how to best invest into a credible supply, that's  very important.  And I think looking at kind of hands-off approaches is very difficult or I don't see that can  
**[0:51:04-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:04):**  be successful based on how we talk to farmers.  Like saying, for example, you only provide financing and you don't even talk to the farmer  necessarily.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:12):**  You're basically a bank where you're saying, okay, I'm going to help you get money because  some people want to pay money for regenerative grazing, but then you just need to do some  credibility check as bank, so to speak, but you don't actually then figure out, okay,  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:26):**  what is the farmer going to do?  Because the risk is going to stay with the farmer.  He has to figure out how am I actually going to do that?  
**[0:51:32-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:32):**  How am I going to generate, let's say, these many credits or how am I going to actually  make these emission reductions happen or how am I going to run a business with these different  practices?  
**[0:51:41-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:41):**  How am I actually going to transition?  So I think that that's why these hands-off approaches in my opinion are very difficult.  So I would look for companies maybe who can show that they can either attract a large  
**[0:51:54-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:54):**  enough segment of a very particular type of farmer or who can show that they have been  able to speak to or attract a lot of different types of farmers.  So where you can just say, okay, they understand farming.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:10):**  Farmers want to work with them and they actually understand how to generate the supply.  That's what I would say.  And so what would you do if you would be in charge of a billion dollars, a billion euros,  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:22):**  let's keep it, or a billion pounds sterling as you're in the UK?  What would you do if you had to invest that?  You have to put it to work with a very long lifetime if you want to or very short, maybe  
**[0:52:33-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:33):**  say most impact can be made now.  Would you just buy all these credits?  Would you set up a lot of roomies around the world or would you shoot some more satellites  
**[0:52:42-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:42):**  into space because you need better than 10 meter accuracy or would you just spend it  all on invested or in machine learning?  What would you, or maybe consumer awareness around these things?  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:52):**  What would you do if you had to put that to work?  I think more satellites would definitely be good and making it available and making it  cheap and also easy to use.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:00):**  Are they getting there?  Is this 10 meter something like if we would discuss this in a year, it would be to eight  or five.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:06):**  Is this a continuing progress?  Is getting better over time or is the machine learning and the software getting better to  identify 10 meters and let's say upscale it to, is it a continuous improvement like Moore's  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:21):**  law or what is happening on both sides, just like with computers and software, the software  is getting better and the hardware is getting better.  It's the same thing for satellites.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:30):**  You have more and more satellites being shot in orbit and the prices are getting cheaper  and cheaper.  We're using free satellite imagery from the Ukraine Space Agency, which have this relatively  
**[0:53:45-0:53:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:45):**  coarse resolution, but also the technology is moving on, not in months, but more like  decades, but it's happening.  At the same time, image processing algorithms and so on are getting better and compute powers.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:02):**  You would maybe spend it, you might maybe put it a bit into the satellite space, but  what else would you do?  We have to accept for roomy, right?  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:13):**  You can put like 50 room into room, but I'm curious about the rest.  But it shouldn't stay in the food space because I was thinking-  It could be anything.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:24):**  Not really.  I'm asking this question because I'm curious how people working in the space would prioritize  if they had unlimited resources.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:34):**  I think even though we haven't solved the climate crisis and solved food production  or anything like this, it feels to me at least, okay, we can actually solve this within the  next 10 years, 15 years, 20 years.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:44):**  I don't know.  It's at least, it feels like it's on the horizon and we know how to do it.  We just need to execute in quotation marks.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:53):**  I feel like there's some questions that we haven't solved yet.  One is there's going to be a lot of migration that has to happen because of climate change.  I don't know how we're going to solve that.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:06):**  We've seen what happened in, whatever, 10 years ago when there was migration happening  after the Syrian war.  I can't remember.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:16):**  But refugees coming to Europe, that was a big crisis and it's just going to be 100 times  bigger within the next 20 years.  How are we going to solve that?  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:28):**  That's a big question for me.  Another one is how are we going to solve the issue around basically the consequences of  an aging society?  
**[0:55:44-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:44):**  I think that that's going to really put us in front of a lot of problems, how we actually  finance that, how we make sure that older people don't live in poverty.  With age, you have a higher risk for health issues, mental ones like dementia, whatever.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:08):**  That's just going to require a rethink in how we set up society.  Right now, you have typically young people living in cities working on tech and then  old people moving out.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:16):**  I was going to say, this gets into a whole different topic, which we should get into  one of these ones.  That's why I was like rural urban divide and how we shape.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:26):**  And generational divide.  I think what's interesting here and generational divide and of course with migrants as well,  how do we shape the countryside or actually the country we want to?  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:40):**  I think there's a very interesting connection with the way we farm and the way we manage  the land.  Let's bring it broader.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:48):**  The reason I'm recording these interviews is because I think regenerative practices  and regenerative food is a very nice entry point to ask all of those questions as well  because you're forced to after a while to ask questions about land ownership, to ask  
**[0:56:59-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:59):**  questions about why some people were very lucky in life and got 100 hectares and many  others most people didn't and were born somewhere else.  Many people got access to water or didn't.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:11):**  Many people got access to education or didn't.  Many people got access to a lot of money or didn't.  And there are big questions around health and big questions around intergenerational  
**[0:57:20-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:20):**  living.  There are big questions around living in general, what we want houses to be or transport.  We come back to the flying, no, sorry, the self driving houses.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:29):**  I think it forces us to ask all of those questions.  Do we want to be dependent on massive input companies that get stuff somewhere that we  don't even know or do we want to be, like how do we shape that?  
**[0:57:39-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:39):**  And it forces us to ask those questions.  It's very valid, but as we're almost approaching the hour, I would just say, let's keep that  for another one.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:47):**  But as we sit down, I think this is a good one to do in person, honestly.  It's better than do through video as we do now.  So if you had a magic wand, I think it's a good final question in this case because it  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:59):**  nicely connects to what you would invest in as well.  What would you change if you had one thing you could change overnight?  What would you use that for?  
**[0:58:08-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:08):**  And it's a very powerful tool, obviously, but what would you do?  I think having the perfect food labels is what I would change.  As a consumer, you can actually make informed choices about what you're buying.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:21):**  That would be fantastic.  Like today, you have a jungle of different labels and I haven't at least seen one yet  where you can actually just look at it and say, that's great.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:31):**  I can make a decision based on that and on that alone.  Because I think it's a very complex issue and we tend to oversimplify.  And that's why companies who produce food can take advantage of that.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:47):**  So as one example, you don't know whether a monoculture oat field that you use to produce  a milk alternative is actually better for the climate than cow milk that you can buy.  You can't make that choice right now as a consumer.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:05):**  Or if you eat avocados or lime from Mexico, are you aware that you're probably supporting  drug cartels?  And I think that's a terrible state to be in as a consumer.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:14):**  Even if you try to make a good choice, but even if you try it, you cannot make the right  choice.  And I think that's terrible.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:21):**  So having the perfect food label, I think would be a very busy one.  It also has to be simple and understandable.  And it would be very interesting to that level of transparency.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:35):**  Do you think people would care?  Enough people would care.  Now let me rephrase the question.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:40):**  To leave this peanut butter and take another one or to take this avocado and like to make  that choice in a supermarket or in a place where they buy?  I think so, yes.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:50):**  Where we buy, honestly, do we care?  I think so.  If you look at like whatever organic produce, for example, right, then you see, okay, people  
**[0:59:58-0:59:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:58):**  are buying that.  You see people choosing to be vegetarian or vegan because of climate.  So I think there's the willingness to change.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:06):**  And I think there's a big group of people who are saying, I can't make a reasonable  choice so I'll just buy whatever.  I'll just buy the cheapest.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:13):**  So then I think there's a majority of people who would make a choice based on that label  and actually change the way we produce food because a farmer is going to produce what  he can sell.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:24):**  So I think it has to start at the consumer level, which is obviously then the perception  is shaped by marketing from companies.  But those things maybe need to work in unison.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:36):**  I think that food producing companies have understood that sustainability has to be part  of their brand now.  There's just no way around it.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:43):**  That's what we're seeing from the corporates who want to be our customers for the in-setting  model.  So it means, okay, we just need to also reach the consumers.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:53):**  And then we have to change complete because a farmer will not produce something that he  cannot sell.  I think it's a good moment to end.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:04):**  I want to thank you so much for your time to explain what a satellite grazing app is  and how does it work in setting versus offsetting?  How grazing can be a huge part of the solution, which we all know, but then how do we practically  
**[1:01:18-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:18):**  get there, which is a very different question.  And I want to definitely keep, I will send an invite at some point to do the philosophical  urban versus rural and migrant generational divide and I will take you up on that at some  
**[1:01:35-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:35):**  point.  But thank you so much for now and good luck with building.  Thank you very much for having me.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:48):**  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end.  For the show notes and links discussed, check out our website, investinginregionaryagriculture.com  forward slash posts.

**[1:02:14-1:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:14):**  Thanks again and see you next time.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:02:35-1:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:35):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:02:45-1:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:45):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:02:57-1:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:57):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[1:03:04-1:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:04):**  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  
**[1:03:08-1:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:08):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[1:03:13-1:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:13):**  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[1:03:22-1:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:22):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:35):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:47):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:51):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:04:06-1:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:06):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[1:04:11-1:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:11):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:04:24-1:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:24):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:36):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:50):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:04:55-1:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:55):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:05:06):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.  Click on the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 06 Sep 2022 17:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:13):**  We know grazing aruminants can dramatically improve grasslands, which are the majority  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:18):**  of our agriculture lands, and store massive amounts of carbon.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:22):**  There are great examples around the world from Cape Brown in the US to Kenya with Savory,  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:26):**  Australia, UK, etc.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:28):**  But how do we get thousands of farmers to change their grazing practices in the next  
**[0:00:33-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:33):**  couple of years?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:34):**  One-on-one training is just not going to scale fast enough, and even after training, most  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:38):**  farmers rightfully so won't risk these massive changes on their farm because they carry all  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:44):**  the risks.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:45):**  So how do we change this paradigm and how do we use the exploding soil carbon markets  
**[0:00:50-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:50):**  and satellite tech to make this happen?  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:00:57):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:02):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:06):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities,  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:11):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:16):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:18):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:22):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:27):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:01:31):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:03):**  Welcome to another episode today with Johannes Scheiber, the founder of Rumi, the satellite  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:07):**  grazing app.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:08):**  Financing land regeneration, Rumi works with farmers and companies to create the conditions  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:13):**  for a better future.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:14):**  Welcome Johannes.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:15):**  Hi, nice to be on.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:17):**  And yeah, so nice to have you.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:20):**  The satellite grazing app already does two words together, satellite and grazing.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:23):**  We're going to unpack that for sure.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:25):**  But I would love to first unpack a bit your background story.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:30):**  How did you end up founding this company, first of all, working on this issue?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:34):**  And when did you get hooked on soil?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:37):**  That's always my first question.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:38):**  How did you get into this crazy rabbit hole that soil carbon can be and soil in general  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:44):**  can be?  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:45):**  Yeah, so we are three co-founders at Rumi.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:48):**  And we met while working at Daimler on self-driving taxis.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:54):**  And very different sector.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:02:58):**  And yeah, we had an office in Berlin.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:01):**  And in late 2019, there were these massive protests from farmers in Berlin protesting  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:07):**  against the new legislations that are coming, which is, I guess, similar to what's happening  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:11):**  in the Netherlands right now.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:13):**  So you've probably heard a lot about that also in the media recently.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:18):**  And so the three of us, turns out, we have some background in farming.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:22):**  I grew up in a really small village where sheep, when I grew up, Patty, second co-founder,  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:29):**  they have beef cattle in their family.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:32):**  Daniel also small village where he grew up, farmers all around and in the family.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:38):**  And to us, this really made a big impact.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:40):**  And we just felt like we perhaps have been a little bit too far removed from where we  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:45):**  came from during our professional life.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:47):**  So we just lived in big cities, only working there, working on problems for cities or solutions  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:56):**  for problems that exist only in cities.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:03:58):**  And then we have farmers who produce our food, who take care of the majority of our ecosystem.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:05):**  And they are really having big problems and are in trouble.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:09):**  And they don't really need self-driving taxis.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:11):**  No, exactly.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:12):**  That's also something we thought, what are actually the applications for what we're building  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:16):**  here?  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:17):**  And is it really going to make this massive impact to justify us devoting our lives to  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:22):**  it?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:23):**  And we decided that not, we need to do something different.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:27):**  But all three together as well.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:29):**  Like, was that an interest?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:30):**  Like, was that a sort of, I wouldn't say aha moment, but because it could be like one of  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:34):**  you said, okay, I'm not no longer going to work on self-driving taxis.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:38):**  I'm going to leave and go on a journey to figure out farming.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:41):**  But actually you decided as a group to do it.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:43):**  Yeah, so we were first, it was Danny and I and actually two others who thought, hey,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:48):**  let's try this together.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:50):**  Then two people left and it was just Danny and I, but Patti joined instead.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:04:55):**  But we all knew each other and been working on this, or like discussing this topic.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:02):**  And we were just trying to figure out also by talking to farmers what the problems are.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:06):**  And why are all farmers so dependent on these agricultural inputs?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:12):**  Like yeah.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:13):**  How did you land on that?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:14):**  Like how did you, because going from, okay, we need to do something about the issues farmers  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:21):**  and challenges farmers have going to do something actually like physically, like it's a big step.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:26):**  Like you went on a learning journey.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:28):**  You remember when that hit you, that the input side is both the challenge and the opportunity?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:34):**  I think it was just talking to a lot of farmers.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:37):**  So we actually first we thought we're going to do something with organic wine producers  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:42):**  and using drones to help them apply fertilizer, like organic fertilizer.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:47):**  But then we thought, okay, the market is too small, drones are too difficult kind of thing.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:49):**  And then just talking to farmers and the family, also to Benedict who's been on your show a  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:56):**  couple of times.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:05:59):**  And we just basically learned, yeah, just by talking to all kinds of farmers and understanding  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:03):**  how they see the world, but also just looking at statistics.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:08):**  And that kind of made us understand that that's a problem and maybe where the problem comes  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:12):**  from.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:13):**  If a farmer is dependent on these inputs, at the same time, the government is saying,  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:17):**  you need to stop using those inputs, then you have a massive conflict.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:22):**  But we also saw that there are some farmers who do things differently.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:26):**  And first we thought, okay, we're going to help all kinds of farmers to move away from  
**[0:06:32-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:32):**  these inputs and to help them detect basically when their crops are in bad health, when they  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:39):**  need water and all of these things.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:41):**  And then we learned, okay, you can't actually irrigate arable land in Germany, most areas,  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:45):**  there's just no water close enough.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:47):**  So just learning, getting into a completely new industry and knowing nothing.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:53):**  And then I guess at some point it made click that the ruminants, so that's why we also  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:06:59):**  call it Rumi, that they actually need to be at the heart of the solution.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:03):**  They're not the problem.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:06):**  It's been said many times before this, it's not the cow, it's the how.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:11):**  And we need to...  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:12):**  It's even a documentary and a book actually.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:15):**  Definitely recommend it if you want to learn more about that.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:18):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:19):**  I'll look into that.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:20):**  But did you, like when did that click?  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:23):**  Because it's very easy, I think, just generalizing, like you're in a big city in Berlin, relatively  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:29):**  far away from farmers, and you're going to visit them, etc.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:31):**  But it's potentially easy to go for a fast, easy solution, might be a bit naive, and to  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:39):**  start a vegan brand or to go for, okay, we have to cut out the animals because the animals  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:43):**  are the issue.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:45):**  But to go beyond that and go to, I mean, of course, if you visit Benedict, you will get  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:49):**  a one on one on what's the role of animals.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:51):**  But that's still you need to be able to, you need to be open to absorbing that and then  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:07:57):**  working on that instead of saying, no, no, no, we have to cut out all animals.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:00):**  Did you go into it with a certain idea of it's better to get rid of the animal piece?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:06):**  Or did you go into it?  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:07):**  Or do we have to find a way to make them part of the solution instead of part of the problem?  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:11):**  I think so one thing is that so I'm not a vegetarian or anything.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:15):**  Daniel actually is our third co-founder.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:18):**  But I always felt like because I grew up in a village, animals are part of what you do,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:22):**  and you can actually keep animals in a sustainable way.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:25):**  That was just my conviction that it must be possible.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:29):**  And I think as so Patty, he is a designer, and he just does a lot of user interviews,  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:36):**  he's probably done like a million or so throughout his whole career.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:39):**  And just to keep digging and keep digging and keep asking questions.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:43):**  That's really what he's really good at.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:45):**  And I don't know, we probably had 100 farmer interviews within two months or so.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:51):**  That was in early 2021.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:54):**  Just really, really focus on what the issue is.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:08:58):**  And I think that's helped us just to the curiosity to understand first.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:01):**  And I guess that was really driven by Patty.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:04):**  And I just keep asking these questions like we had like sometimes three, four hour interviews  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:07):**  with farmers, right?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:08):**  They love talking about this issue.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:11):**  And they were kind of also excited to see like someone from completely outside of the  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:15):**  industries is showing so much interest.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:18):**  Sitting down and really asking questions, which is not I mean, I think many people come  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:22):**  up and come with their drones to help or get fertilizer and try to sell that or come with  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:28):**  their super technical solutions without ever taking the time to do 100 farmer interviews  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:33):**  of three hours and really digging, digging, digging, keep asking why, why, why.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:37):**  And I mean, it's famously said, I think if you ask why three times, you get to a very  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:41):**  core of the issue.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:43):**  And in this case, you discovered the core of the issue for you is that the ruminant  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:47):**  side is not being, it's part of the problem instead of part of the solution and something  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:53):**  or many things are blocking farmers and ranchers or whatever, people that have ruminants to  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:09:59):**  almost say use them optimally use, of course, between brackets, but to unleash the power  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:06):**  of the ruminant.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:07):**  So what did you discover as where the biggest barriers there for farmers to use that power  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:14):**  and to work in the ecosystem instead of fighting against it?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:18):**  So one thing we found is in talking to a lot of German farmers that the wisdom currently  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:25):**  seems to be that it's the best thing to keep your animals inside.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:31):**  And if you want to have an organic label or what's called a Weidemich, so the milk that  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:40):**  gets produced from animals that are outside, they have pretty small requirements.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:43):**  So it's like 12 hours a day for 160 days a year.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:49):**  But the wisdom-  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:50):**  The bare minimum.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:51):**  Exactly.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:52):**  And what we found is also like support beef, cattle, it just for most farmers just seems  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:10:57):**  to be okay, we have some pasture where we can't really do anything else.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:01):**  So we just put some cattle there, but it's completely irrelevant to our whole business.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:06):**  So that was kind of devastating for us as well to see.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:10):**  And what we found is that in the UK, it's very different.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:14):**  There's just like a different culture around grazing with beef, sheep and dairy cattle.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:20):**  You have longer grazing seasons, it seemed like to us and grazing is more part of the  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:27):**  farming culture as well.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:30):**  And I think there we-  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:31):**  Could you say state more part?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:32):**  I mean, I'm imagining 100 years ago was pretty much the same.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:37):**  And so why did that not maybe change so much in the UK?  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:41):**  Or is that cultural connection to, I don't know, seeing animals in the land or you have  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:46):**  any idea, this is pure speculation.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:48):**  Like why those two countries went so far apart?  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:51):**  That's interesting.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:53):**  Because Netherlands and Germany are quite similar, right?  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:11:56):**  As one example, and there's a big difference.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:00):**  And you also see it like in Germany, you see a big difference between East and West, right?  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:03):**  So where you have much bigger farms in the East where the communists used to be.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:09):**  I don't know, it could be a cultural thing, right?  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:13):**  So to try to optimize production and to make things more predictable, maybe that's a German  
**[0:12:20-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:20):**  thing to do, I'm not sure.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:21):**  The engineering mind.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:22):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:23):**  But then you find a very, let's say, open mind or much more interested group of farmers  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:30):**  in the UK.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:31):**  Like was that a sort of desperate move?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:32):**  Like, okay, we keep knocking on doors in Germany and nobody opens the door.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:37):**  They keep saying, okay, animals should be in.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:38):**  What are you telling me?  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:39):**  A grazing app?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:40):**  I don't need a grazing app.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:41):**  I need a barn app.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:43):**  And then you say, okay, let's try another country.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:46):**  How did that come about?  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:47):**  Like, why the UK?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:48):**  I think, I mean, maybe it's a bit opportunistic, but also from the hindsight, strategically,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:54):**  it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:12:56):**  So subsidies, for example, they have changed a lot in the UK thanks to Brexit, right?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:02):**  Like away from, okay, you own a piece of land, you're going to get some money.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:07):**  You need to now show that you are, like the methods that you're using to treat your land  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:16):**  are actually sustainable before you get any subsidies.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:18):**  And then there are different tiers for it.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:19):**  In the UK, it's called the sustainable farming incentive, right?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:22):**  Which is the same kind of incentives that they want to have in the EU now as well, but  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:26):**  it's going to take some time.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:27):**  But what we saw is, okay, so now these subsidies are gone.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:30):**  The basic payment scheme for farmers in the UK are gone.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:33):**  So they need to change now, right?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:36):**  And maybe that was also a catalyst, right?  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:38):**  So that there was more urgency for the farmers in the UK.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:42):**  And we just, like, we had just much more open doors.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:45):**  Maybe that's also a cultural thing that farmers were way more willing to talk to us in the  
**[0:13:50-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:50):**  UK.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:51):**  So we just learned a lot more about UK farming than, you know, like, yeah.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:13:57):**  And we just gathered, I guess, also more early adopters in the UK than we ever could have  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:02):**  maybe in Germany.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:04):**  And so now what is Roomi as we currently speak?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:09):**  I mean, obviously in the light of a startup, it changes constantly.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:13):**  We're now at the end of the summer in 2022.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:16):**  And how would you describe Roomi at the moment to anybody that's completely new to the space?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:21):**  Yeah, so I would say that on the one hand, we help farmers implement sustainable grazing.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:28):**  And on the other hand, we're going to create a proof for them that they have done so and  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:33):**  with which they can get financing to finance this basic transition towards sustainable  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:38):**  farming.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:40):**  So it's really the double piece.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:43):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:44):**  Implementing sustainable grazing or holistic grazing or better grazing.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:48):**  We're going to unpack why that's so important.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:50):**  But also that's been going on for quite a while, mainly through trainers, through sessions,  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:14:56):**  through a lot of, but a lot of one to one or one to a few.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:01):**  And I think we can all agree that needs to go faster.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:03):**  Like what's the role of technology there to unlock it?  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:05):**  But is it also possible?  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:06):**  And I think you're showing that to do that faster.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:09):**  And it's not necessary to have somebody like as a coach, like on the ground to follow your  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:14):**  every step as a farmer to go through a process.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:17):**  How are you unlocking that to go faster than it currently is?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:21):**  Because it is spreading.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:22):**  People are changing their grazing practices.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:23):**  It's just way too slow to have the impact we need to have.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:27):**  So during the interviews, we found that a lot of farmers, they went to, for example,  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:32):**  to Gabe Brown's farm to learn, okay, what is he doing?  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:35):**  And how can I just do it on my farm?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:36):**  Some even paid to do that by supermarket chains.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:40):**  And then they tried it themselves on their farm and couldn't make it happen.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:45):**  Even after maybe they tried to get help from a consultant.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:52):**  Unforeseen things, different soil types, different grass types can really have a massive impact  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:15:58):**  on your journey.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:01):**  So we think that this kind of having a good consultant who understands basically the science  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:09):**  behind sustainable farming and how you can actually make it happen and then help you  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:12):**  implement it, that's very important.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:15):**  So we found that in our first investor who is a grazing consultant in the UK, who basically  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:22):**  helped us also understand what is the actual mechanism behind it.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:27):**  And getting away from a text or let's call it a rule book or a gospel or whatever you  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:38):**  want to call it.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:39):**  If you only do this, you'll be safe.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:42):**  So this is exactly what you need to do and it's going to work to, okay, so I understand  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:47):**  those are your exact characteristics on your farms.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:49):**  This is what you've been trying and it didn't work.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:52):**  Which is what we want to do children to do as well.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:53):**  Like it's not if you want them exactly to, okay, if you do this, this and this and this,  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:16:57):**  then this answer comes out of your mathematical model.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:00):**  But if that answer doesn't come, it would be nice if you actually understand them all.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:03):**  Like what are the mechanisms behind growing grass and growing healthy grass and keep like  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:08):**  optimal.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:11):**  But without going through 10 years of education and study to understand that because we don't  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:16):**  have the time.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:17):**  Yeah, or trial and error.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:18):**  So what did he see in that?  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:19):**  Like what did he see in that to join you?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:23):**  Because I could also see quote unquote as a threat because he probably has enough work  
**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:27):**  for the next 50 years.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:28):**  Doesn't have to worry about that because these really good consultants are full until 2030  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:34):**  basically.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:36):**  And yet there was an interest, okay, how can I leverage technology and how can I sort of  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:41):**  augmentate myself or repeat like sort of clone myself as a consultant and work with many  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:46):**  more people without working with way more people.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:48):**  Yeah, but that's exactly the ambition.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:50):**  So he felt like, okay, I want to scale myself faster.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:52):**  This has to happen faster, this process, the same urgency around climate change and farmers  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:17:57):**  in peril.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:00):**  And he felt like, okay, I can actually scale myself through this application.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:04):**  So we're basically, so his name is James Daniel.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:06):**  So in the beginning we were just joking, okay, we're going to build James Daniel as an app  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:09):**  essentially.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:12):**  And so at least the stuff that we-  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:14):**  He shows up at a hologram when you're in your land.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:19):**  Maybe not quite that far, but yes, like basically getting all this knowledge in and also just  
**[0:18:25-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:25):**  him teaching us and then recording or giving webinars, recording different content that  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:33):**  we can also then share with farmers basically.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:36):**  And kind of systematically breaking down what works and why it works so that we can understand  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:43):**  it and we can fill it into the app.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:46):**  And we can also expand it to farmers in a good way.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:52):**  And so how does that work?  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:54):**  And actually let's start with it.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:55):**  Does it limit you now?  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:18:57):**  We have a lot of this, I don't know, James, but we have a lot of the gurus in this space  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:02):**  that are quite like, it has to be like that and not like that.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:06):**  We need to, like, does it limit you working with one person sort of recreating him in  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:10):**  the app between brackets obviously, or are these relatively, let's say general rules  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:16):**  about grazing and like you can start implementing other philosophies about grazing in other  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:21):**  areas or like, how does it limit you?  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:23):**  Or actually it doesn't.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:25):**  And it's a quite a, let's say he's not the guru that's going to be offended if you change  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:29):**  certain things about him in the app.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:31):**  So I don't think he would consider himself a guru.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:33):**  I think he, so he has a bachelor in engineering.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:37):**  So he's like more of a scientist as well, like from the way he approaches things.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:41):**  So that works for us so that we don't have to say, okay, you need to do mob grazing.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:47):**  Otherwise you can't be part of the program or you need to do holistic grazing.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:51):**  That's the thing.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:52):**  So we can actually just talk to farmers where they are now, figure out why are you where  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:57):**  you are?  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:19:58):**  Are you like, what is your willingness to change?  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:01):**  What is your, what is the possibility to change on your farm?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:03):**  And then figure out how do we get from where you are today to something ideally zero input  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:08):**  farm and how fast can we achieve that?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:12):**  Right.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:13):**  Because just to be clear, like many, many grazing operations, we, maybe if you're not  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:18):**  running a grazing operation, you don't know, but use an immense amount of inputs for like  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:23):**  to keep the grass, the monoculture grass growing.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:25):**  Like just to give an idea to us listeners, if you work on a typical farm of one of your  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:32):**  farmers you work with, what would we see and how much input goes into that?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:36):**  Like how many cows are there?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:37):**  How would we see the current situation before they go into any kind of transition?  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:41):**  I know they're all different, but just a general and try to make it visual because you're between  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:46):**  our ears.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:47):**  Bring us on a journey.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:48):**  So like, so the ideal farmer for us is the one who does everything in the worst possible  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:53):**  way, right?  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:54):**  Which I'll describe now.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:20:55):**  So he is ideally set stock grazing, meaning he's not rotating animals at all between fields  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:02):**  or maybe only once or twice a year, right?  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:04):**  So for our climate here, that's very little.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:07):**  Right.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:08):**  And that means there's a lot of compaction happening in the soil, right?  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:12):**  The animals are constantly on it.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:14):**  More compaction means less water in the soil, right?  
**[0:21:16-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:16):**  It's like a sponge.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:17):**  You can imagine if you compress a sponge, there's no water that can go in, right?  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:21):**  If the sponge is expanded, it can soak up a lot and it stays like available to the plants.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:29):**  And then you...  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:30):**  So this summer is an issue if you have compacted soil.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:33):**  I think everybody in Europe is suffering from drought and too much rain at the worst moments  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:38):**  and nothing is good.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:39):**  So it's very...  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:40):**  And the grass, how does it look like?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:42):**  Do you see a lot of...  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:43):**  Is it like a very nice...  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:46):**  From an outsider, does the grass look okay?  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:47):**  Or is it like with a lot of, let's say, uncovered ground and bare soil in between?  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:52):**  What's the worst situation?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:54):**  Exactly that, what you just described.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:55):**  Like the grass is no longer green, right?  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:58):**  It's super dry.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:21:59):**  Like we've seen actually pictures on a side note from farmers where leaves are falling  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:03):**  from the trees as if it's autumn already just because of this insane dryness.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:08):**  But yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:09):**  So if you do set stock grazing, you're basically going to have a lot of bare soil.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:12):**  All the grass is super dry.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:15):**  You're not growing anything, right?  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:17):**  And your animals are going to try to eat the last stops of the completely dried grass,  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:22):**  right?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:23):**  And that's even going to ruin your grass for years probably, right?  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:27):**  Or like for a long time, it's not going to recover on its own very easily.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:32):**  And then you're probably going to use a monoculture perennial ryegrass, meaning very relatively  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:39):**  shallow roots.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:40):**  But if you give it enough nitrogen, it's going to grow quite fast, right?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:45):**  And that's why you use a lot of fertilizer to make this grass grow.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:49):**  But if you have no water, obviously it's not going to grow anyway.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:53):**  So that's why it's a problem.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:55):**  And then-  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:56):**  And fertilizer is very...  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:57):**  Nitrogen is very expensive.  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:58):**  Yes, that too.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:22:59):**  That's another incentive actually for farmers right now to change, which is great.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:04):**  So we see farmers who use 50 to 100 kilos per hectare in nitrogen fertilizer, which  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:10):**  is a lot.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:13):**  And then, yeah, so talk basically monoculture, set stock raisings or bad management and no  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:21):**  biodiversity, right?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:22):**  Single grass.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:23):**  And that's what we change, right?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:25):**  So we say, okay, based on your soil type.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:27):**  And some willingness to change.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:28):**  Yeah, that would be-  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:29):**  Because the farmer needs to at least have an image or an imagination of what could be  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:35):**  possible.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:36):**  Maybe he's seen other farms, maybe he's been to Cape Brown, maybe he's tested something,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:39):**  but there must be...  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:40):**  I mean, they must pick up the phone and call you otherwise, or pick up the phone and download  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:44):**  the app.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:45):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:46):**  But there must be some step because otherwise...  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:48):**  So let's say this farmer calls you.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:50):**  What happens then?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:52):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:53):**  So we would first try to understand, okay, how big is your farm?  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:57):**  How much grassland do you have?  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:58):**  How many animals do you have?  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:23:59):**  What is your stocking rate?  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:02):**  What type of grasses do you have?  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:03):**  All the characteristics I just described.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:06):**  What has been your historic management?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:08):**  What are you planning to do?  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:09):**  How do your finances look like?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:11):**  Everything needs to be taken into consideration in our viewpoint.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:14):**  A farmer who only has beef or only dairy cattle, he's really going to care a lot about where  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:22):**  the inputs come from, how expensive they are, and how productive they can be.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:26):**  So he cannot look at those things in isolation.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:29):**  If you have the luxury, let's say, to have enough money to just play around with animals,  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:34):**  and to say, okay, this year I'm going to have 10, maybe next year I'm going to have 30,  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:39):**  depending on how I feel about it.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:41):**  But actually your main operation is somewhere completely different, then it doesn't matter  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:44):**  so much.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:45):**  But if this is your only way of making income, then you need to look at the animals, the  
**[0:24:52-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:52):**  grass, and the business at the same time.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:24:59):**  So I kind of lost my thread here.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:03):**  And then what happens?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:04):**  So you get this full picture of the financial situation, the farm situation, and then you're  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:11):**  going to say, Google, what happens?  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:15):**  How do we come up with a transition plan?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:19):**  And then of course, the finance piece of it, but we get to the finance.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:22):**  Okay, you use this amount every year, input is cost is at the moment.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:26):**  How do we get you off this quote unquote drug as fast as possible?  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:29):**  But of course, it means changing the practices quite a bit.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:32):**  What would you and but not making it too risky, because then as a farmer, I would say, No,  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:36):**  no, I'm not going to risk this because I've seen others that tried and failed, or maybe  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:40):**  I tried it myself and failed as well.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:42):**  Like, how do I get over that?  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:44):**  Very, very rightfully so very scary bump of Okay, I'm gonna quite completely throw my  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:49):**  organization or my my my life around.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:51):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:53):**  So after we have all this data, we create a transition plan, right where we figure out  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:25:57):**  what can be done without jeopardizing operations.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:01):**  How fast can it be done?  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:03):**  How many and then also how many carbon credits would that be?  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:07):**  Right?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:08):**  And how much revenue could you get from that?  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:10):**  And what could they finance?  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:12):**  Right, so that we can say, this is your business case, you don't see but the owners is doing  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:15):**  a very nice movement of bringing back things.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:18):**  So finance is great, because it brings things backwards, basically, go forward to us now,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:22):**  like you can get some finance now to put solar panels, exchange practices, and they pay over  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:27):**  a year over time.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:29):**  If you can get that finance, it moves to you, but he makes a very nice movement towards  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:32):**  himself.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:33):**  Like, how do we bring this back in time that the potential benefits or the benefits that  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:37):**  come over time?  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:39):**  And that's this, that's the click there, you can finance these things.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:42):**  So that's what you discovered.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:43):**  And that's what you're building through carbon, which mainly come I think, from the fertilizer,  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:48):**  reduce, reduce fertilizer and the soil carbon, I think those two are the ones that that work  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:53):**  together there.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:54):**  Or is it separate?  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:55):**  Or, or how let's say, how difficult is it to make that transition plan?  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:26:59):**  Is it very relatively standard?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:01):**  Or is it super, super, super specific, like on where people are like, do you need somebody  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:06):**  on site to really build on or have you figured out, okay, if you do these 10 things, if you  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:11):**  take these variables into account, you can get to a pretty, you can get to 80%, let's  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:16):**  say.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:17):**  Yeah, yeah, that's what you said at the end now, basically, is like, so we did around  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:19):**  maybe 100 of those transition plans now, right.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:22):**  And we've seen a lot of different types of cases, edge cases, but also we can start grouping  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:28):**  farmers into different kind of groups, I guess, cohorts.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:35):**  So now, like for 90% of the cases, we can be pretty quick at saying, okay, this is what's  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:40):**  possible.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:41):**  Right.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:42):**  So for example, let's say you have 100 hectares, right.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:45):**  And then the question is, okay, how do I get from monoculture ryegrass to completely perfect,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:51):**  diverse, you know, grass swath with nitrogen, and everything in there, right.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:57):**  So I don't need fertilizer anymore.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:27:59):**  Right.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:00):**  So you can't just, if you want to have an operations, you can't do the whole thing at  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:03):**  once.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:04):**  It's not possible.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:05):**  Right.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:06):**  So you need to think about, okay, do I do 5%, 10%, or 15% of my grazing platform per  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:12):**  year?  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:13):**  What is, what can I actually sustain?  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:15):**  And that's what we can essentially just calculate, right, based on productivity and how the grass  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:21):**  has been managed before, right.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:22):**  So if it was set stock grazing before and use this much fertilizer, then we can say,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:26):**  okay, there's actually, you have whatever 30% room in improving your management practices  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:32):**  and grass utilization.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:33):**  That means we can actually produce this much more food from forage, and that's available  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:39):**  to your animals.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:42):**  And that means we can reduce, for example, the total platform by 30% during a year without  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:48):**  risking any reduction in productivity.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:53):**  Does these crazy droughts, like, model into that?  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:28:57):**  Like, do you take into consideration the crazy climate we currently live in?  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:02):**  Or how does that work?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:03):**  Or everybody suffers, obviously.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:05):**  But maybe if you're in transition, you suffer more or less?  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:09):**  Like how have you seen that this year in 2022?  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:12):**  Yeah, so you might suffer more actually, which is really bad.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:15):**  And that's one of the reasons why some farmers give up.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:18):**  Which is why, so what we want farmers to do is we want them to follow the plan as closely  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:25):**  as they can.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:26):**  But obviously, we want to have a conversation with them as well.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:28):**  Okay, if you didn't follow the plan, what happened?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:32):**  And we will be lenient when it's things like this drought, right.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:36):**  But we can see actually the farmer did reseed, as we said, he did reduce fertilizer.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:41):**  He just couldn't do the rotations as planned because it was just too dry.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:45):**  He had to graze not, he couldn't leave, let's say 15 centimeters of grass, he had to graze  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:52):**  down to five.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:53):**  It just wasn't possible otherwise, as one example, right.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:29:56):**  So and then at the end of the year, they will always get the payments for the carbon credits.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:03):**  And you say we can see, we get to the payments, everybody who's listening on the finance piece,  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:07):**  we get that.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:08):**  But like, when does the, we say we can see, does it mean, is this the piece where the  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:11):**  satellite comes in?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:13):**  How does that help you, because we haven't really covered it until now.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:17):**  Like what is possible now with satellite and grass?  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:20):**  Like what, I don't think you can count the different grasses.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:22):**  But I mean, I know you can count trees from space, but you can't really see what happens  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:25):**  underneath.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:26):**  Like how, why is this possible now?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:30):**  And describe for people, I'll put a remote sensing episode we did with Is and Tom as  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:35):**  well in the show notes.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:37):**  But why is this possible now that it wasn't possible, let's say five or 10 years ago?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:41):**  Yeah, so we're using two different types of satellite imagery.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:47):**  One is multispectral, which is really good at detecting biomass above ground.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:54):**  And the variation of-  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:30:55):**  Which is great for you to figure out, yeah, grass, I can see, okay, is something changing?  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:01):**  And it gives you also some indication of moisture.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:05):**  So like, you can figure from it, you can figure out what is the dry part of the biomass, right?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:11):**  Which is essentially what you need as a farmer to know, okay, how much can I feed my animals  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:15):**  every day?  
**[0:31:16-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:16):**  They typically know, okay, I need 2% of my animals body weight in dry matter every day.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:24):**  So from that we get the variation, but the resolution is only 10 by 10 meters.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:28):**  So that sounds a bit crazy, but on a massive grassland, it doesn't really matter so much.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:33):**  And we can do some machine learning trickery to increase the resolution a little bit.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:40):**  We call super resolution for those who are interested.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:43):**  And then we combine that with radar satellite imagery.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:48):**  So the problem with the multispectral data is that it's an optical sensor.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:52):**  Whenever you have clouds or anything in between, it's going to be, it can't go see anything.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:57):**  It never happens in the UK.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:31:58):**  No, there's almost no clouds in the UK.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:01):**  So that's why we need the radar imagery, which can penetrate clouds.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:06):**  And it's more accurate for seeing height differences.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:11):**  You still can't get to a centimeter resolution, but you can, for example, see, okay, I went  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:15):**  down from half a meter to 15.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:19):**  Those drops you can see.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:20):**  You wouldn't be able to see the variation of the biomass.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:24):**  I went down, meaning it's been grazed.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:27):**  Literally that.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:28):**  Wow.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:30):**  So we can see, has this field been grazed or not?  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:33):**  And the radar can work every day.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:36):**  That's one that doesn't care about clouds, doesn't care about anything.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:40):**  You have other types of interferences and it's not super easy data to work with.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:45):**  But if you combine it together with this multispectral imagery, and because we have a lot of measurement  
**[0:32:52-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:52):**  data from farmers about grass heights historically and current as well, that we can basically,  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:32:59):**  we built this model just for this purpose, right?  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:01):**  To figure out how much grass you currently have.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:05):**  And now we can do things like, we have an internal grass growth model based on temperature  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:11):**  and what we see on multispectral and so on.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:13):**  So cool.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:14):**  Right?  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:15):**  And then if we-  
**[0:33:16-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:16):**  Internal grass growth model.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:17):**  Yeah, we have an internal grass.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:18):**  Of course, model.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:19):**  What do you model?  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:20):**  I model grass.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:21):**  That's what we do.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:22):**  It's really important.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:23):**  But it's the foundation of a big chunk of our life.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:29):**  It's very interesting that we don't discuss that more often, or tree growth models.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:34):**  It's very interesting.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:35):**  How do you turn sunlight into something quote unquote useful is everything we do.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:41):**  That's the whole point.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:42):**  And yet we're laughing when you say a grass growth model because we don't discuss it very  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:46):**  often.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:47):**  So it's something we should do way more.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:48):**  Yeah, I agree.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:49):**  And what happens above ground gives you a good indication of what happens below.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:54):**  So for example, with this growth model, we can say, okay, your grass should grow this  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:33:59):**  much every day currently.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:01):**  But then suddenly we see that your grass grows way faster.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:05):**  So that means we can actually say, you put fertilizer on there.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:08):**  And we know pretty much how much nitrogen it was as well.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:11):**  So then we can say, okay, that impacted your soil negatively as well.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:16):**  And it obviously created emissions from fertilizer itself, from the fuel you use in your tractor  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:20):**  to spray the fertilizer and so on.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:23):**  So that's where the grazing management or the farm management data goes into a carbon  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:30):**  credit verification.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:33):**  Our view is if you want to do very high quality verification, you need to know about what  
**[0:34:39-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:39):**  the farmer is doing at any point in time.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:42):**  Because if you want to do it in a way that's scalable.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:46):**  We talked earlier about all the different emissions that go into these carbon credits.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:50):**  So one is solar organic carbon, it's like 80, 90%.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:34:53):**  But then it's the methane emissions from enteric fermentation, it's from the fertilizer, the  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:00):**  emissions from the manure, how you store it and for how long.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:03):**  If you have an open slurry pit, these gases that go into the air, if you go to a village,  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:10):**  you know.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:11):**  But when it smells like that, that can't be healthy.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:13):**  And it really isn't.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:14):**  Whenever an animal-  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:15):**  So you take all of that into account and look at the net improvement.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:19):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:20):**  You take into consideration, okay, we know that this farmer sprayed NPK X amount of time  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:26):**  with this amount.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:27):**  So we know more or less what that is.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:29):**  We know the diesel, we know how he or she stored the manure, if he or she had that,  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:34):**  we know the soil organic carbon part.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:37):**  And then we do the calculation and we come out hopefully with a plus.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:40):**  And that's able to, that we're able to sell that and finance with that.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:45):**  And then I make the movement again.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:46):**  We finance the transition with that, which I think is very interesting because normally  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:50):**  we, but let's unpack that a bit.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:53):**  So and how, because many people say, I mean, we come back to the, it's the cow, not the  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:58):**  cow.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:35:59):**  Like what do you see in those numbers from a very bad case, like the worst case you could  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:03):**  see, but still a farmer willing to change.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:05):**  Like how meaningful are these, is the carbon potential there?  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:09):**  Like, do you see, are they significant enough to, to, of course, otherwise it wouldn't be  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:13):**  working with you, but are these significant enough to, but maybe the only work for the  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:17):**  savings of the fertilizer, which is also okay.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:19):**  But are these significant enough to make people move?  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:22):**  Like what do you see there in terms of potential, let's say on that a hundred acre farm or an  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:26):**  average one you work with?  
**[0:36:28-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:28):**  From a business perspective or from a carbon perspective?  
**[0:36:31-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:32):**  Just if, if now, if somebody has been using the worst practices and going through this  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:36):**  transition with you, like how much are we saving?  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:39):**  How much are we storing?  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:40):**  How much on average, more or less are you able to verify because you're able to check  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:45):**  if somebody put the carbon or the NPK there because you have the set.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:49):**  So like, let's say we're talking a dairy farmer in Europe, they might have something like  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:55):**  eight tons of CO2 equivalent in emissions per hectare per year.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:36:59):**  Right.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:00):**  During the transition period, the kind of the, the increase in solid kind of carbon  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:05):**  is going to ramp up as you have more and more species on, on more and more of your grazing  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:11):**  platform, right.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:12):**  And you're going to be able to reduce your fertilizer emissions more and more as well  
**[0:37:15-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:15):**  also gradually.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:16):**  Right.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:17):**  So at the end of five.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:18):**  So it's a double one.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:19):**  Exactly.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:20):**  It stores and you reduce, which is great.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:22):**  So at the five year point until 10 years after we started, that's where you're going to have  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:27):**  the biggest drawdown, right.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:30):**  And the biggest reduction kind of, and so there we can be around zero, right.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:37):**  So we're going from eight to zero based on what's possible with increasing solar organic  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:42):**  carbon and reduction fertilizer.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:44):**  Then afterwards, it kind of depends on where your initial solar organic carbon was and  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:50):**  where you're basically going to find your equilibrium.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:54):**  And because like over time, you're going to reduce the amount of increase per hectare  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:37:59):**  per year.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:00):**  Right.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:01):**  So, but even afterwards, you can find farms that can be carbon neutral for a decade or  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:06):**  two.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:07):**  Right.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:08):**  And then maybe they will end up, if you take enteric fermentation into consideration at  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:10):**  around maybe two, three tons of CO2 equivalent per hectare per year.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:15):**  Right.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:16):**  If you keep the stocking rate the same.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:18):**  So animals per hectare, that's the assumption right now.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:21):**  Right.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:22):**  If you were to reduce your animals, of course, then, you know, that's a completely different  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:25):**  story, which we think is.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:28):**  Or I mean, and the methane equivalent or the, that's a very big discussion if we should  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:33):**  include that or not and how methane works.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:36):**  But if you look only at carbon, you're going to be carbon negative if you take the methane  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:42):**  out of the equation.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:44):**  So if you take carbon, right, then we only take the fuel and the, yeah.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:49):**  And the increase in solar organic carbon into account.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:51):**  Right.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:52):**  So the fertilizers typically, you know, nitrous oxide and other stuff.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:38:57):**  And so when you sell these credits, is it mostly sell reduction ones because you reduce  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:02):**  so much the input side or you sell, is there a combination of, and does it make that complicated?  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:09):**  So it's a combination of removal and avoidance.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:11):**  Right.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:12):**  Which does make it sometimes complicated for some buyers, but we're trying to also like  
**[0:39:19-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:19):**  help shape that conversation because in our view, right, so the nature-based solutions,  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:27):**  what you call it in the carbon market, right, is the only thing that's available right now,  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:32):**  which we can scale, right?  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:34):**  There's a lot of technology that's still in the kind of its infancy and we need to scale  
**[0:39:39-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:39):**  it up to get to something meaningful.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:41):**  But today we can make these changes right away.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:43):**  Right.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:44):**  And discussing, okay, should we have fewer animals or not?  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:47):**  It should be different, right?  
**[0:39:48-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:48):**  Like there is, like if, let's say we were to reduce our livestock today, right?  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:39:55):**  That means like on some project area, let's say in the UK, we reduce all livestock by  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:00):**  50%, then okay, what's going to happen?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:03):**  It's not like people will eat less meat all of a sudden.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:06):**  It means someone else or some other country will actually pick that up and we'll just  
**[0:40:09-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:09):**  increase the number of animals.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:11):**  So you have this kind of leakage problem, which means you actually probably want to  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:15):**  kind of maintain the livestock numbers.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:19):**  In some areas, it should probably be reduced, right?  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:20):**  So if your own land cannot maintain the number of animals that you have, you should probably  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:24):**  not have that many animals, but we need to figure out where do we displace it then?  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:29):**  The carrying capacity.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:30):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:31):**  Where, how do we account for this kind of leakage problem and how do we make up for  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:36):**  the loss in proteins as well, right?  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:39):**  And how have you seen that from some of these farmers?  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:41):**  Because we've heard stories, people are like increasing the stocking rate and the carrying  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:45):**  capacity dramatically by changing their management while reducing or going to zero with input,  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:50):**  which is a very interesting, which suggests that you're taking more sunlight and transforming  
**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:56):**  it to something very, very useful, which is nutrient dense protein, et cetera.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:40:59):**  Like, have you seen that as well in the UK or is it mostly like say American stories  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:03):**  and other stories where we actually, what we could do on this piece of land is much  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:06):**  more than we could imagine until we tried and then we saw actually we could produce  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:10):**  way more grass and thus support way more animals than we thought before.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:15):**  So we do also have this kind of understocked and overgrazed farms.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:19):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:20):**  Like we see that a lot.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:23):**  Which is just to get it in your head, like everyone is like understocked and overgrazed  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:28):**  is a crazy phenomenon.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:29):**  I think the first time I heard somebody probably listening, Jan Giesbert said it, like most  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:34):**  farms are understocked and overgrazed.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:36):**  It sounds crazy.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:37):**  But I think Gabe Brown has said it and some of the savory people obviously as well.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:41):**  So which suggested we're damaging our farm and getting way less animal protein of it  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:47):**  than we could.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:49):**  Plus having a lot of input and all the other externalities that we don't have.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:51):**  So which is sort of the wicked, like why?  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:55):**  So they exist.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:56):**  Many of them are understocked and overgrazed.  
**[0:41:57-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:57):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:41:58):**  And so Mariko said that in a previous episode as well, right?  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:01):**  So like reducing inputs, that's the main thing.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:04):**  I think she was saying it shouldn't just be CO2, but I think that's a different topic.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:11):**  So the chemical side as well.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:13):**  I mean, that's a whole different one.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:14):**  The chemical input side, but the whole input industry, we were completely addicted to the  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:21):**  trucks coming on our farm, dropping a lot of different things that sort of, and then  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:25):**  we're still understocked and overgrazed.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:28):**  And so on the carbon piece, on this credit piece, you've been selling the first ones.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:32):**  How has it been going?  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:33):**  Like how difficult, quote unquote, is it to you to have this story?  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:37):**  It's not the cow, it's the how.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:39):**  Because I'm imagining many of these companies are buying from you, are in big cities, very  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:42):**  far removed from the farms itself, just like you were.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:46):**  But maybe even further because they didn't grow up on a farm.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:49):**  Like how difficult is it to sell, quote unquote, the story of you actually should invest in  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:53):**  room and in transition if you want to have a meaningful dent in the next couple of years?  
**[0:42:59-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:42:59):**  So one thing that's difficult is to explain how important the increase in solar and carbon  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:04):**  is because it's not something you can just see directly like a tree.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:09):**  So that's kind of a difficulty for us.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:12):**  What is easier for us is that actually the project sites where these companies can invest  
**[0:43:18-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:18):**  in essentially with their offsets, they are typically way closer to the headquarter than  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:26):**  a project that's maybe halfway around the world.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:29):**  So that's actually a big plus.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:33):**  So imagine if you're a company and you want to attract new employees and you want to tell  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:40):**  the story that you are, or make it part of your brand that you care about sustainability.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:46):**  But then you also want to tell them, you want to be able to show that what you're doing  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:50):**  is meaningful and that it's actually happening.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:43:54):**  And what we are able to do because we talk or we are so close to farmers is we can actually  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:00):**  tell much or help do much better storytelling.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:03):**  And it's much more relatable to say, hey, I'm actually supporting this farmer that's  
**[0:44:06-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:06):**  10 kilometers away from where I work rather than maybe there's going to be some trees  
**[0:44:14-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:14):**  in Bolivia.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:15):**  No, it's very close.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:19):**  And then so what is the, not the trick, but what's the mechanism here?  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:26):**  You calculate with the farmer, what is possible in five and 10 years.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:31):**  And then it's not that you promise him or her, okay, in 10 years, we're going to pay  
**[0:44:35-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:35):**  you.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:36):**  So no, let's bring that forward now.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:37):**  So you can actually make these transitions.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:38):**  Like how difficult is that?  
**[0:44:39-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:39):**  Because that means you sort of pre-financing these carbon gains that are carbon, like avoided  
**[0:44:45-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:45):**  emissions and stored emissions that didn't really happen.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:48):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:49):**  So that we basically also pre-sell these credits.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:52):**  So that means even though we only verify the emission reductions after they have happened,  
**[0:44:59-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:44:59):**  so we can still convince buyers of these carbon credits that we will make them happen.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:06):**  And so that seems to work quite well because we can show that from our track rate of selling  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:11):**  credits.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:12):**  We're selling them at twice the price of our closest competitor in the kind of livestock  
**[0:45:16-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:16):**  space.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:18):**  And we haven't been having trouble, let's say, finding buyers, which is really great  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:24):**  because it means that there's people willing to invest into farmers to change their practices  
**[0:45:31-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:31):**  voluntarily, which I think is fantastic.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:34):**  It just shows that maybe the kind of zeitgeist is changing that we want to get closer to  
**[0:45:45-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:45):**  where the food comes from.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:46):**  We actually want to support one another.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:49):**  And I think that's fantastic.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:51):**  And the companies you sell to, are they typically in the food space?  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:55):**  Are they in media?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:45:56):**  Like what are, because you said you want to get closer.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:00):**  Is that literally like they are in the food space?  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:02):**  They're interested because of that?  
**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:03):**  Or they are generally, let's say, very conscious companies that want to voluntarily obviously  
**[0:46:09-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:09):**  offset or inset and actually offset if they're not in the food space.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:12):**  Like what do you see as a typical, like why do they come to you?  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:16):**  So it's kind of geographical closeness.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:19):**  That's what we see at least for carbon credits.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:22):**  And here we speak of the offset.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:23):**  So location, location, location.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:26):**  And it's story, story, story.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:28):**  You need to be able to tell a good story.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:30):**  It's part of the marketing strategy.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:34):**  It's oftentimes, of course they care what one thinks, but at the same time it's part  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:39):**  of the marketing and PR.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:41):**  But that's on the offsetting side.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:43):**  So like where anyone technically could buy these offsets anywhere on the planet, any  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:49):**  kind of company, any industry.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:52):**  Even though we want to make sure that it's only companies who also can show either already  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:46:57):**  a track record or have some believable strategy for reducing their own emissions.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:02):**  But then you also have to the second kind of distribution channel, if you will, which  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:05):**  is within the food supply chain.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:08):**  And there you typically speak of insetting, because it stays within the supply chain.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:13):**  These carbon credits stay in the supply chain.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:17):**  And there we see equally good traction.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:21):**  We are using the same type of pricing as for the voluntary carbon market.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:26):**  And companies want to reduce their own emissions.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:29):**  Typically they have goals for, okay, I want to reduce my emissions by 50% by 2030.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:35):**  And oftentimes a lot of these emissions come from how the raw materials are produced or  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:40):**  the inputs are produced.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:42):**  And that then comes down to the farmers.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:44):**  That means we need to reduce emissions for the farmers, but they don't know how.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:48):**  So that means they actually pay us to onboard farmers and help them go through the transition  
**[0:47:53-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:53):**  plan.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:54):**  And here again, it works with the financing.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:47:58):**  They will be interested in buying these raw materials in this case, animal protein, which  
**[0:48:03-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:03):**  is much more traceable.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:04):**  Of course, you have all the traceability and has a really, really good story coming back  
**[0:48:09-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:09):**  to the story.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:11):**  And they can inset part of their emissions they get down the line.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:15):**  And I would even say, so today you actually see a lot of dairy or beef companies in the  
**[0:48:20-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:20):**  supply chain who want to, and maybe already are paying for sustainable products, but they  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:27):**  don't actually know whether anything is happening with that money that they're paying, this  
**[0:48:31-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:31):**  premium that they're paying.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:32):**  Maybe they paid one of these farmers to go to Gate Brown's farm and they never had nothing  
**[0:48:37-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:37):**  to pay these trainings, which are great, but then if they don't follow up with a concrete  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:41):**  transition plan and all the work after and the verification, it's very, I mean, we all  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:46):**  know that we go to amazing courses, et cetera.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:48):**  And then on Monday morning you show up again at work or in your farm and then yeah, to  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:52):**  implement it is very, very, you sort of give them a tool to follow through for at least  
**[0:48:57-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:48:57):**  a group that wants to and wants to potentially get premiums as well.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:00):**  Because I think not only reducing drastically your input, of course, get paid for the transition,  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:05):**  which is great, but also if the supermarket chain or whoever can say, okay, but if you  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:09):**  reach this level, we have a certain premium ready for you, which drives the market.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:16):**  And you see that happening already, like that those forces are starting to pull and push  
**[0:49:20-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:20):**  them.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:21):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:22):**  What we also see is that some companies, they try to also implement it by having pilot  
**[0:49:26-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:26):**  programs, right?  
**[0:49:27-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:27):**  So with maybe a handful, sometimes 30 farmers, right?  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:31):**  But they're really asking themselves, how are we going to do this for thousands?  
**[0:49:36-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:36):**  Because if you want to reduce the overall emissions by 50%, it's not enough.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:40):**  If you do it with 30 farmers, you need to do it with all of them.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:46):**  So what would you say now in this space of a carbon hype and a lot of attention, droughts,  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:52):**  et cetera, what would you say?  
**[0:49:54-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:54):**  I always ask this question in this, let's imagine we're in a theater, let's imagine  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:49:57):**  we do this in person soon and we have a lot of smart investors in the room, investing  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:02):**  their own money, investing other people's money, et cetera.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:04):**  What would you, obviously without giving investment advice, but what would you tell them to do  
**[0:50:08-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:08):**  once they leave?  
**[0:50:09-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:09):**  Like, okay, what would be the first step?  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:10):**  Is that doing long interviews with farmers, like you said, like going deep into the space  
**[0:50:15-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:15):**  or what are spaces or places that you say, okay, they really deserve more attention and  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:20):**  more interest, more resources, more energy and potentially more money as well.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:25):**  I think if you look at the carbon market, there's a lot of investments basically going  
**[0:50:29-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:29):**  to downstream innovations like marketplaces, brokers, rating agencies, whatever, but there's  
**[0:50:36-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:36):**  very little on the supply side, right?  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:39):**  On the actual supply, like you're actually creating the credits that need to be then  
**[0:50:44-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:44):**  sold, rated, whatever.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:46):**  So I think investing and figuring out how to best invest into a credible supply, that's  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:51):**  very important.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:50:54):**  And I think looking at kind of hands-off approaches is very difficult or I don't see that can  
**[0:51:04-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:04):**  be successful based on how we talk to farmers.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:06):**  Like saying, for example, you only provide financing and you don't even talk to the farmer  
**[0:51:11-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:11):**  necessarily.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:12):**  You're basically a bank where you're saying, okay, I'm going to help you get money because  
**[0:51:17-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:17):**  some people want to pay money for regenerative grazing, but then you just need to do some  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:22):**  credibility check as bank, so to speak, but you don't actually then figure out, okay,  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:26):**  what is the farmer going to do?  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:27):**  Because the risk is going to stay with the farmer.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:29):**  He has to figure out how am I actually going to do that?  
**[0:51:32-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:32):**  How am I going to generate, let's say, these many credits or how am I going to actually  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:35):**  make these emission reductions happen or how am I going to run a business with these different  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:40):**  practices?  
**[0:51:41-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:41):**  How am I actually going to transition?  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:43):**  So I think that that's why these hands-off approaches in my opinion are very difficult.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:47):**  So I would look for companies maybe who can show that they can either attract a large  
**[0:51:54-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:51:54):**  enough segment of a very particular type of farmer or who can show that they have been  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:00):**  able to speak to or attract a lot of different types of farmers.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:04):**  So where you can just say, okay, they understand farming.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:10):**  Farmers want to work with them and they actually understand how to generate the supply.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:14):**  That's what I would say.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:19):**  And so what would you do if you would be in charge of a billion dollars, a billion euros,  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:22):**  let's keep it, or a billion pounds sterling as you're in the UK?  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:26):**  What would you do if you had to invest that?  
**[0:52:27-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:27):**  You have to put it to work with a very long lifetime if you want to or very short, maybe  
**[0:52:33-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:33):**  say most impact can be made now.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:35):**  Would you just buy all these credits?  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:37):**  Would you set up a lot of roomies around the world or would you shoot some more satellites  
**[0:52:42-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:42):**  into space because you need better than 10 meter accuracy or would you just spend it  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:46):**  all on invested or in machine learning?  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:48):**  What would you, or maybe consumer awareness around these things?  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:52):**  What would you do if you had to put that to work?  
**[0:52:55-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:55):**  I think more satellites would definitely be good and making it available and making it  
**[0:52:58-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:52:58):**  cheap and also easy to use.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:00):**  Are they getting there?  
**[0:53:01-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:01):**  Is this 10 meter something like if we would discuss this in a year, it would be to eight  
**[0:53:05-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:05):**  or five.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:06):**  Is this a continuing progress?  
**[0:53:10-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:10):**  Is getting better over time or is the machine learning and the software getting better to  
**[0:53:15-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:15):**  identify 10 meters and let's say upscale it to, is it a continuous improvement like Moore's  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:21):**  law or what is happening on both sides, just like with computers and software, the software  
**[0:53:27-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:27):**  is getting better and the hardware is getting better.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:29):**  It's the same thing for satellites.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:30):**  You have more and more satellites being shot in orbit and the prices are getting cheaper  
**[0:53:37-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:37):**  and cheaper.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:38):**  We're using free satellite imagery from the Ukraine Space Agency, which have this relatively  
**[0:53:45-0:53:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:45):**  coarse resolution, but also the technology is moving on, not in months, but more like  
**[0:53:52-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:52):**  decades, but it's happening.  
**[0:53:53-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:53:53):**  At the same time, image processing algorithms and so on are getting better and compute powers.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:02):**  You would maybe spend it, you might maybe put it a bit into the satellite space, but  
**[0:54:06-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:06):**  what else would you do?  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:08):**  We have to accept for roomy, right?  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:13):**  You can put like 50 room into room, but I'm curious about the rest.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:18):**  But it shouldn't stay in the food space because I was thinking-  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:22):**  It could be anything.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:24):**  Not really.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:25):**  I'm asking this question because I'm curious how people working in the space would prioritize  
**[0:54:31-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:31):**  if they had unlimited resources.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:34):**  I think even though we haven't solved the climate crisis and solved food production  
**[0:54:38-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:38):**  or anything like this, it feels to me at least, okay, we can actually solve this within the  
**[0:54:42-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:42):**  next 10 years, 15 years, 20 years.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:44):**  I don't know.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:45):**  It's at least, it feels like it's on the horizon and we know how to do it.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:49):**  We just need to execute in quotation marks.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:53):**  I feel like there's some questions that we haven't solved yet.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:54:57):**  One is there's going to be a lot of migration that has to happen because of climate change.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:03):**  I don't know how we're going to solve that.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:06):**  We've seen what happened in, whatever, 10 years ago when there was migration happening  
**[0:55:12-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:12):**  after the Syrian war.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:15):**  I can't remember.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:16):**  But refugees coming to Europe, that was a big crisis and it's just going to be 100 times  
**[0:55:22-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:22):**  bigger within the next 20 years.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:26):**  How are we going to solve that?  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:28):**  That's a big question for me.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:29):**  Another one is how are we going to solve the issue around basically the consequences of  
**[0:55:40-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:40):**  an aging society?  
**[0:55:44-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:44):**  I think that that's going to really put us in front of a lot of problems, how we actually  
**[0:55:48-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:48):**  finance that, how we make sure that older people don't live in poverty.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:55:58):**  With age, you have a higher risk for health issues, mental ones like dementia, whatever.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:08):**  That's just going to require a rethink in how we set up society.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:11):**  Right now, you have typically young people living in cities working on tech and then  
**[0:56:15-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:15):**  old people moving out.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:16):**  I was going to say, this gets into a whole different topic, which we should get into  
**[0:56:21-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:21):**  one of these ones.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:22):**  That's why I was like rural urban divide and how we shape.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:26):**  And generational divide.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:27):**  I think what's interesting here and generational divide and of course with migrants as well,  
**[0:56:33-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:33):**  how do we shape the countryside or actually the country we want to?  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:40):**  I think there's a very interesting connection with the way we farm and the way we manage  
**[0:56:45-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:45):**  the land.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:46):**  Let's bring it broader.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:48):**  The reason I'm recording these interviews is because I think regenerative practices  
**[0:56:51-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:51):**  and regenerative food is a very nice entry point to ask all of those questions as well  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:55):**  because you're forced to after a while to ask questions about land ownership, to ask  
**[0:56:59-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:56:59):**  questions about why some people were very lucky in life and got 100 hectares and many  
**[0:57:05-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:05):**  others most people didn't and were born somewhere else.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:09):**  Many people got access to water or didn't.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:11):**  Many people got access to education or didn't.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:13):**  Many people got access to a lot of money or didn't.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:15):**  And there are big questions around health and big questions around intergenerational  
**[0:57:20-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:20):**  living.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:21):**  There are big questions around living in general, what we want houses to be or transport.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:25):**  We come back to the flying, no, sorry, the self driving houses.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:29):**  I think it forces us to ask all of those questions.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:31):**  Do we want to be dependent on massive input companies that get stuff somewhere that we  
**[0:57:36-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:36):**  don't even know or do we want to be, like how do we shape that?  
**[0:57:39-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:39):**  And it forces us to ask those questions.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:42):**  It's very valid, but as we're almost approaching the hour, I would just say, let's keep that  
**[0:57:46-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:46):**  for another one.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:47):**  But as we sit down, I think this is a good one to do in person, honestly.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:50):**  It's better than do through video as we do now.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:53):**  So if you had a magic wand, I think it's a good final question in this case because it  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:57:59):**  nicely connects to what you would invest in as well.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:03):**  What would you change if you had one thing you could change overnight?  
**[0:58:06-0:58:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:06):**  What would you use that for?  
**[0:58:08-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:08):**  And it's a very powerful tool, obviously, but what would you do?  
**[0:58:11-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:11):**  I think having the perfect food labels is what I would change.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:17):**  As a consumer, you can actually make informed choices about what you're buying.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:21):**  That would be fantastic.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:24):**  Like today, you have a jungle of different labels and I haven't at least seen one yet  
**[0:58:29-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:29):**  where you can actually just look at it and say, that's great.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:31):**  I can make a decision based on that and on that alone.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:35):**  Because I think it's a very complex issue and we tend to oversimplify.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:42):**  And that's why companies who produce food can take advantage of that.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:47):**  So as one example, you don't know whether a monoculture oat field that you use to produce  
**[0:58:56-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:58:56):**  a milk alternative is actually better for the climate than cow milk that you can buy.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:02):**  You can't make that choice right now as a consumer.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:05):**  Or if you eat avocados or lime from Mexico, are you aware that you're probably supporting  
**[0:59:10-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:10):**  drug cartels?  
**[0:59:12-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:12):**  And I think that's a terrible state to be in as a consumer.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:14):**  Even if you try to make a good choice, but even if you try it, you cannot make the right  
**[0:59:19-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:19):**  choice.  
**[0:59:20-0:59:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:20):**  And I think that's terrible.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:21):**  So having the perfect food label, I think would be a very busy one.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:26):**  It also has to be simple and understandable.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:30):**  And it would be very interesting to that level of transparency.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:35):**  Do you think people would care?  
**[0:59:37-0:59:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:37):**  Enough people would care.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:38):**  Now let me rephrase the question.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:40):**  To leave this peanut butter and take another one or to take this avocado and like to make  
**[0:59:45-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:45):**  that choice in a supermarket or in a place where they buy?  
**[0:59:49-0:59:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:49):**  I think so, yes.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:50):**  Where we buy, honestly, do we care?  
**[0:59:52-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:52):**  I think so.  
**[0:59:54-0:59:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:54):**  If you look at like whatever organic produce, for example, right, then you see, okay, people  
**[0:59:58-0:59:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:58):**  are buying that.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=0:59:59):**  You see people choosing to be vegetarian or vegan because of climate.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:03):**  So I think there's the willingness to change.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:06):**  And I think there's a big group of people who are saying, I can't make a reasonable  
**[1:00:09-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:09):**  choice so I'll just buy whatever.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:11):**  I'll just buy the cheapest.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:13):**  So then I think there's a majority of people who would make a choice based on that label  
**[1:00:18-1:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:18):**  and actually change the way we produce food because a farmer is going to produce what  
**[1:00:22-1:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:22):**  he can sell.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:24):**  So I think it has to start at the consumer level, which is obviously then the perception  
**[1:00:29-1:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:29):**  is shaped by marketing from companies.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:33):**  But those things maybe need to work in unison.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:36):**  I think that food producing companies have understood that sustainability has to be part  
**[1:00:40-1:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:40):**  of their brand now.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:42):**  There's just no way around it.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:43):**  That's what we're seeing from the corporates who want to be our customers for the in-setting  
**[1:00:49-1:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:49):**  model.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:50):**  So it means, okay, we just need to also reach the consumers.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:53):**  And then we have to change complete because a farmer will not produce something that he  
**[1:00:57-1:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:57):**  cannot sell.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:00:58):**  I think it's a good moment to end.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:04):**  I want to thank you so much for your time to explain what a satellite grazing app is  
**[1:01:09-1:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:09):**  and how does it work in setting versus offsetting?  
**[1:01:13-1:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:13):**  How grazing can be a huge part of the solution, which we all know, but then how do we practically  
**[1:01:18-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:18):**  get there, which is a very different question.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:21):**  And I want to definitely keep, I will send an invite at some point to do the philosophical  
**[1:01:28-1:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:28):**  urban versus rural and migrant generational divide and I will take you up on that at some  
**[1:01:35-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:35):**  point.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:36):**  But thank you so much for now and good luck with building.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:38):**  Thank you very much for having me.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:01:48):**  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end.

**[1:02:26-1:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:26):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:02:31-1:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:31):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:02:35-1:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:35):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:39):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:02:41-1:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:41):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:02:45-1:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:45):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:02:50-1:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:50):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:02:54-1:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:54):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:02:57-1:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:57):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[1:02:59-1:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:02:59):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[1:03:01-1:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:01):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[1:03:04-1:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:04):**  What questions should you ask?  
**[1:03:06-1:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:06):**  What is happening in the space?  
**[1:03:07-1:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:07):**  What should you read?  
**[1:03:08-1:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:08):**  What should you listen?  
**[1:03:10-1:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:10):**  What should you watch?  
**[1:03:11-1:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:11):**  How to approach this space?  
**[1:03:13-1:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:13):**  For whom is this course?  
**[1:03:15-1:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:15):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:18):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[1:03:22-1:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:22):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  
**[1:03:27-1:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:27):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  
**[1:03:32-1:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:32):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:35):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:03:38-1:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:38):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:03:42-1:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:42):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:47):**  Is this course free?  
**[1:03:48-1:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:48):**  No.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:49):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:51):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[1:03:56-1:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:03:56):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:01):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:04:06-1:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:06):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:04:09-1:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:09):**  Thank you.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:10):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:04:11-1:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:11):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:04:18-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:18):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:19):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:04:24-1:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:24):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:04:30-1:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:30):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:04:35-1:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:35):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:36):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:04:41-1:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:41):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:04:45-1:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:45):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:50):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:04:51-1:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:51):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:04:53-1:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:53):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:04:55-1:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:55):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:04:59):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:05:01):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-scheibe#t=1:05:06):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

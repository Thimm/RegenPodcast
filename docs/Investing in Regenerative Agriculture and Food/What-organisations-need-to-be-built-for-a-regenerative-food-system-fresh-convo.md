**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:13):**  Welcome to a very special episode where we hosted a conversation together with the team  
**[0:00:17-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:17):**  of Fresh Ventures.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:18):**  A conversation where we dig deeper into what ventures need to be built, what ventures are  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:24):**  we missing in the space of regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:27):**  We're going to do this more regularly, so enjoy.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:31):**  Welcome everyone to the first Fresh Convo, Fresh Conversations that we're hosting.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:36):**  A little bit of background.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:37):**  My name is Bart van der Zonde.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:38):**  I'm one of the co-founders of the Fresh Venture Studio, the organization that set this up.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:45):**  We are a startup studio on a mission to regenerative and circular food system.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:50):**  We intend to build multiple new steward owned organizations to help the transition, accelerate  
**[0:00:57-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:57):**  the transition to a regenerative food system.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:00):**  In that context, we are continuously looking and getting into conversations on what are  
**[0:01:06-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:06):**  the actual problems or where are the opportunities that would require more attention from entrepreneurial  
**[0:01:13-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:13):**  teams and talent to work on.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:15):**  What would really help the ecosystem forward in bringing about this more regenerative food  
**[0:01:21-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:21):**  system.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:22):**  Koen van Zijer, one of the co-hosts today is someone we talk a lot with on this subject.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:33):**  We really like his podcast as well for those who don't know it, Investing in Regenerative  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:37):**  Agriculture podcast.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:39):**  Really a lot of great conversations on this subject.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:43):**  We decided to start hosting open conversations about specifically what are potential opportunities  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:51):**  that would need more entrepreneurial energy.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:54):**  I would say what are problems that are still very hard to solve that could really deserve  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:00):**  some additional attention from maybe a different type of people that are working on it right  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:04):**  now.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:05):**  That is the central question today.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:09):**  For the technical part, I would like to invite you all very much to contribute.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:13):**  There is no set program for this conversation.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:18):**  Please share your thoughts as well, your questions, things you want to bring into this group of  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:22):**  people.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:23):**  I think it's an interesting group.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:27):**  If you want to say something, I would like to ask you to make it a little bit civilized  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:32):**  to add a comment in the chat.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:36):**  Then we'll make sure that people get or raise your hand like Koen van Zijer.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:41):**  We'll make sure that we sort of pass on the talking stick, I would say.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:46):**  Before I move into this, I have one short poll that I would like to do.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:52):**  This is to get a little bit of an idea of the people who are in this space right now  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:56):**  and also that you have an idea of what kind of people are here.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:59):**  It's always a little bit difficult if you're digitally connected and not physically.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:04):**  Paul is going to start a poll.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:05):**  If you can answer it, two questions and then we have a little bit of an idea of who we  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:09):**  all are.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:10):**  It should be quite easy.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:26):**  We'll share the results in a little bit so you can see what the rest is doing as well.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:37):**  85% voted.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:41):**  All right.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:45):**  Everyone voted.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:46):**  Paul, if you can share the results.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:51):**  The biggest part of this group is an entrepreneur themselves, investors and knowledge workers  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:58):**  come in second.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:01):**  Also quite a quarter of the group is intending to start a new business, probably a reason  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:05):**  to find answers to the question, all right, where to start, where can I make the most  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:11):**  impact.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:12):**  All right.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:13):**  Thank you, Paul.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:16):**  My co-host of the day is Koen van Zeyer.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:20):**  As I said, Koen, you have been doing over 120 interviews.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:26):**  I think you said over five or six years you've been in the game quite long and you've talked  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:32):**  to a lot of people.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:33):**  I wanted to actually start with you in raising this question on what do you think and what  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:40):**  would you say after these 120 interviews are the biggest problems but also opportunities  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:44):**  for venture building?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:47):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:49):**  Thank you so much, first of all, for organizing this.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:51):**  It's always nice to show up somewhere and not having to do all the background and all  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:54):**  the organization.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:55):**  And I'm very happy, obviously, that Fresh got started after many, many discussions with  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:00):**  people back in the day and over the last years.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:03):**  I think I've done a number of shout outs in the podcast that we need more venture builders  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:08):**  while you were building your venture builders.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:09):**  So I'm very happy that it's public now and ventures are being built.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:14):**  So for me, I mean, for anybody that doesn't know, the journey we've been on is I think  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:19):**  we started interviewing now about four and a half years ago.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:22):**  It feels a lot more or maybe five.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:24):**  I have to check.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:25):**  But it was very sporadic at the beginning.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:27):**  We just interviewed a few friends, interviewed a few people.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:30):**  Honestly, for me to hang out with people virtually that were building or are building interesting  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:34):**  things in the region for the next phase, because I didn't know what I wanted to build myself.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:38):**  I'm not the farmer.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:39):**  I don't have the huge urge to start a farm, nor honestly, the investor, because I don't  
**[0:05:45-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:45):**  have the wealth.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:46):**  So I really wondered, what can I do in this space?  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:48):**  And I thought the best way is probably to hang out with people that are building things.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:51):**  And to do that, I had to interview them.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:53):**  And of course, I had also to publish them, but it was not even part of the game.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:58):**  So we did that for a number of years, and since the last two or three years, we really  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:03):**  brought some more structure to the table.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:05):**  And now we're releasing an episode a week, and we're doing a number of series, and it  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:08):**  really became a small media company.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:11):**  In terms of lessons learned, I think the first one is really the attention for soil.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:16):**  Of course, my bubble has grown, but really exploded over the last years, which is amazing.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:21):**  We need way more attention for the way we treat land, oceans, and basically our planet,  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:26):**  need way more attention for the opportunities.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:28):**  And what we've seen, we sort of identified four themes, I think a year and a half or  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:34):**  two years ago now, which are still very current, that we see huge challenges, also huge opportunities,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:39):**  not necessarily the easiest places to build things, but definitely in our mind, huge opportunities  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:45):**  over the next decade or so.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:47):**  These are long term games, so don't expect anything fast.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:50):**  But we see huge opportunities in food as medicine.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:53):**  So nutrient density, the measurement of how can we show that this tomato is different  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:58):**  than that tomato?  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:59):**  How can we show that connection between healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy gut systems,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:05):**  healthy people, and then ultimately healthy ecosystems?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:08):**  There's a lot being done.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:09):**  There's a lot of luckily grand capital moving into the space.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:14):**  Companies are claiming all kinds of things, but I think there's still a lot of space.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:18):**  Like what are food companies looking in the future if we take food as medicine seriously?  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:23):**  How it's going to look, I don't know.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:25):**  We're going to see a lot of changes, I think, over the next years.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:28):**  The other one, and Willemijn knows a lot more about that, is Lens and also actually Tecla,  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:33):**  landscape design.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:34):**  How do we bring this region-ag discussion and regeneration of an hectare here, 10 hectares,  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:39):**  10,000, et cetera, to a landscape scale?  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:42):**  How do we bring that discussion of bringing back rivers, stabilizing climate in certain  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:48):**  areas?  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:49):**  We need to talk at ecosystem level and landscape levels because we're literally running out  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:52):**  of soil.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:53):**  We need a lot of innovative companies to do that, technology, food companies that operate  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:59):**  at a landscape level, that buy the full rotation.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:02):**  I literally had a discussion with Nestle, all people yesterday, and they say, we're  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:06):**  going to buy the full rotation, which is very interesting, at a landscape level.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:11):**  People are thinking about it, but we need to look at a larger scale.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:15):**  Landscape is, or ecosystem, or biome is really the operating principle we need to use because  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:21):**  otherwise we stay in very, very nice, but very, very small and marginal discussions.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:26):**  Then ecosystem service payments, super interesting as well.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:30):**  Very crowded at the moment.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:31):**  A lot of people are jumping on the carbon bandwagon, obviously.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:34):**  Still, I think a lot of space if you look at payments for biodiversity, payments for  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:38):**  things that we all need.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:40):**  Farmers can provide or lend stewards, but we're currently, especially through food,  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:45):**  not paying for.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:46):**  Of course, there's the subsidy train you can take, but it's very, very complicated.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:51):**  We just released, did we release already?  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:53):**  Anyway, an interview with a colleague of mine on how to calculate returns at a landscape  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:57):**  scale.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:58):**  I would definitely see that as a piece as well.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:00):**  How can you start seeing all the different flows of capital and non-financial returns  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:05):**  that come off regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:07):**  How do you get more money in the pockets of farmers?  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:09):**  I think that's a central question.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:11):**  Then the fourth, transition finance.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:13):**  How do we finance all of these transitions?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:15):**  How do we help farmers to bridge those gaps, the yield gaps, the drops, et cetera, et cetera?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:20):**  How do we make sure food companies go through the transition of sourcing different ingredients,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:24):**  et cetera?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:25):**  There's a lot of innovative ways to travel time there to bring things forward that we  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:31):**  would like to see happening now.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:33):**  Planting trees is an example.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:34):**  They're an amazing investment, but it takes seven to 10 or sometimes even more years.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:38):**  How do you finance that?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:39):**  That's a finance question, but somebody has to build a company to do that.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:42):**  The fifth theme that we've seen recently, I'm getting very excited about, and that's  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:46):**  why I'm so excited of the Stuart connection here, the Stuart ownership, is regenerative  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:51):**  enterprises, who is not only very ambitious when it comes to building soil or rebuilding  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:56):**  soil, but also extremely ambitious when it comes to everything else.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:00):**  All the uncomfortable questions around inequality, land access, profit share, racism, all the  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:06):**  big questions agriculture forces us to ask, and we often don't.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:11):**  I see some organizations taking that head on very, very seriously, and I'm very happy  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:15):**  about that.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:16):**  We're planning with the podcast to follow them.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:19):**  Thank you, Koen.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:23):**  That's quite a lot, as you like to say, that's quite a lot to unpack as well.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:30):**  Maybe already get a few other people involved as well.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:34):**  Again, please enter your own remarks or as Willemijn does now, share resources with us  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:40):**  in the chat as well so we can get you guys involved.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:43):**  Maybe you mentioned Willemijn already, Koen, maybe we can ask her to jump in because you  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:49):**  mentioned landscape design as well.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:52):**  Maybe Willemijn, you can briefly tell a little bit about what you're doing, who you are,  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:58):**  and then I wonder also what your perspective is on this question, like what are the main  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:03):**  problems but also what are the opportunities that you see that we need to work on?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:09):**  Yeah, so first of all, thanks for inviting me.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:12):**  I feel like you are really more an expert than I am, but I'll try to do my best to share  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:20):**  some experiences.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:22):**  It's great to see Tekla here.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:23):**  She's also part of our growing community of people working either on regenerative businesses  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:29):**  or on landscape restoration, and there is a connection.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:32):**  I work for Common Land.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:34):**  It's an Amsterdam-based organization engaged in enabling large-scale holistic landscape  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:40):**  restoration, also built on regenerative businesses.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:44):**  So we believe it can be business-driven landscape restoration.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:49):**  So you can actually restore soils and ecosystem functioning by doing business differently.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:56):**  So it can be different products also coming out of the landscape.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:59):**  This can be fiber, food, drinks, so it can be a lot of different things, and it's a really  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:05):**  exciting space.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:07):**  So I think we're known for the four returns method.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:10):**  So it moves away from maximization of return on investment per hectare, so getting as much  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:17):**  as you can out of the land in a short amount of time, towards maximization of interaction  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:23):**  per hectare.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:24):**  So how can you create more diversity between people, between businesses, but also in terms  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:29):**  of biodiversity, so bringing back diversity in all its shapes and forms to move away from  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:35):**  this monoculture growth-oriented way of using land?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:42):**  So I think carbon is an opportunity and a challenge all in one, because it's really  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:48):**  if you want to measure carbon, for example, on a large scale, you're going to have to  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:53):**  work with proxies, and it's going to be incomplete.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:56):**  So that article I just shared has a good analysis also of that.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:02):**  Because carbon is just one of the multiple things you can create and actually can also  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:10):**  create financial streams around.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:11):**  So we are looking at that space and seeing what we want to do with it, but we also sort  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:18):**  of don't believe the hype in a way, sort of think from an ecosystem perspective.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:23):**  So how can you indeed reward land stewards for whatever they're performing on the land  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:30):**  in terms of producing regeneratively?  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:33):**  So that can be biodiversity oriented or carbon oriented or water quality.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:40):**  But just looking at it more holistically, not just running away with carbon and forgetting  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:45):**  about the ecosystem.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:47):**  Nevertheless, it's also a huge opportunity.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:49):**  I mean, there is a lot of carbon that can be captured by soil and by different land  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:54):**  practices.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:57):**  So definitely a beautiful development, but something to just be aware of.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:01):**  And I really recommend reading that article, although it takes an hour to read.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:07):**  And other challenges, I think a landscape approach in itself can be a bit challenging.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:16):**  And I think Tekle can also talk to that.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:19):**  It's just you are effectively engaging in system change.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:23):**  You are working in an ecosystem with a lot of people living there, using the land, infrastructural  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:30):**  projects.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:32):**  So you have to deal with everybody in that landscape.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:35):**  And that's challenging.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:36):**  So we're trying to also learn from the theory you community and how you can engage in a  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:43):**  system.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:44):**  It can be education, can be health system, but in our case, it's a landscape system and  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:50):**  engage in different types of conversations.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:52):**  So we know how to restore landscapes, basically.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:55):**  We know how you can restore ecosystem functioning.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:57):**  We know a lot more about how you can restore soils.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:00):**  But the tricky part is getting people to collaborate for longer periods of time.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:04):**  So we're working with a 20 year time frame minimum, which is basically one generation  
**[0:15:09-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:09):**  because an ecosystem needs that time to be able to regenerate and create a new stable  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:17):**  system basically.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:18):**  But the trick is to get people to work collaboratively on longer periods of time, because often we  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:24):**  speak different languages, we have different stakes.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:28):**  Sometimes the funding runs dry.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:29):**  So how do you engage into deeper relationship building between these stakeholders for longer  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:35):**  periods of time?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:36):**  And I'm realizing I'm going off on a rant, but I hope it's useful.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:40):**  So that's a second challenge.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:43):**  Maybe because I like the renting personally.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:46):**  Maybe then we can because you mentioned Tekla as well, and we can ask her her experience  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:51):**  as well.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:53):**  But in this bringing together multiple stakeholders and is there what is it?  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:59):**  Why is that difficult?  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:00):**  I mean, I have my ideas, but I would like to hear from your experience as well.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:04):**  Like, why is it so difficult to bridge?  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:11):**  I think because we're so used to compartmentalizing things.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:15):**  Either you are either active in a value chain or you are active in in your own role in the  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:22):**  municipality.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:23):**  So everything is very siloed.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:26):**  So breaking through those silos and thinking from what others might also need in that same  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:31):**  landscape or that same piece of land requires giving in a little bit and not just thinking  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:38):**  about your own stake.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:41):**  Also what's challenging is the long termism thing.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:44):**  So we are so used to projects three years, five years, if you're lucky.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:50):**  And of course, from a business perspective, that longer term is can be either the obvious  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:56):**  route or or your yeah, I don't know.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:58):**  Short term, long termism is interesting from a business perspective.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:02):**  But yeah, just sticking with it for a longer run.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:07):**  That's the challenging thing because we we have we don't have that horizon normally.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:12):**  We're so project oriented, short cycles, even in government.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:16):**  We have four year cycles of people being elected.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:20):**  And then once they know all about the topic and start to understand it.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:25):**  And I think it's a good thing.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:26):**  I mean, you don't want to have monopolies of, you know, politicians staying for too  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:30):**  long.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:31):**  But it does create this short termism.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:34):**  Does that help?  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:35):**  Yeah, yeah, it does.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:36):**  I have a bunch more questions.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:39):**  But maybe let's let's touch a few more people and then we can engage in a broader conversation.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:46):**  So maybe Tecla, Willem, I mentioned you already.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:49):**  Maybe you could introduce yourself briefly as well.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:52):**  And and and zoom in on a similar question, actually.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:57):**  What kind of problems do you see now?  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:00):**  I listen to the podcast you did with Kuhn today, actually.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:05):**  You're facing quite a lot of challenges in general, I think.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:07):**  But what are specific problems you also see that might be transferable to different contexts  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:12):**  as well?  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:15):**  Thanks, Bart.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:16):**  So, yeah, I'm Tecla and I am a co-founder of Grounded.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:23):**  It's an organization.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:24):**  We're actually based in South Africa and we work with farmers in Africa to help them switch  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:29):**  to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:31):**  And then we build businesses on the back of that, where we actually connect them to markets.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:40):**  In yeah, to answer and it's kind of I've been doing this now for about seven years and encountered  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:48):**  many challenges.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:49):**  I think maybe the first thing which I think is quite important to acknowledge is that  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:54):**  ultimately, regenerative agriculture is about farming with nature.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:01):**  And what we have been doing over the past, what, like 60 years or something is farming  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:08):**  against nature and more in a sort of linear.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:11):**  Yeah, I don't know how to actually describe it in English, but not with nature, but it's  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:19):**  a more linear approach where it's like, OK, this is a spray program for this particular  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:24):**  farm and you need to just execute this and then you're going to kill all the pests which  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:30):**  are on this land if you just follow exactly these steps.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:36):**  And this farming with nature requires a much deeper understanding of an entire system,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:43):**  which is actually specific to every single farm and every single circumstance where you  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:48):**  are.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:49):**  So it's maybe we need to all acknowledge that this is extremely hard to do.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:56):**  And in particular, if you take it to a landscape approach, which you already hinted on, which  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:01):**  makes this even more complex.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:05):**  So it's it's definitely not something which is easy.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:10):**  It's quite a beast.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:11):**  And therefore, it also takes more time to create the challenges.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:16):**  That's not to say that you cannot have like quick wins in the beginning and it's like  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:19):**  it is actually a lot that you can do relatively quickly and you'll see results.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:24):**  But it's also hard.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:26):**  So in the work that we do on the ground, there is just hurdle after hurdle after hurdle and  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:32):**  unknown after unknown after unknown.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:34):**  And I think it's important that as a community, we talk about those things because then we  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:40):**  can actually learn and progress, just like there has been a lot of science on the sort  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:46):**  of conventional agricultural system.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:49):**  We need a lot more knowledge sharing and science on the region system and not only saying this  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:57):**  is great, please give us money.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:01):**  And I think maybe two other angles that I can take like to build on what Kun was saying,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:08):**  like what are sort of venture opportunities?  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:11):**  If I look at it more in ground, we take more of a value chain approach.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:18):**  And I think there's quite a lot of focus on initiatives happening on a farm level.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:23):**  So farmers switching to regenerative.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:25):**  And there's also quite a lot happening on the brand side.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:28):**  So brands claiming that they're going to be regenerative.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:32):**  Where I see two sort of gaps is one is what happens before the farm.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:38):**  So where does this farmer actually get his or her inputs?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:42):**  This has been a major hurdle for us.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:44):**  So regenerative seeds, organically certified seeds, what kind of microbial applications  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:52):**  can you actually use?  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:55):**  Fungi that you want to actually grow, how you make the right kind of compost.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:00):**  So because farmers are used to actually getting consultants in who then sell them whatever  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:07):**  kind of fertilizer or spray programs.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:10):**  But in the regenerative system, they have to do something different.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:13):**  They still have to use inputs which they can often actually make themselves.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:18):**  But how to do that?  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:21):**  There's a big opportunity there, I think.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:25):**  And then there's also an opportunity, I think, between the farmer and the brand where this  
**[0:22:30-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:30):**  is a system, our food system is dominated by huge companies that pile all agricultural  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:38):**  commodities on one heap and then ship them and transport them and make sure that everything  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:43):**  tastes the same.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:45):**  Where there are massive opportunities, I think, to do this differently or to work from within  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:53):**  those companies to change them so that products which have been produced regeneratively can  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:59):**  also get to the brands that are looking for these ingredients.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:06):**  And then you can have more value transfer.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:08):**  Otherwise, you lose the value because everything just goes on the one heap and it's lost.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:14):**  This is an issue we are facing all the time.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:16):**  This is something we have to deal with.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:24):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:25):**  Super insightful already.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:26):**  Koen, maybe, I don't know if you want to respond.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:29):**  I have a few questions, but you're always...  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:31):**  I see actually Albert is asking just in terms of a bit of background, what kind of crops  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:36):**  are you dealing with in South Africa?  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:39):**  Just for people who have no idea what you're doing, just to give a bit of background when  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:43):**  you say ingredients, what do you mean?  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:46):**  We don't do fresh vegetables or something like that.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:49):**  We work with non-perishable high value crops.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:52):**  So we're in essential oils and seed and vegetable oils.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:55):**  So those are like pressed.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:58):**  And herbal tea and spices.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:02):**  We're not only in South Africa, also in Zambia and in Tanzania.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:06):**  So a lot of these crops go for export markets.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:12):**  And do you see the same issue that actually the Nestle person was discussing that issue  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:19):**  of as soon as you are applying regenerative approaches or practices, often farmers start  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:25):**  to grow different crops and obviously they need to find markets for the different crops.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:30):**  Is that something you're saying, okay, we're also buying your two other, three other crops,  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:35):**  even though the cash crop is honey bush or is et cetera?  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:38):**  Is that something you're figuring out how to buy the full rotation as a quote that I  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:42):**  think Dan Barber once quoted?  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:45):**  But is that something you're working on, something you're seeing, or is it getting way too complicated  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:49):**  because then you have to deal with three, four, five, in some cases six, seven, ten  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:53):**  crops.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:54):**  Yeah, what we try to do is build it on the back of what the farmers are already doing.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:58):**  And often actually the smallholder farmers that we're working with are already selling,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:03):**  they already have a range of different crops.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:05):**  So they'll have maybe some maize, maybe some spices, maybe some vegetables, and they'll  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:14):**  sell a lot of the stuff into local markets.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:17):**  And then we can help them capture a higher value for, for instance, these spices that  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:23):**  we can then actually export and get a premium for.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:29):**  So I think, yes, this is definitely key is you want to find product market combinations  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:35):**  for all these crops in the system.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:38):**  It's not something that necessarily we as Grounded are going to sit between the farmer  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:43):**  and the market for all of those things, because some of them they will actually be, ideally,  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:47):**  they will be able to sell them off themselves into local markets.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:50):**  Yeah, but it's definitely something you need to take into account.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:53):**  If you let them grow crops, which they can't sell themselves, it totally sucks, of course,  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:59):**  and they're super dependent.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:01):**  And they, yeah.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:02):**  It's a great bridge, actually.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:04):**  I see that Alfredo unmuted his video.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:07):**  I don't know how you say that.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:10):**  Switch this video on.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:11):**  Alfredo123, welcome.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:12):**  I know you're multitasking, very, very busy.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:15):**  Happy you're here.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:16):**  Can you talk a bit about that?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:17):**  Because that's in agroforestry systems.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:19):**  Obviously, you are dealing with multiple crops, especially as you're moving towards more  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:23):**  regenerative practices.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:24):**  What do you see at that, you'll be dealing with a cash crop like cocoa or cash crop like  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:30):**  coffee and then what do you do with the other crops?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:34):**  So thanks for having me and for inviting me.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:39):**  First of all, I would like to just jump in on what was just shared before answering your  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:48):**  question.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:49):**  And I think, and I second totally what was the analysis that was just done on the supply  
**[0:26:56-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:56):**  chain and on the opportunities that can be found beside the pure play, let's say investment  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:05):**  at the farm level or what the claims of the brands, especially on the organic agri inputs.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:12):**  I think that is an important opportunity.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:17):**  And us as 123, we created an incubator exactly for tackling these kind of challenges.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:23):**  And specifically, we are now launching an organic agri input management company.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:31):**  And regarding your question, so when we set up agroforestry systems in our farms, yes,  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:40):**  we do have our cash crop that is primarily either cocoa or coffee.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:47):**  But we do rely on this cash crop in pairing it with other crops that for us, the first  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:58):**  main reason is the climate resiliency of the farm.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:04):**  And also having the possibility of with these other multi cropping to have a more positive  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:18):**  and more profitable first cash crop.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:22):**  So let's make an example that probably everybody already knows, but cocoa trees grow well in  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:28):**  the shade.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:29):**  And so for achieving this result, we plant either coconut trees or native trees or bananas.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:41):**  And therefore, we enrich our product array on one side and on the other side, our cocoa  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:49):**  grows better.  
**[0:28:50-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:50):**  And then obviously, in the course of the growth of the farm and on the field, the cropping  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:03):**  system is managed and there's some changing and optimization.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:09):**  So yeah, and on what do we do with these other crops besides just having them in the shade  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:19):**  system and helping us with our, let's say, first crop?  
**[0:29:23-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:23):**  Well, a lot of our effort is now geared towards finding, well, and signing sustainable off  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:36):**  takes, off take agreements with these brands that are claiming to want to regenerative  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:43):**  agriculture sourced foods.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:46):**  And we've been able to do it, for example, for our bananas, we have a good contract with  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:52):**  a German supermarket chain.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:55):**  And we are now opening for, for example, coffee and coconut oil and all the byproducts of  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:00):**  these of these crops.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:03):**  So does that answer your question?  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:04):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:05):**  And I have a follow up question.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:09):**  First of all, can you just in one or two sentences, because I obviously realize we're talking  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:14):**  to the in crowd here.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:15):**  What is one, two, three?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:17):**  And then to briefly mention, because you said something very interesting on the incubator,  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:21):**  you're starting to build companies that are serving your farms.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:25):**  And so what have you, you've launched two companies so far, what are you and then what  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:29):**  are you missing on that side?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:30):**  Like, what would you love that somebody launches?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:32):**  Yes.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:33):**  Okay, so in a couple of words about what wants, what is one, two, three, one, two, three is  
**[0:30:40-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:40):**  an asset manager slash operator, German company that was founded in 2017.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:48):**  And so far, and it targets the management and funds for institutional investors.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:58):**  So our anchor investor is a group of German pension funds.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:02):**  And we together with them and other investors, we were successfully able to basically have  
**[0:31:14-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:14):**  more than $500 million committed to our agroforestry systems and the management of our farms and  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:24):**  forestry projects.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:26):**  More or less half of that is actually invested.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:31):**  And we focus on agroforestry systems, climate change mitigations, local communities and  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:41):**  social impact.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:42):**  And so we both start the farms from scratch with a greenfield approach.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:49):**  Our specialty is again, Coco in Latin America.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:53):**  And we have now 13 projects in seven countries, especially in Latin America.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:02):**  And we focus with projects at scale.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:06):**  So we do not usually do small farms, but we operate on significant scales, also because  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:16):**  of the nature of our investors.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:18):**  But we do also engage with smallholder farmers with programs around our big farms.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:25):**  And this is obviously a pure play regenerative agriculture and agroforestry investment or  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:31):**  strategy if you want to call it.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:34):**  And we soon realized that there was, as was shared before, a need for, let's call it the  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:44):**  value chain or the supply chain that goes around what is being done specifically on  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:50):**  the farms.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:52):**  And therefore we decided to launch this 1-2-3 Impact Incubator that so far has launched  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:00):**  two startups.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:01):**  One is a fertilization company that has already been successfully funded in the first year.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:09):**  And now it's tackling projects that need assistance in designing irrigation systems that bring  
**[0:33:21-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:21):**  a lot of efficiency to the farms and allow for the applications of input in the fertigation  
**[0:33:30-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:30):**  system and just as spraying or direct input.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:38):**  And the second one is instead an Agri inputs management advisor, let's call it like this.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:46):**  It wants to act as a one-stop shop for Agri inputs management.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:53):**  Usually again, we're starting from our experiences.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:57):**  So most of these ventures are born trying to give answers to, let's say, market failures  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:07):**  that we observe in our big farms.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:09):**  So usually they are tailored for large scale farming operations.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:16):**  And what we are trying to achieve with this one is instead helping these big farms and  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:20):**  big operations to switch to a more organic and regenerative agriculture approach.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:26):**  What we are looking for next, we identified more or less five major opportunities.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:33):**  Among these, there's definitely precision agriculture.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:36):**  So drones and GIS mapping.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:44):**  And this is probably one of the ventures that we are probably going to launch sooner than  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:49):**  others.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:50):**  And as well, data management and all this.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:53):**  But this is still far off for us at the moment.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:00):**  Thank you so much for that.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:01):**  Sorry, Bart.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:02):**  I went down a rabbit hole.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:03):**  That's good.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:06):**  Thank you also, Alfredo.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:09):**  Great to meet you.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:11):**  We haven't properly met.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:12):**  I've heard about you from Koen.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:15):**  I actually also want to get back a little bit to Tecla, what she was saying, because  
**[0:35:20-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:20):**  there were sort of three things that you said.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:23):**  The first one was about the knowledge sharing part.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:26):**  And I tend to hear that more often, I would say.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:29):**  So maybe the rest can chip in on that as well.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:33):**  And you say that there's a sort of a lack of knowledge sharing, or we should do it more  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:40):**  as well.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:41):**  Maybe you can get a bit more specific on your journey, in what moments you've done things  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:47):**  that you would have need.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:50):**  Well maybe experiences from others.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:52):**  And what would be also a good way to actually get that access, elaborate a little bit further  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:57):**  on what's missing there, and what we should deliver there.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:03):**  Yes, there's so much knowledge that you need if you do this, like if you actually do this  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:12):**  on the ground.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:15):**  I think maybe the first thing you need, like that I wish I would have known, is that it  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:20):**  is flipping hard.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:24):**  And that is, I think, something that is quite useful to know before you start.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:29):**  We were told that this was easy.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:32):**  Like I had read about it, and I'd seen all the nice movies, like from brown to green.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:37):**  And I thought, OK, this is fantastic.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:38):**  I'm going to actually just do this.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:41):**  But it turned out it's a little bit harder.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:43):**  You can go from brown to green, I noticed, quite quickly if you have good rain.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:48):**  But that's another, exactly.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:52):**  Sometimes that's actually a challenge.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:56):**  What's hard on a farm level, I think, is that what I hinted on already is you need, farmers  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:04):**  need to acquire a different kind of set of knowledge to be able to operate their farm  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:11):**  regeneratively.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:14):**  And so you need to look at the soil differently.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:17):**  You need to understand what kind of life there actually is in the soil.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:20):**  You need to analyse that.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:21):**  You need to then fix for things which are out of balance.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:24):**  So if there are too many nematodes, you need to find a way to fight that without killing  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:30):**  them all and killing all the other life in the soil.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:34):**  And it's those kinds of things which are actually very difficult.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:39):**  Or for instance, deciding what kind of cover crops are you going to actually plant.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:45):**  What does this particular piece of soil need in terms of nutrients?  
**[0:37:49-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:49):**  And then which crops can we grow here, given the soil and the water availability?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:58):**  And sometimes the land maybe floods or it's very dry or whatever, you know.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:03):**  So there is just a lot of knowledge that goes into actually doing this on a farm level.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:11):**  And I think then on the back of that, what is also really hard is that once you then  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:19):**  have all the farming elements right, you need to then get a product that you can get to  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:25):**  a market for which you need to have an entirely different kind of skill set.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:30):**  And especially if you have new products that you want to get into new markets, for instance,  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:34):**  that we did with essential oils, you need to understand how do I get a good quality  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:39):**  essential oil?  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:40):**  So you need to do product development tests, chemical analyses, whatever.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:47):**  And then you need to understand what are actually the requirements of the different buyers?  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:51):**  Who are these buyers?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:52):**  How can we access them, et cetera, which is a totally different kind of skill set.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:57):**  So there's just a lot of, yeah, I don't know if this kind of answers your question.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:02):**  Well, I think especially on the first part that you and maybe Willemijn, I'm not sure  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:06):**  if you've been involved, but you talk about what do you actually need to do?  
**[0:39:11-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:11):**  And I think ComaLand actually build a sort of a toolkit that you can sort of say what  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:18):**  kind of conditions you are, what kind of context you are, and you can roughly get some information  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:24):**  on, for example, cover crops and what to work with.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:28):**  So on the one hand, I see sort of twofold thing and maybe someone else can chip in on  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:32):**  this or maybe Willemijn, but on the one hand, it's like almost Google it.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:37):**  Like is there an information center?  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:39):**  If I understand you correctly, on the other hand, it also relates to, and I saw some questions  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:43):**  coming in as well, like the actual experts or the independent agronomists or people that  
**[0:39:48-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:48):**  can actually help you and maybe also help you on that input side.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:56):**  And both of these challenges, is that a correct read?  
**[0:40:00-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:00):**  Like that you need both of them, like the expert, but also the knowledge database that  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:07):**  you can use?  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:09):**  So I shared a link to a short story, which was called the six biggest lessons learned  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:14):**  on regenerative agriculture, which is basically us trying to capture the knowledge in the  
**[0:40:18-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:18):**  network of partners like Grounded, similar in other countries, and how they've, yeah,  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:25):**  what they've picked up on the road to regenerative agriculture as part of a landscape initiative,  
**[0:40:30-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:30):**  basically.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:31):**  And one thing that we found was that there's a huge science practice gap.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:36):**  So like you mentioned, there's a lot of research backing conventional agriculture up, but there's  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:40):**  no equivalent amount backing regenerative up.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:45):**  Of course, you can look at agro ecological research, there's probably more there, but  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:49):**  still, it's a huge gap.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:50):**  And also, there's a mismatch of if, if let's say you were to pilot with a group of farmers,  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:57):**  different practices, then it's hard to find a scientist that can deal with that level  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:04):**  of complexity, because you're not just looking at two or three elements, you're looking at  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:08):**  a whole system.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:09):**  So that also, so that was one big thing in terms of knowledge gap.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:13):**  And there was another one.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:17):**  So interestingly, we saw that farmer centric networks kind of were the way to go.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:23):**  And farmers to exchange with each other, they're also they have a lot of knowledge already.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:28):**  But just being able to experiment together, and share knowledge about that visit each  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:34):**  other's farms frequently invite expert speakers that can help you along that sort of learning  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:39):**  journey you're on, because once you understand this, you also want to understand that and  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:43):**  then you want to understand that.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:44):**  So it's like, it never stops, but you just need to pull in the right people at the right  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:49):**  time in that farmer centric network kind of.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:54):**  So that's from a sort of a helicopter view.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:56):**  That's what I saw happening.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:00):**  And yeah, so the tool you mentioned, so we're trying to develop a couple of sort of, yeah,  
**[0:42:08-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:08):**  general tools that can help sort of move towards that holistic thinking towards, for example,  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:15):**  your regenerative business.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:16):**  We have one tool where you can look at your farm or estate if you have one from a sort  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:23):**  of for a transfer perspective.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:25):**  So what are the sort of things you can take into account when you look at your farm?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:29):**  We also have another tool, a business model canvas, just old school, like old school business  
**[0:42:35-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:35):**  model canvas, but then yeah, sort of twisted a little bit more towards a holistic view  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:39):**  and taking a landscape also into account.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:44):**  But it's no means perfect, but it's just us trying to sort of pin it down and make it  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:49):**  tangible.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:50):**  But feedback is always welcome.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:56):**  Thank you, Willemijn.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:58):**  We also got a bunch of questions in the chat, Koen, if you want me to unpack them very quickly.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:05):**  The first one I think of Chris is, it's a very good question.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:09):**  Why are we not, why are organizations we know not doing 20 million, but a billion, et cetera?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:15):**  I had a discussion on that yesterday.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:18):**  My feeling is we're too early where we don't have the proof of concept like Willemijn is  
**[0:43:23-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:23):**  sharing at a landscape level, at hundreds of farms, doing all kinds of different products  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:30):**  at a scale that we can get a billion dollars or more or a lot of money, let's say, because  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:35):**  for that you need institutional investors and they need to see a long track record.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:38):**  The first investments in renewable energy or renewable energies were also not institutional  
**[0:43:43-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:43):**  investors.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:44):**  They were absolutely subsidized based, but still it was a slow start before we got to  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:48):**  the level where we are now.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:50):**  So my feeling is really we're going to see these examples being built over the next years  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:54):**  and all of us will probably feel like they're too small, but they are already thinking about  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:59):**  the next fund or they are thinking about their next 10x time, what their need to raise to  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:03):**  really make a dent in the Midwest, talking about agriculture.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:07):**  But we're still figuring out the recipes.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:08):**  We're still figuring out really we're so early on, like we have to take this as the whole  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:13):**  value chain or the whole value web has to be redesigned and be figured out in terms  
**[0:44:17-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:17):**  of ingredients, in terms of expertise and coming to a question of Paul, farmer consultants,  
**[0:44:22-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:22):**  it really depends who pays them.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:24):**  If the input companies pay them, we know what kind of advice they give.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:27):**  And so that's a whole other business opportunity in terms of education for farmers.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:33):**  Very tricky, very difficult, but there's a huge need to have independent farmer consultants.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:39):**  So Capital is working on it.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:40):**  Others are working on it.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:41):**  We need to be able to make sure that farmers have an independent advice that they can trust  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:47):**  that is not sold to them by an input company.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:50):**  Because if the incentives are aligned like that, we know what happens.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:52):**  Just like Shell is going to tell you, we're going to help save petrol, which obviously  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:55):**  we all know is not going to happen, which is not because they're bad, it's just because  
**[0:44:59-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:59):**  their business model is different.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:01):**  So I feel we're really early on.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:03):**  We should really crawl before we're going to run or we're going to stand.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:07):**  And we are in the crawling phase, in many phases, in many other places, not necessarily,  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:10):**  but as a system, as a movement, we're super, super, super early.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:15):**  And we just don't have, we cannot point the two, three things that are already raised.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:18):**  A lot of money have huge successes or huge acreage, et cetera.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:22):**  Like New Foundation Farm still has to start and they're raising now as we speak.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:26):**  And they're only raising only because it's a lot of money, but 20 million.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:30):**  Perennial we all see as a huge success, but they only raised 10.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:35):**  And so it's really, we have to build the foundations first and these are potentially pieces of  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:40):**  the foundation.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:41):**  So I hope that answers it.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:43):**  Alice, I saw a question on the cultural and socioeconomic.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:48):**  Access is an enormous question.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:49):**  Like how do we make sure this is not again, another elite game like many of the other  
**[0:45:54-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:54):**  food movements have been, farm to table, organic in many examples, et cetera.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:00):**  How we're going to do that without some extra flow of capital in terms of subsidies or it's  
**[0:46:06-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:06):**  going to be very, very tricky.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:07):**  I hope we're going to move the food discussion to medicine.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:10):**  And then suddenly we open up a whole different discussion in terms of insurance, in terms  
**[0:46:14-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:14):**  of what, what am I willing to spend on health and not just on feeding myself, but that's  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:18):**  a long, long walk we need to do there.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:21):**  So I don't know the easy answer there at the moment.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:24):**  It's a, it's not as accessible as it should be.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:26):**  And cheap calories and processed calories are way more accessible.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:29):**  So that that's very difficult.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:32):**  And there also, there's a huge etiquette, like we are what we eat literally.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:38):**  But most people are a lot of people don't see it.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:40):**  If you see what a lot of people throw in their supermarket basket, when you, when you are  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:44):**  at your local supermarket, you'll be shocked or you are shocked probably because most of  
**[0:46:47-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:47):**  it is simply not food.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:49):**  I mean, Nestle did an internal research which came out unfortunately for them in the financial  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:54):**  time, I'll put a link below that 65% of their products can never be claimed healthy.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:59):**  And so they have huge issues of with the new supermarket, with the new traffic light system  
**[0:47:04-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:04):**  of is it green or not?  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:06):**  Like can it be named healthy in France and Australia?  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:08):**  They're already doing that.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:09):**  Most of our products are simply too salty and too sweet.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:13):**  And so they know that, but how are you going to change a behemoth like that doing, I checked  
**[0:47:17-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:17):**  it yesterday, 93 billion a year.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:19):**  So it's, that's a very, I mean, cheap calories are cheap and not very cheap if you take into  
**[0:47:25-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:25):**  of course, true cost accounting could potentially fix some of that.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:29):**  But that's a, it's a very difficult one.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:30):**  How do we keep this accessible to all, especially to the people that need it most that are eating  
**[0:47:36-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:36):**  the worst food at the moment.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:37):**  And we, because we potentially all here on the call are already shopping locally, are  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:41):**  already making choices differently.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:43):**  So there's not too much to win honestly when you look at us.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:47):**  Maybe I can chip in there.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:48):**  But I think on a farmer level, that's I think relevant to think about, cause I think most  
**[0:47:53-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:53):**  of the pioneering examples that you see on regenerative farms that get everything right  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:00):**  are people that also had the cash to spend.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:05):**  And this is something which is very frustrating for some of the farmers that we've been working  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:09):**  with because then you point them to those examples.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:12):**  You say, look, you can hear it's possible.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:14):**  And then they're like, yeah, okay.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:15):**  But this guy had a shitload of money and that's how he made it possible.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:19):**  You know?  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:21):**  So it's those examples can be inspiring to outsiders, but they can be super frustrating  
**[0:48:27-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:27):**  and actually off putting to farmers who are just common farmers and who have to make ends  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:33):**  meet and are like, yeah, but that's just unattainable for me.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:37):**  So then you have to go like smaller steps, things which are immediately interesting to  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:42):**  them, like reducing input costs by making their own compost tea, for instance, which  
**[0:48:47-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:47):**  immediately can fertilize their crops and they can see the results.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:50):**  So those are things that we are also working on.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:53):**  It's like, how can you make this transition affordable to farmers who have very little  
**[0:48:59-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:59):**  to spend without having to always resort to massive subsidies, for instance?  
**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:06):**  I think that's a very exciting thing to think about.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:09):**  How can you make this show a poor farmer that a small investment can lead to an immediate  
**[0:49:15-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:15):**  return?  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:16):**  Which I think is possible in some cases, like maybe not for the full transition, but in  
**[0:49:21-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:21):**  many cases, I think you can actually do things there as well.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:24):**  Yeah, thank you both.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:27):**  Thank you.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:28):**  We have a bunch of more questions, but maybe, I don't know, Alice or Chris could answer  
**[0:49:34-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:34):**  your questions.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:35):**  I'm not sure if any of you wants to respond or has additional questions.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:42):**  Well, I would jump in.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:45):**  Yeah, I would ask, I want to poke around, Khun, your thoughts on new foundation farms  
**[0:49:51-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:51):**  related also to what Tekla said about having a lot of money and being able to put into  
**[0:49:59-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:59):**  a farm this decent amount of capital and then wanting to showcase or demonstrate regenerative  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:05):**  agriculture as the way to go for other farmers to copy in a nearby location.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:11):**  Is there, do you see evidence of that or do you see potential challenges there?  
**[0:50:15-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:15):**  I'd also like to, if possible, briefly hear a little bit from Tekla about some of the  
**[0:50:20-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:20):**  more specific challenges that you face, whether it's expanding the amount of farmers that  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:26):**  you're working with or expanding to another geographical location, the specific things  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:32):**  that are really bottlenecks for you in that context.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:35):**  You want to go first, Tekla?  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:39):**  No, you can go.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:41):**  So on new foundation farms, just for anybody who doesn't know, they are raising 20 million,  
**[0:50:46-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:46):**  buying a thousand acres in the UK, potentially scaling that a number of times and being a  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:52):**  fully regenerative, fully integrated regenerative food enterprise, agri-food enterprises, they  
**[0:50:57-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:57):**  call it.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:58):**  And we're following them with the podcast because I find them extremely ambitious, a  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:02):**  very interesting team and doing things very differently, like Chris is saying.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:07):**  And I'm interested because they do things at a certain scale or they are going to try  
**[0:51:11-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:11):**  to do things at a certain scale, which maybe unlocks certain things that we, that an individual  
**[0:51:15-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:15):**  farmer can't, meaning building a proper food brand, selling it to the city, having a farm  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:21):**  shop that operates year round and actually drives a lot of the value back to the land,  
**[0:51:26-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:26):**  having more than a hundred people on staff and operating at a scale that there is an  
**[0:51:31-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:31):**  economy of scale, like let's not deny that.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:34):**  It's a very different thing, obviously, because they start with a sort of clean slate.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:37):**  They will buy the land, they can do whatever they want with that.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:39):**  They will never sell it.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:41):**  So they have a very long term, at least plan.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:44):**  Let's see what they will be following that.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:46):**  So I'm very curious about that because it shows a different operating system or different  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:50):**  model at a different scale that according to them makes sense in the UK, very context  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:56):**  specific, obviously.  
**[0:51:57-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:57):**  So let's see.  
**[0:51:58-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:58):**  I don't know.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:59):**  I think once you have that brand standing, you can sell a lot of the food through the  
**[0:52:03-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:03):**  food brand and proper marketing, proper design.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:06):**  If you see their data room, they thought about this a lot and they have a lot of experience  
**[0:52:10-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:10):**  with selling food.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:12):**  I think you can absorb a lot of other food from the area, from farmers that are nearby  
**[0:52:16-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:16):**  and make this transition a lot easier for people that don't want to, like I said in  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:19):**  the chat, every farmer needs a market that don't want to set up their own food brand,  
**[0:52:24-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:24):**  that don't necessarily want to do that because you don't want to wear 15 different hats and  
**[0:52:30-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:30):**  they want to have access to the best technology that you can have if you share it with a major  
**[0:52:35-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:35):**  hub like that.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:36):**  So I think if you offer a good market and have a good sense of the quality and the regenerative  
**[0:52:42-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:42):**  practices, then this could be very interesting, could fail completely in a couple of years  
**[0:52:46-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:46):**  and we look back like this was really, this was a bad shot.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:50):**  But I think we need to be ambitious.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:51):**  We need to be bold in the current times.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:53):**  We need to question a lot of things about agriculture and one of them is the single  
**[0:52:56-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:56):**  family farm with a small farm shop and we all hope that that will save the world because  
**[0:53:01-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:01):**  I think there are a lot of issues with that.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:03):**  So we need professional organizations and companies as well running some of these and  
**[0:53:08-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:08):**  so let's see where they get.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:10):**  Yeah, I will go quickly.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:14):**  I think on the model, the model farm thing and then having other farmers copy that is  
**[0:53:22-0:53:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:22):**  I think very often challenging because in the model farm you, like I just mentioned,  
**[0:53:26-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:26):**  you then invest a lot of resources and then for the other farmers surrounding that farm  
**[0:53:31-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:31):**  can sometimes be difficult to get to that.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:35):**  So that's one comment.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:38):**  In terms of barriers to scale for Grounded, for us the success in our model lies in making  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:47):**  it successful for the farmers because that will allow us to scale.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:51):**  So if we can make this work financially for farmers that we work with, then we can also  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:55):**  scale and barriers there.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:00):**  I think there are two which we are now addressing.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:03):**  One is money because you often need to have some kind of capital to get this whole thing  
**[0:54:09-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:09):**  started.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:11):**  So we're looking at raising our own fund within Grounded to be able to scale more rapidly  
**[0:54:19-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:19):**  and have a little bit more leeway that we can actually choose areas which we think are  
**[0:54:23-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:23):**  interesting and get started.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:26):**  And the other thing is market access and for that we are an access to the right kind of  
**[0:54:33-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:33):**  market and for that we are launching a platform hopefully next week which is geared towards  
**[0:54:41-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:41):**  giving regenerative suppliers access to niche brands.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:47):**  So kind of bridging that gap that I was talking about earlier, we're looking for regeneratively  
**[0:54:52-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:52):**  produced ingredients and then hopefully getting those suppliers a better price.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:59):**  And that will hopefully also allow us to scale more rapidly because then we can onboard all  
**[0:55:05-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:05):**  kinds of different suppliers who we can then provide support to get better at regenerative  
**[0:55:11-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:11):**  agriculture.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:12):**  So we see that market link as a sort of scaling mechanism so we can reach many more suppliers  
**[0:55:20-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:20):**  than we are currently doing.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:21):**  Nice, thanks for that.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:23):**  By the way that's very exciting, two nice initiatives that you're kind of folding into  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:28):**  that.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:29):**  I'm looking forward to see that platform.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:30):**  I wish you guys the best.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:33):**  Yes we're crunching at the moment.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:35):**  Well not me as you can see but my colleagues.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:39):**  All right, thank you Tecla.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:45):**  We're also almost already at the end, it's a one hour conversation.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:50):**  We're going to do this way more often and maybe zoom in on the specific parts of what  
**[0:55:54-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:54):**  we addressed today even to get a little bit more detail.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:59):**  Maybe Daniel to mention you, Kun, you responded.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:04):**  Well you mentioned, if I say your name right Daniel, Cezano, correct me please.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:12):**  You mentioned a few things, maybe it's a good closing remark as well because you just you  
**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:17):**  mentioned a few ideas that you think are going to be relevant in the space and maybe Kun  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:22):**  you can respond on it as a final remark.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:26):**  So well basically just present myself, I'm Daniel Cezano, founder of Adapta, it's a  
**[0:56:31-0:56:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:31):**  startup that works in Brazil on regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:35):**  I currently have joined the IDB, the Inter-American Development Bank.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:38):**  I'm helping them invest part of their fund in a larger portfolio on regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:46):**  We're creating a green hub to invest basically with the best, largest multinational companies  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:55):**  in Latin America in regenerative agriculture and I'm also a farmer.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:00):**  So I'm on a small farm here in Rio de Janeiro.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:07):**  What I see is that a lot of people usually they talk about transitional finance but for  
**[0:57:12-0:57:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:12):**  me this is a second bit, is a key.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:16):**  If you don't have a system to manage the transition at scale then you cannot have transitional  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:23):**  finance because transitional finance is a scale issue.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:28):**  And then we have companies like 1 to 3 that they actually have the expertise in the whole  
**[0:57:34-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:34):**  house that they've developed their own system.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:36):**  But how many companies do we need to create to develop this sort of system?  
**[0:57:41-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:41):**  So I think that developing a mechanism, a clear mechanism that tries these processes  
**[0:57:49-0:57:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:49):**  and manages the transition at scale that will be actually very important because when you  
**[0:57:52-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:52):**  do that you start collecting data and then you're going to have artificial intelligence  
**[0:57:57-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:57):**  and then you're going to have all the satellite data with carbon.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:01):**  Our regional network is doing a great thing with satellite images for monitoring carbon  
**[0:58:07-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:07):**  which can be linked to blockchain.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:10):**  You can have traceable products with traceable impacts and ultimately we can up with a marketplace  
**[0:58:17-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:17):**  online platform that eventually can substitute current trading structures.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:24):**  You can actually, in my opinion, that's where we have to go.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:28):**  Create trading mechanisms large scale that are going to sell tradable products with tradable  
**[0:58:35-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:35):**  impacts.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:36):**  And I think that's when we're actually going to start working at the landscape level.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:40):**  So this should be my take on how I actually see the market evolving.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:45):**  Thank you Daniela, good to see you.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:50):**  I think we're on top of the, not on top of the hour, on the bottom of the hour so I'd  
**[0:58:53-0:58:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:53):**  rather give it back to you.  
**[0:58:55-0:58:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:55):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:58:56-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:56):**  I see there's a lot to be built here.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:58):**  Almost every piece of the value chain has to be, value web has to be rebuilt so we better  
**[0:59:02-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:02):**  get to work.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:04):**  I think so as well.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:05):**  I'm going to wrap it up for today.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:09):**  First of all, thank you very much all for coming.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:11):**  As I said in the beginning, we recorded the session so I will follow up with all of you.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:17):**  I'll try to capture some of the links in this chat as well, make sure that that is in an  
**[0:59:20-0:59:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:20):**  email together with the registration so you can watch it again.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:27):**  We are currently with Fresh working hard on this mission, trying to get more teams working  
**[0:59:33-0:59:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:33):**  on these challenges.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:34):**  So if you know people who want to work in this space, especially we are starting up  
**[0:59:41-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:41):**  a cohort at the end of this year trying to build these new organizations.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:45):**  So also on the input side like ideas or problems that you run into, but especially on the talent  
**[0:59:52-0:59:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:52):**  side currently we are very much open for people that want to build new ventures in this space.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:58):**  So yeah, please share.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:03):**  We will have a next event actually on the 7th of July, which is a Fresh Talks around  
**[1:00:09-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:09):**  a similar subject that we will invite probably three different pioneers in this space to  
**[1:00:15-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:15):**  tell more on a specific use case that we can dive into.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:19):**  This is more of an open conversation and probably Koen and I will host another conversation  
**[1:00:25-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:25):**  like this at the end of July.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:30):**  Let's see how it goes.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:31):**  If you have any ideas on maybe a more focused discussion or topics that you would like to  
**[1:00:35-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:35):**  get into in this conversation arena, I would say, or you would like to have some speaking  
**[1:00:40-1:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:40):**  time, please reach out to us.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:43):**  You can either email me or do it via LinkedIn.  
**[1:00:47-1:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:47):**  But yeah, let's get this conversation going.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:50):**  I think there's a lot more than we could cover today.  
**[1:00:53-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:53):**  And especially also thanks for Willemijn and Tecla for being here and sharing your story.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:00):**  So thank you very much.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:02):**  And I hope to see you the 7th of July.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:07):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:01:12-1:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:12):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:01:16-1:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:16):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:20):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:01:22-1:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:22):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:01:26-1:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:26):**  to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:01:31-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:31):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:36):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:01:38-1:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:38):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[1:01:41-1:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:41):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[1:01:43-1:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:43):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[1:01:46-1:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:46):**  What questions should you ask?  
**[1:01:47-1:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:47):**  What is happening in the space?  
**[1:01:48-1:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:48):**  What should you read?  
**[1:01:49-1:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:49):**  What should you listen?  
**[1:01:51-1:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:51):**  What should you watch?  
**[1:01:52-1:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:52):**  How to approach this space?

**[1:01:56-1:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:56):**  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[1:02:00-1:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:00):**  the space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform  
**[1:02:06-1:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:06):**  builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line designers,  
**[1:02:10-1:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:10):**  holistic management consultants, etc.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:13):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:16):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:02:19-1:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:19):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[1:02:29-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:29):**  No.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:30):**  It is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:33):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:36):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[1:02:41-1:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:41):**  different means.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:42):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:02:47-1:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:47):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:50):**  Thank you.  
**[1:02:51-1:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:51):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:02:52-1:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:52):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:02:59-1:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:59):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:01):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:03:06-1:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:06):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:03:11-1:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:11):**  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[1:03:15-1:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:15):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:17):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:03:22-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:22):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:26):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:31):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:03:32-1:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:32):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:34):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:36):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:40):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:42):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:47):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:13):**  It seems so idyllic.  Selling your apartment in London, quitting your well-paid jobs and buying 10 acres in  wells to farm.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:20):**  Back to the land, the good life, the simple life.  Until you get punched in the face.  Again, again and again.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:28):**  Farming isn't easy, let alone profitably and ecologically sound on a small scale.  Don't let anybody tell you differently.  Today's story unpacks one of those examples which after 7 years of regen farming might  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:40):**  go bankrupt this month.  Learn all about duck eggs, feed prices, black soldier flies, vermi compost, back to the  land and if they make it through the winter, how they are planning to dramatically change  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:52):**  their business and scale their impact.  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:06):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:19):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:31):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  To make it easy for fans to support our work we launched our membership community and so  many of you have joined us as a member.

**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:03):**  Welcome to another episode today with Josh of Park Carrick.  Welcome Josh, we're going to talk a lot about the current emergency but also want to know  a lot about duck eggs, geese eggs and what brings you to start a farm in Wales.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:15):**  So welcome to the podcast.  Thanks Ken, it's really great to be here.  And let's start I will put a beautiful video which is sort of a bit outdated now but still  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:27):**  very very pretty in the show notes below if you want to see a visual overview of the farm  you and your partner are running.  But just to give a bit of an intro, because you didn't grow up in farming, what brought  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:39):**  you to literally what brought you to the land and start to start a farm and then we'll get  into recording this at the end of October 2022.  And we'll get into the current situation and what you're doing about it and why you are  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:53):**  in an emergency.  Yeah thanks Ken.  Well I'm actually South African and Abby my partner she's British and before we before  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:06):**  we moved back and moved to the land we were living and working in London.  And we were there for eight years working in the city.  I was working in tech, in mobile software actually.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:20):**  And we I think after eight years in London we just got incredibly itchy.  You know like I started wanting to get outside.  I'm from as I mentioned from Cape Town South Africa.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:34):**  So I grew up in a very beautiful place.  And are you suggesting that London isn't very beautiful?  You know it's a bit of a concrete jungle and like it was super exciting when I first got  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:47):**  there you know the bright lights and everything.  But after about eight years there we really started craving you know wanting to get out  of the office wanting to get outside.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:03):**  And just having a long time like eight years is a proper.  Yeah it was definitely the shiny lights were nice for that's a considerable amount of your  career and your time.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:15):**  Yeah it was a it was a slog but I you know it was hard work.  But I and I did really enjoy it.  I worked with some amazing people in London.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:28):**  But you know it was something about being in a city with all those you know the constant  noise the sirens the bright lights the being in an office and air conditioned space with  not much fresh air.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:40):**  And it just I think I think I over the years I got quite a lot of anxiety being in that  environment.  I wanted to get outside.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:50):**  I wanted to do something with my hands.  I wanted to be more physically active.  I felt unhealthy.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:57):**  I didn't feel like I ever had time to do any physical exercise or anything.  So one day we just made this like really brash decision.  We're like you know what we're just we're just going to we're going to sell our little  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:10):**  flat in London.  We're going to quit our jobs and we're going to go and start a farm.  And it was like we had no idea what we were about to get into.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:20):**  And what do you remember what triggered that.  I mean I know people have seen the biggest little farm but I don't think it was out there  yet or maybe it was and said they were going to do it.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:30):**  But then the next day reality kicked in and they didn't sell their flat in London and  they didn't quit their jobs and their lives basically.  And you did.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:37):**  Was it like it was a very rainy I don't know February very cold or was it something like  what was their specific moment or what led up to it and then what made you actually do  it?  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:48):**  There were a few things.  One was health issues.  Like both of us were experiencing health problems and I had gotten really far down the rabbit  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:59):**  hole of diet and came to the conclusion that I needed to actually be more involved in my  own food production in order to ensure that I was eating healthy nutrient dense food.  And actually I see a lot of a lot of people with a similar motivation in the space.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:15):**  So that was one reason.  The other reason was I had this constant impending sense of doom like you know the world is about  to come to an end and I think a lot of that was just anxiety from living in the city.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:31):**  And I felt helpless.  I felt helpless about you know the climate disaster that's coming.  And I'm not someone who likes to when I feel worried about something I really want to get  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:49):**  up and go and do something about it.  Like I can't stand talking about stuff.  And so you know agriculture is a huge issue and a contributor to climate change.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:01):**  And I really felt like I wanted to get out there and just have a go and just see if I  could actively do something that might you know help make the world a better place one  day.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:15):**  And then the last contributing factor to us actually getting up and going and doing it  was I actually started working from home on the last project that I was doing.  I left the company that I was working for and I started consulting and freelancing working  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:32):**  from home.  And the experience of working from home and having my own free time and space to think  really just I think it just tipped me over the edge into wanting to sort of detach myself  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:50):**  from corporate life.  And I think it's funny because a lot of people have gone through something similar in recent  times with COVID when everyone was sort of forced to go back home and to start working  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:03):**  from home.  So reconsidering home like oh actually yeah it's not just a place I sleep I should probably  do something.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:12):**  It was a very powerful experience.  You know all my meals were home cooked.  I was no longer going down to the local shop to go and get a sandwich to suddenly just  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:22):**  scoff down in front of my computer whilst I was banging out an email.  You know I was actually like going and preparing a meal for lunch and it was just.  And they're still eating it at your computer but yeah that was a big thing.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:33):**  Yeah sometimes yeah.  But it's a powerful process and I think a lot of people have experienced the same thing  and really reevaluated where they're at in their life and a lot of people have made some  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:43):**  pretty big decisions as a result of it.  So yeah so that was that was the thing that one of the things that tipped us over the  edge.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:54):**  So Toby and I had always talked about having a farm one day and the idea was we were going  to go and you know do something in the city get rich retire buy a farm and you know enjoy  our lives.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:09):**  And we talked a lot about this and exactly and I was sitting in a London bus one day  and coming home from work and another bus sort of passed and there was this big ad on  the bus.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:24):**  I don't remember what the brand was or who the ad was for but it just had this line start  where you want to go.  And I was like why do we want to.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:35):**  And people say advertisement doesn't have impact.  Yeah well it had a huge impact on me but unfortunately I don't think it increased sales for them  very much because I can't even remember what the brand was but I thought about that statement  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:48):**  start where you want to go.  And I was like why do you want to wait until you are possibly 60 years old and about and  retired probably not as fit and active as you are now.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:02):**  Why do you want to wait until then to start farming.  If you really want to farm and you want to work outside and you want to enjoy that lifestyle  then enjoy it while you're young and while you're still physically capable of doing it.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:14):**  So I was like OK right.  How do we actually do this.  Like could we actually could we actually sell our home and buy a farm.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:21):**  How would we make this happen.  So it was and from there the process started basically.  And I mean there's so much to unpack there and I want to get to the emergency but just  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:30):**  as a sidestep for a second.  At that moment did you make it deliberate or was it always part of the plan to farm  not just as a homestead for yourself.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:41):**  You were talking a lot about of course the challenge of getting access to or more involved  in your own food.  But there's a difference between your own food and food for others.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:51):**  Like was that from the beginning of it.  OK we need this.  It's not that I'm going to keep working maybe remotely or freelance for a day a week.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:01):**  And with that we keep we keep things going and the farm is mostly as a homestead for  our own food.  Or was it from the beginning the plan to actually farm and live off the farm as well in terms  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:13):**  of economically.  Yeah it's a good question.  Actually it started off with the idea of going off grid and some of my colleagues if they're  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:21):**  my old colleagues if they're listening to this they'll remember I had this idea to actually  create like a space for digital nomads to go off and come and work on an off grid farm  and that was going to be it is mostly going to be about self-sufficiency being off grid  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:41):**  and you know providing a space for people to escape to.  It's still connected to the fiber of the cable.  That created…  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:48):**  Connected to all the fiber and connected to my old digital you know my digital addictions.  And so it did start off there and then of course we got into permaculture hugely and  we got into self-sufficiency and that whole you know that whole area.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:07):**  But we very quickly as things sort of unraveled and as we started pursuing it we very quickly  realized that okay we need to figure out how we're going to make a living doing this realistically  for long reasons.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:22):**  I won't get into this too much but basically we were going to go to Spain because we thought  that's the only place we could afford to buy land.  And then Abby actually got diagnosed with MS and it was a massive shock.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:35):**  It was literally as we left London we had our camper van, we had all of our stuff in  storage we're on our journey about to go and find some land and go off to Spain and then  boom Abby's legs started getting numb and it was like that's weird what's going on?  
**[0:12:52-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:52):**  And long story short we ended up in the hospital and we ended up with a diagnosis of MS.  And we were just like how are we going to go off to Spain and start this thing away  from family away from the NHS you know when Abby's potentially got this like completely  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:11):**  debilitating disease moving forward.  So without going too much down that rabbit hole.  The camper never went on the ferry.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:20):**  Yeah we decided let's stay in the UK let's stay close to family let's try and figure  out how to do this in the UK although it is expensive.  I mean close to family you're from South Africa but yeah that's never going to be close to  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:31):**  family.  Should I say yeah close to Abby's family yeah.  So Wales it became very different climate yeah.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:40):**  And Wales it became yeah.  So we weren't going to do the digital nomad thing in Spain but then we just were like  well how are we going to make money doing this?  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:50):**  Well if you've got land you can be farmers okay cool.  And also we felt this immense responsibility as potentially future landowners people who  are sitting on agricultural land.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:03):**  We felt this immense responsibility to actually be more than just self-sufficient but to be  actual producers and food producers.  To feed the city yeah.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:12):**  And feed people because you know when you take this idea of self-sufficiency you can't  scale that up it doesn't work.  You can't give everybody a 10-20 acre plot of land and tell them to be self-sufficient  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:25):**  it doesn't work.  So we felt it was our responsibility.  Some dreams of listeners have been shattered now.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:31):**  No I don't think anybody listening to this is in that matter.  But yeah no that's physically geography and probably mentally not a good idea to do that  with everyone.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:42):**  Yeah it doesn't work when you scale it up.  So that very quickly led us on to regenerative agriculture.  So we went from sort of permaculture to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:54):**  And when you say we went from what are I wouldn't say the big differences but what do you say  what in your mind is that step from permaculture to to the region?  Why is that a step and why is not is it not the same thing?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:10):**  Yeah it's not the I don't see it as the same thing because you know I love the design principles  in permaculture and I think you can apply them to not just all forms of agriculture  but you know many aspects of life actually.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:28):**  But when you go and look at the permaculture influences or content out there it is generally  much smaller scale more focused on self-sufficiency and it's not really focused on productive  large scale food production.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:47):**  So you know things are very much they're not in need rows they're not in an organized fashion  they're not designed necessarily for commercial production or efficiency so I mean you can  you can translate it into that form but most of the influences in space.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:10):**  So let's say the current the current examples we see mostly I'm going to get emails about  this for sure are the smaller scale homesteading not necessarily commercial scale.  That doesn't mean it cannot be done but we just haven't seen it yet it hasn't been hasn't  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:27):**  formed in that way or expressed itself in that way let's say.  So yeah and so you went to we need to feed people so we need a you know we need to be  farming and then how did you land on I mean you landed on a number of acres probably because  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:44):**  you could afford them and then the journey into and then I promise we'll get into the  emergency but also we're still back here but how did you land in the current form let's  say of the of the farm and yeah what we're now at the end of October what emergency are  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:59):**  you in?  Well without going into too much detail about why we chose Wales we we ended up in Wales  and we were keen to start you know we were like actually we what's quite unique about  
**[0:17:13-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:13):**  what we did and possibly a bit stupid is we didn't go and do any we didn't really go and  do any courses we did one very little permaculture course which to be honest it doesn't really  apply to what we've actually ended up doing but we didn't go and volunteer on any farms  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:34):**  we didn't go roofing we didn't we didn't go and do any real workshops or education or  courses or anything like that.  We had read lots of books we had watched all the YouTube videos I mean you could call us  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:48):**  YouTube farmers.  There's a there's a difference and I see in my notes because Josh and some nice notes  over the steepest learning curve in the world like I want to know about that.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:58):**  Yeah yeah I mean it was an immense learning curve and so we we just jumped straight in  we ended up in Wales we pretty much we the first place we looked at happened to be great  I mean it's not like it was a mistake purchase it was a great purchase but it was the first  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:14):**  place we looked at and we bought it we just said okay we're going to start.  And we were actually going to try and get planning permission to build a home an eco  home on the land which is very difficult to do because it's agricultural land but we decided  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:34):**  that we didn't want to get distracted with building a house and so we actually we found  a derelict little cottage a few minutes up the road and we're really lucky so we bought  that and we just started squatting in this in this old Welsh cottage that was very much  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:49):**  in a state and needed a lot of work.  And we got distracted with with building a house but you had to rebuild another one basically.  Exactly yeah but at least we had a roof over our heads you know we are out of the wind  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:02):**  and the rain and a lot of people start this journey in a caravan in a field and actually  we did live in a caravan on our field for three months and that was interesting and  quite exciting but not something I wanted to do long term.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:19):**  But yeah so we were squatting in this little cottage and we just got to work on the land  and we're like right it was the most threatening thing honestly like to look at 10 acres of  pasture and try and okay right now let's build a diverse and profitable and ecologically  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:40):**  sound regenerative farm go.  It was like you know imagine a writer staring at a blank page with a writer's block it was  like oh my god how what what are we going to do so yeah we start like what's the first  
**[0:19:54-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:54):**  like not with a spreadsheet but like what's the lots of lots of spreadsheets lots of spreadsheets  but it was very much like we were you know everything was a guess everything was just  based on ideas and no practical experience so we had lots of spreadsheets we had where  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:15):**  we actually practically started was on the project that we thought was going to take  the longest so we needed to start first which was our perennial crops so the blueberries  so the first thing we once we had decided roughly what how we were going to earn our  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:31):**  income we decided right let's first get the blueberries in the ground because we know  they're going to take many years to actually become productive and then let's take it from  there and build around that because we knew we wanted to do blueberries they're a high  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:43):**  value crop we had acidic soil we knew of a neighbor who was successfully growing them  so we thought right that's a good it's a good first step let's do that so we started with  the blueberries then we realized oh my goodness there's this problem of having too much grass  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:58):**  which we didn't even think about um the grass just grows it rains it rains yeah yeah in  the sun and it just goes yeah yeah we've got the best some of the best grass growth in  the world the grass just grows and you think okay well either i lose my productive land  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:16):**  to scrub and i rewild it or i mow it or i get some animals so we're like right well  we're going to do the sensible thing and get some sheep which may or may not have been  sensible actually i love them and i'm you know i would never regret getting them but  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:32):**  we got our sheep next um and then  on youtube yeah yeah we're yeah watching all the youtube it is actually to be honest i  did start connecting with local um more conventional farmers quite early on i really wanted to  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:50):**  sort of bridge the gap between what did they think of you like typical back to the landers  that are gonna hit the landers the let's say the fence because they're in times burn themselves  touch the electric like yeah but they still you still wanted to connect with them yeah  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:09):**  i basically just i basically just went and got really drunk with one of them or a few  of them actually a bunch of them um and that was the best way to do it honestly before  you had a child yeah yeah before i had a child yeah um avi still remembers the night i came  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:26):**  home and it was but it's that's investment in like networking and that's your your your  right of passage on the local community yeah i think i connected with people um that some  of the local farmers really well like that and you know a lot of um barriers were dropped  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:43):**  and a lot of you know they they could see my what my intentions were and that and that  i wasn't like completely off my rocker because there's a huge cultural gap between rural  folk and city folk i mean there's just such a huge divide there and um uh you know they  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:01):**  looked at us and we were just you we were just a classic example of townies that had  that had you know that had money and wanted to come and buy some land and live the good  life um and yeah as i said in in one of my youtube videos recently which which you watched  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:21):**  um you know i i was told by several different farmers um there's a saying around here they  arrive in their fancy cars and they leave on their bicycles um and it's because they  have seen it many times and it's actually i talk about the back to the land movement  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:37):**  that we were very much a part of the most recent wave which i i think it seems like  quite a few people started on this journey around 2015 ish it seems like around here  there was this big sudden surge of people moving into the area trying to do this sort  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:52):**  of alternative stuff um but there's been many of these waves before and i've been told by  a few locals that happened i think it happened back in the 60s and i think again in the 80s  i can't remember the exact dates but it's happened in on several occasions and most  
**[0:24:11-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:11):**  of the time it ends in in tears in divorce in in debt and financial ruin honestly i mean  it tears people apart because there's this ideal and there's this expectation of the  good life and what it is and what it means and and then there's the reality of mother  
**[0:24:32-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:32):**  nature and and farming and the and and how tough it is and um so so yeah i mean not the  divorce part because that's not the case but the the debt part might be shouldn't be the  case but we are um in the toughness now where do you find yourself now so you you planted  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:53):**  the blueberries you have some sheep but i don't think that's a huge part of i think  the flock is 20 or so um or maybe less now but and the main part is duck eggs which you  figure out is an interesting market but now you're being hit by um by input costs by feed  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:10):**  costs which we in the regen movement always say no but the input cost doesn't really reach  us too much but of course if you buy organic grains and and it arrives from somewhere or  or ukraine this year and you're gonna be hit even if you don't get it from ukraine like  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:24):**  prices have gone through the roof if any any energy intensive sector is being hit right  now even if you get your your your green electricity from somewhere it's connected to the gas price  and it explodes so what situation do you find yourself now in i will put the youtube videos  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:41):**  you're documenting this story as it goes every week which i highly recommend people to watch  i'll put it below but where do you find yourself now um and and then we'll unpack a lot of  the backup to the land movement and the potential future of that because that wave is going  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:54):**  to repeat itself i'm not too worried about that but the question is what do we do with  it and how do we make some impact on on the land but where do you find yourself now and  why are we recording now because this was going to happen but it wasn't necessarily  
**[0:26:06-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:06):**  scheduled for the end of october 2022 um right so i mean to cut to the chase our farm is  about to go bankrupt and we've pretty much just got november like our cash flows tells  us that you reach the end of november and unless you figure something out that's game  
**[0:26:23-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:23):**  over and um so um i i decided to start a little series on youtube called how to fail at farming  and i i did that because i thought right if we're gonna go under if this is gonna be it  um i have to extract some value out of this failure you know i have to take something  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:47):**  good away from it um and i i want to help um educate people about the realities of small  scale agriculture and agriculture in general and how tough it is um and i want to share  our learnings with people i want to share what i think we've done wrong what we could  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:05):**  have done better how we're going to potentially get out of this um and i yeah i decided i'd  i'd like to document the process because no matter what happens um i think that that will  be of value to the community moving forward um and so yeah i mean the main thing that  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:23):**  nailed us or is nailing us is these rising is the rising cost of feeds linked to uh russia  and ukraine and the global and just to give us an idea like what yeah what what kind of  percentages are you looking at now or what kind of money like cash flow going out basically  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:42):**  and yeah i mean every month just to to see how yeah how tight or how negative it got  yeah i mean um our costs have increased um by more than 50 um since since i installed  our new feed bin so our feed silo that we've got which was last year um early last year  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:06):**  we installed that feed bin so that we could benefit from bulk food prices you know before  then i was buying bagged feed and i was hauling it by hand and so our prices have gone up  by more than 50 when you accommodate when you factor in all the other inflation across  
**[0:28:23-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:23):**  all of the other costs in our business um and you know it's it's hard to um even though  they should know retailers it's hard to get them to to understand the speed at which you  have to put your prices up and i have now the the supply our main supply that we're  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:45):**  our main um customer that we're with now has agreed to a very steep price increase with  us and it remains to be seen what exactly um how that will impact the demand for our  eggs but luckily we've got some very very good customers who really care so i think  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:02):**  we'll be supported in that way but our business you know there are we have to our feed bill  every month is is thousands um and for for such a small business like us that is massive  um now people who who've watched the youtube series so far we've done part one and part  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:19):**  two will know that we've just recently culled a large portion of of our flock and that's  to help reduce our feed bill um and i think that the other thing that i i do want to make  people i really want to emphasize that although the feed bill has really been the nail in  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:38):**  the coffin i think that it's important that we take responsibility for the fact that there  are other factors at play here other reasons why we're in trouble and um you know a lot  of that is due to the fact that we are inexperienced farmers you know that we spent the first sort  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:57):**  of five years figuring out exactly how this whole farming thing really works yeah and  separating the you know myths from actual um you know fact from fiction that you the  fiction that you see on youtube from the actual facts on the ground for people who are trying  
**[0:30:14-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:14):**  to earn a living full-time farming um and we also have certain ideals you know ideals  about how we want to run the farm how we want to keep our animals and those ideals make  it very difficult to make it more difficult to be profitable um and and there is a reason  
**[0:30:34-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:34):**  why farmers do things the way they do um and we're learning the hard way so um so so that  those are sort of some of the part those are some of the reasons as to why we're in the  situation we're in but the businesses um as i said you know it's crunch time for us um  
**[0:30:55-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:55):**  this is a this is a cash flow issue for us um and it's happened very quickly um and i  i think the other thing to to mention is that there's you know i've been contacted by quite  a few people since releasing those videos saying you know they don't fully understand  
**[0:31:14-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:14):**  um the mechanics of poultry businesses like you know they they think for example that  our ducks could potentially forage more land or that potentially we're not managing our  grassland properly in order to help feed the animals or that we should be somehow growing  
**[0:31:34-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:34):**  our own food or feed for the poultry um for our ducks and i think it's because regenerative  agriculture is generally there's a a lot of the focus is on ruminants on grazing animals  and with poultry it's a whole different story you know they need grain or they need some  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:54):**  nutrient-dense food yeah they don't have that ability to turn grass into into except for  geese right if i understand correct like except for geese yeah would that be why did you go  for ducks not for geese because you're talking that video that i mentioned at the beginning  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:08):**  um like they have this unique opportunity or unique capability sorry of actually foraging  and still create high nutrient-dense protein in shape of eggs and meat and what what i  mean was geese even more difficult than ducks to find like duck eggs are geese eggs even  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:26):**  more difficult to to sell than duck eggs or is that a feature i wouldn't say thought or  idea like to find a one poultry species in this case geese that actually can forage and  doesn't need all of that or maybe even none of it uh in terms of outside um very expensive  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:43):**  at the moment fee yeah yeah it's a really good question and i've i've i've put so much  thought into geese and and um i really love the theory behind it um what's the practice  yeah we've had geese we actually recently um got rid of our geese because uh over the  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:01):**  years we've just realized simplify simplify simplify focus focus focus on what you're  good at and what you're doing and um the geese were really creating some issues for us specifically  when we had to lock down the birds during avian flu so uh we we we decided to to to  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:19):**  simplify things there but with geese they're amazing you know they they have that ability  to turn grass into forage um unlike um sorry to turn forage and grass into actual meat  you you wouldn't really keep your geese for eggs that's not they don't you know they produce  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:36):**  maybe 30 eggs a year compared to a khaki campbell that does roughly 300 eggs a year you would  really be keeping the geese for the meat uh it's what we in the uk at least would have  eaten for christmas dinner you know much more commonly than say turkey um so it was it was  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:55):**  really a traditional christmas roast um the meat is delicious there's lots of fat on it  it's much more moist than turkey is although i know a lot of people say you just got to  cook the turkey right which i've never managed to do but um geese is geese is absolutely  
**[0:34:10-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:10):**  delicious um uh as we were gonna yeah there's yeah there's no methane as far as i know which  i find really amazing because they don't really use um from what i understand they don't use  fermentation to actually digest the grass it's their unique gizzard which actually does  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:28):**  that breaking down um and uh they have to eat constantly and they there's actually quite  a lot of waste when when it comes out the grasses you know they have these really big  green poos which look almost like unprocessed grass but they they managed to do it by just  
**[0:34:44-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:44):**  constantly eating which is is it good for the land like is that uh is it a good grazer  quote unquote yeah they're very good lawnmowers they they are they're very good lawnmowers  i'm sorry i was interrupting you were saying if we would like what what is there a future  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:01):**  place for geese on the farm if like a year from now we're talking to farmers yeah if  we were going to get into geese it would be for the meat and um and you know this is another  example of of um i i have i take issue with minute scale agriculture very small scale  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:19):**  agriculture and this is one of the reasons is because you know they talk a lot about  diversity and stacking enterprises and and so geese was one of those examples which we  were trying to add into the mix but if we were going to process geese for meat to do  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:34):**  that effectively it would be another capital investment that we'd have to make because  we'd need that abattoir we'd need to be able to process the birds processing you need a  few thousand birds at least a year probably more yeah yeah you need you need enough birds  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:50):**  to to justify it um you know you need the correct equipment processing geese is actually  very difficult like processing chickens easiest ducks is the next step up in terms of difficulty  because of all their down and how hard it is to pluck um and then geese are even further  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:08):**  up there so they're very difficult to process they're also very seasonal people tend to  only want them during christmas um or sort of around uh winter time they take quite long  to grow and finish um and so you've got a large portion of the year where you're working  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:26):**  on growing these geese and then a very small window of of time to sell and then also sort  of sell all of them pre-service yeah yeah so it's not a business you can just easily  stack on top and just make a bit of extra money left and right now you need to do this  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:44):**  full time and only yeah almost only if i had um another if i was doing a meat business  with say um some chickens or ducks already and already had the processing facility and  the license and everything sure i i don't think i think it would make a lot of sense  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:01):**  to add geese into the mix but as an egg producer as a primarily primarily as an egg producer  it's just a whole nother level of investment for us so another yeah um so coming back to  the the feed issue with ducks is that you know you can't uh you can't rely on acreage  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:23):**  to feed your ducks you have to rely on ghost acreage you know you have to rely on arable  grain producers to help you feed your ducks or your chickens or whatever poultry you might  have um and you know people say well then you shouldn't have poultry or they're not  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:39):**  well on 10 acres you can't keep ruminants and make a business it's just not possible  you know um i i would in order to make a business like a snow scale dairy or something i'm joking  no but it's yeah i mean i mean you could but you're you're you're not gonna make any money  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:58):**  or very you could try you're not gonna make enough money basically um and so when you've  got 10 acres you've got limited options i mean i basically i basically put it down to  two options you've got poultry if you want to do livestock or you've got market gardening  
**[0:38:15-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:15):**  and the market gardening things i i've i've tried both um i haven't tried market gardening  at the same level of intensity as the ducks because that was our primary focus we did  a bit of market gardening alongside the poultry um but the problem is locally here you know  
**[0:38:35-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:35):**  there's not um there isn't that easy to access market to go and do our to do a veg box scheme  really we've we've already got some very well established um uh market gardeners slash wholesalers  and area who do a great job we also have a lot of really small family-run retailers who  
**[0:38:57-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:57):**  buy in from you know the local wholesaler um and and you know people have that community  they have those those little high streets and the space with the place where they go  and they buy their veg and um it's not like it's not like maybe a city where all of its  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:15):**  supermarket veg and you want to maybe come and disrupt things and you want to say hey  don't go to the supermarket come to me buy the veg directly and buy a veg box and you  know i don't really want to go and say hey stop buying from your local family small retailer  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:31):**  on the high street and come and buy directly from directly from us yeah no no yeah so in  our context leaves poetry basically yeah so it leaves poultry if you really and i should  also clarify because our goals from the start were and this was a bit too idealistic really  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:49):**  and this is one of my lessons that i've learnt is our goals from the start was we were going  to be 100% farm farmers on the farm no side hustles no other income and and that was our  goal and and you know i was warned by the other farmers the the real farmers 10 acres  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:06):**  yeah it's i was warned josh that's not you're not going to build to do that and being the  type of person i am i dug my heels in and i said no i'm going to show you that on 10  because i'm going to be a farmer producing nothing other than food and i'm going to make  
**[0:40:22-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:22):**  it work and that was too idealistic and so a lot of the time you see other people making  small scale farming sort of work in i'm doing quote unquote yeah that with airbnb tourism  courses experiences dinner i mean anything else than selling pure food yeah yeah yeah  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:46):**  i think like 90 plus i'm getting the numbers wrong lauren is gonna manning's gonna kill  me um but i think in even in the us on large scale commercial farms the majority i'm gonna  say somewhere in 80 90 percent has an off-farm job for sure also for medical reasons for  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:05):**  health care reasons and insurance with other other reasons just a pure cash but even there  at that scale um most farmers or most farming families have an off-site an on an off-farm  job to keep the lights on which is very scary if you think about it it's very scary and  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:23):**  you know i mean the real farmers around here um they not only do they have a a job on the  side like hgv driving which pays pretty well actually especially these days um or contracting  using the kit that they've got um the tractors and whatnot but they've they also tend to  
**[0:41:42-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:42):**  have hundreds of acres and they are claiming subsidies on that acreage so in our case we  were farming if you think about it yeah yeah i mean you know they don't get me wrong they're  putting a lot of hours in and they're working hard about something else i just want to say  
**[0:41:58-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:58):**  is since arriving here i have never met a people or um and in like a community of people  that work as hard as farmers i mean they are hard we just put out an interview like this  week of the laziest farmer of the uk i listened to the math that's right yeah and and it's  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:18):**  interesting that the whole definition of i have to work until like i have to burn the  midnight oil and and in summer i have to be on my tractor until midnight and it's it's  very interesting it's probably a lot of that is needed but also a lot of that is is part  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:33):**  of that and he said yeah i'm too lazy to farm against nature like if we did the the conventional  extractive system is also extremely our intensive and does not sustainably mentally like you  cannot do that forever and i hope that that's fine and if you're not making like if you  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:50):**  did it for a few years and and your farm is getting off the ground and your your system  is starting to work etc no it's a slow hill like it's a it's a downhill slowly or vastly  and i can only imagine the level of stress i think that the farmer suicide rates everywhere  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:05):**  in the world are way it's like one of the most dangerous jobs and it's the highest suicides  it's crazy i believe farming is the highest uh suicide rate of any other industry from  what i understand and but i can tell you another reason you went there like let's from the  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:19):**  city you wanted to be outside work a lot uh deal with your anxiety yeah it's probably  not the combination you want to bring to farming looking back i mean um i i'll say that farmers  like um multi-generation farmers so not um you know not really first generation farmers  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:37):**  like myself but guys who have guys and girls who've been in this business for many generations  and grown up with it they are cuts from a different cloth i mean they they work hard  and they work in rough conditions and for very little pay and it's it never ceases to  
**[0:43:53-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:53):**  amaze me and it's just incredible um but you know our situation as i was saying not only  were we trying to do it without a job on the side or a non-agricultural related enterprise  like abnb which we now do have because we realized um but we will also we're also just  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:14):**  we don't even qualify for subsidies you can't get any subsidies on 10 acres you have to  be slightly bigger and even then you know basically the more acreage you have the more  fun subsidies you can claim so it is a case of size helps a lot um so we were in november  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:34):**  yeah let's talk about what needs to happen now to get you through the winter and i want  to hear your future vision you're going to do a massive airbnb experience with fiber  up to cable and remote working or something else on the farming side but what needs to  
**[0:44:47-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:47):**  happen now and what are you going to do to basically solve not solve but yeah solve the  cash flow issue and get you through the winter and is that enough because are you like expecting  that that feed cost will come down or what happens after the winter um yeah first of  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:05):**  all we're definitely not going to do any more than one abnb um and i'll talk why it's also  a lot of work um uh yeah when you work it out per hour pays a hell of a lot better than  farming but um i don't i i'm still have ideals about being a primarily a food producer and  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:21):**  i and i don't i don't want to turn it into a big campsite you know that's i i think it's  great having one abnb there people need to be able to come visit the farm it's a good  extra bit of income but i i definitely don't want to turn it into a big campsite um where  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:36):**  we are now is as i said end of november if we don't generate it um around about five  thousand pounds is is is the minimum that we need to see us through the winter um and  so the plan is actually to run a crowdfunding campaign uh to help generate that that cash  
**[0:45:53-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:53):**  now actually when i started the youtube channel that wasn't our intention you know that we  only did it because first of all my best friend from south africa rang me up and he was like  josh man you you can't you can't you've been doing this for seven years you can't just  
**[0:46:08-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:08):**  let this whole thing fall apart you need to you need to um you need to do a crowd funder  and he said that and then i started getting a lot of comments on the video like i would  support you i'd do a go fund me whatever so i and we were very reluctant because i you  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:26):**  know because you're making it work yeah yeah we see that even more as failure and you know  we are we see ourselves as a commercial business not a not a charity but so we've actually  we've come up with an idea for um we're going to do a crowd funder but there will be rewards  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:45):**  that people get back and there'll be very real things that they can get in return so  we're not just going to take you're going to ship eggs to south africa no no i i happen  to know from experience they ship very badly um you can only imagine the mess yeah yeah  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:00):**  um but uh but yeah so okay so we're going to do a crowd funding with rewards and yeah  and for about 5k which sounds possible i mean depends on your crowd obviously and let's  hope some of the crowd is listening to this uh because that would be already let's say  
**[0:47:17-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:17):**  for the space to see the transition to make sure you make it and then enable you to go  through a transition would be very interesting not that next year you'll be in the same issue  and have to keep that that i think is your reluctance not wanting to to keep asking the  
**[0:47:32-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:32):**  crowd to keep going and does not know financially stable no so one thing you know we've had  to think very hard about this because one thing we do not want to do is we do not want  to just limp along we don't we don't want to take you know five grand and then sort  
**[0:47:48-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:48):**  of get to next year i use this emergency to to fit yeah to to to get to reinvent ourselves  or to go down or get to the next level yeah yeah yeah we need to we need to um either  we need to fail fast or we need to and and just and just no depth you know change our  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:06):**  lives and do something else or we need to actually figure out how are we going to sustainably  move this forward on 10 acres you can sell the farm to the next back to the land movement  that's probably happening like every seven years i mean if they study this they've already  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:17):**  seen it's like some kind of exactly there are there are plenty of people out there who  want to have a go just like we did um and i and i would just i would just tell them  go for it but just don't quit your day job basically um so uh you know we've actually  
**[0:48:36-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:36):**  got some very interesting opportunities on the horizon we've got um i guess without uh  for confidentiality reasons without talking about it in great detail um there is a farm  in europe that wants to buy hatching eggs from us and that being fertilized duck eggs  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:56):**  which they can then incubate and then they can basically get our genetics of khaki campbells  onto their farm um and suddenly your 10 acres let's say multiplies the whole seed thing  is very interesting we're going to do another episode on that in the nutrient density yeah  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:13):**  and and the genetics and selling and selling to others your it's an input but it's not  really an input like then suddenly with 10 acres you can i'm imagining i don't know how  that works in duck eggs but you can let's say touch a lot more more hectares and acres  
**[0:49:28-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:28):**  and touch a lot more more people yeah exactly i mean hatching eggs are incredibly more valuable  than table eggs um like immensely so so that would what is immensely 10x 50x 100x uh like  you know you're talking um sort of um 40 pence an egg table eggs um compared to uh which  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:55):**  is we are very by the way anyone listening should know we are not failing because we're  not niche enough and we're not premium enough okay we are the uk's only organic duck egg  producer and uh talking about a niche and and we yeah and we sell our eggs i i mean  
**[0:50:12-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:12):**  i'd imagine our eggs are probably the most expensive in the uk um so that's not why we're  failing um but yes our eggs our eggs are about 40 pence each um and you know hatching egg  depending on the volumes you're selling it but at small volumes you're selling at a two  
**[0:50:28-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:28):**  pound 50 an egg um you know so it's it's many times greater and and it makes a huge difference  to our business so and is that easy to do probably not otherwise they wouldn't be searching  for you they would be trying to find somebody on the continent it's it's it's not hard to  
**[0:50:44-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:44):**  do you know you ultimately just have to set up a breeding group and you have to but the  thing is you need the right genetics and so which is when it comes yeah when it comes  to khaki campbells um and the ducks that we keep um which is a type of ducks just for  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:00):**  people to yeah yeah it's a specific genetics yeah we keep um campbell breeds all focused  on egg laying and and the three breeds we've got are dark campbells um khaki campbells  and welsh harlequins which um which are also actually campbells um and you know they're  
**[0:51:18-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:18):**  like for for years obviously on yeah quality like on laying on easiness and disease i mean  you've been selecting and now maybe in a position to start selling yeah exactly so those duck  breeds are pretty rare um first of all just the fact that there are very few duck egg  
**[0:51:35-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:35):**  producers in the uk let alone actually uh organic uh certified duck egg producers so  you don't get many farmers who have that sort of volume those population numbers like we  do to select from you know you've got lots of backyard people with ducks but they've  
**[0:51:53-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:53):**  got small populations and those populations are coming from other places which are not  breeding in the same way that we're breeding so i actually i look at our breeding program  as a regenerative breeding program which the way we go about it is um is you know we are  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:12):**  breeding for every generation to be better than the previous one and we're doing that  by brutally selecting out birds that don't meet our requirement requirements where um  withholding as much um how do i say we're muddy coddling and care and you know we're  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:34):**  giving them um a natural environment and we're saying we're not going to give you all the  additional medication and parasite wormers and we're not going to basically who makes  it we're going to the toughies yeah yeah it's survival of the fittest and we're not going  
**[0:52:49-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:49):**  to try and optimize your performance through inputs you know if a bird if it is an animal  welfare issue and then we do the same process with our sheep and i'm really stoked about  where we've got to with our flock of sheep but if there's an animal welfare issue we  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:04):**  immediately treat them we sort them out we make sure they're happy but they get a black  mark and they do not move into the next flock and our criteria that we that we have when  selecting are much stricter than what people usually have like for example with our sheep  
**[0:53:20-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:20):**  if a sheep has to be if a sheep gives birth and we have to pull that lamb we're not happy  because we've got a big lamb we're really annoyed because we have to pull the lamb um  we we want sheep that and that is very common amongst farming community is you know they're  
**[0:53:36-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:36):**  they're proud about how many lambs they've pulled and how big the lamb was when it came  out so how unique is that approach like that genetic approach also in sheep because i i  sense that there's another opportunity there as well like to get these genetics right on  
**[0:53:51-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:51):**  low input low input also in terms of time and resources and having to pull sheep or  having to medicate ducks which for sure is not easy like how unique is that approach  to creating the tuffies i think it's i think it's quite unique actually like even if people  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:08):**  say that they you know everyone says that they're selecting the best of the flock for  the next generation means something else but in this case it's like it's like okay you're  saying you selected the best but um you know how much attention how much like resources  
**[0:54:25-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:25):**  did you give those though that flock through the year like how many inputs and resources  did you get to get that animal to look like that and perform like that and so we we've  been from the very beginning giving we kind of call we call it minimal intervention and  
**[0:54:41-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:41):**  that is we give them as little as possible and we see how they do and if there's an issue  we treat it and then they don't get bred from and we have lots of criteria that we score  them against and then from and then we select them for breeding so regenerative mark shepherd  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:59):**  calls it like what is it stun sheer yeah sheer total out of neglect that's right yeah yeah  i don't know maybe it's a bit tricky but yeah you get the idea yeah i i don't i don't actually  neglect them um but uh you know and he uses that principle with plants right and we've  
**[0:55:16-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:16):**  actually done the same thing with our blueberry patch which is a whole nother story um but  so yeah regenerative breeding so our genetics um we also happen to get our khaki campbells  came from um a farm uh they're called a family called the court langs and they have a farm  
**[0:55:36-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:36):**  and i i don't know exactly how many generations i someone said to me they've been breeding  khaki campbells for seven generations um i'm not sure if that number is but the family  yeah uh that the yeah the family have been breeding khaki campbell ducks how many generations  
**[0:55:55-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:55):**  of ducks that's generations oh many yeah yeah so i and i i say seven you know people don't  think it could be less but they've been doing it pretty much the longest of anyone and and  they're actually known all around the world for for their um genetics now that's where  
**[0:56:14-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:14):**  our original khaki campbell genetics came from and then in 2020 when covet kicked off  um very last minute i found out that peter court lang um who was the last you know member  of that family uh or the sort of the last member who still wanted to farm he decided  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:33):**  to retire and no one else wanted to take over the family business so he sold it on to someone  else that other person seems to not be doing a hell of a lot with with the flock that he  got um and we were like well we're sitting on 200 ducks right now that came from peter  
**[0:56:49-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:49):**  um and we need to breed our we basically we we were like we got to start breeding our  own duck so we we got into that so the genetics that we've got already make an attempt to  buy the other one or not did we make an attempt before peter i don't know no by the time we  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:05):**  heard from peter um it was already he had already found a buyer and sold all of his  incubators and everything so it made you aware like okay we need to be there's not going  to be a place anymore to buy our our future fox so we need to do it ourselves yeah and  
**[0:57:22-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:22):**  certainly not the quality that we were expecting so of course so we we we had a really good  stock to begin with and we built up from there and then we've applied our regenerative breeding  principles to that um and so we've got these so coming right back to your original question  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:38):**  sort of and what's um how are we going to get through the winter and what's next so  one of the potential options for us in the future is to is to really sell our genetics  and to um take the role of you know to the role of a leading breeder in in that in that  
**[0:57:56-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:56):**  space for khaki campbell ducks and this farm in europe wants hatching eggs from us and  the very unique thing is they want quite a lot of hatching eggs from us and it'll be  a long period of of supplying them hatching eggs because they want to build up their flock  
**[0:58:13-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:13):**  they want to build up a flock of of khaki campbells and they don't have access to them  so um that's one opportunity on the on the horizon but it's not guaranteed it's it's  sitting there to kick off in march but it's it's not a hundred things can happen until  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:29):**  march yeah yeah and and we are very close we've been through a long process of getting  an export license with defra and as far as i know they are crossing i's and dotting the  t's um dotting the i's and crossing the t's um and we should have our export license pretty  
**[0:58:48-0:58:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:48):**  soon to do that so um so that's an opportunity on the horizon um and then uh and then there  are other there are other aspects so there's another opportunity there which is obviously  the airbnb will kick off next year because it'll be it'll be season again and we were  
**[0:59:07-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:07):**  just too late with that this year so our airbnb was only ready at the end of the season so  the airbnb will help next year but the the next really big opportunity for us and the  what i'm very excited about is essentially to produce um a super compost from our duck  
**[0:59:24-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:24):**  manure and so we have these aspirations for the farm moving forward if we can get through  the winter if we can get over this hump and we can survive um where we want to ultimately  take the business on our 10 acres we we need to be profitable and we need to be comfortably  
**[0:59:45-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:45):**  we need to be more resilient and we just you know we are suffering right now with the feed  price increase because we're just not resilient enough and we we we admit that um and so moving  forward we need to be more profitable and more resilient and we have this vision for  
**[1:00:04-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:04):**  uh two things apart from the genetics one is to um to produce a carbon negative duck  egg um and i've got a lot of work to actually color i want it to be calculated and i want  it to be calculated properly you know i don't i don't want to green wash this i want this  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:23):**  to be a proper sum maybe we can only get to carbon neutral and that'll be fine too but  if we could get carbon negative i'd be very happy um so we want to produce um carbon negative  duck eggs most of that work is going to be on the the the ghost acre it's basically um  
**[1:00:42-1:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:42):**  on the grain side or what what where do you see the work that needs to be done because  it sounds like on the farm itself at least on the the grazing of the ducks which obviously  don't graze a lot like that there's a limit there that you reach already reached or it  
**[1:00:57-1:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:57):**  will reach pretty quickly even though all youtube commenters are saying you should grow  your own feet etc etc yeah how are you going to get your carbon positive or neutral or  negative whatever the right direction is let's say one you get the picture how do you get  
**[1:01:11-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:11):**  to yeah so yeah it's a very good question when we rely on so many ghost acres how how  are we going to get to carbon negative or neutral and the way i see us doing that is  um first of all we need to get off the soy as quick as possible and and that's the that  
**[1:01:29-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:29):**  is the big sticking point for all poultry producers is how do you get off the soy train  um so we we we want to move over to black soldier fly larvae production and i've talked  about this and now now we own my whole different youtube community yeah yeah so um there are  
**[1:01:48-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:48):**  technologies coming out you know a lot of people like oh why don't you just do black  soldier flies in your polytunnel or like don't worry everybody that says that i've seen the  first factories from the inside we've done due diligence at a fund i used to work with  
**[1:02:02-1:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:02):**  yeah and it's fascinating very possible but not easy at all talking about genetics of  flies good luck yeah like this is something you need to do at a yeah this is not this  is not something you can do at the side in in a room you have left over exactly exactly  
**[1:02:21-1:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:21):**  and and the other thing is you know black soldier fly lives are native to to the uk  so they don't survive through the winters here um although climate change might change  that but and then then yeah that's always the thing always the point everybody raises  
**[1:02:36-1:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:36):**  don't worry if they escape i've seen rooms full of these flies don't worry if they escaped  anyway die in the winter yeah if the winters get warmer we might get into other licensing  issues yeah yeah so it doesn't come without its um complications um how much would that  
**[1:02:49-1:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:49):**  fix like how much would that like help you because they are able to and some other insects  but this specifically to turn low grade food waste brewery waste or any kind of sludge  basically into protein into insects and i've seen living examples like living insects feeding  
**[1:03:09-1:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:09):**  them to poultry is very interesting for the poultry because they it triggers something  compared to pellets they get or compared to grain but how much would that be like the  protein thing would that fix a lot of your issues and or would it just fit a small percentage  
**[1:03:23-1:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:23):**  of feed issue and you still have to buy a different somewhere else it's um it only fixes  part of um it only gets us part of the way to a carbon neutral or negative egg um but  it is a huge part of that i mean i don't i don't know in percentage terms and i haven't  
**[1:03:39-1:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:39):**  got the exact numbers but i know that our biggest impact by far is in the soy that we  consume as a farm so moving moving the poultry over to black soldier flies by taking local  food waste and then converting that into insects and then feeding that to the ducks you know  
**[1:03:58-1:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:58):**  you're hitting on multiple things they first of all you're helping redirect food waste  um away from landfill and um and that creates a lot of methane production and that's pretty  bad in itself um and then you turn it into protein and then you're forgoing your soya  
**[1:04:15-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:15):**  consumption which comes from another part of the world and potentially is involved in  deforestation etc so there's a massive improvement there by switching over to black soldier flies  does it do anything for the taste and nutrient density of the eggs oh oh yeah i mean on that  
**[1:04:32-1:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:32):**  point of view uh that's the other thing is like we we really carbon negative and the  most healthy egg in the world yeah there's the most nutrient dense egg because by the  way duck eggs are a lot more nutritious than chicken eggs and i i'm a big fan of duck eggs  
**[1:04:45-1:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:45):**  in general so we you know we could potentially move towards being one of the most nutritious  and nutrient dense eggs in the world as well okay but i'm imagining this is like a massive  undertaking like does it make sense on 10 acres yeah so um i've actually had a conversation  
**[1:05:02-1:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:02):**  with a gentleman from a different company that do black soldier fly love it like a lot  of people have seen in my videos i referenced um uh better origin um and i know what's the  other one called now anyway yeah the container size you buy your plug plug and play and it  
**[1:05:19-1:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:19):**  should work yeah they they won't they won't talk to me i'm um i'm too small scale and  it wouldn't be realistic but this other guy that i've spoken with um we had a we had a  chat and it sounds like um if i could get the flock up to a thousand ducks where we're  
**[1:05:36-1:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:36):**  you know we've been sitting at 500 if i could get the flock up to a thousand ducks it would  make commercial sense i would match the current cost of feed um by by renting his shipping  container because that has a monthly cost that goes out and then i saw the mannish is  
**[1:05:53-1:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:53):**  it he manages the shipping no i manage it it's on the farm i source local food waste  i blend that food waste i feed it into this container in a tube and the soldier flies  eat that um and then i feed the flies to the uh all the should i say the larvae to the  
**[1:06:09-1:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:09):**  uh to the ducks um so which fixes a huge issue for processing these because that's a massive  alive i'm gonna say a warning it sounds really nice on youtube videos but yeah it's the blending  it getting the right feed mix i think as always like garbage in garbage out and but it's fascinating  
**[1:06:32-1:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:32):**  to okay so you need to to to make any commercial sense it needs to be double the flock and  then you can do a big yeah but let me let me just say you get a lot of you get a lot  of fertilizer out of it as well that's the big thing with soldier flies actually it's  
**[1:06:43-1:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:43):**  not necessarily yes the protein it's what they what they shit basically which makes  it yeah potentially even more interesting from a from a cash flow perspective yeah so  um i i just want to say this is a pretty you know this is a big idea and and to make this  
**[1:06:59-1:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:59):**  happen is is not going to be easy but um it is the future of poultry and possibly pig  production it is it's going there like we are i can see that this is there are no other  as far as i can see there are no other real better options i mean people talk about why  
**[1:07:18-1:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:18):**  don't you feed the ducks um sort of legumes or um beans or um you know other other sort  of high protein grains and you know we've we've looked into it people have tried it  there's all sorts of complexities around the anti-nutrients that come with those beans  
**[1:07:35-1:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:35):**  and the the conclusion overall has been soya is the ultimate protein for poultry and that's  why we use it for very good reason but this really is going to be the future and it's  very early days but that's where the world is moving and if we carry on i want to be  
**[1:07:53-1:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:53):**  on that train as very as soon as possible because we need to now the other part there's  another piece yeah and then the other piece is um okay so we'll get we'll have to source  some carbohydrate locally and uh that's going to be possibly wheat or barley now you know  
**[1:08:12-1:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:12):**  there's going to be some sort of carbon cost to that but we can't really do much about  that so that that wheat or barley that comes in is is it's got to be sourced locally and  it's just something we can't get around the other side to the businesses as well as using  
**[1:08:29-1:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:29):**  the black soldier fly as the insect production is i want to combine the poultry with short  rotation coppers on the farm so i want to reduce my grazing pasture i want to reduce  my pasture my strict posture only um i'd still have ruminants on there but in very specific  
**[1:08:48-1:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:48):**  parts of the farm but primarily i want to grow large blocks of short rotation coppers  that produces biomass that we can then cut chip and then include in the bedding for the  ducks which eventually becomes the compost that we produce and the ducks will also be  
**[1:09:08-1:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:08):**  rotated around that coppers and we're talking about a very densely stocked corpus of very  fast growing biomass like willow poplar in our case gray older grows incredibly well  on our fields so um we would rotate the birds amongst that they obviously do their thing  
**[1:09:29-1:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:29):**  and fertilize the ground underneath there that helps you know so any any there's no  waste there you know anything you're feeding the ducks that ultimately gets pooped down  beneath the trees the trees use that they grow the trees provide the shade in the shelter  
**[1:09:44-1:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:44):**  for the poultry we have a rotation of cutting that biomass we chip it up and we include  it into our bedding and then ultimately the compost that we produce now the compost that  we produce is going to be we've um we've been experimenting a lot with vermicompost and  
**[1:10:01-1:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:01):**  with farming worms specifically so we come back to insects we come back to insects again  and actually the reason why we started experimenting with uh worms was because i thought originally  ah i can produce worms to feed to the ducks as their protein but no no no big no no because  
**[1:10:20-1:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:20):**  a there's a very small loop there there's a very small cycle between the duck manure  which the worms feed on and then the ducks feeding on the worms that loop is too small  and frowned upon generally so that for that reason it's no good but also um the practicalities  
**[1:10:37-1:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:37):**  of producing the quantity of worms in a consistent supply to feed to the ducks logistically it's  it's just not doable um so what i realized was no no no the worms are we want to keep  the worms as um as little workers on the farm who basically take the the manure and the  
**[1:10:58-1:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:58):**  waste from the ducks and turn it into a super compost basically and and there's a lot of  established science on the benefits of vermicompost and the differences between aerated compost  um or and an actual vermicompost so vermicompost is much more nutrient dense and it's much  
**[1:11:20-1:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:20):**  more it's much richer and it's much stronger um so there are a lot of benefits to vermicompost  and there's just a lot of benefits to raising worms like is that like it's niche you've  done that before with duck eggs i'm not so scared about that but is there maybe a benefit  
**[1:11:38-1:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:38):**  from like the current input prices that there there's more people are more searching for  the non half heavy fossil fuel chemical fertilizer because it went whatever percentage up it  went in your local co-op where you have to buy it like i'm imagining a lot of alternative  
**[1:11:59-1:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:59):**  quote-unquote alternative input companies are getting a lot of calls this year do you  see that as well like okay we have this political situation which is pushing our input price  our input prices up but actually we might use it as a as a stepping stone to a system  
**[1:12:12-1:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:12):**  where we're going to produce a lot of inputs for other people that don't have the this  huge political and environmental cost to it exactly so um when all of this stuff kicked  off i was like well it's negatively impacting the feed price but actually fertilizer prices  
**[1:12:27-1:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:27):**  are skyrocketing you see now every farmer around here they were just spreading their  muck like crazy they were using every last scrap of muck they had and all of a sudden  the local growers who usually you know get muck for free muck what is muck oh sorry muck  
**[1:12:45-1:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:45):**  being manure animal manure farmyard manure um and you know usually the local growers  and stuff are pretty much getting the stuff free as a waste product from farmers um and  now uh they can't get hold of any because everybody's making use of every last drop  
**[1:13:05-1:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:05):**  of manure that they've got um or crumb um and so uh yes our duck our duckman our duck  manure becomes a lot more valuable and the interesting thing about ducks is um their  manure is very rich it's like chicken manure everyone knows that chicken manure is the  
**[1:13:26-1:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:26):**  most potent of all animal manures but ducks manure is equally as potent but it actually  has much less ammonia in it and ammonia is what burns plants so you have to be careful  with chicken manure because you can quite easily burn your plants if you apply it um  
**[1:13:42-1:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:42):**  too much and with duck manure it's much more gentle but it's still potent and ducks produce  a lot of waste um i read there was a study that had been done which i read and i how  true this is i don't know but apparently according to them ducks actually produce more manure  
**[1:14:03-1:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:03):**  per kilo of body weight than any other livestock or any other farmed livestock should i say  so um ducks produce a lot of manure um it's good quality manure and because it's an issue  if you're living of duck eggs but it's an opportunity if you're selling manure yeah  
**[1:14:22-1:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:22):**  yeah and and on top of that we're using um a lot of bedding in the house okay we use  we used to use straw we now use this um this like wood chip sawdust stuff that we get um  from a biomass boiler pellet manufacturer and they have a byproduct that comes out of  
**[1:14:41-1:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:41):**  that process which is like a dust that they can't actually use so we actually use that  now in our house for bedding but we apply a lot of bedding more bedding than you would  normally do with other livestock because ducks are ground nesting birds and you can't get  
**[1:14:58-1:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:58):**  them to lay in a raised up nest box so in order to reduce the labor on the washing side  because you really do have to wash layer and layer and layer you just throw as much bedding  as you can at it because then your eggs come out cleaner so as a result we've got a lot  
**[1:15:13-1:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:13):**  of manure a lot of carbon in bedding and a lot of nitrogen so you're feeding that through  the worms and then it's ready to to sell feeding it through the worms and it's been shown that  when um so when that material moves through a worm's gut it comes out the other end at  
**[1:15:31-1:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:31):**  a perfect ph it's it's it's neutral spot on and um they also kill a lot of the pathogens  and and bad bacteria and at the same time they inoculate those castings what comes out  the other end is actually like the fact that's called castings yeah i remember from it's  
**[1:15:50-1:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:50):**  good it's called yeah yeah it's it's the probiotics that come out the beneficial bacteria that  come out of the worm's gut the other end didn't exist you know before it went in the other  side so yeah i've been selling that already or not like i said that's that's one of the  
**[1:16:10-1:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:10):**  pieces to get started yeah i i found some i i've i've i've produced some on the farm  and i've i've tested it with some of our stuff that we were growing in the polytunnel and  i was just amazed by how good it was i mean i used some stuff that i produced um i grew  
**[1:16:27-1:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:27):**  winter squash in it one year and winter squash is a very hungry crop you know you produce  these really big uh fruits and then the next year i took some of that beautiful black gold  that we had produced and had already produced the squash and i went and i grew tomatoes  
**[1:16:45-1:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:45):**  in it which is another very hungry crop which is another light and next next to the tomatoes  i i had some locally produced uh organic certified compost that is generally well considered  and i put some tomatoes in that compost and some of the tomatoes in my compost which was  
**[1:17:05-1:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:05):**  a year old already and uh i left it in the polytunnel and ended up being too busy to  manage the plants um you know dealing with your stuff and i actually in the beginning  i was like oh there's there's no difference they're both growing the same um okay so nothing  
**[1:17:23-1:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:23):**  which already would be an interesting thing yeah which already i was like oh okay yeah  i was like at least you know we're matching at least matching this compost and then i  just totally left the tomatoes because i was like crazy busy and i came back later on the  
**[1:17:39-1:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:39):**  polytunnel's all like overgrown and crazy and it's just been neglected and there are  these tomatoes and the ones that are sitting in our vermicompost still lush and green and  the ones that are sitting in the the commercially the local compost that we got were all yellowing  
**[1:17:57-1:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:57):**  and dying and clearly i had they were root bound and i took the plants out of the pots  and i looked and you know the roots were rack hurling around and they'd been sitting in  those pots way too long and they hadn't been watered and and i was just like wow okay so  
**[1:18:14-1:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:14):**  even despite the fact so somehow this vermicompost is really just giving it a lot of steam and  helping it get through despite the neglect that it received so it's done i was really  convinced when i saw that and i was like wow imagine when we start selling fresh vermicompost  
**[1:18:29-1:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:29):**  that isn't that hasn't been grown in for a year already and so that's the product that  we want to produce you know it's a very it's a product that you apply in much smaller volumes  and and generally vermicompost is worth roughly 10 times the price if you go and look at prices  
**[1:18:47-1:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:47):**  of compost online you'll see standard compost versus vermicompost pretty consistently the  vermicompost is 10 times the value per litre is what they sell it in to regular compost  so when i look at the economics of a duck or duckonomics you know there's two genetics  
**[1:19:07-1:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:07):**  and the the output yeah it's not the egg there's the genetics yeah but actually table egg yeah  yeah there's two primary outputs it's an egg and it's some poop and it's kind of ironic  that the situation we're in is that actually you know what that that egg unless it's the  
**[1:19:25-1:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:25):**  genetics and the breed and the fertile egg that egg is a table egg is worth much less  than the poop that comes out the other side so and how did the black soldier fly fertilizer  come into that like are you going to mix that through as well or that's just a separate  
**[1:19:41-1:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:41):**  piece and let's see do you know what i don't know yet i mean what happens when you mix  that with vermicompost i mean you're talking about some serious rocket fuel maybe it's  better to sell it as a as a as a as its own product but you know we're i think that if  
**[1:19:58-1:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:58):**  we're talking realistically the compost business is much closer in terms of feasibility the  black soldier flies are a bit further out because we have to scale up to a thousand  ducks to make that work as a minimum you have to manage that facility and get the get all  
**[1:20:18-1:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:18):**  the yeah the issues i mean that's that's going to take a few generations of flex all the  place before you get that to an optimum yes you have to hold stuff onto the farm first  which is not easy and the mixing of any of that's of course we we have we have capital  
**[1:20:34-1:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:34):**  we have a lot of capex to not i say a lot you know in the greater scheme of things it's  not that much money but we need to get a few things set up on the farm in order to scale  the ducks up to a thousand and to get one of these shipping containers set up so that's  
**[1:20:49-1:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:49):**  further out in the future what's closer in the future is the short rotation coppice the  biomass production the compost and the vermicompost thing that can happen you know i'm already  producing vermicompost now in preparation for spring next year so that's kind of where  
**[1:21:09-1:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:09):**  we want the farm to go but you know cash cash is king cash flow is super important and doesn't  really matter what kind of dream you have for the future if you can't if you can't sort  the cash flow out then you can't get there and you know there's a really i love the saying  
**[1:21:29-1:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:29):**  as mike tyson once said everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the face and  we've just been punched in the face multiple times many many times over the last seven  years and i feel like we're we're starting to learn we're starting to learn how to duck  
**[1:21:46-1:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:46):**  and weave a little bit the punches but um but intended yeah yeah we we we've we've yeah  so that's the idea behind the the the crowdfunding campaign um and uh if we can if we can get  through the winter then hopefully we can we can level park harreg up and and make ourselves  
**[1:22:07-1:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:07):**  more resilient and adapt to this future that we we all face i think it's a a gazillion  other questions i i want to ask and there's a whole other chapter i want to go into in  terms of your vision for um small but most importantly large scale agriculture and regenerative  
**[1:22:26-1:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:26):**  future but i also want to be conscious of your time and um i would think we'll leave  it at that this is the the immersion or the current moment the end of october 2022 is  now and and hopefully we'll see you through the winter like you you go through the winter  
**[1:22:42-1:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:42):**  you make it um and then we can sit and and explore first of all we're going to talk a  lot about compost at the time for sure i guess you would have learned a lot that you would  have sold for sure already and you would be way further down the line with black soldier  
**[1:22:56-1:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:56):**  flies or other flies and but also to hear your vision and what you've learned in this  and everything needs to be small scale but actually the future might be larger and and  what your vision is there that would be i think a part two so i will i want to add that  
**[1:23:11-1:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:11):**  and you probably have some some final words to share thank you yeah i i mean just the  last point to say is on the youtube channel you know like um if if there are people out  there listening to this yeah um yeah if there are people out there listening to this thinking  
**[1:23:25-1:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:25):**  well i i had plans to do this sort of really small scale hyper diversified um lean agile  farm and and that was you know i think if there are people out there that want to do  that i really i want to encourage them to to follow us on youtube and watch watch this  
**[1:23:45-1:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:45):**  process unfold because we had all the same ideas and we've read the same books as you  and we've watched the same influencers on youtube as you and then you get punched in  the face we got punched in the face multiple times and you know we've we've done the diversification  
**[1:24:00-1:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:00):**  the stacking the enterprises we've done the the niche products the premium products we've  done the no dig we've done the agroforestry stuff we've you know we've it's not like it's  not like we haven't tried this stuff and i think that um there's a lot of problems with  
**[1:24:15-1:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:15):**  this idea of small scale agriculture being the future i my my belief is that we need  large scale regenerative agriculture and that that is really the future and and what is  gonna get us out of this mess that we face um so before you go and spend your money on  
**[1:24:33-1:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:33):**  a little parcel of land and start trying to change the world like we did just take care  and and perhaps you know uh watch how things unfold for us because it's it's very tough  um and there's i think it's important to say that there are um influencers out there that  
**[1:24:54-1:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:54):**  have a very different context um you know it on the surface it it looks like they're  making it work but there's a lot of other things at play um and and so your your specific  context is always really important but that's all i'll say and um yeah please do follow  
**[1:25:14-1:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:25:14):**  us on youtube and um no matter what happens you know whether we make it or or not i think  um i'd like to share our journey with people so thanks for having me on and and thank you  for that because it's been refreshing extremely needed and and very interesting to see obviously

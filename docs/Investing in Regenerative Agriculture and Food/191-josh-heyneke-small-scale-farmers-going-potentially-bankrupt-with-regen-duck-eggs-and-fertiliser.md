**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:13):**  It seems so idyllic.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:15):**  Selling your apartment in London, quitting your well-paid jobs and buying 10 acres in  
**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:19):**  wells to farm.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:20):**  Back to the land, the good life, the simple life.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:23):**  Until you get punched in the face.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:25):**  Again, again and again.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:28):**  Farming isn't easy, let alone profitably and ecologically sound on a small scale.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:32):**  Don't let anybody tell you differently.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:35):**  Today's story unpacks one of those examples which after 7 years of regen farming might  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:40):**  go bankrupt this month.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:42):**  Learn all about duck eggs, feed prices, black soldier flies, vermi compost, back to the  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:47):**  land and if they make it through the winter, how they are planning to dramatically change  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:52):**  their business and scale their impact.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:00:57):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:02):**  mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:06):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:12):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:16):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:19):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:23):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:27):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:01:31):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:07):**  Welcome Josh, we're going to talk a lot about the current emergency but also want to know  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:10):**  a lot about duck eggs, geese eggs and what brings you to start a farm in Wales.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:15):**  So welcome to the podcast.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:18):**  Thanks Ken, it's really great to be here.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:21):**  And let's start I will put a beautiful video which is sort of a bit outdated now but still  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:27):**  very very pretty in the show notes below if you want to see a visual overview of the farm  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:33):**  you and your partner are running.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:35):**  But just to give a bit of an intro, because you didn't grow up in farming, what brought  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:39):**  you to literally what brought you to the land and start to start a farm and then we'll get  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:43):**  into recording this at the end of October 2022.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:47):**  And we'll get into the current situation and what you're doing about it and why you are  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:53):**  in an emergency.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:56):**  Yeah thanks Ken.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:02:59):**  Well I'm actually South African and Abby my partner she's British and before we before  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:06):**  we moved back and moved to the land we were living and working in London.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:11):**  And we were there for eight years working in the city.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:14):**  I was working in tech, in mobile software actually.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:20):**  And we I think after eight years in London we just got incredibly itchy.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:26):**  You know like I started wanting to get outside.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:30):**  I'm from as I mentioned from Cape Town South Africa.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:34):**  So I grew up in a very beautiful place.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:38):**  And are you suggesting that London isn't very beautiful?  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:43):**  You know it's a bit of a concrete jungle and like it was super exciting when I first got  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:47):**  there you know the bright lights and everything.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:50):**  But after about eight years there we really started craving you know wanting to get out  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:03:59):**  of the office wanting to get outside.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:03):**  And just having a long time like eight years is a proper.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:07):**  Yeah it was definitely the shiny lights were nice for that's a considerable amount of your  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:14):**  career and your time.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:15):**  Yeah it was a it was a slog but I you know it was hard work.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:21):**  But I and I did really enjoy it.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:23):**  I worked with some amazing people in London.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:28):**  But you know it was something about being in a city with all those you know the constant  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:32):**  noise the sirens the bright lights the being in an office and air conditioned space with  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:39):**  not much fresh air.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:40):**  And it just I think I think I over the years I got quite a lot of anxiety being in that  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:48):**  environment.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:49):**  I wanted to get outside.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:50):**  I wanted to do something with my hands.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:52):**  I wanted to be more physically active.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:54):**  I felt unhealthy.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:04:57):**  I didn't feel like I ever had time to do any physical exercise or anything.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:02):**  So one day we just made this like really brash decision.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:07):**  We're like you know what we're just we're just going to we're going to sell our little  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:10):**  flat in London.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:11):**  We're going to quit our jobs and we're going to go and start a farm.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:14):**  And it was like we had no idea what we were about to get into.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:20):**  And what do you remember what triggered that.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:23):**  I mean I know people have seen the biggest little farm but I don't think it was out there  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:27):**  yet or maybe it was and said they were going to do it.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:30):**  But then the next day reality kicked in and they didn't sell their flat in London and  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:33):**  they didn't quit their jobs and their lives basically.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:36):**  And you did.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:37):**  Was it like it was a very rainy I don't know February very cold or was it something like  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:42):**  what was their specific moment or what led up to it and then what made you actually do  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:47):**  it?  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:48):**  There were a few things.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:51):**  One was health issues.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:52):**  Like both of us were experiencing health problems and I had gotten really far down the rabbit  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:05:59):**  hole of diet and came to the conclusion that I needed to actually be more involved in my  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:04):**  own food production in order to ensure that I was eating healthy nutrient dense food.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:10):**  And actually I see a lot of a lot of people with a similar motivation in the space.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:15):**  So that was one reason.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:16):**  The other reason was I had this constant impending sense of doom like you know the world is about  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:24):**  to come to an end and I think a lot of that was just anxiety from living in the city.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:31):**  And I felt helpless.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:35):**  I felt helpless about you know the climate disaster that's coming.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:42):**  And I'm not someone who likes to when I feel worried about something I really want to get  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:49):**  up and go and do something about it.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:50):**  Like I can't stand talking about stuff.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:06:52):**  And so you know agriculture is a huge issue and a contributor to climate change.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:01):**  And I really felt like I wanted to get out there and just have a go and just see if I  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:05):**  could actively do something that might you know help make the world a better place one  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:13):**  day.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:15):**  And then the last contributing factor to us actually getting up and going and doing it  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:20):**  was I actually started working from home on the last project that I was doing.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:27):**  I left the company that I was working for and I started consulting and freelancing working  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:32):**  from home.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:33):**  And the experience of working from home and having my own free time and space to think  
**[0:07:42-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:42):**  really just I think it just tipped me over the edge into wanting to sort of detach myself  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:50):**  from corporate life.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:53):**  And I think it's funny because a lot of people have gone through something similar in recent  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:07:58):**  times with COVID when everyone was sort of forced to go back home and to start working  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:03):**  from home.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:04):**  So reconsidering home like oh actually yeah it's not just a place I sleep I should probably  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:11):**  do something.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:12):**  It was a very powerful experience.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:14):**  You know all my meals were home cooked.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:16):**  I was no longer going down to the local shop to go and get a sandwich to suddenly just  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:22):**  scoff down in front of my computer whilst I was banging out an email.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:26):**  You know I was actually like going and preparing a meal for lunch and it was just.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:30):**  And they're still eating it at your computer but yeah that was a big thing.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:33):**  Yeah sometimes yeah.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:34):**  But it's a powerful process and I think a lot of people have experienced the same thing  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:39):**  and really reevaluated where they're at in their life and a lot of people have made some  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:43):**  pretty big decisions as a result of it.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:45):**  So yeah so that was that was the thing that one of the things that tipped us over the  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:53):**  edge.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:08:54):**  So Toby and I had always talked about having a farm one day and the idea was we were going  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:01):**  to go and you know do something in the city get rich retire buy a farm and you know enjoy  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:07):**  our lives.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:09):**  And we talked a lot about this and exactly and I was sitting in a London bus one day  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:17):**  and coming home from work and another bus sort of passed and there was this big ad on  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:23):**  the bus.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:24):**  I don't remember what the brand was or who the ad was for but it just had this line start  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:29):**  where you want to go.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:31):**  And I was like why do we want to.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:35):**  And people say advertisement doesn't have impact.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:38):**  Yeah well it had a huge impact on me but unfortunately I don't think it increased sales for them  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:42):**  very much because I can't even remember what the brand was but I thought about that statement  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:48):**  start where you want to go.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:49):**  And I was like why do you want to wait until you are possibly 60 years old and about and  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:09:56):**  retired probably not as fit and active as you are now.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:02):**  Why do you want to wait until then to start farming.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:05):**  If you really want to farm and you want to work outside and you want to enjoy that lifestyle  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:09):**  then enjoy it while you're young and while you're still physically capable of doing it.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:14):**  So I was like OK right.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:16):**  How do we actually do this.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:17):**  Like could we actually could we actually sell our home and buy a farm.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:21):**  How would we make this happen.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:22):**  So it was and from there the process started basically.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:27):**  And I mean there's so much to unpack there and I want to get to the emergency but just  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:30):**  as a sidestep for a second.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:34):**  At that moment did you make it deliberate or was it always part of the plan to farm  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:39):**  not just as a homestead for yourself.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:41):**  You were talking a lot about of course the challenge of getting access to or more involved  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:47):**  in your own food.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:48):**  But there's a difference between your own food and food for others.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:51):**  Like was that from the beginning of it.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:53):**  OK we need this.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:10:56):**  It's not that I'm going to keep working maybe remotely or freelance for a day a week.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:01):**  And with that we keep we keep things going and the farm is mostly as a homestead for  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:05):**  our own food.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:06):**  Or was it from the beginning the plan to actually farm and live off the farm as well in terms  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:13):**  of economically.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:14):**  Yeah it's a good question.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:17):**  Actually it started off with the idea of going off grid and some of my colleagues if they're  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:21):**  my old colleagues if they're listening to this they'll remember I had this idea to actually  
**[0:11:25-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:25):**  create like a space for digital nomads to go off and come and work on an off grid farm  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:34):**  and that was going to be it is mostly going to be about self-sufficiency being off grid  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:41):**  and you know providing a space for people to escape to.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:44):**  It's still connected to the fiber of the cable.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:47):**  That created…  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:48):**  Connected to all the fiber and connected to my old digital you know my digital addictions.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:11:54):**  And so it did start off there and then of course we got into permaculture hugely and  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:00):**  we got into self-sufficiency and that whole you know that whole area.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:07):**  But we very quickly as things sort of unraveled and as we started pursuing it we very quickly  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:14):**  realized that okay we need to figure out how we're going to make a living doing this realistically  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:20):**  for long reasons.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:22):**  I won't get into this too much but basically we were going to go to Spain because we thought  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:26):**  that's the only place we could afford to buy land.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:29):**  And then Abby actually got diagnosed with MS and it was a massive shock.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:35):**  It was literally as we left London we had our camper van, we had all of our stuff in  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:39):**  storage we're on our journey about to go and find some land and go off to Spain and then  
**[0:12:45-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:45):**  boom Abby's legs started getting numb and it was like that's weird what's going on?  
**[0:12:52-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:52):**  And long story short we ended up in the hospital and we ended up with a diagnosis of MS.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:12:59):**  And we were just like how are we going to go off to Spain and start this thing away  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:06):**  from family away from the NHS you know when Abby's potentially got this like completely  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:11):**  debilitating disease moving forward.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:14):**  So without going too much down that rabbit hole.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:17):**  The camper never went on the ferry.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:20):**  Yeah we decided let's stay in the UK let's stay close to family let's try and figure  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:23):**  out how to do this in the UK although it is expensive.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:26):**  I mean close to family you're from South Africa but yeah that's never going to be close to  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:31):**  family.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:32):**  Should I say yeah close to Abby's family yeah.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:36):**  So Wales it became very different climate yeah.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:40):**  And Wales it became yeah.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:44):**  So we weren't going to do the digital nomad thing in Spain but then we just were like  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:48):**  well how are we going to make money doing this?  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:50):**  Well if you've got land you can be farmers okay cool.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:53):**  And also we felt this immense responsibility as potentially future landowners people who  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:13:59):**  are sitting on agricultural land.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:03):**  We felt this immense responsibility to actually be more than just self-sufficient but to be  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:09):**  actual producers and food producers.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:11):**  To feed the city yeah.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:12):**  And feed people because you know when you take this idea of self-sufficiency you can't  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:17):**  scale that up it doesn't work.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:19):**  You can't give everybody a 10-20 acre plot of land and tell them to be self-sufficient  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:25):**  it doesn't work.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:26):**  So we felt it was our responsibility.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:28):**  Some dreams of listeners have been shattered now.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:31):**  No I don't think anybody listening to this is in that matter.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:33):**  But yeah no that's physically geography and probably mentally not a good idea to do that  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:41):**  with everyone.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:42):**  Yeah it doesn't work when you scale it up.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:46):**  So that very quickly led us on to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:50):**  So we went from sort of permaculture to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:14:54):**  And when you say we went from what are I wouldn't say the big differences but what do you say  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:03):**  what in your mind is that step from permaculture to to the region?  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:07):**  Why is that a step and why is not is it not the same thing?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:10):**  Yeah it's not the I don't see it as the same thing because you know I love the design principles  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:17):**  in permaculture and I think you can apply them to not just all forms of agriculture  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:23):**  but you know many aspects of life actually.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:28):**  But when you go and look at the permaculture influences or content out there it is generally  
**[0:15:35-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:35):**  much smaller scale more focused on self-sufficiency and it's not really focused on productive  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:46):**  large scale food production.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:47):**  So you know things are very much they're not in need rows they're not in an organized fashion  
**[0:15:57-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:15:57):**  they're not designed necessarily for commercial production or efficiency so I mean you can  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:06):**  you can translate it into that form but most of the influences in space.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:10):**  So let's say the current the current examples we see mostly I'm going to get emails about  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:15):**  this for sure are the smaller scale homesteading not necessarily commercial scale.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:22):**  That doesn't mean it cannot be done but we just haven't seen it yet it hasn't been hasn't  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:27):**  formed in that way or expressed itself in that way let's say.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:31):**  So yeah and so you went to we need to feed people so we need a you know we need to be  
**[0:16:36-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:36):**  farming and then how did you land on I mean you landed on a number of acres probably because  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:44):**  you could afford them and then the journey into and then I promise we'll get into the  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:49):**  emergency but also we're still back here but how did you land in the current form let's  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:53):**  say of the of the farm and yeah what we're now at the end of October what emergency are  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:16:59):**  you in?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:01):**  Well without going into too much detail about why we chose Wales we we ended up in Wales  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:08):**  and we were keen to start you know we were like actually we what's quite unique about  
**[0:17:13-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:13):**  what we did and possibly a bit stupid is we didn't go and do any we didn't really go and  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:22):**  do any courses we did one very little permaculture course which to be honest it doesn't really  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:28):**  apply to what we've actually ended up doing but we didn't go and volunteer on any farms  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:34):**  we didn't go roofing we didn't we didn't go and do any real workshops or education or  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:40):**  courses or anything like that.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:42):**  We had read lots of books we had watched all the YouTube videos I mean you could call us  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:48):**  YouTube farmers.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:50):**  There's a there's a difference and I see in my notes because Josh and some nice notes  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:55):**  over the steepest learning curve in the world like I want to know about that.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:17:58):**  Yeah yeah I mean it was an immense learning curve and so we we just jumped straight in  
**[0:18:03-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:03):**  we ended up in Wales we pretty much we the first place we looked at happened to be great  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:10):**  I mean it's not like it was a mistake purchase it was a great purchase but it was the first  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:14):**  place we looked at and we bought it we just said okay we're going to start.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:20):**  And we were actually going to try and get planning permission to build a home an eco  
**[0:18:25-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:25):**  home on the land which is very difficult to do because it's agricultural land but we decided  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:34):**  that we didn't want to get distracted with building a house and so we actually we found  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:39):**  a derelict little cottage a few minutes up the road and we're really lucky so we bought  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:43):**  that and we just started squatting in this in this old Welsh cottage that was very much  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:49):**  in a state and needed a lot of work.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:52):**  And we got distracted with with building a house but you had to rebuild another one basically.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:18:58):**  Exactly yeah but at least we had a roof over our heads you know we are out of the wind  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:02):**  and the rain and a lot of people start this journey in a caravan in a field and actually  
**[0:19:07-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:07):**  we did live in a caravan on our field for three months and that was interesting and  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:16):**  quite exciting but not something I wanted to do long term.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:19):**  But yeah so we were squatting in this little cottage and we just got to work on the land  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:25):**  and we're like right it was the most threatening thing honestly like to look at 10 acres of  
**[0:19:31-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:31):**  pasture and try and okay right now let's build a diverse and profitable and ecologically  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:40):**  sound regenerative farm go.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:43):**  It was like you know imagine a writer staring at a blank page with a writer's block it was  
**[0:19:47-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:47):**  like oh my god how what what are we going to do so yeah we start like what's the first  
**[0:19:54-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:19:54):**  like not with a spreadsheet but like what's the lots of lots of spreadsheets lots of spreadsheets  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:01):**  but it was very much like we were you know everything was a guess everything was just  
**[0:20:06-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:06):**  based on ideas and no practical experience so we had lots of spreadsheets we had where  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:15):**  we actually practically started was on the project that we thought was going to take  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:21):**  the longest so we needed to start first which was our perennial crops so the blueberries  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:26):**  so the first thing we once we had decided roughly what how we were going to earn our  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:31):**  income we decided right let's first get the blueberries in the ground because we know  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:35):**  they're going to take many years to actually become productive and then let's take it from  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:39):**  there and build around that because we knew we wanted to do blueberries they're a high  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:43):**  value crop we had acidic soil we knew of a neighbor who was successfully growing them  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:48):**  so we thought right that's a good it's a good first step let's do that so we started with  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:52):**  the blueberries then we realized oh my goodness there's this problem of having too much grass  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:20:58):**  which we didn't even think about um the grass just grows it rains it rains yeah yeah in  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:04):**  the sun and it just goes yeah yeah we've got the best some of the best grass growth in  
**[0:21:08-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:08):**  the world the grass just grows and you think okay well either i lose my productive land  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:16):**  to scrub and i rewild it or i mow it or i get some animals so we're like right well  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:23):**  we're going to do the sensible thing and get some sheep which may or may not have been  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:28):**  sensible actually i love them and i'm you know i would never regret getting them but  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:32):**  we got our sheep next um and then  
**[0:21:35-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:35):**  on youtube yeah yeah we're yeah watching all the youtube it is actually to be honest i  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:44):**  did start connecting with local um more conventional farmers quite early on i really wanted to  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:50):**  sort of bridge the gap between what did they think of you like typical back to the landers  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:21:57):**  that are gonna hit the landers the let's say the fence because they're in times burn themselves  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:04):**  touch the electric like yeah but they still you still wanted to connect with them yeah  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:09):**  i basically just i basically just went and got really drunk with one of them or a few  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:15):**  of them actually a bunch of them um and that was the best way to do it honestly before  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:20):**  you had a child yeah yeah before i had a child yeah um avi still remembers the night i came  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:26):**  home and it was but it's that's investment in like networking and that's your your your  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:32):**  right of passage on the local community yeah i think i connected with people um that some  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:37):**  of the local farmers really well like that and you know a lot of um barriers were dropped  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:43):**  and a lot of you know they they could see my what my intentions were and that and that  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:47):**  i wasn't like completely off my rocker because there's a huge cultural gap between rural  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:22:53):**  folk and city folk i mean there's just such a huge divide there and um uh you know they  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:01):**  looked at us and we were just you we were just a classic example of townies that had  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:08):**  that had you know that had money and wanted to come and buy some land and live the good  
**[0:23:12-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:12):**  life um and yeah as i said in in one of my youtube videos recently which which you watched  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:21):**  um you know i i was told by several different farmers um there's a saying around here they  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:26):**  arrive in their fancy cars and they leave on their bicycles um and it's because they  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:32):**  have seen it many times and it's actually i talk about the back to the land movement  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:37):**  that we were very much a part of the most recent wave which i i think it seems like  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:42):**  quite a few people started on this journey around 2015 ish it seems like around here  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:47):**  there was this big sudden surge of people moving into the area trying to do this sort  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:52):**  of alternative stuff um but there's been many of these waves before and i've been told by  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:23:58):**  a few locals that happened i think it happened back in the 60s and i think again in the 80s  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:05):**  i can't remember the exact dates but it's happened in on several occasions and most  
**[0:24:11-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:11):**  of the time it ends in in tears in divorce in in debt and financial ruin honestly i mean  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:20):**  it tears people apart because there's this ideal and there's this expectation of the  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:27):**  good life and what it is and what it means and and then there's the reality of mother  
**[0:24:32-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:32):**  nature and and farming and the and and how tough it is and um so so yeah i mean not the  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:42):**  divorce part because that's not the case but the the debt part might be shouldn't be the  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:46):**  case but we are um in the toughness now where do you find yourself now so you you planted  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:53):**  the blueberries you have some sheep but i don't think that's a huge part of i think  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:24:57):**  the flock is 20 or so um or maybe less now but and the main part is duck eggs which you  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:03):**  figure out is an interesting market but now you're being hit by um by input costs by feed  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:10):**  costs which we in the regen movement always say no but the input cost doesn't really reach  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:14):**  us too much but of course if you buy organic grains and and it arrives from somewhere or  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:19):**  or ukraine this year and you're gonna be hit even if you don't get it from ukraine like  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:24):**  prices have gone through the roof if any any energy intensive sector is being hit right  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:30):**  now even if you get your your your green electricity from somewhere it's connected to the gas price  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:35):**  and it explodes so what situation do you find yourself now in i will put the youtube videos  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:41):**  you're documenting this story as it goes every week which i highly recommend people to watch  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:45):**  i'll put it below but where do you find yourself now um and and then we'll unpack a lot of  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:50):**  the backup to the land movement and the potential future of that because that wave is going  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:54):**  to repeat itself i'm not too worried about that but the question is what do we do with  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:25:57):**  it and how do we make some impact on on the land but where do you find yourself now and  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:02):**  why are we recording now because this was going to happen but it wasn't necessarily  
**[0:26:06-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:06):**  scheduled for the end of october 2022 um right so i mean to cut to the chase our farm is  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:13):**  about to go bankrupt and we've pretty much just got november like our cash flows tells  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:19):**  us that you reach the end of november and unless you figure something out that's game  
**[0:26:23-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:23):**  over and um so um i i decided to start a little series on youtube called how to fail at farming  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:34):**  and i i did that because i thought right if we're gonna go under if this is gonna be it  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:41):**  um i have to extract some value out of this failure you know i have to take something  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:47):**  good away from it um and i i want to help um educate people about the realities of small  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:26:55):**  scale agriculture and agriculture in general and how tough it is um and i want to share  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:02):**  our learnings with people i want to share what i think we've done wrong what we could  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:05):**  have done better how we're going to potentially get out of this um and i yeah i decided i'd  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:11):**  i'd like to document the process because no matter what happens um i think that that will  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:16):**  be of value to the community moving forward um and so yeah i mean the main thing that  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:23):**  nailed us or is nailing us is these rising is the rising cost of feeds linked to uh russia  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:30):**  and ukraine and the global and just to give us an idea like what yeah what what kind of  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:36):**  percentages are you looking at now or what kind of money like cash flow going out basically  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:42):**  and yeah i mean every month just to to see how yeah how tight or how negative it got  
**[0:27:49-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:27:49):**  yeah i mean um our costs have increased um by more than 50 um since since i installed  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:00):**  our new feed bin so our feed silo that we've got which was last year um early last year  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:06):**  we installed that feed bin so that we could benefit from bulk food prices you know before  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:11):**  then i was buying bagged feed and i was hauling it by hand and so our prices have gone up  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:19):**  by more than 50 when you accommodate when you factor in all the other inflation across  
**[0:28:23-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:23):**  all of the other costs in our business um and you know it's it's hard to um even though  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:32):**  they should know retailers it's hard to get them to to understand the speed at which you  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:39):**  have to put your prices up and i have now the the supply our main supply that we're  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:45):**  our main um customer that we're with now has agreed to a very steep price increase with  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:51):**  us and it remains to be seen what exactly um how that will impact the demand for our  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:28:57):**  eggs but luckily we've got some very very good customers who really care so i think  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:02):**  we'll be supported in that way but our business you know there are we have to our feed bill  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:07):**  every month is is thousands um and for for such a small business like us that is massive  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:14):**  um now people who who've watched the youtube series so far we've done part one and part  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:19):**  two will know that we've just recently culled a large portion of of our flock and that's  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:25):**  to help reduce our feed bill um and i think that the other thing that i i do want to make  
**[0:29:31-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:31):**  people i really want to emphasize that although the feed bill has really been the nail in  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:38):**  the coffin i think that it's important that we take responsibility for the fact that there  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:44):**  are other factors at play here other reasons why we're in trouble and um you know a lot  
**[0:29:50-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:50):**  of that is due to the fact that we are inexperienced farmers you know that we spent the first sort  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:29:57):**  of five years figuring out exactly how this whole farming thing really works yeah and  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:03):**  separating the you know myths from actual um you know fact from fiction that you the  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:09):**  fiction that you see on youtube from the actual facts on the ground for people who are trying  
**[0:30:14-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:14):**  to earn a living full-time farming um and we also have certain ideals you know ideals  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:23):**  about how we want to run the farm how we want to keep our animals and those ideals make  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:28):**  it very difficult to make it more difficult to be profitable um and and there is a reason  
**[0:30:34-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:34):**  why farmers do things the way they do um and we're learning the hard way so um so so that  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:43):**  those are sort of some of the part those are some of the reasons as to why we're in the  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:48):**  situation we're in but the businesses um as i said you know it's crunch time for us um  
**[0:30:55-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:30:55):**  this is a this is a cash flow issue for us um and it's happened very quickly um and i  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:03):**  i think the other thing to to mention is that there's you know i've been contacted by quite  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:08):**  a few people since releasing those videos saying you know they don't fully understand  
**[0:31:14-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:14):**  um the mechanics of poultry businesses like you know they they think for example that  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:23):**  our ducks could potentially forage more land or that potentially we're not managing our  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:29):**  grassland properly in order to help feed the animals or that we should be somehow growing  
**[0:31:34-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:34):**  our own food or feed for the poultry um for our ducks and i think it's because regenerative  
**[0:31:42-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:42):**  agriculture is generally there's a a lot of the focus is on ruminants on grazing animals  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:49):**  and with poultry it's a whole different story you know they need grain or they need some  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:31:54):**  nutrient-dense food yeah they don't have that ability to turn grass into into except for  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:00):**  geese right if i understand correct like except for geese yeah would that be why did you go  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:05):**  for ducks not for geese because you're talking that video that i mentioned at the beginning  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:08):**  um like they have this unique opportunity or unique capability sorry of actually foraging  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:15):**  and still create high nutrient-dense protein in shape of eggs and meat and what what i  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:22):**  mean was geese even more difficult than ducks to find like duck eggs are geese eggs even  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:26):**  more difficult to to sell than duck eggs or is that a feature i wouldn't say thought or  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:32):**  idea like to find a one poultry species in this case geese that actually can forage and  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:36):**  doesn't need all of that or maybe even none of it uh in terms of outside um very expensive  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:43):**  at the moment fee yeah yeah it's a really good question and i've i've i've put so much  
**[0:32:48-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:48):**  thought into geese and and um i really love the theory behind it um what's the practice  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:32:55):**  yeah we've had geese we actually recently um got rid of our geese because uh over the  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:01):**  years we've just realized simplify simplify simplify focus focus focus on what you're  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:06):**  good at and what you're doing and um the geese were really creating some issues for us specifically  
**[0:33:12-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:12):**  when we had to lock down the birds during avian flu so uh we we we decided to to to  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:19):**  simplify things there but with geese they're amazing you know they they have that ability  
**[0:33:24-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:24):**  to turn grass into forage um unlike um sorry to turn forage and grass into actual meat  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:31):**  you you wouldn't really keep your geese for eggs that's not they don't you know they produce  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:36):**  maybe 30 eggs a year compared to a khaki campbell that does roughly 300 eggs a year you would  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:42):**  really be keeping the geese for the meat uh it's what we in the uk at least would have  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:48):**  eaten for christmas dinner you know much more commonly than say turkey um so it was it was  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:33:55):**  really a traditional christmas roast um the meat is delicious there's lots of fat on it  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:00):**  it's much more moist than turkey is although i know a lot of people say you just got to  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:04):**  cook the turkey right which i've never managed to do but um geese is geese is absolutely  
**[0:34:10-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:10):**  delicious um uh as we were gonna yeah there's yeah there's no methane as far as i know which  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:18):**  i find really amazing because they don't really use um from what i understand they don't use  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:22):**  fermentation to actually digest the grass it's their unique gizzard which actually does  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:28):**  that breaking down um and uh they have to eat constantly and they there's actually quite  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:34):**  a lot of waste when when it comes out the grasses you know they have these really big  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:38):**  green poos which look almost like unprocessed grass but they they managed to do it by just  
**[0:34:44-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:44):**  constantly eating which is is it good for the land like is that uh is it a good grazer  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:51):**  quote unquote yeah they're very good lawnmowers they they are they're very good lawnmowers  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:34:56):**  i'm sorry i was interrupting you were saying if we would like what what is there a future  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:01):**  place for geese on the farm if like a year from now we're talking to farmers yeah if  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:06):**  we were going to get into geese it would be for the meat and um and you know this is another  
**[0:35:11-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:11):**  example of of um i i have i take issue with minute scale agriculture very small scale  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:19):**  agriculture and this is one of the reasons is because you know they talk a lot about  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:24):**  diversity and stacking enterprises and and so geese was one of those examples which we  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:30):**  were trying to add into the mix but if we were going to process geese for meat to do  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:34):**  that effectively it would be another capital investment that we'd have to make because  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:39):**  we'd need that abattoir we'd need to be able to process the birds processing you need a  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:45):**  few thousand birds at least a year probably more yeah yeah you need you need enough birds  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:50):**  to to justify it um you know you need the correct equipment processing geese is actually  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:35:56):**  very difficult like processing chickens easiest ducks is the next step up in terms of difficulty  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:02):**  because of all their down and how hard it is to pluck um and then geese are even further  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:08):**  up there so they're very difficult to process they're also very seasonal people tend to  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:12):**  only want them during christmas um or sort of around uh winter time they take quite long  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:19):**  to grow and finish um and so you've got a large portion of the year where you're working  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:26):**  on growing these geese and then a very small window of of time to sell and then also sort  
**[0:36:31-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:31):**  of sell all of them pre-service yeah yeah so it's not a business you can just easily  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:39):**  stack on top and just make a bit of extra money left and right now you need to do this  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:44):**  full time and only yeah almost only if i had um another if i was doing a meat business  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:50):**  with say um some chickens or ducks already and already had the processing facility and  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:36:56):**  the license and everything sure i i don't think i think it would make a lot of sense  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:01):**  to add geese into the mix but as an egg producer as a primarily primarily as an egg producer  
**[0:37:06-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:06):**  it's just a whole nother level of investment for us so another yeah um so coming back to  
**[0:37:16-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:16):**  the the feed issue with ducks is that you know you can't uh you can't rely on acreage  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:23):**  to feed your ducks you have to rely on ghost acreage you know you have to rely on arable  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:28):**  grain producers to help you feed your ducks or your chickens or whatever poultry you might  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:33):**  have um and you know people say well then you shouldn't have poultry or they're not  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:39):**  well on 10 acres you can't keep ruminants and make a business it's just not possible  
**[0:37:45-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:45):**  you know um i i would in order to make a business like a snow scale dairy or something i'm joking  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:53):**  no but it's yeah i mean i mean you could but you're you're you're not gonna make any money  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:37:58):**  or very you could try you're not gonna make enough money basically um and so when you've  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:03):**  got 10 acres you've got limited options i mean i basically i basically put it down to  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:09):**  two options you've got poultry if you want to do livestock or you've got market gardening  
**[0:38:15-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:15):**  and the market gardening things i i've i've tried both um i haven't tried market gardening  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:23):**  at the same level of intensity as the ducks because that was our primary focus we did  
**[0:38:27-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:27):**  a bit of market gardening alongside the poultry um but the problem is locally here you know  
**[0:38:35-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:35):**  there's not um there isn't that easy to access market to go and do our to do a veg box scheme  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:43):**  really we've we've already got some very well established um uh market gardeners slash wholesalers  
**[0:38:50-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:50):**  and area who do a great job we also have a lot of really small family-run retailers who  
**[0:38:57-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:38:57):**  buy in from you know the local wholesaler um and and you know people have that community  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:05):**  they have those those little high streets and the space with the place where they go  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:09):**  and they buy their veg and um it's not like it's not like maybe a city where all of its  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:15):**  supermarket veg and you want to maybe come and disrupt things and you want to say hey  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:20):**  don't go to the supermarket come to me buy the veg directly and buy a veg box and you  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:25):**  know i don't really want to go and say hey stop buying from your local family small retailer  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:31):**  on the high street and come and buy directly from directly from us yeah no no yeah so in  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:36):**  our context leaves poetry basically yeah so it leaves poultry if you really and i should  
**[0:39:42-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:42):**  also clarify because our goals from the start were and this was a bit too idealistic really  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:49):**  and this is one of my lessons that i've learnt is our goals from the start was we were going  
**[0:39:53-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:39:53):**  to be 100% farm farmers on the farm no side hustles no other income and and that was our  
**[0:40:00-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:00):**  goal and and you know i was warned by the other farmers the the real farmers 10 acres  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:06):**  yeah it's i was warned josh that's not you're not going to build to do that and being the  
**[0:40:11-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:11):**  type of person i am i dug my heels in and i said no i'm going to show you that on 10  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:17):**  because i'm going to be a farmer producing nothing other than food and i'm going to make  
**[0:40:22-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:22):**  it work and that was too idealistic and so a lot of the time you see other people making  
**[0:40:31-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:31):**  small scale farming sort of work in i'm doing quote unquote yeah that with airbnb tourism  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:40):**  courses experiences dinner i mean anything else than selling pure food yeah yeah yeah  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:46):**  i think like 90 plus i'm getting the numbers wrong lauren is gonna manning's gonna kill  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:52):**  me um but i think in even in the us on large scale commercial farms the majority i'm gonna  
**[0:40:58-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:40:58):**  say somewhere in 80 90 percent has an off-farm job for sure also for medical reasons for  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:05):**  health care reasons and insurance with other other reasons just a pure cash but even there  
**[0:41:09-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:09):**  at that scale um most farmers or most farming families have an off-site an on an off-farm  
**[0:41:16-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:16):**  job to keep the lights on which is very scary if you think about it it's very scary and  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:23):**  you know i mean the real farmers around here um they not only do they have a a job on the  
**[0:41:29-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:29):**  side like hgv driving which pays pretty well actually especially these days um or contracting  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:37):**  using the kit that they've got um the tractors and whatnot but they've they also tend to  
**[0:41:42-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:42):**  have hundreds of acres and they are claiming subsidies on that acreage so in our case we  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:49):**  were farming if you think about it yeah yeah i mean you know they don't get me wrong they're  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:55):**  putting a lot of hours in and they're working hard about something else i just want to say  
**[0:41:58-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:41:58):**  is since arriving here i have never met a people or um and in like a community of people  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:07):**  that work as hard as farmers i mean they are hard we just put out an interview like this  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:13):**  week of the laziest farmer of the uk i listened to the math that's right yeah and and it's  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:18):**  interesting that the whole definition of i have to work until like i have to burn the  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:23):**  midnight oil and and in summer i have to be on my tractor until midnight and it's it's  
**[0:42:29-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:29):**  very interesting it's probably a lot of that is needed but also a lot of that is is part  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:33):**  of that and he said yeah i'm too lazy to farm against nature like if we did the the conventional  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:39):**  extractive system is also extremely our intensive and does not sustainably mentally like you  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:45):**  cannot do that forever and i hope that that's fine and if you're not making like if you  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:50):**  did it for a few years and and your farm is getting off the ground and your your system  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:42:55):**  is starting to work etc no it's a slow hill like it's a it's a downhill slowly or vastly  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:00):**  and i can only imagine the level of stress i think that the farmer suicide rates everywhere  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:05):**  in the world are way it's like one of the most dangerous jobs and it's the highest suicides  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:10):**  it's crazy i believe farming is the highest uh suicide rate of any other industry from  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:15):**  what i understand and but i can tell you another reason you went there like let's from the  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:19):**  city you wanted to be outside work a lot uh deal with your anxiety yeah it's probably  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:25):**  not the combination you want to bring to farming looking back i mean um i i'll say that farmers  
**[0:43:30-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:30):**  like um multi-generation farmers so not um you know not really first generation farmers  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:37):**  like myself but guys who have guys and girls who've been in this business for many generations  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:43):**  and grown up with it they are cuts from a different cloth i mean they they work hard  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:48):**  and they work in rough conditions and for very little pay and it's it never ceases to  
**[0:43:53-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:43:53):**  amaze me and it's just incredible um but you know our situation as i was saying not only  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:01):**  were we trying to do it without a job on the side or a non-agricultural related enterprise  
**[0:44:06-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:06):**  like abnb which we now do have because we realized um but we will also we're also just  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:14):**  we don't even qualify for subsidies you can't get any subsidies on 10 acres you have to  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:19):**  be slightly bigger and even then you know basically the more acreage you have the more  
**[0:44:24-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:24):**  fun subsidies you can claim so it is a case of size helps a lot um so we were in november  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:34):**  yeah let's talk about what needs to happen now to get you through the winter and i want  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:38):**  to hear your future vision you're going to do a massive airbnb experience with fiber  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:43):**  up to cable and remote working or something else on the farming side but what needs to  
**[0:44:47-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:47):**  happen now and what are you going to do to basically solve not solve but yeah solve the  
**[0:44:52-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:52):**  cash flow issue and get you through the winter and is that enough because are you like expecting  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:44:59):**  that that feed cost will come down or what happens after the winter um yeah first of  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:05):**  all we're definitely not going to do any more than one abnb um and i'll talk why it's also  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:10):**  a lot of work um uh yeah when you work it out per hour pays a hell of a lot better than  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:15):**  farming but um i don't i i'm still have ideals about being a primarily a food producer and  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:21):**  i and i don't i don't want to turn it into a big campsite you know that's i i think it's  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:26):**  great having one abnb there people need to be able to come visit the farm it's a good  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:30):**  extra bit of income but i i definitely don't want to turn it into a big campsite um where  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:36):**  we are now is as i said end of november if we don't generate it um around about five  
**[0:45:42-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:42):**  thousand pounds is is is the minimum that we need to see us through the winter um and  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:48):**  so the plan is actually to run a crowdfunding campaign uh to help generate that that cash  
**[0:45:53-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:53):**  now actually when i started the youtube channel that wasn't our intention you know that we  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:45:59):**  only did it because first of all my best friend from south africa rang me up and he was like  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:04):**  josh man you you can't you can't you've been doing this for seven years you can't just  
**[0:46:08-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:08):**  let this whole thing fall apart you need to you need to um you need to do a crowd funder  
**[0:46:15-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:15):**  and he said that and then i started getting a lot of comments on the video like i would  
**[0:46:19-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:19):**  support you i'd do a go fund me whatever so i and we were very reluctant because i you  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:26):**  know because you're making it work yeah yeah we see that even more as failure and you know  
**[0:46:33-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:33):**  we are we see ourselves as a commercial business not a not a charity but so we've actually  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:39):**  we've come up with an idea for um we're going to do a crowd funder but there will be rewards  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:45):**  that people get back and there'll be very real things that they can get in return so  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:48):**  we're not just going to take you're going to ship eggs to south africa no no i i happen  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:46:54):**  to know from experience they ship very badly um you can only imagine the mess yeah yeah  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:00):**  um but uh but yeah so okay so we're going to do a crowd funding with rewards and yeah  
**[0:47:07-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:07):**  and for about 5k which sounds possible i mean depends on your crowd obviously and let's  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:13):**  hope some of the crowd is listening to this uh because that would be already let's say  
**[0:47:17-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:17):**  for the space to see the transition to make sure you make it and then enable you to go  
**[0:47:23-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:23):**  through a transition would be very interesting not that next year you'll be in the same issue  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:27):**  and have to keep that that i think is your reluctance not wanting to to keep asking the  
**[0:47:32-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:32):**  crowd to keep going and does not know financially stable no so one thing you know we've had  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:39):**  to think very hard about this because one thing we do not want to do is we do not want  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:44):**  to just limp along we don't we don't want to take you know five grand and then sort  
**[0:47:48-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:48):**  of get to next year i use this emergency to to fit yeah to to to get to reinvent ourselves  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:47:55):**  or to go down or get to the next level yeah yeah yeah we need to we need to um either  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:01):**  we need to fail fast or we need to and and just and just no depth you know change our  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:06):**  lives and do something else or we need to actually figure out how are we going to sustainably  
**[0:48:10-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:10):**  move this forward on 10 acres you can sell the farm to the next back to the land movement  
**[0:48:14-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:14):**  that's probably happening like every seven years i mean if they study this they've already  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:17):**  seen it's like some kind of exactly there are there are plenty of people out there who  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:22):**  want to have a go just like we did um and i and i would just i would just tell them  
**[0:48:27-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:27):**  go for it but just don't quit your day job basically um so uh you know we've actually  
**[0:48:36-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:36):**  got some very interesting opportunities on the horizon we've got um i guess without uh  
**[0:48:42-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:42):**  for confidentiality reasons without talking about it in great detail um there is a farm  
**[0:48:49-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:49):**  in europe that wants to buy hatching eggs from us and that being fertilized duck eggs  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:48:56):**  which they can then incubate and then they can basically get our genetics of khaki campbells  
**[0:49:01-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:01):**  onto their farm um and suddenly your 10 acres let's say multiplies the whole seed thing  
**[0:49:09-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:09):**  is very interesting we're going to do another episode on that in the nutrient density yeah  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:13):**  and and the genetics and selling and selling to others your it's an input but it's not  
**[0:49:19-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:19):**  really an input like then suddenly with 10 acres you can i'm imagining i don't know how  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:23):**  that works in duck eggs but you can let's say touch a lot more more hectares and acres  
**[0:49:28-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:28):**  and touch a lot more more people yeah exactly i mean hatching eggs are incredibly more valuable  
**[0:49:37-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:37):**  than table eggs um like immensely so so that would what is immensely 10x 50x 100x uh like  
**[0:49:46-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:46):**  you know you're talking um sort of um 40 pence an egg table eggs um compared to uh which  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:49:55):**  is we are very by the way anyone listening should know we are not failing because we're  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:00):**  not niche enough and we're not premium enough okay we are the uk's only organic duck egg  
**[0:50:05-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:05):**  producer and uh talking about a niche and and we yeah and we sell our eggs i i mean  
**[0:50:12-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:12):**  i'd imagine our eggs are probably the most expensive in the uk um so that's not why we're  
**[0:50:18-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:18):**  failing um but yes our eggs our eggs are about 40 pence each um and you know hatching egg  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:24):**  depending on the volumes you're selling it but at small volumes you're selling at a two  
**[0:50:28-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:28):**  pound 50 an egg um you know so it's it's many times greater and and it makes a huge difference  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:35):**  to our business so and is that easy to do probably not otherwise they wouldn't be searching  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:39):**  for you they would be trying to find somebody on the continent it's it's it's not hard to  
**[0:50:44-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:44):**  do you know you ultimately just have to set up a breeding group and you have to but the  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:50):**  thing is you need the right genetics and so which is when it comes yeah when it comes  
**[0:50:54-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:50:54):**  to khaki campbells um and the ducks that we keep um which is a type of ducks just for  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:00):**  people to yeah yeah it's a specific genetics yeah we keep um campbell breeds all focused  
**[0:51:06-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:06):**  on egg laying and and the three breeds we've got are dark campbells um khaki campbells  
**[0:51:12-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:12):**  and welsh harlequins which um which are also actually campbells um and you know they're  
**[0:51:18-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:18):**  like for for years obviously on yeah quality like on laying on easiness and disease i mean  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:24):**  you've been selecting and now maybe in a position to start selling yeah exactly so those duck  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:29):**  breeds are pretty rare um first of all just the fact that there are very few duck egg  
**[0:51:35-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:35):**  producers in the uk let alone actually uh organic uh certified duck egg producers so  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:43):**  you don't get many farmers who have that sort of volume those population numbers like we  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:48):**  do to select from you know you've got lots of backyard people with ducks but they've  
**[0:51:53-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:53):**  got small populations and those populations are coming from other places which are not  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:51:59):**  breeding in the same way that we're breeding so i actually i look at our breeding program  
**[0:52:04-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:04):**  as a regenerative breeding program which the way we go about it is um is you know we are  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:12):**  breeding for every generation to be better than the previous one and we're doing that  
**[0:52:17-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:17):**  by brutally selecting out birds that don't meet our requirement requirements where um  
**[0:52:25-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:25):**  withholding as much um how do i say we're muddy coddling and care and you know we're  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:34):**  giving them um a natural environment and we're saying we're not going to give you all the  
**[0:52:39-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:39):**  additional medication and parasite wormers and we're not going to basically who makes  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:45):**  it we're going to the toughies yeah yeah it's survival of the fittest and we're not going  
**[0:52:49-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:49):**  to try and optimize your performance through inputs you know if a bird if it is an animal  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:54):**  welfare issue and then we do the same process with our sheep and i'm really stoked about  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:52:59):**  where we've got to with our flock of sheep but if there's an animal welfare issue we  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:04):**  immediately treat them we sort them out we make sure they're happy but they get a black  
**[0:53:08-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:08):**  mark and they do not move into the next flock and our criteria that we that we have when  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:15):**  selecting are much stricter than what people usually have like for example with our sheep  
**[0:53:20-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:20):**  if a sheep has to be if a sheep gives birth and we have to pull that lamb we're not happy  
**[0:53:25-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:25):**  because we've got a big lamb we're really annoyed because we have to pull the lamb um  
**[0:53:30-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:30):**  we we want sheep that and that is very common amongst farming community is you know they're  
**[0:53:36-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:36):**  they're proud about how many lambs they've pulled and how big the lamb was when it came  
**[0:53:39-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:39):**  out so how unique is that approach like that genetic approach also in sheep because i i  
**[0:53:46-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:46):**  sense that there's another opportunity there as well like to get these genetics right on  
**[0:53:51-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:51):**  low input low input also in terms of time and resources and having to pull sheep or  
**[0:53:56-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:53:56):**  having to medicate ducks which for sure is not easy like how unique is that approach  
**[0:54:02-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:02):**  to creating the tuffies i think it's i think it's quite unique actually like even if people  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:08):**  say that they you know everyone says that they're selecting the best of the flock for  
**[0:54:13-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:13):**  the next generation means something else but in this case it's like it's like okay you're  
**[0:54:19-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:19):**  saying you selected the best but um you know how much attention how much like resources  
**[0:54:25-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:25):**  did you give those though that flock through the year like how many inputs and resources  
**[0:54:30-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:30):**  did you get to get that animal to look like that and perform like that and so we we've  
**[0:54:35-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:35):**  been from the very beginning giving we kind of call we call it minimal intervention and  
**[0:54:41-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:41):**  that is we give them as little as possible and we see how they do and if there's an issue  
**[0:54:47-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:47):**  we treat it and then they don't get bred from and we have lots of criteria that we score  
**[0:54:53-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:53):**  them against and then from and then we select them for breeding so regenerative mark shepherd  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:54:59):**  calls it like what is it stun sheer yeah sheer total out of neglect that's right yeah yeah  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:05):**  i don't know maybe it's a bit tricky but yeah you get the idea yeah i i don't i don't actually  
**[0:55:10-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:10):**  neglect them um but uh you know and he uses that principle with plants right and we've  
**[0:55:16-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:16):**  actually done the same thing with our blueberry patch which is a whole nother story um but  
**[0:55:20-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:20):**  so yeah regenerative breeding so our genetics um we also happen to get our khaki campbells  
**[0:55:27-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:27):**  came from um a farm uh they're called a family called the court langs and they have a farm  
**[0:55:36-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:36):**  and i i don't know exactly how many generations i someone said to me they've been breeding  
**[0:55:42-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:42):**  khaki campbells for seven generations um i'm not sure if that number is but the family  
**[0:55:48-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:48):**  yeah uh that the yeah the family have been breeding khaki campbell ducks how many generations  
**[0:55:55-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:55:55):**  of ducks that's generations oh many yeah yeah so i and i i say seven you know people don't  
**[0:56:03-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:03):**  think it could be less but they've been doing it pretty much the longest of anyone and and  
**[0:56:09-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:09):**  they're actually known all around the world for for their um genetics now that's where  
**[0:56:14-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:14):**  our original khaki campbell genetics came from and then in 2020 when covet kicked off  
**[0:56:19-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:19):**  um very last minute i found out that peter court lang um who was the last you know member  
**[0:56:27-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:27):**  of that family uh or the sort of the last member who still wanted to farm he decided  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:33):**  to retire and no one else wanted to take over the family business so he sold it on to someone  
**[0:56:37-0:56:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:37):**  else that other person seems to not be doing a hell of a lot with with the flock that he  
**[0:56:44-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:44):**  got um and we were like well we're sitting on 200 ducks right now that came from peter  
**[0:56:49-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:49):**  um and we need to breed our we basically we we were like we got to start breeding our  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:55):**  own duck so we we got into that so the genetics that we've got already make an attempt to  
**[0:56:59-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:56:59):**  buy the other one or not did we make an attempt before peter i don't know no by the time we  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:05):**  heard from peter um it was already he had already found a buyer and sold all of his  
**[0:57:10-0:57:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:10):**  incubators and everything so it made you aware like okay we need to be there's not going  
**[0:57:16-0:57:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:16):**  to be a place anymore to buy our our future fox so we need to do it ourselves yeah and  
**[0:57:22-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:22):**  certainly not the quality that we were expecting so of course so we we we had a really good  
**[0:57:27-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:27):**  stock to begin with and we built up from there and then we've applied our regenerative breeding  
**[0:57:31-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:31):**  principles to that um and so we've got these so coming right back to your original question  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:38):**  sort of and what's um how are we going to get through the winter and what's next so  
**[0:57:44-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:44):**  one of the potential options for us in the future is to is to really sell our genetics  
**[0:57:49-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:49):**  and to um take the role of you know to the role of a leading breeder in in that in that  
**[0:57:56-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:57:56):**  space for khaki campbell ducks and this farm in europe wants hatching eggs from us and  
**[0:58:02-0:58:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:02):**  the very unique thing is they want quite a lot of hatching eggs from us and it'll be  
**[0:58:07-0:58:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:07):**  a long period of of supplying them hatching eggs because they want to build up their flock  
**[0:58:13-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:13):**  they want to build up a flock of of khaki campbells and they don't have access to them  
**[0:58:17-0:58:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:17):**  so um that's one opportunity on the on the horizon but it's not guaranteed it's it's  
**[0:58:23-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:23):**  sitting there to kick off in march but it's it's not a hundred things can happen until  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:29):**  march yeah yeah and and we are very close we've been through a long process of getting  
**[0:58:35-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:35):**  an export license with defra and as far as i know they are crossing i's and dotting the  
**[0:58:42-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:42):**  t's um dotting the i's and crossing the t's um and we should have our export license pretty  
**[0:58:48-0:58:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:48):**  soon to do that so um so that's an opportunity on the horizon um and then uh and then there  
**[0:58:56-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:58:56):**  are other there are other aspects so there's another opportunity there which is obviously  
**[0:59:02-0:59:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:02):**  the airbnb will kick off next year because it'll be it'll be season again and we were  
**[0:59:07-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:07):**  just too late with that this year so our airbnb was only ready at the end of the season so  
**[0:59:12-0:59:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:12):**  the airbnb will help next year but the the next really big opportunity for us and the  
**[0:59:17-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:17):**  what i'm very excited about is essentially to produce um a super compost from our duck  
**[0:59:24-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:24):**  manure and so we have these aspirations for the farm moving forward if we can get through  
**[0:59:30-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:30):**  the winter if we can get over this hump and we can survive um where we want to ultimately  
**[0:59:37-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:37):**  take the business on our 10 acres we we need to be profitable and we need to be comfortably  
**[0:59:45-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:45):**  we need to be more resilient and we just you know we are suffering right now with the feed  
**[0:59:51-0:59:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:51):**  price increase because we're just not resilient enough and we we we admit that um and so moving  
**[0:59:59-1:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=0:59:59):**  forward we need to be more profitable and more resilient and we have this vision for  
**[1:00:04-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:04):**  uh two things apart from the genetics one is to um to produce a carbon negative duck  
**[1:00:11-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:11):**  egg um and i've got a lot of work to actually color i want it to be calculated and i want  
**[1:00:18-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:18):**  it to be calculated properly you know i don't i don't want to green wash this i want this  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:23):**  to be a proper sum maybe we can only get to carbon neutral and that'll be fine too but  
**[1:00:30-1:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:30):**  if we could get carbon negative i'd be very happy um so we want to produce um carbon negative  
**[1:00:37-1:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:37):**  duck eggs most of that work is going to be on the the the ghost acre it's basically um  
**[1:00:42-1:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:42):**  on the grain side or what what where do you see the work that needs to be done because  
**[1:00:48-1:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:48):**  it sounds like on the farm itself at least on the the grazing of the ducks which obviously  
**[1:00:52-1:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:52):**  don't graze a lot like that there's a limit there that you reach already reached or it  
**[1:00:57-1:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:00:57):**  will reach pretty quickly even though all youtube commenters are saying you should grow  
**[1:01:01-1:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:01):**  your own feet etc etc yeah how are you going to get your carbon positive or neutral or  
**[1:01:06-1:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:06):**  negative whatever the right direction is let's say one you get the picture how do you get  
**[1:01:11-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:11):**  to yeah so yeah it's a very good question when we rely on so many ghost acres how how  
**[1:01:17-1:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:17):**  are we going to get to carbon negative or neutral and the way i see us doing that is  
**[1:01:23-1:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:23):**  um first of all we need to get off the soy as quick as possible and and that's the that  
**[1:01:29-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:29):**  is the big sticking point for all poultry producers is how do you get off the soy train  
**[1:01:34-1:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:34):**  um so we we we want to move over to black soldier fly larvae production and i've talked  
**[1:01:42-1:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:42):**  about this and now now we own my whole different youtube community yeah yeah so um there are  
**[1:01:48-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:48):**  technologies coming out you know a lot of people like oh why don't you just do black  
**[1:01:53-1:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:53):**  soldier flies in your polytunnel or like don't worry everybody that says that i've seen the  
**[1:01:58-1:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:01:58):**  first factories from the inside we've done due diligence at a fund i used to work with  
**[1:02:02-1:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:02):**  yeah and it's fascinating very possible but not easy at all talking about genetics of  
**[1:02:10-1:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:10):**  flies good luck yeah like this is something you need to do at a yeah this is not this  
**[1:02:15-1:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:15):**  is not something you can do at the side in in a room you have left over exactly exactly  
**[1:02:21-1:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:21):**  and and the other thing is you know black soldier fly lives are native to to the uk  
**[1:02:27-1:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:27):**  so they don't survive through the winters here um although climate change might change  
**[1:02:31-1:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:31):**  that but and then then yeah that's always the thing always the point everybody raises  
**[1:02:36-1:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:36):**  don't worry if they escape i've seen rooms full of these flies don't worry if they escaped  
**[1:02:39-1:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:39):**  anyway die in the winter yeah if the winters get warmer we might get into other licensing  
**[1:02:44-1:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:44):**  issues yeah yeah so it doesn't come without its um complications um how much would that  
**[1:02:49-1:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:49):**  fix like how much would that like help you because they are able to and some other insects  
**[1:02:54-1:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:02:54):**  but this specifically to turn low grade food waste brewery waste or any kind of sludge  
**[1:03:03-1:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:03):**  basically into protein into insects and i've seen living examples like living insects feeding  
**[1:03:09-1:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:09):**  them to poultry is very interesting for the poultry because they it triggers something  
**[1:03:13-1:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:13):**  compared to pellets they get or compared to grain but how much would that be like the  
**[1:03:17-1:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:17):**  protein thing would that fix a lot of your issues and or would it just fit a small percentage  
**[1:03:23-1:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:23):**  of feed issue and you still have to buy a different somewhere else it's um it only fixes  
**[1:03:28-1:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:28):**  part of um it only gets us part of the way to a carbon neutral or negative egg um but  
**[1:03:33-1:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:33):**  it is a huge part of that i mean i don't i don't know in percentage terms and i haven't  
**[1:03:39-1:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:39):**  got the exact numbers but i know that our biggest impact by far is in the soy that we  
**[1:03:46-1:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:46):**  consume as a farm so moving moving the poultry over to black soldier flies by taking local  
**[1:03:53-1:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:53):**  food waste and then converting that into insects and then feeding that to the ducks you know  
**[1:03:58-1:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:03:58):**  you're hitting on multiple things they first of all you're helping redirect food waste  
**[1:04:03-1:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:03):**  um away from landfill and um and that creates a lot of methane production and that's pretty  
**[1:04:09-1:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:09):**  bad in itself um and then you turn it into protein and then you're forgoing your soya  
**[1:04:15-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:15):**  consumption which comes from another part of the world and potentially is involved in  
**[1:04:19-1:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:19):**  deforestation etc so there's a massive improvement there by switching over to black soldier flies  
**[1:04:26-1:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:26):**  does it do anything for the taste and nutrient density of the eggs oh oh yeah i mean on that  
**[1:04:32-1:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:32):**  point of view uh that's the other thing is like we we really carbon negative and the  
**[1:04:36-1:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:36):**  most healthy egg in the world yeah there's the most nutrient dense egg because by the  
**[1:04:41-1:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:41):**  way duck eggs are a lot more nutritious than chicken eggs and i i'm a big fan of duck eggs  
**[1:04:45-1:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:45):**  in general so we you know we could potentially move towards being one of the most nutritious  
**[1:04:50-1:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:50):**  and nutrient dense eggs in the world as well okay but i'm imagining this is like a massive  
**[1:04:56-1:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:04:56):**  undertaking like does it make sense on 10 acres yeah so um i've actually had a conversation  
**[1:05:02-1:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:02):**  with a gentleman from a different company that do black soldier fly love it like a lot  
**[1:05:06-1:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:06):**  of people have seen in my videos i referenced um uh better origin um and i know what's the  
**[1:05:14-1:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:14):**  other one called now anyway yeah the container size you buy your plug plug and play and it  
**[1:05:19-1:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:19):**  should work yeah they they won't they won't talk to me i'm um i'm too small scale and  
**[1:05:25-1:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:25):**  it wouldn't be realistic but this other guy that i've spoken with um we had a we had a  
**[1:05:29-1:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:29):**  chat and it sounds like um if i could get the flock up to a thousand ducks where we're  
**[1:05:36-1:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:36):**  you know we've been sitting at 500 if i could get the flock up to a thousand ducks it would  
**[1:05:40-1:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:40):**  make commercial sense i would match the current cost of feed um by by renting his shipping  
**[1:05:48-1:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:48):**  container because that has a monthly cost that goes out and then i saw the mannish is  
**[1:05:53-1:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:53):**  it he manages the shipping no i manage it it's on the farm i source local food waste  
**[1:05:59-1:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:05:59):**  i blend that food waste i feed it into this container in a tube and the soldier flies  
**[1:06:04-1:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:04):**  eat that um and then i feed the flies to the uh all the should i say the larvae to the  
**[1:06:09-1:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:09):**  uh to the ducks um so which fixes a huge issue for processing these because that's a massive  
**[1:06:18-1:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:18):**  alive i'm gonna say a warning it sounds really nice on youtube videos but yeah it's the blending  
**[1:06:25-1:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:25):**  it getting the right feed mix i think as always like garbage in garbage out and but it's fascinating  
**[1:06:32-1:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:32):**  to okay so you need to to to make any commercial sense it needs to be double the flock and  
**[1:06:36-1:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:36):**  then you can do a big yeah but let me let me just say you get a lot of you get a lot  
**[1:06:40-1:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:40):**  of fertilizer out of it as well that's the big thing with soldier flies actually it's  
**[1:06:43-1:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:43):**  not necessarily yes the protein it's what they what they shit basically which makes  
**[1:06:48-1:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:48):**  it yeah potentially even more interesting from a from a cash flow perspective yeah so  
**[1:06:53-1:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:53):**  um i i just want to say this is a pretty you know this is a big idea and and to make this  
**[1:06:59-1:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:06:59):**  happen is is not going to be easy but um it is the future of poultry and possibly pig  
**[1:07:07-1:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:07):**  production it is it's going there like we are i can see that this is there are no other  
**[1:07:13-1:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:13):**  as far as i can see there are no other real better options i mean people talk about why  
**[1:07:18-1:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:18):**  don't you feed the ducks um sort of legumes or um beans or um you know other other sort  
**[1:07:25-1:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:25):**  of high protein grains and you know we've we've looked into it people have tried it  
**[1:07:31-1:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:31):**  there's all sorts of complexities around the anti-nutrients that come with those beans  
**[1:07:35-1:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:35):**  and the the conclusion overall has been soya is the ultimate protein for poultry and that's  
**[1:07:42-1:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:42):**  why we use it for very good reason but this really is going to be the future and it's  
**[1:07:48-1:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:48):**  very early days but that's where the world is moving and if we carry on i want to be  
**[1:07:53-1:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:53):**  on that train as very as soon as possible because we need to now the other part there's  
**[1:07:59-1:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:07:59):**  another piece yeah and then the other piece is um okay so we'll get we'll have to source  
**[1:08:04-1:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:04):**  some carbohydrate locally and uh that's going to be possibly wheat or barley now you know  
**[1:08:12-1:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:12):**  there's going to be some sort of carbon cost to that but we can't really do much about  
**[1:08:16-1:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:16):**  that so that that wheat or barley that comes in is is it's got to be sourced locally and  
**[1:08:23-1:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:23):**  it's just something we can't get around the other side to the businesses as well as using  
**[1:08:29-1:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:29):**  the black soldier fly as the insect production is i want to combine the poultry with short  
**[1:08:34-1:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:34):**  rotation coppers on the farm so i want to reduce my grazing pasture i want to reduce  
**[1:08:41-1:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:41):**  my pasture my strict posture only um i'd still have ruminants on there but in very specific  
**[1:08:48-1:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:48):**  parts of the farm but primarily i want to grow large blocks of short rotation coppers  
**[1:08:55-1:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:08:55):**  that produces biomass that we can then cut chip and then include in the bedding for the  
**[1:09:01-1:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:01):**  ducks which eventually becomes the compost that we produce and the ducks will also be  
**[1:09:08-1:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:08):**  rotated around that coppers and we're talking about a very densely stocked corpus of very  
**[1:09:16-1:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:16):**  fast growing biomass like willow poplar in our case gray older grows incredibly well  
**[1:09:22-1:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:22):**  on our fields so um we would rotate the birds amongst that they obviously do their thing  
**[1:09:29-1:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:29):**  and fertilize the ground underneath there that helps you know so any any there's no  
**[1:09:35-1:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:35):**  waste there you know anything you're feeding the ducks that ultimately gets pooped down  
**[1:09:39-1:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:39):**  beneath the trees the trees use that they grow the trees provide the shade in the shelter  
**[1:09:44-1:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:44):**  for the poultry we have a rotation of cutting that biomass we chip it up and we include  
**[1:09:49-1:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:49):**  it into our bedding and then ultimately the compost that we produce now the compost that  
**[1:09:54-1:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:09:54):**  we produce is going to be we've um we've been experimenting a lot with vermicompost and  
**[1:10:01-1:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:01):**  with farming worms specifically so we come back to insects we come back to insects again  
**[1:10:07-1:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:07):**  and actually the reason why we started experimenting with uh worms was because i thought originally  
**[1:10:12-1:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:12):**  ah i can produce worms to feed to the ducks as their protein but no no no big no no because  
**[1:10:20-1:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:20):**  a there's a very small loop there there's a very small cycle between the duck manure  
**[1:10:25-1:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:25):**  which the worms feed on and then the ducks feeding on the worms that loop is too small  
**[1:10:28-1:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:28):**  and frowned upon generally so that for that reason it's no good but also um the practicalities  
**[1:10:37-1:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:37):**  of producing the quantity of worms in a consistent supply to feed to the ducks logistically it's  
**[1:10:45-1:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:45):**  it's just not doable um so what i realized was no no no the worms are we want to keep  
**[1:10:51-1:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:51):**  the worms as um as little workers on the farm who basically take the the manure and the  
**[1:10:58-1:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:10:58):**  waste from the ducks and turn it into a super compost basically and and there's a lot of  
**[1:11:04-1:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:04):**  established science on the benefits of vermicompost and the differences between aerated compost  
**[1:11:11-1:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:11):**  um or and an actual vermicompost so vermicompost is much more nutrient dense and it's much  
**[1:11:20-1:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:20):**  more it's much richer and it's much stronger um so there are a lot of benefits to vermicompost  
**[1:11:27-1:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:27):**  and there's just a lot of benefits to raising worms like is that like it's niche you've  
**[1:11:33-1:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:33):**  done that before with duck eggs i'm not so scared about that but is there maybe a benefit  
**[1:11:38-1:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:38):**  from like the current input prices that there there's more people are more searching for  
**[1:11:44-1:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:44):**  the non half heavy fossil fuel chemical fertilizer because it went whatever percentage up it  
**[1:11:53-1:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:53):**  went in your local co-op where you have to buy it like i'm imagining a lot of alternative  
**[1:11:59-1:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:11:59):**  quote-unquote alternative input companies are getting a lot of calls this year do you  
**[1:12:02-1:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:02):**  see that as well like okay we have this political situation which is pushing our input price  
**[1:12:07-1:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:07):**  our input prices up but actually we might use it as a as a stepping stone to a system  
**[1:12:12-1:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:12):**  where we're going to produce a lot of inputs for other people that don't have the this  
**[1:12:16-1:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:16):**  huge political and environmental cost to it exactly so um when all of this stuff kicked  
**[1:12:22-1:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:22):**  off i was like well it's negatively impacting the feed price but actually fertilizer prices  
**[1:12:27-1:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:27):**  are skyrocketing you see now every farmer around here they were just spreading their  
**[1:12:33-1:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:33):**  muck like crazy they were using every last scrap of muck they had and all of a sudden  
**[1:12:38-1:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:38):**  the local growers who usually you know get muck for free muck what is muck oh sorry muck  
**[1:12:45-1:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:45):**  being manure animal manure farmyard manure um and you know usually the local growers  
**[1:12:51-1:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:51):**  and stuff are pretty much getting the stuff free as a waste product from farmers um and  
**[1:12:59-1:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:12:59):**  now uh they can't get hold of any because everybody's making use of every last drop  
**[1:13:05-1:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:05):**  of manure that they've got um or crumb um and so uh yes our duck our duckman our duck  
**[1:13:15-1:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:15):**  manure becomes a lot more valuable and the interesting thing about ducks is um their  
**[1:13:21-1:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:21):**  manure is very rich it's like chicken manure everyone knows that chicken manure is the  
**[1:13:26-1:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:26):**  most potent of all animal manures but ducks manure is equally as potent but it actually  
**[1:13:32-1:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:32):**  has much less ammonia in it and ammonia is what burns plants so you have to be careful  
**[1:13:37-1:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:37):**  with chicken manure because you can quite easily burn your plants if you apply it um  
**[1:13:42-1:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:42):**  too much and with duck manure it's much more gentle but it's still potent and ducks produce  
**[1:13:49-1:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:49):**  a lot of waste um i read there was a study that had been done which i read and i how  
**[1:13:58-1:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:13:58):**  true this is i don't know but apparently according to them ducks actually produce more manure  
**[1:14:03-1:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:03):**  per kilo of body weight than any other livestock or any other farmed livestock should i say  
**[1:14:10-1:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:10):**  so um ducks produce a lot of manure um it's good quality manure and because it's an issue  
**[1:14:18-1:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:18):**  if you're living of duck eggs but it's an opportunity if you're selling manure yeah  
**[1:14:22-1:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:22):**  yeah and and on top of that we're using um a lot of bedding in the house okay we use  
**[1:14:28-1:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:28):**  we used to use straw we now use this um this like wood chip sawdust stuff that we get um  
**[1:14:34-1:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:34):**  from a biomass boiler pellet manufacturer and they have a byproduct that comes out of  
**[1:14:41-1:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:41):**  that process which is like a dust that they can't actually use so we actually use that  
**[1:14:46-1:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:46):**  now in our house for bedding but we apply a lot of bedding more bedding than you would  
**[1:14:52-1:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:52):**  normally do with other livestock because ducks are ground nesting birds and you can't get  
**[1:14:58-1:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:14:58):**  them to lay in a raised up nest box so in order to reduce the labor on the washing side  
**[1:15:04-1:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:04):**  because you really do have to wash layer and layer and layer you just throw as much bedding  
**[1:15:09-1:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:09):**  as you can at it because then your eggs come out cleaner so as a result we've got a lot  
**[1:15:13-1:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:13):**  of manure a lot of carbon in bedding and a lot of nitrogen so you're feeding that through  
**[1:15:19-1:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:19):**  the worms and then it's ready to to sell feeding it through the worms and it's been shown that  
**[1:15:26-1:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:26):**  when um so when that material moves through a worm's gut it comes out the other end at  
**[1:15:31-1:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:31):**  a perfect ph it's it's it's neutral spot on and um they also kill a lot of the pathogens  
**[1:15:40-1:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:40):**  and and bad bacteria and at the same time they inoculate those castings what comes out  
**[1:15:46-1:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:46):**  the other end is actually like the fact that's called castings yeah i remember from it's  
**[1:15:50-1:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:50):**  good it's called yeah yeah it's it's the probiotics that come out the beneficial bacteria that  
**[1:15:58-1:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:15:58):**  come out of the worm's gut the other end didn't exist you know before it went in the other  
**[1:16:03-1:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:03):**  side so yeah i've been selling that already or not like i said that's that's one of the  
**[1:16:10-1:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:10):**  pieces to get started yeah i i found some i i've i've i've produced some on the farm  
**[1:16:16-1:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:16):**  and i've i've tested it with some of our stuff that we were growing in the polytunnel and  
**[1:16:21-1:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:21):**  i was just amazed by how good it was i mean i used some stuff that i produced um i grew  
**[1:16:27-1:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:27):**  winter squash in it one year and winter squash is a very hungry crop you know you produce  
**[1:16:33-1:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:33):**  these really big uh fruits and then the next year i took some of that beautiful black gold  
**[1:16:41-1:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:41):**  that we had produced and had already produced the squash and i went and i grew tomatoes  
**[1:16:45-1:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:45):**  in it which is another very hungry crop which is another light and next next to the tomatoes  
**[1:16:52-1:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:52):**  i i had some locally produced uh organic certified compost that is generally well considered  
**[1:16:59-1:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:16:59):**  and i put some tomatoes in that compost and some of the tomatoes in my compost which was  
**[1:17:05-1:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:05):**  a year old already and uh i left it in the polytunnel and ended up being too busy to  
**[1:17:11-1:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:11):**  manage the plants um you know dealing with your stuff and i actually in the beginning  
**[1:17:18-1:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:18):**  i was like oh there's there's no difference they're both growing the same um okay so nothing  
**[1:17:23-1:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:23):**  which already would be an interesting thing yeah which already i was like oh okay yeah  
**[1:17:29-1:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:29):**  i was like at least you know we're matching at least matching this compost and then i  
**[1:17:33-1:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:33):**  just totally left the tomatoes because i was like crazy busy and i came back later on the  
**[1:17:39-1:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:39):**  polytunnel's all like overgrown and crazy and it's just been neglected and there are  
**[1:17:43-1:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:43):**  these tomatoes and the ones that are sitting in our vermicompost still lush and green and  
**[1:17:51-1:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:51):**  the ones that are sitting in the the commercially the local compost that we got were all yellowing  
**[1:17:57-1:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:17:57):**  and dying and clearly i had they were root bound and i took the plants out of the pots  
**[1:18:04-1:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:04):**  and i looked and you know the roots were rack hurling around and they'd been sitting in  
**[1:18:07-1:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:07):**  those pots way too long and they hadn't been watered and and i was just like wow okay so  
**[1:18:14-1:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:14):**  even despite the fact so somehow this vermicompost is really just giving it a lot of steam and  
**[1:18:19-1:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:19):**  helping it get through despite the neglect that it received so it's done i was really  
**[1:18:24-1:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:24):**  convinced when i saw that and i was like wow imagine when we start selling fresh vermicompost  
**[1:18:29-1:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:29):**  that isn't that hasn't been grown in for a year already and so that's the product that  
**[1:18:35-1:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:35):**  we want to produce you know it's a very it's a product that you apply in much smaller volumes  
**[1:18:42-1:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:42):**  and and generally vermicompost is worth roughly 10 times the price if you go and look at prices  
**[1:18:47-1:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:47):**  of compost online you'll see standard compost versus vermicompost pretty consistently the  
**[1:18:54-1:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:54):**  vermicompost is 10 times the value per litre is what they sell it in to regular compost  
**[1:18:59-1:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:18:59):**  so when i look at the economics of a duck or duckonomics you know there's two genetics  
**[1:19:07-1:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:07):**  and the the output yeah it's not the egg there's the genetics yeah but actually table egg yeah  
**[1:19:14-1:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:14):**  yeah there's two primary outputs it's an egg and it's some poop and it's kind of ironic  
**[1:19:20-1:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:20):**  that the situation we're in is that actually you know what that that egg unless it's the  
**[1:19:25-1:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:25):**  genetics and the breed and the fertile egg that egg is a table egg is worth much less  
**[1:19:29-1:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:29):**  than the poop that comes out the other side so and how did the black soldier fly fertilizer  
**[1:19:35-1:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:35):**  come into that like are you going to mix that through as well or that's just a separate  
**[1:19:41-1:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:41):**  piece and let's see do you know what i don't know yet i mean what happens when you mix  
**[1:19:46-1:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:46):**  that with vermicompost i mean you're talking about some serious rocket fuel maybe it's  
**[1:19:52-1:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:52):**  better to sell it as a as a as a as its own product but you know we're i think that if  
**[1:19:58-1:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:19:58):**  we're talking realistically the compost business is much closer in terms of feasibility the  
**[1:20:08-1:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:08):**  black soldier flies are a bit further out because we have to scale up to a thousand  
**[1:20:12-1:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:12):**  ducks to make that work as a minimum you have to manage that facility and get the get all  
**[1:20:18-1:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:18):**  the yeah the issues i mean that's that's going to take a few generations of flex all the  
**[1:20:24-1:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:24):**  place before you get that to an optimum yes you have to hold stuff onto the farm first  
**[1:20:29-1:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:29):**  which is not easy and the mixing of any of that's of course we we have we have capital  
**[1:20:34-1:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:34):**  we have a lot of capex to not i say a lot you know in the greater scheme of things it's  
**[1:20:40-1:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:40):**  not that much money but we need to get a few things set up on the farm in order to scale  
**[1:20:45-1:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:45):**  the ducks up to a thousand and to get one of these shipping containers set up so that's  
**[1:20:49-1:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:49):**  further out in the future what's closer in the future is the short rotation coppice the  
**[1:20:53-1:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:20:53):**  biomass production the compost and the vermicompost thing that can happen you know i'm already  
**[1:21:01-1:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:01):**  producing vermicompost now in preparation for spring next year so that's kind of where  
**[1:21:09-1:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:09):**  we want the farm to go but you know cash cash is king cash flow is super important and doesn't  
**[1:21:16-1:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:16):**  really matter what kind of dream you have for the future if you can't if you can't sort  
**[1:21:20-1:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:20):**  the cash flow out then you can't get there and you know there's a really i love the saying  
**[1:21:29-1:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:29):**  as mike tyson once said everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the face and  
**[1:21:35-1:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:35):**  we've just been punched in the face multiple times many many times over the last seven  
**[1:21:40-1:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:40):**  years and i feel like we're we're starting to learn we're starting to learn how to duck  
**[1:21:46-1:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:46):**  and weave a little bit the punches but um but intended yeah yeah we we we've we've yeah  
**[1:21:53-1:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:21:53):**  so that's the idea behind the the the crowdfunding campaign um and uh if we can if we can get  
**[1:22:00-1:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:00):**  through the winter then hopefully we can we can level park harreg up and and make ourselves  
**[1:22:07-1:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:07):**  more resilient and adapt to this future that we we all face i think it's a a gazillion  
**[1:22:16-1:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:16):**  other questions i i want to ask and there's a whole other chapter i want to go into in  
**[1:22:21-1:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:21):**  terms of your vision for um small but most importantly large scale agriculture and regenerative  
**[1:22:26-1:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:26):**  future but i also want to be conscious of your time and um i would think we'll leave  
**[1:22:32-1:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:32):**  it at that this is the the immersion or the current moment the end of october 2022 is  
**[1:22:38-1:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:38):**  now and and hopefully we'll see you through the winter like you you go through the winter  
**[1:22:42-1:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:42):**  you make it um and then we can sit and and explore first of all we're going to talk a  
**[1:22:49-1:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:49):**  lot about compost at the time for sure i guess you would have learned a lot that you would  
**[1:22:52-1:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:52):**  have sold for sure already and you would be way further down the line with black soldier  
**[1:22:56-1:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:22:56):**  flies or other flies and but also to hear your vision and what you've learned in this  
**[1:23:02-1:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:02):**  and everything needs to be small scale but actually the future might be larger and and  
**[1:23:06-1:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:06):**  what your vision is there that would be i think a part two so i will i want to add that  
**[1:23:11-1:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:11):**  and you probably have some some final words to share thank you yeah i i mean just the  
**[1:23:16-1:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:16):**  last point to say is on the youtube channel you know like um if if there are people out  
**[1:23:20-1:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:20):**  there listening to this yeah um yeah if there are people out there listening to this thinking  
**[1:23:25-1:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:25):**  well i i had plans to do this sort of really small scale hyper diversified um lean agile  
**[1:23:33-1:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:33):**  farm and and that was you know i think if there are people out there that want to do  
**[1:23:39-1:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:39):**  that i really i want to encourage them to to follow us on youtube and watch watch this  
**[1:23:45-1:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:45):**  process unfold because we had all the same ideas and we've read the same books as you  
**[1:23:50-1:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:50):**  and we've watched the same influencers on youtube as you and then you get punched in  
**[1:23:55-1:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:23:55):**  the face we got punched in the face multiple times and you know we've we've done the diversification  
**[1:24:00-1:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:00):**  the stacking the enterprises we've done the the niche products the premium products we've  
**[1:24:05-1:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:05):**  done the no dig we've done the agroforestry stuff we've you know we've it's not like it's  
**[1:24:10-1:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:10):**  not like we haven't tried this stuff and i think that um there's a lot of problems with  
**[1:24:15-1:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:15):**  this idea of small scale agriculture being the future i my my belief is that we need  
**[1:24:21-1:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:21):**  large scale regenerative agriculture and that that is really the future and and what is  
**[1:24:26-1:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:26):**  gonna get us out of this mess that we face um so before you go and spend your money on  
**[1:24:33-1:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:33):**  a little parcel of land and start trying to change the world like we did just take care  
**[1:24:40-1:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:40):**  and and perhaps you know uh watch how things unfold for us because it's it's very tough  
**[1:24:46-1:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:46):**  um and there's i think it's important to say that there are um influencers out there that  
**[1:24:54-1:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:24:54):**  have a very different context um you know it on the surface it it looks like they're  
**[1:25:01-1:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:25:01):**  making it work but there's a lot of other things at play um and and so your your specific  
**[1:25:08-1:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:25:08):**  context is always really important but that's all i'll say and um yeah please do follow  
**[1:25:14-1:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/josh-heyneke#t=1:25:14):**  us on youtube and um no matter what happens you know whether we make it or or not i think

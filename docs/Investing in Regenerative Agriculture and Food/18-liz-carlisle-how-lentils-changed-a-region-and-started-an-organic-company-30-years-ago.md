**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:14):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Liz Carlisle, writer of the Lento Underground.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:19):**  She wrote a book about one of the pioneering organic companies in the US, Timeless Seeds.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:24):**  We're discussing the start of the company, how four farmers 30 years ago started Timeless  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:29):**  Seeds in a time where nobody knew what organic was, let alone what lentils were, plus what  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:34):**  was the key role of impact investors and why it makes so much investment sense to look  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:39):**  at markets for crops which are key to bring a local ecosystem in balance.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:43):**  In this case lentils, which fitted perfectly into a rotation for organic grain.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:48):**  But nobody knew what lentils were and most farmers saw them as weed.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:53):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:55):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:00:59):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:01):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:05):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:10):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:15):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:17):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:21):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small  
**[0:01:26-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:26):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:33):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:37):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:41):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:45):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:49):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:54):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:01:58):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:03):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:10):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:13):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:14):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:19):**  I'm Koon Vossian, your host.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:20):**  In a podcast of today, I'm joined by Liz Carlisle, writer of Lento Underground, where she followed  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:26):**  and told the amazing story of Timeless Seeds, where a group of farmers started one of the  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:30):**  pioneering organic food companies in the US.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:32):**  Welcome Liz.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:33):**  Thank you, happy to be here.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:35):**  So to start with a personal question and also with a question about Lento Underground and  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:40):**  Timeless Seeds, how did you get into the regenerative agriculture space?  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:43):**  How did you find this group of farmers?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:46):**  And in a very brief for the people who didn't read the book, what did they do?  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:50):**  And what was a small summary of the story you told in the book?  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:55):**  Yeah, well, you know, in a nutshell, I am originally from the same part of the US as  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:02:59):**  these farmers.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:00):**  I'm from Montana.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:01):**  But I didn't start out wanting to be in agriculture myself.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:05):**  I was a country singer.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:07):**  So I was sort of telling the stories of farmers in rural America.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:10):**  And as I was traveling around the United States, I started hearing about how difficult it was  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:15):**  to be a farmer, given the way the industry is currently structured, with lots of large  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:21):**  multinational corporations and just commodity markets.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:24):**  And so, of course, farmers getting low prices for grain and paying a lot of money for the  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:28):**  inputs that they needed to use the fertilizers and the herbicides and such.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:33):**  So I was quite concerned about this and also quite concerned about climate change.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:37):**  And then I heard about an organic farmer from my home state, who was doing all of this farming  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:43):**  without chemicals and growing a more diverse rotation of crops.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:47):**  And he managed to get himself elected to the United States Senate.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:50):**  And I thought that was pretty amazing.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:52):**  And so I quit working as a country singer and went to work for him at the Senate.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:03:57):**  And really, through him discovered that he was part of this 30-year effort that I then  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:01):**  ended up chronicling in this book.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:04):**  And what drew you in the beginning to agriculture?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:07):**  I mean, you come from an agricultural state, but also a lot of people probably have left  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:12):**  and went to pursue completely different careers and want to stay as far away from farmland  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:17):**  as possible, but you didn't.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:19):**  That's right.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:20):**  And you know, maybe you could put me in that category too, as an 18-year-old going off  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:23):**  to college.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:24):**  But I did get very concerned about climate change and about environmental issues, as  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:29):**  well as economic issues.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:31):**  And as I'm sure many of your listeners know, in the United States in particular, the gap  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:37):**  between people who have a lot of money and people who are working really hard and still  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:41):**  can't make ends meet is just getting bigger and bigger during my lifetime.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:45):**  And particularly in areas like where I'm from, people work just as hard as they used to,  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:49):**  but they can't put food on the table anymore, ironically, since they're growing it.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:04:54):**  So I realized that agriculture was this fundamental human activity that really we needed to change  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:03):**  in order to solve these environmental questions around climate change, as well as these economic  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:07):**  questions around what were people going to do for a living in a place where I was from.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:13):**  It used to be extractive.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:15):**  It used to be things like mining.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:16):**  Obviously, we need to move beyond that.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:18):**  So I think I realized that agriculture was a lot more complex than I had understood growing  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:24):**  up and that farmers are some of the people really on the front lines of trying to deal  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:29):**  with these major environmental questions.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:31):**  So I started just wanting to learn a little bit about what farmers know.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:36):**  And if you had to name, let's say two things, because one is usually too complicated, two  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:42):**  things that really, really surprised you of your home state of farmers that you maybe  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:46):**  have known before, you've seen before, but then you went when you really dove into the  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:50):**  work to write the book.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:52):**  What were the two things that really stood out and surprised you so much about the farming  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:57):**  life and agriculture?  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:05:58):**  Well, I think the two things would be that farmers were really concerned about what I  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:03):**  would characterize as progressive issues, issues like climate change, issues that are  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:08):**  global and far beyond just their own farm communities and understand that what they  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:14):**  do bears on those global problems.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:17):**  And then also that they're incredibly sophisticated scientists.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:21):**  And so what I went to learn about from them was this system that they had devised to balance  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:27):**  the nutrients that they were providing to their soil such that they would have a healthy  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:32):**  and complete soil that could then support a healthy farm.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:36):**  So they were in these complex 10-year rotations between different kinds of legumes, post crops  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:43):**  and grains and crops from other families.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:46):**  And they understood what was helping to make phosphorus more available and just some really  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:51):**  sophisticated science that they were doing with these systems, just working with each  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:06:56):**  other and using each other's farms basically as an experimental design.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:01):**  And then in terms of the market, because I read the book, I really enjoyed it.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:06):**  I will recommend everybody to read and learn about, I mean, 30 years of regenerative farming.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:14):**  And when it comes to selling, that was a big issue, finding a market that's willing to  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:19):**  pay on your terms for, in this case, your lentils, but also many other products.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:25):**  How did they do that and where did they find, I mean, they're very sophisticated on the  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:30):**  plant, but you need a very different quality to also market and sell it.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:35):**  Is that where the added value of this company came from?  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:40):**  So what you have is just a group of four farmers who've realized that they need to grow legumes.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:45):**  They need to grow, you know, crops in the bean and pea family in order to supply the  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:49):**  nutrients to their soil that will allow them to farm in a healthy way without chemicals  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:54):**  that are bankrupting them and also doing environmental damage.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:07:57):**  So they know they need to grow lentils, chickpeas, dry peas as part of their system.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:02):**  But the problem is they literally have nowhere to sell them.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:06):**  So they're in a commodity agriculture system where there's a grain elevator, a storage  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:11):**  facility that you can take wheat or barley, and that's pretty much it.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:17):**  Those are kind of their only options for crops that they can grow and sell.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:20):**  And they're not used to being in sort of the direct to consumer business or even the retail  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:25):**  or wholesale business.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:26):**  They're commodity farmers.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:28):**  But they're so committed to having healthy farms and they want to stay on their land  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:33):**  that they just decide we're going to try to create a market for these crops that we know  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:37):**  we need to be growing.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:38):**  So they start in just the simplest way possible, pooling their harvest and putting them in  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:44):**  these 25 pound bags and then just driving around the state to the four natural food  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:48):**  stores at the time.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:50):**  And you know, pretty quickly got those stores signed up.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:53):**  But when you think about the scale of production that was necessary to convert agriculture  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:08:58):**  in this region, four natural food stores were not going to cut it.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:01):**  So they were total novices in business.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:05):**  But that was the time in the early 90s that they started going out of state and going  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:11):**  to natural food shows and trying to find early, early, early social investors who would be  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:16):**  interested in such a thing.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:18):**  And kind of bit by bit, we're able to build this business and purchase a processing facility  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:23):**  and get other growers into the mix.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:28):**  And at this point, you know, are now quite successful with it.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:32):**  It's a fascinating story because it basically flips the normal model of starting a company  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:38):**  of looking at your market, etc. and looking what's missing, as they really took the soil  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:42):**  and the ground as the basis.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:45):**  They were growing grain, but wanted to do it with less chemicals or probably without  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:50):**  and also in going organic and figured out as very sophisticated scientists that they  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:09:55):**  were missing certain amount of things in their, their, their terrain and were growing legumes  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:00):**  to fix that.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:02):**  But then almost the focus of the whole organization or the focus of the became selling organic  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:07):**  legumes instead of the grain, which is still sold, but is sold to the commodity market  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:12):**  organically.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:13):**  And they also set up a company or they also set up a specific channels for that.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:19):**  Well, you know, sort of a sister company developed to do that.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:22):**  So Montana flower and grain is just gosh, maybe an hour down the road from timeless  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:27):**  seeds.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:28):**  And they've developed the whole business of a better market for organic grains and including  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:33):**  organic ancient grains and grains that are stone ground into flour.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:39):**  So farmers have, you know, both of those businesses that they can work with as well as a couple  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:44):**  of others that give them an option outside the commodity market where they could get  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:48):**  a higher price for higher quality.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:51):**  But you know, the grain thing was always going to be easier because we have so many staple  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:10:57):**  foods in the United States that we eat that are based on grains.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:00):**  People are eating cereals at breakfast, you know, so that was one of the first organic  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:06):**  markets to take off was organic breakfast cereal.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:09):**  So you know, at this point, the organic grain companies actually have kind of a supply problem.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:15):**  They're looking for more farmers to grow, but we don't eat very many pulse crops.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:19):**  We don't really have a culinary tradition of eating lentils or chickpeas in the US.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:25):**  That's changed a little bit with the hummus revolution of late.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:29):**  And we've seen more people interested in, you know, plant forward eating kind of like  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:34):**  meatless Mondays type of stuff and more interest in ethnic foods.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:38):**  But at the time these farmers started trying to market lentils in the early 90s, many of  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:43):**  their own family members didn't even know what it was they were growing.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:46):**  And I thought it was a weed, right?  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:48):**  Yeah, they thought it was a weed.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:49):**  And then when they said lentil, people said, What is that?  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:53):**  Or Oh, you know, I guess I've had lentil soup once or twice.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:11:57):**  But it was it was an uphill battle in terms of, you know, finding the markets and and  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:04):**  you know, eventually they realized that there were real nutritional benefits as well.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:08):**  And that just as their soil needed lentils, the American diet really needed some more  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:13):**  plant based protein too.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:15):**  And they started working with chefs, if I remember correctly, to really get it on the  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:19):**  menus and to to make sure that people at restaurants, etc, get really high end organic lentils.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:26):**  Yes, yeah.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:27):**  And, you know, one of the first chefs who got on board was actually from a rural area  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:31):**  in Montana.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:33):**  And was a huge leader.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:35):**  I know a lot of people including potentially, I think maybe myself, the first time we ever  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:39):**  ate lentils was at this restaurant and he served it as a side dish rather than in a  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:44):**  soup, just kind of like a braised lentil dish.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:48):**  So yeah, I think chefs have been really important.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:51):**  chefs like Dan Barber, who wrote the book, Third Plate has also been talking a lot about  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:12:55):**  eating from the whole rotation and familiarizing people with what they might do with pulse  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:01):**  crops since it's not necessarily in their cultural tradition, and then also just educating  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:05):**  people a little bit about what the benefits are both to their health and to the planet.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:10):**  And then do you see, and now for the company, I imagine you're still following them a bit.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:15):**  What's the next phase for them?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:17):**  What's the what's next for for such a successful company, but still relatively small?  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:23):**  What would be next, do you think, for this group of farmers?  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:26):**  Yeah, well, you know, they've been growing in the last couple years.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:31):**  Faster than they had been, I think, an interesting lesson that I've learned is that it really  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:35):**  takes a long time to build a solid foundation for a values based business.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:41):**  And then I think then there's the ability to grow a bit faster once that's done.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:46):**  So I think they've doubled the business in the past year or so they, when I wrote the  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:50):**  book, they had about 15 growers.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:52):**  So this was 2012 when I was researching the book, and now they have about 30 who grow  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:57):**  for this business.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:13:58):**  So wow, you know, pretty decent pace of growth just recently.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:03):**  And I think that's partly because of changing diets and the interest in plant forward eating  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:09):**  and the interest in ethnic food.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:12):**  And it's also it takes a while for growers to shift their system, because you have to  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:17):**  remember that farmers deal with incredible risk in their business, and they don't just  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:23):**  jump on a new bandwagon right away.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:25):**  So there were in the early days, some farmers who joined this group for philosophical reasons,  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:31):**  they just weren't willing to farm in a way that they saw as extractive anymore, or they  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:36):**  were bankrupt from trying to do so.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:38):**  So they had no other option.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:40):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:41):**  No other option, other than not farming.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:45):**  And I think in more recent years, what we've seen is that after, you know, a couple of  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:49):**  decades of success, or at least stability, other growers who may not be as philosophically  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:14:56):**  committed, but who would like to grow organic, are getting on board because they see this  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:01):**  as a good business proposition.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:04):**  And they see that the market is stable, rather than Oh, this company starts up, I sell to  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:09):**  them for a couple years, and then they go away.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:11):**  Meanwhile, I've changed my whole growing system to grow this product.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:15):**  It's really scary to grow a crop that only one or two companies buy.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:21):**  And in the early days of organic legumes, that was the case.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:26):**  So if the company goes under, if you're the farmer, you don't have anywhere else to sell  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:30):**  it.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:31):**  So now that this has expanded a bit, it's not as risky for the for the growers to get  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:36):**  involved.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:37):**  And that now is really actually where the expansion, that's that's the bottleneck is  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:42):**  more on the supply end rather than the demand end,  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:46):**  which is a great position to be in as a company, obviously, absolutely.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:50):**  And in the early days, because you've written a number of, of those stories that the pressure  
**[0:15:56-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:15:56):**  on the earliest farmers that joined or basically set it up to to join the conventional commoditized  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:05):**  grain market has been enormous, what made them step away from that, and, and basically  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:12):**  set up something that was so completely unknown to so many people and what made them stick  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:16):**  to it?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:17):**  Well, I think something that's important for anybody in the agriculture space to kind of  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:20):**  recognize looking historically is that there are cycles of crises with the commodity industrial  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:26):**  system.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:27):**  So you know, at some point in time over a given period, it's it's going to be absolutely  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:34):**  disastrous for the farmers involved.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:37):**  And the what happened in the 1980s, one of these crises was that the fertilizer prices  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:42):**  were high because fossil fuel prices were high, the grain prices were low, not mostly  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:47):**  had to do with sort of the international supply.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:50):**  And at the same time, there were three drought years within the span of four years.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:16:55):**  So many, many farmers across the grain belt in the United States had to make a big decision  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:00):**  at that point, many people went out of farming.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:03):**  And those who stayed often had to make some kind of big change.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:07):**  And because input costs were so high, people were thinking about ways to lower those input  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:12):**  costs.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:13):**  And because the grain prices were so low, people were thinking about ways to get out  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:17):**  of the commodity market.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:18):**  So you had all of these farmers interested in some kind of an alternative.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:23):**  And that it's not an accident that that is really when organic started to take off, particularly  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:30):**  in the larger scale grain growing areas.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:33):**  There had been organic produce farming in places like California, Oregon, New England,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:38):**  but that's really when organic farming or low input sustainable agriculture, as it was  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:43):**  often called at the time took off because you did have all these people that really  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:47):**  didn't see themselves being able to continue to earn a living in farming.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:51):**  That's a very different situation from from what we are now that almost the demand is  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:55):**  bigger than the supply.  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:58):**  Right?  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:17:59):**  Well, and that is just that's just policy.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:02):**  That's just artificial money propping up an archaic system.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:06):**  What do you mean by that?  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:07):**  Well, we have farm programs in the United States, federal government programs that support  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:13):**  farmers in some important ways, but also do too much to prop up an old system.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:19):**  So people can literally not earn any profit at all on their farm, but still earn a living  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:25):**  because they're getting these payments to do kind of the old commodity crop input dependent  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:31):**  farming.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:32):**  And this whole system was devised in the Great Depression, you know, almost 100 years ago  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:37):**  to help farmers recover from that time.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:40):**  And it hasn't been adequately updated since.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:43):**  So you know, the reason that we don't see a faster conversion, I think, to regenerative  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:48):**  agriculture is that our policy hasn't really caught up to what we know scientifically to  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:53):**  what growers know to what consumers want.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:18:57):**  So that is probably the biggest barrier right now in the United States.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:00):**  And what would you if you had a magic wand, what would you change?  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:05):**  How would you shape the policy for let's say, the next decade or next 15 to 20 years?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:12):**  I think one of the biggest levers is crop insurance, because that's now the main form  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:17):**  of producer support coming out of the United States Department of Agriculture.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:22):**  And currently, as I said, it's sort of propping up these systems that are not sustainable  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:26):**  input dependent grain monoculture.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:28):**  And I would just shift the way that crop insurance is how it functions, what it pays for.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:34):**  And one idea that's been floated by many people is why don't we give people lower crop insurance  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:39):**  premiums for using regenerative practices that fundamentally reduce their risk?  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:45):**  I mean, it's a good from an insurance point of view, it's a great policy.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:49):**  Why don't we give people lower crop insurance premiums for planting cover crops, for example,  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:54):**  which are crops used just to feed the soil and improve the soil organic matter and they  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:19:59):**  also catch nutrients that would otherwise go into waterways.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:04):**  We should give people lower crop insurance premiums for rotating crops, or for reducing  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:10):**  tillage in innovative ways.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:13):**  So we could use the whole crop insurance system to actually incentivize the things that reduce  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:18):**  risk and improve the system for the public.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:22):**  I think we could just do a much better job of aligning the public incentives with the  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:28):**  public benefit, because agriculture, of course, has a public benefit as well as a private  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:32):**  benefit.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:33):**  Right now, the public programs often just feed into private benefits.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:37):**  What we need to do is better restructure them.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:39):**  So they're literally much better supporting the public benefit piece of agriculture and  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:45):**  the, you know, the foundation that keeps everybody farming and everybody's land healthy and the  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:49):**  water healthy and all these good things.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:52):**  And when you look at the investor point of view or the role of the investor, what has  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:20:58):**  been the role of impact investors or investors in general or social investors in timeless  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:03):**  seeds and what would be the role?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:06):**  But the second question in the future of companies like this, where do you see the biggest added  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:11):**  benefit if you would be an impact investor?  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:15):**  Well, impact investing has been absolutely critical to timeless seeds because they were  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:20):**  so ahead of their time that they had absolutely no access to any kind of conventional financing.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:26):**  David Oyen, who's the CEO and founding farmer, tells this great story about going to his  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:30):**  local bank in the early 90s and saying, you know, we have a customer in California, they  
**[0:21:36-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:36):**  want 300,000 pounds of lentils and we need a loan for $40,000 for an organic lentil company.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:44):**  And the banker had two questions.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:46):**  What's organic and what's a lentil?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:49):**  So like conventional financing was not going to happen for this company.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:54):**  And that's true for a lot of people in the regenerative ag space even now.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:21:59):**  It's gotten better than that now.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:01):**  But timeless has operated with a lot of, you know, unconventional capital with social investing  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:07):**  kinds of capital.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:08):**  At that time, it was before Kickstarter.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:10):**  They just literally went and knocked on the doors of friends and neighbors and like minded  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:16):**  people who were interested in this bigger picture of regenerative agriculture, whether  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:20):**  or not they were farmers or stood to benefit in any real direct way from the development  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:25):**  of this particular business.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:27):**  And I think they sold like $1,000 shares to get into this original mill.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:32):**  Really crowdfunding.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:33):**  Really crowdfunding.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:35):**  And that, you know, then that was the model again, when they moved into their current  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:37):**  plant in 2008 at a little bit larger scale, and they kind of tapped into the slow money  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:43):**  network at that time.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:45):**  But I think you'd find lots of similar stories of other companies that are similarly trying  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:50):**  to support what the natural system needs by creating markets for the things that need  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:56):**  to be part of these systems.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:22:58):**  All those companies have a story like that of creative ways of finding capital from social  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:03):**  investors.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:04):**  And I think, you know, the benefit is that this is a group of people who just look at  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:08):**  the economy differently.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:10):**  It's people who are investing in fundamental value, things like soil health, and climate  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:16):**  mitigation, rather than just speculative value, which unfortunately, I think is kind of the  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:22):**  majority of the conventional economy.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:25):**  You know, it's, it's not real.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:27):**  It's on paper, it's there for maybe a few decades, but we obviously can't pretend that  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:33):**  the world's going to continue to function that way.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:35):**  We're gonna, our planet's gonna burn up.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:37):**  So I think, you know, impact investors are critical in that they just see value in a  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:44):**  completely different way.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:45):**  And when you look at, let's imagine there's a gigantic group of smart impact investors  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:51):**  listening to this podcast, what would be your advice to them?  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:23:55):**  They are interested in this space of food, of agriculture, they haven't probably made  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:00):**  investments yet.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:01):**  And they read the book and they're really interested, like, how can I find the next  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:05):**  timeless seed or what could be my role there?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:08):**  Where can I add value and of course, also make smart investments?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:11):**  What would be your, your place to start in some some advice?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:15):**  I think get to know a place really well and understand what that place needs.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:21):**  Because regenerative agriculture is all about fitting the agricultural system to the place  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:26):**  rather than having this one standard model that's imposed all over the world, you know,  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:32):**  which is kind of the Achilles heel of the green revolution or industrial agriculture.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:36):**  So obviously, you know, if you deeply studied the northern Great Plains, Montana, Idaho,  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:42):**  you would find that investing in legumes is a really important part of the green economy  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:48):**  in that area.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:50):**  You know, another thing that's important in a lot of places is pastured livestock.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:24:56):**  Because we obviously need to shift away from this concentrated animal feeding operation  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:00):**  basis for our protein system.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:03):**  So part of that is about plant based protein.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:05):**  And part of that is about a totally different system for animal protein, that's not doesn't  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:10):**  have such a terrible impact on the environment and on human health.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:15):**  So any place that you get to know is going to have this missing piece of the puzzle for  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:20):**  a regenerative agricultural system.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:22):**  And that's where I think impact investors can help accelerate that transition, which  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:28):**  needs to come by creating those markets and helping farmers be on the vanguard and helping  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:34):**  to accelerate this process where farmers can see their neighbors do it and succeed and  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:38):**  get involved.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:39):**  I think that that's really good advice, because so many investors are looking for generic  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:45):**  models, etc.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:47):**  But all of this, I mean, regenerative agriculture, like you said, is really place based, and  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:52):**  you need to really, really well understand the local circumstances and the context.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:56):**  And I want to end with a question for you.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:25:59):**  What's next for you?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:00):**  You wrote this book in, or you did the research in 2012, it was published, I think a year  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:04):**  later, and you've still are active in regenerative agriculture movement.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:09):**  So anything you can say what you're working on or worked on for in the last bit of what  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:14):**  you're going to work on next?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:16):**  Yeah, well, I'm very interested to continue learning from farmers, I feel like I just  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:25):**  started that process.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:28):**  And of course, farmers are innovating new things in this in this area every day.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:31):**  So I spent quite a bit of time in Montana and other parts of farming country in the  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:36):**  US sort of keeping tabs on what's going on and doing a little bit of writing here and  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:41):**  there, maybe launching another larger project soon.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:45):**  And then the other thing I'm really passionate about is teaching.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:48):**  I teach at Stanford, I work with young people who are first year students in university  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:53):**  and also, you know, master students and PhD students.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:26:56):**  And I have a lot of hope for this next generation.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:00):**  And that is such an exciting piece of the work too.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:03):**  And particularly to connect some of these young people thinking about sustainability  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:08):**  with some of these elders in these agrarian communities who thought really deeply about  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:12):**  sustainability in their own place.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:15):**  So to kind of be that bridge builder and come up with project based classes and things like  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:19):**  that, that's just been fantastic.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:22):**  Is that something that you see as a challenge as well as an opportunity that this big transition  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:27):**  in generations that we're seeing now, I imagine it also in the US, at least here in Europe,  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:33):**  a lot of farmers are getting close to their retirement age and a lot of young people want  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:38):**  to get into farming.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:39):**  But the transition both in language, culture, I mean, it's so different that it's going  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:45):**  to be probably a rocky transition if we don't manage it well.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:48):**  Do you see that as well in the US?  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:50):**  Yes, I mean, land access is really the problem.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:53):**  The young people here who want to be farmers typically are not people who come from farming  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:57):**  families.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:27:58):**  And it's difficult to access land if that does says something though or not.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:02):**  It does.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:03):**  It does.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:04):**  I think what it says is that the people who want to farm aren't necessarily looking to  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:07):**  do it the same way that the generation before the one before that did.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:11):**  They're inspired for these bigger, they want to fix climate change, and they want to grow  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:17):**  healthy food for people.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:18):**  And they're interested in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:21):**  And so they need access to land.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:23):**  And actually, what's been interesting is to see that some people you wouldn't think have  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:27):**  a lot in common, you know, say a young urban progressive and a retiring farmer from a conservative  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:33):**  rural community many states away, sometimes that actually works out because they share  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:39):**  something, they share some value around the importance of taking care of land.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:45):**  But we need to develop a lot more tools to make it possible for that transition to really  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:49):**  work and for both sides to feel satisfied with it.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:52):**  Do you have an idea about some of those tools?  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:28:54):**  Because I have heard a few times in these podcasts that the same, the same wish and  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:00):**  the same struggle that people have are there any tools you've seen or you come across that  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:06):**  are working to or slowly piloting maybe a solution to that?  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:10):**  Well, we have a good one here.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:12):**  There's a nonprofit organization called Farmlink that I think is doing a pretty good job.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:17):**  And there are a couple of people trying to help with financing for these young farmers  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:23):**  who are starting with no capital basically.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:26):**  But I think this is another area where those efforts are going to need some support from  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:30):**  policy.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:31):**  And young farmers are just going to need better terms to start on.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:37):**  And there's a little bit out there.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:38):**  There's a beginning farmer and rancher program that's been very helpful from the United States  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:41):**  Department of Agriculture.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:43):**  But in general, these farmers started a disadvantage with all of these support programs that I  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:50):**  talked about earlier.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:51):**  So there will need to be some shifts in policy as well as all this activity, you know, in  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:29:56):**  our world from investors and from nonprofit organizations trying to figure it out.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:30:02):**  Yeah, no, definitely.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:30:04):**  I mean, it needs to come from from all sides.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:30:07):**  I want to thank you so much for your time and I'll definitely be checking in with the

**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:31:33):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:31:37):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011

**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:32:43):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:03):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:10):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:11):**  We're going to look into why investing regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:17):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:22):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:27):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:28):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:33):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:37):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:42):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:43):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:45):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:47):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/10/liz-carlisle/#t=0:33:51):**  It's also not investment advice.
